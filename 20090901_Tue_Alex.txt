[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:06.148]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:07.929]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.671]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:12.192]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:16.996]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:21.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:42.014]  Well, we have a busy show today and a lot going on.
[00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:46.477]  A lot of important news and information to cover.
[00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:55.643]  I have Mark Cuban's HDTV here to videotape the show today and interview me after the show on a program on Malicious.
[00:00:55.643 --> 00:01:00.627]  I wonder how bad the hit piece will be.
[00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.168]  Though Mark Cuban generally isn't that bad of a guy.
[00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:06.611]  He doesn't control all the shows he puts on his TV system.
[00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:13.973]  We have our once a month visit from Hawaii with Mike Rivera of What Really Happened.
[00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:19.854]  He'll be joining us coming up in the second hour today on a host of issues.
[00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:27.515]  I have just a ton of important news coming up as well we're going to be covering, in fact, in this hour.
[00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:31.956]  And I promised to do this so I'm going to do it at the start of the one o'clock hour.
[00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:34.136]  It's a 13 minute video.
[00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.309]  This is not on the web.
[00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:41.730]  This has never before been seen.
[00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.913]  This was put out by the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia.
[00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:52.595]  We're going to analyze this piece by piece and go through it.
[00:01:54.124 --> 00:02:00.930]  This is a terrorist screening center training video, and it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:13.981]  And it's designed to put into the minds of TSA screeners, police, sheriffs, deputies, FBI, trainees, cadets, that everybody is a terrorist, everybody is al-Qaeda.
[00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:17.805]  So, that is coming up today.
[00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:27.048]  In fact, let me just mention to my crew now, go ahead and get Watson on the phone, ask him to IMU just five or six, not the hundreds.
[00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:40.311]  The latest on Hal Turner being FBI, the articles out of Florida with the leaders of the white supremacist groups being FBI, the founders of it, Elohim City running McVeigh and white supremacists on 9-11.
[00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:40.571]  I want the
[00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:44.814]  APs on that.
[00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:50.399]  I meant to pull this last night because they're coming in in a few hours and I want to have the facts in front of me.
[00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.641]  They're all in my mind, but you can sit there and tell the TV network this.
[00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:57.885]  They'll just won't say it exists, but I want to actually go over that.
[00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:02.009]  So just ask Watson to just not throw the kitchen sink, but just send maybe 10, 15 articles.
[00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:17.979]  about every major Klan group, every major Black Supremacist group, every major White Supremacist group, every major Arab group, always founded, run, commanded by the FBI, MI6, or Mossad.
[00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.361]  Because I want to go over some of that while we play this Category 3 video.
[00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:29.766]  And then we're going to pull some articles about the naked body scanners that they're putting in everywhere, and just the whole grid.
[00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.387]  I'm going to really try to do a good job
[00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:45.039]  We're coming up in the third and fourth hour today on this and we'll play this FBI video and tie it into MIAC and the Homeland Security reports demonizing gun owners, veterans that we of course broke.
[00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.541]  We'll be breaking something as big as MIAC today.
[00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:59.625]  As big as the DHS report today here on this transmission and you'll be able to see the video at PrisonPlanet.tv or on the web when it gets ripped to the four winds.
[00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:01.706]  And again we're going to break this down and analyze it.
[00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:11.274]  In its entirety, today, here on the radio show.
[00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:13.474]  And I appreciate the folks that sent this to me.
[00:04:13.474 --> 00:04:17.136]  I've got all these slat reports from the federal marshals.
[00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:22.577]  I mean, for years we broke the news that anybody who wants to audit the Fed is a terrorist.
[00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:24.718]  Anybody who likes Ron Paul is a terrorist.
[00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:26.259]  The Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.419]  That's in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.460]  We've got a bunch of big boil-down articles that cover it.
[00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.771]  And it never got traction, but we broke all this earlier this year.
[00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:44.354]  One state police officer sent it to us, and then we got some other documents from Federal Marshal.
[00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:45.314]  And so now we know.
[00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:48.035]  Of course, we always knew.
[00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:58.020]  I mean, the whole Homeland Security system is to extract your wealth and your wages and your labor from you at the point of a gun.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.400]  Period.
[00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.614]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:08.939]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.984]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:16.905]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:18.286]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.167]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:21.248]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:23.450]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.791]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.312]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:31.596]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:35.179]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:38.642]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.982 --> 00:05:40.203]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.203 --> 00:05:41.104]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.104 --> 00:05:42.224]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.224 --> 00:05:43.145]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.145 --> 00:05:44.246]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:47.288]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.288 --> 00:05:49.489]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:50.610]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.313]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:09.547]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:16.596]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:25.108]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:32.578]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.578 --> 00:06:35.740]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.523]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:41.523 --> 00:06:44.604]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:51.067]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the
[00:06:54.401 --> 00:07:06.806]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:09.647]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:14.289]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.790]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door or safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.671]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.311]  We're good to go.
[00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:40.522]  I think so.
[00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:08.279]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:21.181]  Okay, I've got some news on the economy, some news on the hurricane coming into the Baja Peninsula, very rare, extremely strong.
[00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:21.721]  L.A.
[00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:30.103]  in danger of basically burning down, and I have a lot of friends that live out there, and they say it is just absolutely hellish.
[00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:42.618]  I talked to Coast to Coast AM producer last night and I just wanted to see how the fires were going so I called Tom Dannheiser up and he said the fires are like a mile from his house.
[00:08:42.618 --> 00:08:58.201]  I know that the fires were raining ash down on me from where I was staying last Thursday and Friday in Los Angeles in Beverly Hills visiting with a friend on an upcoming project.
[00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:03.389]  And the fires were about three miles away, and the sky was black.
[00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:06.391]  The sun was bright red at high noon.
[00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.571]  It was like something out of Dante's Inferno.
[00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:13.653]  And now, the fire has more than doubled since I was there.
[00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:17.294]  I mean, you would start, if you spent a lot of time outside, you'd start coughing.
[00:09:17.294 --> 00:09:18.415]  My lungs hurt.
[00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.911]  In the last three, four days since I got back.
[00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:27.092]  So just absolutely amazing what's happening out there.
[00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:35.114]  A bunch of big new developments that we've got linked up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:09:35.114 --> 00:09:37.174]  They're also up on Drudge.
[00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:48.337]  There is one here out of the Star Tribune where they just calmly report that the
[00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:58.961]  Police are preparing to quarantine people and lock them down in their homes and park police cars at the end of your street.
[00:09:58.961 --> 00:10:04.364]  And I have another story here where it sings, hands-off plans, schools ban touching to fight H1N1.
[00:10:04.364 --> 00:10:10.429]  You know, first you can't play dodgeball, then tag, then no running, now no jogging, no arguing.
[00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:11.850]  I mean, they're mind-control prisoners.
[00:10:13.084 --> 00:10:14.344]  And now no touching.
[00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:21.007]  So the new medical dictatorship is one of the main courses the globalists are going to use to set up this tyranny.
[00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:30.069]  The fake environmental tyranny, hijacking the environmental movement, the fake biological weapon threat tyranny, and the fake terrorist tyranny.
[00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:32.290]  And then of course you're going to have debtor prisons again.
[00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.171]  Anybody with bad credits is not going to have any rights.
[00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:37.932]  You're going to have to have a national ID card to have jobs, board planes, own a gun.
[00:10:38.812 --> 00:10:43.357]  Unelected federal boards will secretly ban your Second Amendment or your right to jobs or travel.
[00:10:43.357 --> 00:10:44.478]  It's all being announced.
[00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:49.623]  Total federalization of all internet and computer systems and all private IT systems.
[00:10:49.623 --> 00:10:52.186]  I mean, it's just unspeakable.
[00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:53.528]  Federal inspections of
[00:10:56.727 --> 00:11:02.071]  Basically any type of market right down to your garage sales and flea markets.
[00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:03.712]  Just total tyranny!
[00:11:03.712 --> 00:11:09.236]  Shutting down farms and ranches, animal ID, premise society, SWAT teaming every week.
[00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:12.598]  Amish and small farms and small family farms.
[00:11:12.598 --> 00:11:18.442]  Shutting down people selling eggs, jelly, cheese, milk, watermelons, squash.
[00:11:18.442 --> 00:11:20.224]  Just hellish control.
[00:11:20.224 --> 00:11:23.146]  CPSing Amish and Mennonite children en masse.
[00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:27.009]  Hell is released and it's only beginning.
[00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:34.375]  You ever opened up your pantry and weevils or something have gotten in and there's bugs climbing all over your food?
[00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:39.540]  You know, that just happened at my house because we don't like to use really bad pesticides because we have children.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.323]  We don't want them to get cancer when they're 15 or have their livers rot.
[00:11:43.323 --> 00:11:46.786]  They get enough pesticide in the food they eat, you know, from the vegetables.
[00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:47.567]  It's in everything.
[00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:48.567]  It's in the air.
[00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:50.809]  We don't want brain damaged children like everybody else has.
[00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:57.566]  You know, we got fruit flies swarming around, we got a kill by hand with a fly swatter and occasionally weevils and things.
[00:11:57.566 --> 00:12:02.488]  But even though our house is super clean, the point is that that's what we got with the government.
[00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:07.310]  We got an infestation of maggots, though, eating our flesh.
[00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.552]  Screwworms, the type that eat living flesh.
[00:12:12.552 --> 00:12:15.673]  And we better wake up to it, ladies and gentlemen, because we're in trouble.
[00:12:18.058 --> 00:12:22.560]  Government's like a 200-pound tick on a 100-pound dog, and it isn't going to stop.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.661]  And now the dog's kind of struggling as it's figuring out it's going to die.
[00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:31.483]  The parasite's just grabbing it that much harder with its stinking breath and sucking what's left of the blood out.
[00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:32.264]  It doesn't care.
[00:12:32.264 --> 00:12:35.605]  It's going to crawl off, try to find something else, go to a new country.
[00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:42.328]  And the new world order knows people run from it to other nations, so the tick, world government is now the tick attaching itself to every nation.
[00:12:43.752 --> 00:12:52.557]  And the tick has turned its parasitic activity into a religion called eugenics to rationalize all of its activities.
[00:12:52.557 --> 00:12:54.178]  Now, I called Paul Watson up.
[00:12:54.178 --> 00:12:58.441]  He's got his family in town in Sheffield.
[00:12:58.441 --> 00:13:01.362]  He's over in England.
[00:13:01.362 --> 00:13:09.947]  And Paul's doing a big story about anarchist provocateurs trying to shut down the tea parties and trying to shut down the in the Fed rallies.
[00:13:09.947 --> 00:13:11.308]  Foundation bought and paid for it.
[00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:23.377]  And he's also getting me together a folder, just because this HDTV interview, HDNet interview, snuck up on me.
[00:13:23.377 --> 00:13:29.622]  And so he's going to get me a folder together and email it over, because they're getting here in about an hour and a half.
[00:13:29.622 --> 00:13:31.924]  You know, just a few dozen or so.
[00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:39.330]  There's hundreds and hundreds of German news reporting that all the major white supremacist groups were founded and run firebombing
[00:13:41.229 --> 00:14:10.272]  innocent uh... turkish immigrants begin to have crackdowns on free speech in germany and take everybody's rights british white supremacist and i are a on record all founded run by my six in my five hamas founded by israel her it's jerusalem post reporting send me that ball uh... elohim city founded run by the southern party law center running mcveigh fbi documents just came out last year major white supremacist groups all over florida
[00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:16.141]  Up into Maryland, Texas, run by the feds, Miami Herald.
[00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:17.883]  What's the other big article on that one?
[00:14:17.883 --> 00:14:19.045]  I'm just pulling these up from memory.
[00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:20.947]  There's just hundreds and hundreds.
[00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:23.450]  One was Orlando Sentinel.
[00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.231]  I like that one.
[00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:25.773]  The commander, the founder, FBI.
[00:14:27.944 --> 00:14:30.145]  It's not just FBI infiltrating, they run them.
[00:14:30.145 --> 00:14:38.029]  All these black groups from Miami to Toronto, supposedly going to blow stuff up, turns out they're feds, Fed Run.
[00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:39.650]  Viper Militia, Fed Run.
[00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.832]  Fed founded Fed Run.
[00:14:43.832 --> 00:14:46.873]  Hal Turner, Fed Run, we told you that.
[00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:52.096]  Some good hackers hacked in and exposed that years ago, now it's been confirmed in court.
[00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:54.817]  FBI admits it, but says, you know, he hasn't been one for a year.
[00:14:54.817 --> 00:14:56.338]  Yeah, since we blew his cover.
[00:14:58.084 --> 00:15:12.631]  So all of that going on, and by the way, every time I get hit by the COINTELPRO feds, when I say the anarchists are feds, that doesn't mean if you're an anarchist you're a fed and you have anarchist beliefs.
[00:15:12.631 --> 00:15:19.095]  Extreme, and I do call them extreme because it isn't workable, it isn't livable.
[00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:27.419]  You have liberty on one end of the spectrum and you have government formed by the people of a republic, constitutional republic, where the minority is protected above the majority.
[00:15:29.176 --> 00:15:33.420]  51% can't gang-rape the rights of the 49%.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.204]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:40.407]  As Benjamin Franklin said, that's democracy.
[00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:42.790]  But I agree with about 95% of real
[00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:48.299]  Anarchist methodology and ideas.
[00:15:48.299 --> 00:16:01.666]  But, I have the video, the raw footage, I have the newscast, I have mainstream news, but saying it's a good thing that in 1999, we reported this six months before it happened.
[00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:10.210]  In Oregon, they were training at Ford Foundation, and Annenberg Foundation, and Soros-funded compounds.
[00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.772]  Armies of anarchists to be flown all over the world.
[00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:17.824]  To demonize anti-globalization demonstrators.
[00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:32.820]  You got 60,000 clean-cut, good-looking, black, white, old, young, Asian, Muslim, Christian, Catholic, agnostic, didn't matter, out there with their baby carriages and their families saying no to the WTO, being unelected.
[00:16:34.031 --> 00:16:35.312]  And criminal.
[00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:38.814]  And doing whatever it wanted to, and having more authority than our Congress over trade.
[00:16:38.814 --> 00:16:48.420]  And they had 50 thugs they brought in, and later the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Seattle Times, and Seattle Weekly, and it's all in my film, Police State, do the takeover!
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:56.885]  I'm gonna cover this in the third and fourth hour.
[00:16:56.885 --> 00:17:01.067]  They came in.
[00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:01.808]  And they came in.
[00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:14.314]  And they attacked the police, and the police were ordered to stand down, and the National News pointed their cameras at them, and said, look, the police won't do anything about the protesters.
[00:17:14.314 --> 00:17:25.719]  And then they were pulled back, put in a government building, protected by police, and the peaceful people the next day had their collarbones broken, old women stomped, the cops had a riot, went into neighborhoods, all run by Delta Force.
[00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:27.179]  That's mainstream news.
[00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.720]  So that's who I'm talking about.
[00:17:29.577 --> 00:17:30.917]  And you're feds and you know it.
[00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:35.879]  Let's bring Paul Watson up for three minutes, giving you a bird's-eye view of a report going up in the next 30.
[00:17:35.879 --> 00:17:39.100]  Paul Watson, tell us about it briefly.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:58.805]  This is a report that's arisen out of a Missouri House of Representatives meeting which took place yesterday regarding the MIAC report, which was a report put out by the Missouri Information Analysis Center, which
[00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:04.275]  Yeah, we've got a witness coming on the last 30 minutes today who was there also.
[00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:07.556]  Chuck Baldwin's running mate was there.
[00:18:07.556 --> 00:18:10.898]  We're going to get him on in the next few days.
[00:18:10.898 --> 00:18:11.219]  Go ahead.
[00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:37.936]  And there was another witness there who was one of the organizers of one of the protest groups at the end of the Fed rallies which took place in November last year.
[00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:53.583]  And of course, as it came to light in March, were monitored very closely by the United States Army Reserve Command, who put out a document before warning that the protest was about to take place and implying that those
[00:18:54.355 --> 00:18:58.017]  protesting against the Fed were essentially domestic terrorists.
[00:18:58.017 --> 00:19:02.640]  Yeah, it said, don't let them know you're with Army Intelligence or they may kill you.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.601]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.982]  So they could be violent.
[00:19:05.982 --> 00:19:17.750]  And so this was testimony given by an organizer of a protest group yesterday called C. J. Reagan, who told
[00:19:18.362 --> 00:19:30.471]  The representatives at one of the protests, the Fed protest, there was an anarchist group who started canvassing and talking to all the protesters that were there.
[00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:46.496]  And I guarantee you if you follow those people home, they're either federal or state informants or police.
[00:19:46.496 --> 00:19:48.417]  And of course, we caught them in Denver.
[00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:49.918]  Make sure that's in your article.
[00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:53.119]  Denver Post admits the police attacked their own police.
[00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:56.921]  Absolute vicious criminals trying to end the First Amendment.
[00:19:56.921 --> 00:19:58.222]  These are Nazis!
[00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:03.705]  Wow!
[00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.926]  All I can say is wow!
[00:20:05.926 --> 00:20:08.207]  Times are changing fast!

[00:20:11.928 --> 00:20:14.549]  It'll be against the law to grow a tomato plant!
[00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:16.470]  How does this fit into health care?

[00:22:02.768 --> 00:22:03.449]  It's here.
[00:22:03.449 --> 00:22:08.595]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:22:08.595 --> 00:22:16.163]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:16.943 --> 00:22:24.368]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:24.368 --> 00:22:36.116]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:40.079]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:42.340]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.183]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:04.179]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:07.421]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:15.244]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[00:23:15.384 --> 00:23:16.024]  We're good to go.
[00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:36.975]  I think.
[00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:19.099]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade.
[00:24:19.099 --> 00:24:27.043]  And though the news was rather sad, well, I just had to laugh.
[00:24:34.784 --> 00:24:42.229]  Okay, Watson, I want you to be able to get back to this big report you're about to put out about provocateurs in the state testimony.
[00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:49.614]  They did make some of the state officials step down that put out the report saying pull people over if they have a Ron Paul sticker or Bob Barr sticker.
[00:24:49.614 --> 00:24:51.195]  This is the commissariat.
[00:24:51.195 --> 00:24:52.476]  This is the end of America.
[00:24:52.476 --> 00:24:55.137]  This is the Soviet East German police.
[00:24:55.137 --> 00:24:55.538]  This is
[00:24:57.182 --> 00:25:02.144]  The new no-fly list, no-gun-buy list, number one terror threat, veterans gun owners.
[00:25:02.144 --> 00:25:05.785]  You are the enemy of the criminal offshore banks.
[00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:14.628]  They want your Second Amendment, they want your private property, they want your kids, they want to have a one-child policy, and they're going to do it at gunpoint.
[00:25:14.628 --> 00:25:16.009]  Period!
[00:25:16.009 --> 00:25:21.991]  Until we take the government back and stop all these half-measures of left, right, and then playing us off against each other.
[00:25:21.991 --> 00:25:25.152]  We have a rotten, stinking government.
[00:25:25.152 --> 00:25:25.692]  Period!
[00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:27.750]  Period!
[00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.555]  We have some hope of taking the states back and the counties and cities.
[00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:32.356]  You want a solution?
[00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:33.217]  There it is.
[00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:38.043]  The Tenth Amendment movement, which the media and the government poses as some type of secession.
[00:25:38.043 --> 00:25:41.407]  That's why they bring in the anarchists and the thugs and the white supremacists.
[00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:42.067]  All feds!
[00:25:43.134 --> 00:25:49.078]  Folks, I'm telling you, next time anarchists come over, I've seen them leave with police, we've caught them being police.
[00:25:49.078 --> 00:25:52.360]  Here in Austin, I've had them death threaten me and admit they're with police.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.921]  I've seen them with the cops.
[00:25:53.921 --> 00:25:59.324]  I've come over and gotten the cops' faces and had cops run across the street in uniform and say, back off our officers.
[00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:04.007]  As soon as you put a hand on one of them and say, listen, the cops just run across in uniform.
[00:26:04.007 --> 00:26:06.428]  They're here to gut the country.
[00:26:06.428 --> 00:26:10.271]  They got a mafia job to carry out and they're doing a good job of it.
[00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.891]  Now does that mean every cop is part of this?
[00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:16.292]  No, but those special units are terrorists.
[00:26:16.292 --> 00:26:17.913]  They've been caught at Watson.
[00:26:17.913 --> 00:26:19.153]  You've got them in England.
[00:26:19.153 --> 00:26:21.374]  They were caught at the G20 earlier this year.
[00:26:21.374 --> 00:26:23.135]  It's just everywhere.
[00:26:23.135 --> 00:26:25.336]  And you've got to follow them.
[00:26:25.336 --> 00:26:27.117]  In fact, folks, go to protest.
[00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:29.098]  We need private investigators to volunteer.
[00:26:29.098 --> 00:26:30.078]  We don't have the money.
[00:26:30.078 --> 00:26:31.139]  We don't have the coordination.
[00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:32.519]  Just do it for the Republic.
[00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:34.080]  We need private eyes to start going.
[00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:39.031]  to these protests, watching people following the anarchist.
[00:26:39.031 --> 00:26:41.112]  You'll see them go to the police department.
[00:26:41.112 --> 00:26:42.552]  You'll see them meet their handlers.
[00:26:42.552 --> 00:26:44.033]  A lot of times they're cops.
[00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:45.913]  Just photograph them and burn them!
[00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:47.734]  Burn them hard for America!
[00:26:47.734 --> 00:26:48.594]  Bring them down!
[00:26:48.594 --> 00:26:50.274]  I'm sick of you scumbags!
[00:26:50.274 --> 00:26:51.555]  Oh, I'm gonna get you criminals!
[00:26:51.555 --> 00:26:57.376]  You listen to me, you sons of bitches who think you're gonna destroy the First Amendment and have your way with this country!
[00:26:57.376 --> 00:26:58.937]  I'm telling you, it's time to beat them!
[00:26:59.417 --> 00:26:59.897]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:59.897 --> 00:27:01.098]  I'm sorry.
[00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:05.502]  I just start getting really excited because we can beat them if we just take action against them.
[00:27:05.502 --> 00:27:06.462]  You know what I'm doing?
[00:27:06.462 --> 00:27:09.245]  And I want those Denver cops in prison!
[00:27:09.245 --> 00:27:20.053]  And I want those police up in Canada, up there in Ottawa, who got caught attacking the other cops and staged events so they could attack the peaceful demonstrators.
[00:27:20.053 --> 00:27:23.596]  I want those royal mounted criminals in prison!
[00:27:25.438 --> 00:27:31.160]  See, that's the normal response to the police staging attacks so they can hurt us and our families!
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.621]  Watson, I know you gotta go, you got a lot of work to do.
[00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:41.864]  Just again, tell folks about the article, finish up about the little scumbag feds.
[00:27:41.864 --> 00:27:54.789]  Yeah, this was at the end of the Fed Rally last November, and it was a protest organizer testimony that said, quote, my group was at the end of the Fed Rally and there were a bunch of different groups there.
[00:27:55.310 --> 00:28:02.372]  And there was this group of anarchists who started talking to us, and then they tried to recruit us, or have us join their group.
[00:28:02.372 --> 00:28:08.595]  Then they started telling us what we should write on our signs, and insisting on letting them rewrite our signs.
[00:28:08.595 --> 00:28:12.916]  Later we overheard them saying they couldn't even get us to jaywalk.
[00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:18.318]  And, uh, the fact that they were trying to get them to commit petty crimes was in direct
[00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:24.131]  Contrast to the guidelines which were published by the End of Fed organizers.
[00:28:24.131 --> 00:28:25.852]  And it's totally illegal!
[00:28:25.852 --> 00:28:32.735]  It's totally illegal to have the police out there dressed up and with their provocateurs saying, come on, let's commit crime.
[00:28:32.735 --> 00:28:39.438]  I mean, that's more than entrapment and I want them to go to prison, you evil anti-American scum!
[00:28:39.438 --> 00:28:41.359]  There's no one worse than these people.
[00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:43.540]  How did it end, Watson?
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.301]  Well, that's just the quote.
[00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:46.782]  So they were out there trying to get
[00:28:52.084 --> 00:29:01.090]  And remember Senator Menace's thing in Oregon?
[00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.373]  You ought to pull that bill up where they said if you block traffic, life in prison and a forced labor camp.
[00:29:05.373 --> 00:29:08.775]  Remember that Senate bill in Oregon, Watson?
[00:29:08.775 --> 00:29:09.395]  Yeah.
[00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:11.497]  You ought to add that little giblet in there for folks.
[00:29:12.346 --> 00:29:25.470]  And don't forget the STP protesting in 2007 where the Quebec police were caught posing as rock-wielding anarchists trying to stir chaos and they had to admit that that was the case.
[00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.931]  They were hitting cops with it, hitting other police.
[00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:29.311]  Total criminals.
[00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:32.932]  They just would love to line people up in pits and shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:29:32.932 --> 00:29:33.732]  I'm serious.
[00:29:33.732 --> 00:29:36.693]  These people will go totally Soviet on you the minute they can.
[00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:38.914]  Watson, when's that report coming out?
[00:29:38.914 --> 00:29:39.654]  In 20 minutes.
[00:29:40.602 --> 00:29:41.003]  20 minutes.
[00:29:41.003 --> 00:29:42.644]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:42.644 --> 00:29:43.965]  Start the countdown.
[00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:46.867]  Megaviral transmission of the resistance.
[00:29:46.867 --> 00:29:50.830]  We will crush the New World Order with the truth!
[00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.232]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.232 --> 00:29:54.754]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.754 --> 00:29:57.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.128 --> 00:30:04.372]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:06.374]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.374 --> 00:30:14.903]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:14.903 --> 00:30:20.448]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.448 --> 00:30:22.070]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:28.812]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:28.812 --> 00:30:39.856]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:39.856 --> 00:30:40.636]  That's right.
[00:30:40.636 --> 00:30:43.197]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:30:43.197 --> 00:30:44.797]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:30:46.718 --> 00:30:47.379]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:06.768]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.768 --> 00:31:14.336]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.336 --> 00:31:20.502]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:22.884]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.884 --> 00:31:25.386]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:36.977]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:38.658]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.658 --> 00:31:40.520]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:46.726]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.398 --> 00:31:55.663]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:57.244]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.244 --> 00:31:58.445]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.578 --> 00:32:07.723]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:32:07.723 --> 00:32:23.934]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:32:23.934 --> 00:32:29.078]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:32:29.278 --> 00:32:35.799]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:39.700]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.381]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:48.062]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:32:48.062 --> 00:32:50.742]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:50.742 --> 00:32:52.963]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:32:52.963 --> 00:32:55.463]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:32:55.463 --> 00:32:59.084]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose
[00:32:59.604 --> 00:33:19.419]  What's happened psychologically is we've become broken back.
[00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:20.360]  We've capitulated.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:27.385]  This is where government does whatever it wants, engages in whatever crimes it wants, violates the Bill of Rights, Constitution out in the open.
[00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:28.025]  The police!
[00:33:29.051 --> 00:33:34.573]  I've caught them in Austin, Texas at the Fortune 500 in, what, 99.
[00:33:34.573 --> 00:33:37.335]  I have caught them in Denver.
[00:33:37.335 --> 00:33:43.097]  We have caught them in England and in Italy and in Canada and in Russia.
[00:33:43.097 --> 00:33:45.678]  I mean, all these governments do it.
[00:33:45.678 --> 00:33:56.983]  I've never found a Klan group or a white supremacist group or a black supremacist group or a Mexican supremacist group that isn't Ford Foundation funded one way or the other.
[00:33:57.987 --> 00:34:01.310]  I mean it's ridiculous!
[00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.613]  And LA Weekly's got, it's a big newspaper.
[00:34:04.613 --> 00:34:06.695]  It's the one everybody reads in LA.
[00:34:06.695 --> 00:34:13.942]  It's just on every street corner is the little newspaper machines.
[00:34:13.942 --> 00:34:16.004]  It's the one with all the hooker ads in it and stuff.
[00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:27.481]  And it's attacking me saying, Jones says he doesn't like Obama because of his policies, but when you hear someone say it's not about race or party, you bet it is!
[00:34:27.481 --> 00:34:34.930]  I mean, they are just obsessed with injecting race and making everything racial, and I'm so sick of you!
[00:34:35.831 --> 00:34:39.436]  And everybody's starting to see through all your race pimping.
[00:34:39.436 --> 00:34:42.680]  Every day, big publications attack me now.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.224]  Every day, big foundations attack us.
[00:34:45.224 --> 00:34:48.047]  Because we see exactly what you are.
[00:34:48.047 --> 00:34:50.370]  Dirt bag criminals.
[00:34:52.534 --> 00:34:54.636]  And let me tell you, I started howling at the moon mad.
[00:34:54.636 --> 00:35:02.042]  You're supposed to get angry at cops every time you turn around, throwing beer bottles and rocks at other cops.
[00:35:02.042 --> 00:35:03.723]  In some cases, the cops don't even know.
[00:35:03.723 --> 00:35:09.428]  They'll go over and before a commander stops them, they'll find out it was staged and then the cops complain to the media.
[00:35:09.428 --> 00:35:11.650]  That's how we found out in Denver.
[00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.212]  In other cases, the cops are part of it.
[00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:20.457]  But in Seattle, it was police that came out and said, yeah, these people were working for the government and they allowed them to attack us and I'm angry about it.
[00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:33.787]  Again, the foundations openly are the private political arms of the big private banks that are setting up the world dictatorship, the Bank of the World.
[00:35:33.787 --> 00:35:38.872]  And so they are the ones that openly fund the anarchists, who are not anarchists.
[00:35:38.872 --> 00:35:44.938]  Every time you go, it's like 20-year-old college kids with big red stars and big tattoos of Mao and Lenin on them.
[00:35:44.938 --> 00:35:47.121]  I mean, literally, like Mike Tyson with Mao on his arm.
[00:35:48.478 --> 00:35:54.369]  And they'll say, yeah, we're with the Revolutionary Youth Brigade of Malice Youth Brigade.
[00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:56.052]  And then next we'll be going, ANARCHY!
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.061]  And they're there to create the anarchy, bought and paid for.
[00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:16.545]  I mean, I've seen it where you'll have some six-foot-four huge cop with huge arms commanding a scraggly group of meth-head pension fund kids who get flown all over the world to do this.
[00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:21.647]  And the cops will step aside, they'll let them march right through into a crowd.
[00:36:21.647 --> 00:36:25.508]  They got caught in Denver.
[00:36:25.508 --> 00:36:29.150]  Witnesses, and it later was confirmed, would see vans pull up and U.S.
[00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.110]  Marines would get out.
[00:36:31.678 --> 00:36:38.623]  In the park in the early morning hours, they would then change clothes in the vans and run around stirring trouble up all day.
[00:36:38.623 --> 00:36:44.307]  I mean, you know, the Marine Corps, the Army, the Delta Force, this is who they are!
[00:36:44.307 --> 00:36:45.909]  And you know how they do it?
[00:36:45.909 --> 00:36:47.550]  I could play newscast after newscast.
[00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.912]  I played one, what, two weeks ago out of Maine.
[00:36:50.572 --> 00:36:52.334]  With the flu drill.
[00:36:52.334 --> 00:37:10.172]  Just Google Maine military trains for flu quarantine and we've got them from South Carolina and all over the country where they have the Marines in the army and regular army and National Guard and the rest of it come out and quote do drills of attacking local police and the military and then they go out and run real checkpoints on the highway afterward.
[00:37:10.512 --> 00:37:18.313]  And that's how they tell these young stupid, usually it's very young Marines and Army, but then commanding them will be Delta Force or PSYOPs or Army Intelligence.
[00:37:18.313 --> 00:37:23.534]  They'll say, yeah, we're going out here to do a live-action drill, but don't tell the public, they don't know.
[00:37:23.534 --> 00:37:26.155]  And you're going to go up and hit the police, alright?
[00:37:26.155 --> 00:37:27.215]  And you're going to dress like this.
[00:37:27.215 --> 00:37:31.516]  They're like, OK, Sergeant!
[00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:34.496]  You think it's funny?
[00:37:34.496 --> 00:37:36.976]  Let me tell you something, you young Marines and Army people.
[00:37:36.976 --> 00:37:39.437]  If this stuff really goes the way these globalists plan,
[00:37:40.529 --> 00:37:46.353]  You have any idea what your job is going to be like when you're trying to go up against the American people, you stupid fools?
[00:37:46.353 --> 00:37:58.761]  But they're training you just like you train an attack dog on a dummy at first, and then a guy dressed up in an outfit that's with pads on it that's meant to be able to take bites, and that's what you're being trained on before you're really put up against the real bears.
[00:37:58.761 --> 00:38:01.642]  So you're getting trained on a little stuffed bear.
[00:38:01.642 --> 00:38:08.006]  You think you're real tough, you think it's real cute, think it's all real funny.
[00:38:08.006 --> 00:38:08.827]  In fact, I've got a
[00:38:11.172 --> 00:38:19.016]  Couple articles here out of some magazines I bought when I was in the airport.
[00:38:19.016 --> 00:38:23.199]  One of them is Popular Science, the future of remote-controlled warfare.
[00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:27.481]  And here it is, oh, you know, this guy was a top video game player in simulations.
[00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:30.143]  And it just so happens the Pentagon designed those simulations.
[00:38:30.143 --> 00:38:32.184]  It's kind of like The Last Starfighter.
[00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:34.946]  That's all the predictive programming they put out there for people.
[00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:38.708]  And then now he's flying Predator and Grim Reapers, killing enemies.
[00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:40.569]  Soon the whole Air Force will be robotic.
[00:38:41.149 --> 00:38:42.990]  Then they're going to get rid of the human controllers.
[00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:49.672]  They're wargaming the different algorithms of human controllers and moves humans make with the big AI computers watching and all.
[00:38:49.672 --> 00:38:55.674]  And soon the globalists will be able to launch giant wars without any human help in the first phases.
[00:38:55.674 --> 00:38:58.935]  And then just human technicians over the machine factories.
[00:38:58.935 --> 00:39:00.135]  And then that's the next phase.
[00:39:00.135 --> 00:39:01.896]  And then after that, no humans involved!
[00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:06.049]  And the globalists will have their mechanized army.
[00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:08.010]  They'll be in control of Skynet.
[00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:11.111]  That's in 1968 documents put out by the Pentagon.
[00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:18.172]  Yeah, Terminator is based... James Cameron's movie is based on what they're really planning.
[00:39:18.172 --> 00:39:20.152]  Does that mean they're going to get to that level?
[00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:21.573]  No, but that's what they're trying!
[00:39:21.573 --> 00:39:24.233]  Remember the article in AP a few months ago?
[00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:27.014]  Flesh-eating robots that feed themselves off your blood?
[00:39:28.137 --> 00:39:30.338]  This is what they're doing!
[00:39:30.338 --> 00:39:33.679]  But Skynet isn't in the control of a crazy computer.
[00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:35.640]  It's in the control of a eugenicist.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.920]  It's in the control of John P. Holdren.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.142]  It's in the control of David Rockefeller.
[00:39:41.142 --> 00:39:43.903]  That's Skynet!
[00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:44.723]  And that's what this is.
[00:39:46.892 --> 00:39:48.132]  Look, I could rant and rave all day.
[00:39:48.132 --> 00:39:56.095]  I'm going to give the number out and I'm going to take calls right now.
[00:39:56.095 --> 00:39:56.335]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:56.335 --> 00:39:56.696]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:56.696 --> 00:40:03.498]  And we're going to talk to Mike Rivero about a host of issues, but also just take your calls the entire time he's on.
[00:40:03.498 --> 00:40:14.242]  And then I'm doing two hours on the demonization of the militia movement and how they're taking over while Mark Cuban's HDTV network is here.
[00:40:18.231 --> 00:40:22.174]  So that is coming up.
[00:40:22.174 --> 00:40:24.195]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:40:24.195 --> 00:40:29.319]  The phones are open.
[00:40:29.319 --> 00:40:30.840]  And I've got this article out of Minnesota.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.601]  We're going to get to it when Rivero's here.
[00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:35.643]  In fact, guys, will you reprint me this story?
[00:40:35.643 --> 00:40:39.726]  She's walking the tightrope on flu.
[00:40:39.726 --> 00:40:42.568]  For some reason it didn't print the back page for me.
[00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:47.372]  Because it's got the quote about how they're going to lock the city down and put police cars at the end of your street.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:55.786]  And again, this will probably just come and go and kill 10-20,000 people, less than the regular flu, but they'll fear-monger you and train you to be a prisoner.
[00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:58.728]  Hands-off plans, schools ban touching to fight H1N1.
[00:40:58.728 --> 00:41:05.193]  Again, this is all part of the new medical tyranny.
[00:41:05.193 --> 00:41:09.617]  Rasmussen had a daily poll two weekends ago at 41%.
[00:41:09.617 --> 00:41:13.080]  They're saying 41% strongly disapprove of the President.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.501]  That's a new poll out today.
[00:41:16.496 --> 00:41:23.861]  But then when I see it on CNN, they keep saying Rasmussen says 45 and Zogby says 42.
[00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:26.743]  And I've got both those articles here.
[00:41:26.743 --> 00:41:35.229]  So what they do is they look at one little demographic in the media and then report on his low poll numbers by using the highest demographic he's got.
[00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:37.490]  But his real demographics are 41 and 42.
[00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.652]  That's the general poll number.
[00:41:41.363 --> 00:41:48.328]  I wanted to get to the bottom of this last night, because I was watching CNN while I was eating a late night dinner up here working on Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:48.328 --> 00:41:54.692]  The presidency of Barack H. Obama coming out October 21st, and I saw that, so that is coming up.
[00:41:54.692 --> 00:42:09.763]  Oh, before I go to your calls here in just a moment, I do want to just let people know, I'm getting all these emails saying, is your big announcement next Tuesday that you're going to be on
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.943]  Some Sky television channel that somebody leases and owns, and this went by my desk about a month ago.
[00:42:16.943 --> 00:42:20.385]  They want to play my PrisonPlanet.tv show.
[00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:24.348]  I told them I don't even have the staff to download this and give it to them.
[00:42:24.348 --> 00:42:27.310]  They can just grab it if they want, I told them.
[00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.492]  I haven't even had time to look at the contract they've got.
[00:42:30.492 --> 00:42:31.372]  That's how busy we are.
[00:42:31.372 --> 00:42:36.435]  We don't even have personnel to give a high-quality copy of this to an international TV network.
[00:42:36.435 --> 00:42:39.117]  I mean, and I can only do what I can do.
[00:42:41.147 --> 00:42:48.149]  I can only, um, make the film, do the website, do the events we do, have the guest on we have on.
[00:42:48.149 --> 00:42:51.810]  But yes, we're blowing up at every level.
[00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:57.892]  And, uh, there's some private folks I want to get them on who, again, Lisa Channel, they want to put me on.
[00:42:57.892 --> 00:43:02.393]  That'll be on Sky all over Europe and England, and I've just been so busy I haven't even tracked that down.
[00:43:02.393 --> 00:43:04.134]  So, no, that's not the big announcement.
[00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.451]  And the big announcement is not that I'm a consultant on and will probably appear.
[00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:10.352]  They're saying four to seven of the seven episodes.
[00:43:10.352 --> 00:43:11.932]  Either four of them or all seven.
[00:43:11.932 --> 00:43:13.773]  They don't know of the Jesse Ventura Show.
[00:43:13.773 --> 00:43:17.735]  No, that's not the big announcement.
[00:43:17.735 --> 00:43:18.515]  It's big, though.
[00:43:18.515 --> 00:43:22.817]  And it's coming up Tuesday.
[00:43:22.817 --> 00:43:23.697]  September 8th.
[00:43:23.697 --> 00:43:26.378]  You believe we're almost to the eighth year anniversary of the stage terror attack.
[00:43:26.378 --> 00:43:27.678]  And that's a whole nother issue.
[00:43:27.678 --> 00:43:30.900]  In fact, I will spend 15 minutes at the end of the show if I have time.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.840]  Again, that's a whole nother thing.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.541]  I sat there while I was eating dinner last night.
[00:43:36.431 --> 00:43:49.195]  Channel surfing and I watched 20 minutes of news and then I went to watch 20 minutes of the ridiculous new National Geographic.
[00:43:49.195 --> 00:43:55.076]  Now they put out an apology saying their last show was wrong, the pancake theory is wrong, because NIST has had to admit that's a fraud.
[00:43:55.076 --> 00:43:57.157]  The feds have had to admit it.
[00:43:57.157 --> 00:43:59.698]  This was like it was a joke, like they were trying
[00:44:00.615 --> 00:44:02.156]  to make themselves look stupid.
[00:44:02.156 --> 00:44:10.682]  They fire a missile with a pound of plastic explosives into a fiberglass, I mean, not even a half inch thick, chicken coop.
[00:44:10.682 --> 00:44:13.784]  It is a chicken coop.
[00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:15.985]  I think they lazily went out and actually bought a chicken coop.
[00:44:15.985 --> 00:44:17.627]  I've seen these fiberglass chicken coops.
[00:44:17.627 --> 00:44:19.568]  It just didn't have little subdividers in it.
[00:44:19.568 --> 00:44:20.929]  And they fire a missile
[00:44:22.435 --> 00:44:26.138]  Into it and it blows up and they say, see a missile would have blown up the whole Pentagon.
[00:44:26.138 --> 00:44:31.302]  I mean, this was like it was made for three-year-olds that have been given lobotomies.
[00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:33.343]  It was, it was unspeakable.
[00:44:33.343 --> 00:44:37.887]  I saw 20 minutes of it and then I came back in later when it was on, we were recording it and watched like five minutes at the end.
[00:44:37.887 --> 00:44:48.675]  I mean, it was an absolute asinine joke and the people they had who were against the 9-11 truthers
[00:44:49.824 --> 00:45:05.349]  We're well-spoken, focused, they used the very clips of where they were authoritative, and then you could tell they probably interviewed Gage and others for days, and then used the few little times that they were hesitant or thoughtful to make it look like they were bumbling.
[00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:10.011]  But they still did a pretty good job in Stephen Jones.
[00:45:10.011 --> 00:45:13.272]  But they used the parts where they look completely clueless.
[00:45:13.272 --> 00:45:15.553]  That's why they don't really put me in those TV shows.
[00:45:15.553 --> 00:45:19.114]  They'll only do it if they can come to public events I met where they can try to stage things.
[00:45:20.478 --> 00:45:48.725]  but uh... we're gonna see what goes on with that uh... let's talk to uh... gary in arizona gary are on the air okay gary doesn't want to talk let him go mike in wyoming uh... mike you're on the air hello alex hey you used to have some uh...
[00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:53.851]  Great sections like 9-11 and on Freemasonry.
[00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.214]  I can't find those anymore.
[00:45:56.214 --> 00:45:58.457]  Are they squirreled away somewhere?
[00:45:59.713 --> 00:46:03.835]  I'd be willing to set up my own website to just have those available.
[00:46:03.835 --> 00:46:06.517]  Yeah, no, Paul Watson and others created archives.
[00:46:06.517 --> 00:46:14.161]  If you just Google Prison Planet Freemasonry Archive, Prison Planet 9-11 Archive, they're all there.
[00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:16.922]  There's just tabs up at the top that link through to the older pages.
[00:46:16.922 --> 00:46:22.765]  We just don't have the money and the personnel, and I can turn the whole show into nothing but an infomercial, and then there's, it's just, it's a Catch-22.
[00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:30.251]  I just, people, they want to see more sections and more webmasters and more material, but I've also got to spend time managing things.
[00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:34.253]  If I don't manage people around my office, nothing will happen either.
[00:46:34.253 --> 00:46:38.616]  So it just turns into a hall of mirrors, and I'm not bitching.
[00:46:38.616 --> 00:46:40.398]  I just am not a corporate manager.
[00:46:40.398 --> 00:46:43.160]  I'm a filmmaker and a radio host, but yes, we're trying, Mike.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.961]  Yes, those archives are up there.
[00:46:44.961 --> 00:46:50.245]  You're the hardest working guy I know out there, so I'm certainly not complaining about that.
[00:46:50.245 --> 00:46:52.686]  I just... No, no, no, no, I'm complaining.
[00:46:52.686 --> 00:46:53.327]  I'm complaining.
[00:46:54.554 --> 00:47:02.577]  I mean, I mean, I wish we just had some benefactor, where I just had millions of dollars and I could just pay for all this, because believe me, I don't like having to spend my time.
[00:47:02.577 --> 00:47:11.920]  In fact, I've even turned down a lot of advertising, because I just don't want to have more things to plug and more things to cover, because it just turns into an endless, you know, it's just endless.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.120]  I don't, you know.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:13.521]  Sure.
[00:47:13.521 --> 00:47:18.682]  So if I Google Prison Planet 9-11 archives, that should bring it up?
[00:47:18.682 --> 00:47:21.383]  Yes, or InfoWars 9-11 archive.
[00:47:21.383 --> 00:47:22.304]  Okay.
[00:47:22.304 --> 00:47:22.884]  Alright, great.
[00:47:22.884 --> 00:47:23.144]  Thank you.
[00:47:23.772 --> 00:47:25.133]  Anything else, Mike?
[00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:25.994]  No, sir.
[00:47:25.994 --> 00:47:27.475]  Thank you, good to hear from you.
[00:47:27.475 --> 00:47:29.136]  WSC in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:47:29.136 --> 00:47:33.740]  Brother Jones, thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.461]  Go ahead.
[00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:38.744]  I'd like to point out a couple of victories we're having here in the Houston area.
[00:47:38.744 --> 00:47:46.350]  I, on a regular basis, because I've got all this retail in my hand now that I'm rehabbing my shoulder, I've been using it to my advantage.
[00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:52.715]  I call in regularly on local radio here, and there's one specific radio station, it's a Clear Channel station, but they do
[00:47:53.502 --> 00:48:01.534]  I'm almost convinced now that the people over there are wide awake and they allow me to get on every day and talk about different issues.
[00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.233]  I've got to mention things about swine flu, squalene, all kind of stuff.
[00:48:07.233 --> 00:48:09.915]  So I think... Yeah, that's what's... I mean, let me explain.
[00:48:09.915 --> 00:48:14.919]  Only top editors and top individuals in key position are government operatives, and even they're upset.
[00:48:14.919 --> 00:48:23.265]  I've talked to some of them who like, wink, wink, you know, I know you're telling the truth because I'm in the system and we're sick of it too, Alex.
[00:48:23.265 --> 00:48:28.309]  And that's exactly what's happening is an illusion is what keeps everybody in line.
[00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:32.863]  An illusion that the system was telling the truth.
[00:48:32.863 --> 00:48:44.831]  Once that illusion's over, and once people realize that people want freedom of the majority, it's all over for the New World Order and this handful of corrupt, pot-bellied, bastard bankers.
[00:48:44.831 --> 00:48:50.655]  Verbal jiu-jitsu that I like to use on them, because you can always hammer them when they're sitting in their line.
[00:48:50.655 --> 00:48:53.216]  I mean, because it takes so much energy to remember a lie.
[00:48:53.216 --> 00:48:57.159]  But the truth rolls right off your tongue, and it registers, and you know that.
[00:48:57.159 --> 00:48:57.919]  But also,
[00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:05.906]  There's a radio station here that the Obama worship on 90.1 in Houston is absolute audible epicac.
[00:49:05.906 --> 00:49:07.488]  It is sickening.
[00:49:07.488 --> 00:49:12.732]  And I try to call in and be the voice in the wilderness, and more folks are calling in, too.
[00:49:12.732 --> 00:49:15.454]  But, you know, I just like to hammer on the positive.
[00:49:15.454 --> 00:49:20.378]  We are having victories, but always keep knowing that our enemy is always changing.
[00:49:20.378 --> 00:49:28.264]  And another thing that I've seen, actually it was this morning on Fox News, the O. Steve Ducey rolling his sleeve up, taking his flu shot.
[00:49:28.669 --> 00:49:31.931]  And they said right there, oh well it won't protect against swine flu.
[00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:33.833]  That won't be out till next month.
[00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:35.374]  Everybody knows October's the month of May.
[00:49:35.374 --> 00:49:35.994]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:35.994 --> 00:49:43.540]  Just like they admit Gardasil doesn't protect girls from cancer on the drug insert, but it kills a bunch of people, and people go, I don't care if it kills my daughter.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.483]  I'd rather be dead than get warts.
[00:49:47.483 --> 00:49:49.064]  So, you know.
[00:49:49.064 --> 00:49:51.085]  It's amazing, sir, but you know what?
[00:49:51.085 --> 00:49:52.186]  I'm positive every day.
[00:49:52.651 --> 00:49:55.233]  I know that we're doing great here.
[00:49:55.233 --> 00:49:57.976]  I've called him before with HoustonTruth.org.
[00:49:57.976 --> 00:50:01.338]  We're doing good things here in the community, and Alex, this is a huge market.
[00:50:01.338 --> 00:50:07.324]  If we could get you on the radio here, I mean, it's an untapped market, and a lot of folks here still don't know your voice.
[00:50:07.324 --> 00:50:08.384]  Yeah, no, I know.
[00:50:08.384 --> 00:50:09.185]  Listen, I hear you.
[00:50:09.185 --> 00:50:11.427]  People always call me and say, why aren't you on in this city?
[00:50:11.427 --> 00:50:12.948]  Why aren't you on in that city?
[00:50:12.948 --> 00:50:15.691]  How do we get you on?
[00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:18.253]  And, I mean, if we could be on in every city, we would be.
[00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.830]  You're right about that.
[00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:21.951]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:21.951 --> 00:50:22.871]  I'm gonna have to let you go.
[00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:24.132]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:24.132 --> 00:50:25.292]  Thank you.
[00:50:25.292 --> 00:50:27.774]  Uh, good points.
[00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:33.736]  Listen, folks.
[00:50:33.736 --> 00:50:37.638]  The way radio works is a handful of companies own over 90% of the stations.
[00:50:37.638 --> 00:50:41.960]  We're on privately owned, independent, stand-alone stations across the country.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.601]  Brave, wonderful people that believe in the First Amendment.
[00:50:44.601 --> 00:50:49.103]  Even if you disagree with everything I'm saying, you should still agree with hearing something alternative.
[00:50:50.674 --> 00:50:51.715]  But my message is simple.
[00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:54.577]  Meet the new boss same as the old boss.
[00:50:54.577 --> 00:50:56.459]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:50:56.459 --> 00:50:59.461]  And then Mike Rivero and a special report on the militia.
[00:50:59.461 --> 00:50:59.862]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.095 --> 00:51:08.639]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:51:08.639 --> 00:51:13.142]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:51:13.142 --> 00:51:18.285]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:51:18.285 --> 00:51:25.409]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:26.069]  I think so.
[00:51:43.394 --> 00:51:48.897]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:51.419]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[00:51:51.419 --> 00:51:53.540]  Or, call 269-409-1776.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:58.183]  269-409-1776 today.
[00:51:58.183 --> 00:52:07.108]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.108 --> 00:52:08.789]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:09.924 --> 00:52:11.285]  Who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.285 --> 00:52:12.066]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:13.066]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.066 --> 00:52:14.427]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.427 --> 00:52:16.449]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.449 --> 00:52:23.594]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.594 --> 00:52:24.075]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.075 --> 00:52:29.719]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.419 --> 00:52:33.901]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:36.062]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:11.210]  Yes.
[00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.611]  The answer is simple.
[00:53:12.611 --> 00:53:13.832]  PureBulk.com.
[00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.211]  Because we've been trying to dump the wine spray for much too long.
[00:54:18.895 --> 00:54:21.356]  Mike Rivera is coming up in the second segment of the next hour.
[00:54:21.356 --> 00:54:26.338]  8 After will start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:54:26.338 --> 00:54:30.780]  He will join us from Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.462]  There will also be a video link for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:54:34.462 --> 00:54:38.864]  I'm going to continue with Lauren, Jay, Richard, Ralph, Gary and others here in just a moment.
[00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:44.620]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that do make this radio show possible.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:48.542]  One of those is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:54:48.542 --> 00:55:01.369]  And I don't have to remind you that in these crazy uncertain times with the economy, and with all this flu behavior, and all the crazy fires, and just the nuttiness in the world, you buy high-quality non-GMO, non-hybrid foods,
[00:55:02.657 --> 00:55:04.658]  They last more than 10 years in climate control.
[00:55:04.658 --> 00:55:08.300]  10 years if it's in your garage or attic in the heat, like I've got mine.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.741]  And if you ever need it, you use it.
[00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:14.763]  And when it gets to be 5, 6, 7 years old, you buy some new food and eat the old stuff.
[00:55:14.763 --> 00:55:17.344]  It keeps really well and it's high quality and tastes good.
[00:55:17.344 --> 00:55:19.125]  Check them out at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:55:19.125 --> 00:55:20.946]  That's the letter E, foodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[00:55:20.946 --> 00:55:21.226]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:55:21.226 --> 00:55:23.507]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.211]  And lastly, the great folks at Ecola Blue.
[00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:34.132]  This is also part of preparedness.
[00:55:34.132 --> 00:55:42.716]  And they have the solar-powered systems that go with this, and they have the solar-powered little converter that you can buy from them very inexpensively as well.
[00:55:42.716 --> 00:55:45.538]  The Ecola Blue is an atmospheric water generator that grabs
[00:55:46.826 --> 00:55:51.588]  Water out of thin air, up to seven and a half gallons a day with their smaller units, even more with their bigger units.
[00:55:51.588 --> 00:55:54.469]  And it looks like a water cooler without the water cooler on top of it.
[00:55:54.469 --> 00:55:59.671]  Got a stainless steel illuminated tank with a antibacterial, antifungal UV light.
[00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:04.872]  Goes through six other filters on top of that, including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[00:56:04.872 --> 00:56:07.793]  Ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, or 1-800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, Ecolablue.com.
[00:56:07.793 --> 00:56:08.574]  Check them out today!
[00:56:18.419 --> 00:56:22.082]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Lauren in Ohio.
[00:56:22.082 --> 00:56:23.103]  Lauren, you're on the air.
[00:56:23.103 --> 00:56:23.983]  Go ahead.
[00:56:23.983 --> 00:56:25.324]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:56:25.324 --> 00:56:26.605]  Good, good to hear from you.
[00:56:26.605 --> 00:56:27.426]  Great.
[00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:38.814]  Hey, you were talking about, I'll just, a couple things and then I'll get to my main thing, but verisimilitude, the appearance of truth, that's what we've been living under in this culture.
[00:56:38.814 --> 00:56:40.555]  And that's why we're having so much trouble.
[00:56:40.555 --> 00:56:43.217]  Because we think things that are not real are real.
[00:56:43.217 --> 00:56:44.058]  Dominionomics.
[00:56:44.525 --> 00:56:46.026]  Men want control over other men.
[00:56:46.026 --> 00:56:48.367]  That's how it's been since the very beginning.
[00:56:48.367 --> 00:56:50.188]  It isn't going to change.
[00:56:50.188 --> 00:56:54.211]  Well, you know, what business do we have obeying men instead of obeying God?
[00:56:54.738 --> 00:57:05.327]  Well, it's also a devilish system because if you're not a control freak and don't want to control other people, you have to get power just to protect yourself and live in peace.
[00:57:05.327 --> 00:57:19.840]  And that's what liberty is all about, is having your own money, your own liberties, your own freedoms, and having a mutual truce of not having aggression towards each other so that we can use our own resources instead of expending them fighting with each other.
[00:57:20.962 --> 00:57:27.706]  In your time, it's like if somebody just kept coming up to your door every day saying, you owe me $10,000, and you gotta keep opening the door and saying no.
[00:57:27.706 --> 00:57:29.187]  Just the stealing of your time.
[00:57:29.187 --> 00:57:31.229]  They're time pirates, but here's the solution.
[00:57:31.229 --> 00:57:32.389]  Time pirates!
[00:57:32.389 --> 00:57:36.572]  Ooh, that's a great term.
[00:57:36.572 --> 00:57:38.433]  Go ahead.
[00:57:38.433 --> 00:57:40.014]  So here's my solution though, Jobs.
[00:57:40.515 --> 00:57:43.997]  Temp, high employment, manufacturing, products.
[00:57:43.997 --> 00:57:48.959]  They keep trying to have us living in an industry where there's no productivity.
[00:57:48.959 --> 00:57:53.181]  If you look at where money is being made in this country, none of it is producing products.
[00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:53.581]  That's it.
[00:57:53.581 --> 00:57:55.642]  They want a, and I'm going to keep you over this, this is key.
[00:57:55.642 --> 00:57:59.563]  They want a zero economy, one that's not just a zero growth.
[00:57:59.563 --> 00:58:00.584]  That's what they publicly say.
[00:58:00.584 --> 00:58:04.446]  Maury Strong and David Rockefeller say they want it reduced by at least 80%.
[00:58:04.446 --> 00:58:09.788]  And that means getting rid of most of the people, though they know an industrialized nation actually causes that.
[00:58:11.195 --> 00:58:17.917]  They just want the third world to actually starve to death, so they actually want a larger population, but then later just to cull that larger mass.
[00:58:17.917 --> 00:58:18.298]  Stay there.
[00:58:18.298 --> 00:58:21.919]  I want you to continue with the great line of reasoning you're putting out here, Lauren.
[00:58:21.919 --> 00:58:24.400]  We come back in T-minus 70 seconds.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:29.722]  And then eight minutes into the show, when we start the second segment, we're going to have Mike Rivera joining us for 50 minutes.
[00:58:29.722 --> 00:58:38.185]  Then, I'm going to do two hours on the militia, play this internal FBI training video, and get into a lot more.
[00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:38.665]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:45.403]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.403 --> 00:58:50.107]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.107 --> 00:58:55.433]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.433 --> 00:58:57.515]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:58:57.515 --> 00:58:59.958]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:59.958 --> 00:59:02.240]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.862]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:03.862 --> 00:59:04.883]  There is a solution.
[00:59:05.123 --> 00:59:13.551]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:59:27.023 --> 00:59:33.047]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:59:53.286 --> 00:59:55.688]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.688 --> 01:00:05.096]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.096 --> 01:00:06.397]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.397 --> 01:00:08.159]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.159 --> 01:00:09.360]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.541]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.863]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:17.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.266 --> 01:00:21.330]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.266]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:41.348]  We're going to start simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv in seven minutes.
[01:00:41.348 --> 01:00:42.848]  We start the next segment.
[01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:51.132]  We've got Mike Rivero coming up and I'm going to do two hours on the whole provocateur black op program and how the media is trying to demonize the militia movement.
[01:00:51.132 --> 01:00:52.873]  So that is coming up
[01:00:53.933 --> 01:00:55.615]  In about 58 minutes.
[01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:58.318]  Right now, going back to Lauren in Ohio.
[01:00:58.318 --> 01:00:59.299]  Lauren, continue.
[01:00:59.299 --> 01:01:10.451]  Yes, the establishment wants you to spend all your time filling out census forms and tax forms and they admit it's a tool of control because the globalists are monopoly men and they don't want a free market.
[01:01:10.451 --> 01:01:10.772]  Go ahead.
[01:01:11.397 --> 01:01:15.218]  Well, and so they have jobs managing your life.
[01:01:15.218 --> 01:01:17.699]  Now, there's nothing you can sell for a buck there.
[01:01:17.699 --> 01:01:20.600]  Prison guards, what do you produce you can sell for a buck?
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.302]  The prison blues and the deaths that you make in the prisons compete against the public sector that's trying to make a living.
[01:01:26.302 --> 01:01:28.462]  But anyway... Yes, it's a control freak.
[01:01:28.462 --> 01:01:34.804]  The whole world is a giant control freak church where the control freaks set up control freak systems.
[01:01:34.804 --> 01:01:38.405]  Lesser men who are nothing but greedy, wicked control freaks.
[01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:39.586]  It's their system.
[01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:39.766]  Yes.
[01:01:40.225 --> 01:01:42.506]  Now, here's the solution, and we can just take it from them.
[01:01:42.506 --> 01:01:43.986]  We don't have to vote for anybody.
[01:01:43.986 --> 01:01:46.747]  We don't have to... We can do this on our own.
[01:01:46.747 --> 01:01:47.607]  Here's the deal.
[01:01:47.607 --> 01:01:49.408]  I'm looking at... Noncompliance!
[01:01:49.408 --> 01:01:51.469]  Just start saying no to all their crap.
[01:01:51.469 --> 01:01:52.969]  It's respect for truth!
[01:01:52.969 --> 01:01:56.630]  I'm looking at an 1888 campaign poster, okay?
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.731]  And what does it say?
[01:01:57.731 --> 01:02:00.952]  Protect rice, corn, hemp, and fruit.
[01:02:01.687 --> 01:02:03.750]  And the other thing it says, this is 1888.
[01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.894]  An honest count, an honest vote, and an honest count.
[01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.396]  So we're dealing with the same problems.
[01:02:08.396 --> 01:02:10.738]  But see, back then, they had respect for the truth.
[01:02:10.738 --> 01:02:11.900]  God put rice on the planet.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.461]  He put corn.
[01:02:12.461 --> 01:02:13.121]  He put fruit.
[01:02:13.121 --> 01:02:13.923]  He put hemp.
[01:02:13.923 --> 01:02:18.008]  It's the widest, the most widely used fabric and material in the world.
[01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:24.334]  But we're banned from using the same criminal... That's right, and 99% of the varieties have no THC, but the police don't care.
[01:02:24.334 --> 01:02:33.664]  They'll come to your house and swat team you and beat your brains out if you're caught with it, because it makes, it's better than cotton, and you're not gonna grow it, you're gonna wear toxic polyester, and if you don't like it, they'll murder you!
[01:02:33.664 --> 01:02:34.025]  Period!
[01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:39.512]  And you could provide jobs from the farm all the way up through full manufacturing.
[01:02:39.512 --> 01:02:42.356]  Henry Ford had a car made completely of flax, hemp, and linen.
[01:02:42.356 --> 01:02:43.497]  Doesn't matter!
[01:02:43.497 --> 01:02:44.178]  Doesn't matter!
[01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:45.660]  Doesn't matter!
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.663]  The chemical companies have SWAT teams!
[01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:48.584]  They have SWAT teams!
[01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.171]  We can make them do this, just like we're making them.
[01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:54.032]  We made them not let in all those illegals.
[01:02:54.032 --> 01:03:00.354]  We made them, you know, in Ohio, we made them not charge us to park in our state parks that we pay for.
[01:03:00.354 --> 01:03:04.615]  We can make them do this, and if we make them do this, we've got everything.
[01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:08.136]  You can provide food, clothing, shelter, fuel.
[01:03:08.136 --> 01:03:13.718]  You can provide biodegradable plastics, steel 10 times stronger than steel.
[01:03:13.718 --> 01:03:16.319]  Remember old Ironside, the battleship they retired last year?
[01:03:16.319 --> 01:03:18.560]  There was 40,000 acres of hemp in there.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.062]  And so, you have a government that made a video, Hemp for Victory.
[01:03:22.062 --> 01:03:24.123]  All patriotic farmers will grow this.
[01:03:24.123 --> 01:03:25.864]  You see?
[01:03:25.864 --> 01:03:31.008]  We can't keep letting them say that the truth is not the truth and we just go along with it.
[01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:31.588]  Are you kidding?
[01:03:31.588 --> 01:03:35.010]  They're trying to... Ma'am, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.652]  They're trying to restrict... Made a lot of good points.
[01:03:37.652 --> 01:03:41.494]  They're trying to restrict aloe vera now.
[01:03:41.494 --> 01:03:43.775]  Yes.
[01:03:43.775 --> 01:03:46.037]  For some reason, the ash that comes out of hemp
[01:03:47.812 --> 01:03:48.632]  That is confirmed.
[01:03:48.632 --> 01:03:56.435]  When they burn it, they create the ash, or what they call the coke, that they put into the furnaces with the iron to make the steel.
[01:03:56.435 --> 01:03:57.095]  And yes, it does.
[01:03:57.095 --> 01:03:59.516]  It's just an amazing plant.
[01:03:59.516 --> 01:04:03.037]  And very few varieties actually have THC, but they don't care.
[01:04:03.037 --> 01:04:09.960]  The federal government and the big foundations, admittedly, in the 20s and 30s, went around to all the public schools and to the
[01:04:11.991 --> 01:04:18.898]  Local school boards and the PTAs and said hemp is evil, hemp is bad, it makes you go crazy.
[01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:22.181]  And they said ban it and they said absolutely ban it.
[01:04:22.181 --> 01:04:26.745]  And so you can't grow it here in America but they can grow it in Canada and make tens of billions of dollars a year off of it.
[01:04:26.745 --> 01:04:35.894]  And it's just another example of how they do whatever they want whenever they want because the government is run by absolute total degenerate criminals.
[01:04:37.264 --> 01:04:45.012]  Mike Rivero is coming up, joining us from Hawaii, hooked up via video link so you won't just hear him, you'll see him if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:04:45.012 --> 01:04:52.380]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, all 23 of my films, including the upcoming one, are going to be posted there first.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:58.587]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my live TV show, the archives of it, the best archives of the radio show, it's all at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.472 --> 01:05:05.435]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:30.492 --> 01:05:31.032]  We're good.
[01:06:00.134 --> 01:06:01.495]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.495 --> 01:06:03.497]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:06:03.497 --> 01:06:04.478]  Well, you should.
[01:06:04.478 --> 01:06:08.981]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:09.782]  That's right.
[01:06:09.782 --> 01:06:18.449]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:06:18.449 --> 01:06:19.610]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:27.135]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:06:27.135 --> 01:06:34.020]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:39.543]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:07:08.798 --> 01:07:12.920]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.

[01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:32.288]  Incredible taste.
[01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:40.366]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.986]  Coming up in about an hour and five minutes, I'm going to air large clips.
[01:08:17.986 --> 01:08:20.169]  It's only 13 minutes, I might air all of it.
[01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:28.359]  But I want to stop and comment on each section and analyze the propaganda that our tax dollars paid for, what they're brainwashing the
[01:08:30.931 --> 01:08:35.733]  FBI recruits with, and what they're giving to police and military and others.
[01:08:35.733 --> 01:08:41.676]  And how this ties into the MIAC report, the DHS report, saying veterans, gun owners are the number one terror threat.
[01:08:41.676 --> 01:08:46.959]  If you have a Bob Barr sticker, a Libertarian sticker, a Ron Paul sticker, an In The Fed sticker, you're a terrorist.
[01:08:47.912 --> 01:09:00.728]  Paul Watson, as we speak, has a big article, big exclusive article going up on PrisonPlanet.com about state, and we've already confirmed this with state officials that we're in contact with.
[01:09:00.728 --> 01:09:03.611]  In fact, let's get that state rep guest on.
[01:09:04.543 --> 01:09:05.344]  That's a good idea.
[01:09:05.344 --> 01:09:12.848]  In Missouri, with the hearings they've had on MYAC, where the feds came in and were teaching them that the founding fathers are bad.
[01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:14.769]  I actually have video of that in Missouri.
[01:09:14.769 --> 01:09:18.911]  The police being talked at by FEMA, that the founders are bad, America's bad.
[01:09:18.911 --> 01:09:21.653]  I know this sounds crazy, but this is really going on.
[01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:24.092]  So that's coming up next hour.
[01:09:24.092 --> 01:09:38.397]  But with us, five minutes in the next hour, roughly 55 minutes, is Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, and he joins us today live here on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv with a whole host of issues to talk about.
[01:09:38.397 --> 01:09:40.678]  Mike Rivera, good to have you here with us.
[01:09:40.678 --> 01:09:42.479]  Thank you for having me back on the show today.
[01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:44.279]  It's always good to have you.
[01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:49.021]  I want to take a lot of calls today when you're on with us, but let's get into a host of subjects.
[01:09:49.021 --> 01:10:04.545]  I want to get into Bill would give President emergency control over the internet, taking over all the private IT, a new private group of federally certified IT commissars to be over even private networks by law, a form of indentured servitude.
[01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:06.806]  Converting the whole economy over.
[01:10:06.806 --> 01:10:09.088]  I want to get into the latest flu developments.
[01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:11.950]  They're now admitting quarantines, forced inoculations.
[01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:13.531]  That doesn't mean they're going to get away with it, though.
[01:10:13.531 --> 01:10:14.992]  It just means they're going to try it.
[01:10:14.992 --> 01:10:18.934]  Obama's plunging approval numbers.
[01:10:18.934 --> 01:10:20.876]  Just all the things that are happening.
[01:10:20.876 --> 01:10:27.860]  But Mike, out of the gates, I'm asking you this, not having any idea, what do you think is most important right now?
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.902]  What is on Mike Rovero's mind?
[01:10:30.836 --> 01:10:33.877]  Well, I think the first topic you mentioned is definitely important.
[01:10:33.877 --> 01:10:40.220]  We're seeing all this legislative push to give the government control of the Internet in a so-called emergency.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:47.224]  We're also seeing where certain organizations like Wikipedia are now going to decide for you what is trustworthy and what is not.
[01:10:47.224 --> 01:10:48.985]  There are going to be little color codes.
[01:10:48.985 --> 01:10:58.369]  We know there's a new web browser in development that will have built into it a little indicator on whether the link that is showing on your page should be considered trustworthy or not.
[01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:12.000]  And this is a desperate panic attempt by the government and the corporate media to take us back to the 1950s and 1960s when we, the American people, would rely on government and the media to tell us what to think and what to believe in.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:26.632]  Of course, the whole point of the evolution of the Internet and the blogs and the Alex Jones Show and what really happened is that the American people are learning to trust their own analytical ability to decide what is true, what is a lie, what is false, and the government is scared
[01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:31.274]  Out of their minds about it, the corporate media has lost control of the American public.
[01:11:31.274 --> 01:11:41.499]  They're trying to figure some way they can convince you to give up trusting your own mind and go back to letting an authority figure tell you what is true and what is not true.
[01:11:41.499 --> 01:11:44.501]  Just last night we had another National Geographic show out there.
[01:11:44.841 --> 01:11:53.084]  Trying to resell the idea that anybody who thinks there's a conspiracy about 9-11, there's just got to be something wrong about those people and you don't want to hang out with them.
[01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:55.784]  And again, it's the same stuff they have been hammering before.
[01:11:55.784 --> 01:12:05.988]  They go right back to that no plane at the Pentagon thing and they use that as the primary lever to try and convince people that there couldn't possibly be anything incorrect about the official government story of 9-11.
[01:12:07.048 --> 01:12:08.909]  They've lost control of the American people.
[01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:12.050]  That's why we're seeing this anger surface in the town hall meetings.
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:15.131]  The healthcare reform is just the fuse.
[01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:24.735]  The powder for the anger is being lied into war after war after war, being lied to about 9-11, being lied to about TW800, being lied to about Pearl Harbor.
[01:12:24.735 --> 01:12:28.136]  Torture, all of it, is building to a head right now.
[01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:31.758]  The government knows they can't lie to us anymore with any kind of success.
[01:12:31.758 --> 01:12:35.860]  They're desperate to figure out a way to reimpose that rule by lie.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.460]  And they're failing.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.962]  And Mike, you're right.
[01:12:38.962 --> 01:12:41.784]  Before you leave, I do want to talk about the National Geographic Show.
[01:12:41.784 --> 01:12:43.665]  I did watch part of it last night.
[01:12:43.665 --> 01:12:47.529]  They fired a missile with a pound of explosive.
[01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.590]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.943 --> 01:13:17.289]  Just the way they shot it, the way they did it, the way they zoom in on a bandaid on Richard Gage's show or zoom in on Dylan Avery picking his mustache or whatever.
[01:13:17.289 --> 01:13:20.652]  I mean, just everything, because I've had that before.
[01:13:20.652 --> 01:13:23.374]  I mean, I've had national media follow me around for two, three days.
[01:13:23.374 --> 01:13:27.757]  And the one time I wipe my nose, I see him looking at me and I go, that's going to be on TV.
[01:13:27.757 --> 01:13:29.578]  You know, they use every little slip up.
[01:13:30.459 --> 01:13:38.748]  And they do everything they can, just this image and the camera kind of crooked when they're talking to you, but when they talk to the debunker, it's all crystal clear.
[01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.310]  I mean, they do this over and over again.
[01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.033]  So I want to go over that today coming up, Mike.
[01:13:43.033 --> 01:13:46.456]  But first, the power to create
[01:13:47.463 --> 01:13:52.328]  A national no-fly list, we always said, would be used to create a no-gun-by list.
[01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:53.549]  It's Kafkaesque.
[01:13:53.549 --> 01:14:08.845]  You're not arrested, you're not charged, you can't find out who puts you on the list, you can't get off the list, now you can't have a job, you can't get on a bus, go to national parks, you can't get on a plane, you can't own a firearm if you're on that list, and they now admit
[01:14:09.366 --> 01:14:11.807]  They've got over a million two hundred thousand.
[01:14:11.807 --> 01:14:16.610]  In the last eight months they made the list secret, so it's probably a million and a half by now.
[01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:25.455]  They admit, they say the government and other corporations are working on these lists where they'll say your website is not true.
[01:14:25.455 --> 01:14:36.322]  Well, creating a list that tracks what people are saying and doing, and where things are flagged, and we know Wikipedia was the model of that, where my name is spelled wrong,
[01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:40.099]  Most of the stuff on there is a lie.
[01:14:40.099 --> 01:14:42.885]  They won't even let me change it or anybody else change it.
[01:14:42.885 --> 01:14:47.815]  I've sent them mainstream news articles showing what I'm saying is true and they don't care.
[01:14:48.519 --> 01:15:00.090]  Now, this CIA, admittedly runs Wikipedia, model is now going to be the whole internet where they take control, they place things over your computer screen, and that's only phase one.
[01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:10.439]  The power to track internet is the power to then block you going to those sites, and the Pentagon's on record under the Cybersecurity Act, not just in the bill with Jay Rockefeller, but in
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:22.724]  For those that don't know, in the actual cybersecurity announcements and symposiums that we've posted the links to, the video, they brag that they're going to, quote, shut down opposition to the government in the U.S.
[01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:24.544]  by just shutting off IPs.
[01:15:24.544 --> 01:15:30.326]  And already, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, you can't go to them.
[01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:38.949]  At most libraries, and we've gotten the screenshots, it says this is a site that teaches you criminal skills or hacking or racism.
[01:15:39.289 --> 01:15:43.330]  And they're banning our YouTube videos saying racism when it's not even about race.
[01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.291]  So we can see the new tyranny.
[01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.011]  Mike Rivero, break it down.
[01:15:47.011 --> 01:15:48.371]  You're absolutely correct here.
[01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:52.352]  My own experience with Wikipedia, they used to have articles about WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:15:52.352 --> 01:15:54.373]  They had an article about me personally.
[01:15:54.373 --> 01:15:56.573]  It was filled with a lot of distortions.
[01:15:56.573 --> 01:15:57.834]  I went in to correct it.
[01:15:57.834 --> 01:15:58.714]  I'd go back.
[01:15:58.714 --> 01:16:00.234]  The original lies were back in.
[01:16:00.234 --> 01:16:01.775]  I'd go in and correct it again.
[01:16:01.775 --> 01:16:03.315]  They'd put the lies back in.
[01:16:03.315 --> 01:16:04.596]  I'd go back in to correct it.
[01:16:04.596 --> 01:16:06.136]  It was locked against editing.
[01:16:06.556 --> 01:16:16.381]  And I'm not kidding you, Wikipedia told me that I was not allowed to change the article about Michael Rivero because I was not a recognized authority on the subject of Michael Rivero.
[01:16:16.381 --> 01:16:20.844]  When I wrote back and I said, I am Michael Rivero, they simply deleted the articles.
[01:16:20.844 --> 01:16:23.185]  And you're absolutely right, they're trying to block websites.
[01:16:23.185 --> 01:16:25.126]  If you go to a US military base,
[01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:28.588]  The computer security there, it is insane.
[01:16:28.588 --> 01:16:34.911]  In fact, the computer security on military bases is so tight, the computers are all but unusable.
[01:16:34.911 --> 01:16:39.233]  And definitely, you are not allowed to see any Alex Jones sites, you're not allowed to see what really happened.
[01:16:39.233 --> 01:16:42.335]  They are terrified the word is getting out there.
[01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:53.181]  And yes, they're openly talking about finding some way to take the truth away from the people, to force us to go back to living in a culture of lies and deception, because that is the only way they know how to rule us.
[01:16:53.741 --> 01:17:02.606]  And, you know, the thing with the no-fly list, turning into a no-gun list, turning into a no-job list, this is the government using terror on the American people.
[01:17:02.606 --> 01:17:06.489]  Because you're terrified if you get on that list, your life is functionally over.
[01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:09.851]  You can't work, you can't travel, you can't have a normal life.
[01:17:09.851 --> 01:17:14.053]  This is just like they used to do in Stalin's Russia, in the Soviet Union.
[01:17:14.053 --> 01:17:22.138]  If you got on the bad enemies list, the government would destroy your life with impunity, and everybody around would say, oh, he's on the list, he must be a bad person.
[01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:25.439]  Now of course we recognize that that was definitely not the case.
[01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:33.102]  We know in our own past history in the United States that the blacklists were very often, in fact usually, tools of intimidation and persecution.
[01:17:33.102 --> 01:17:37.104]  And this is a hundred times bigger and worse than the blacklist.
[01:17:37.104 --> 01:17:43.887]  They're admitting it's going to be a no job, no travel, no gun list, with no judge, jury, no evidence.
[01:17:45.307 --> 01:17:50.730]  We're now being given the choice, liberty or slavery, freedom or tyranny.
[01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:57.135]  If we are cowed, if we let the chilling effect work and start self-censoring, they will win.
[01:17:57.135 --> 01:18:01.297]  But if we say, look, you can't pull us all on list, you bastards, they lose.
[01:18:01.297 --> 01:18:03.218]  Here's an example, Mike.
[01:18:03.218 --> 01:18:08.582]  Three weeks ago, a young man, junior in high school, put up several hundred posters in Florida.
[01:18:09.468 --> 01:18:12.870]  They came, the State Attorney General said they may arrest him.
[01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:20.476]  When that happened, everybody statewide, every major town, it was all over the news, put up the JokerInfoWars.com poster.
[01:18:20.476 --> 01:18:21.977]  Then it spread all over the world.
[01:18:21.977 --> 01:18:30.083]  That intimidation made it blow up 100 times 100, and so now they're dropping charges, backing off, saying it's okay, it's okay.
[01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:37.328]  The Washington Post came out and said, don't censor it, don't censor it, free speech, because the tyrants know we are going to win.
[01:18:37.608 --> 01:18:45.130]  And that's why I've said, I want to live, I don't want to die, but if they kill me or set me up, I'm doing it for my family, I'm doing it for humanity.
[01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:49.250]  I have just become a giant fertilizer bag for the mighty Oak of Liberty.
[01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:54.892]  And if you have that attitude of, I'm going to fight you 110%, you can't be beaten, Mike.
[01:18:54.892 --> 01:18:56.472]  They can beat us individually.
[01:18:56.472 --> 01:18:57.512]  Like V for Vendetta.
[01:18:57.512 --> 01:18:59.573]  Ideas, though, are bulletproof.
[01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:02.033]  And I just thank God I know people like you, Mike.
[01:19:02.033 --> 01:19:03.393]  And I thank God we're part of the 21st century, 1776.
[01:19:06.658 --> 01:19:08.819]  Well, my personal opinion is that the U.S.
[01:19:08.819 --> 01:19:11.321]  government is going to go the way of the former Soviet Union.
[01:19:11.321 --> 01:19:13.923]  It is on the verge of collapse economically.
[01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:16.184]  It has lost the trust of the American people.
[01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:21.167]  It literally cannot function, because the only way it could control the American people was to lie.
[01:19:21.167 --> 01:19:22.888]  We now know about the lies.
[01:19:22.888 --> 01:19:25.590]  We're not going to go back to being led by lies willingly.
[01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:29.555]  And as a result, I'm convinced this government is doomed.
[01:19:29.555 --> 01:19:31.418]  There is no way to save it.
[01:19:31.418 --> 01:19:35.724]  We're seeing a lot of panic on their part right now.
[01:19:35.724 --> 01:19:37.647]  But in the end, I think it is going to collapse.
[01:19:37.647 --> 01:19:41.252]  And we're at the point where we have to start thinking, what do we want to bring on to replace it?
[01:19:41.753 --> 01:19:45.559]  Alright, by the way, Provocateurs and In the Fed Rally article is up.
[01:19:45.559 --> 01:19:49.124]  I'm looking at photos and videos of these guys.
[01:19:49.124 --> 01:19:50.806]  They're definitely cops.
[01:19:50.806 --> 01:19:55.132]  These aren't just provocateurs or hired informants.
[01:19:55.132 --> 01:19:56.374]  I can look at these guys.
[01:19:56.374 --> 01:19:57.235]  They are police, 100%.
[01:20:00.694 --> 01:20:04.097]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[01:20:04.097 --> 01:20:08.541]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:20:08.541 --> 01:20:11.044]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:20:11.044 --> 01:20:17.309]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:23.675]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:27.138]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[01:22:01.425 --> 01:22:07.472]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.472 --> 01:22:13.339]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.339 --> 01:22:19.507]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.827 --> 01:22:21.788]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.788 --> 01:22:24.269]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:24.269 --> 01:22:37.456]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.456 --> 01:22:39.137]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.137 --> 01:22:40.978]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.978 --> 01:22:47.221]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:24:03.254 --> 01:24:09.899]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:09.899 --> 01:24:14.583]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:22.529]  Alright, Mike, I want to start going to calls in the next segment and then get into the whole 9-11 situation coming up with you.
[01:24:22.529 --> 01:24:28.373]  Maybe give you a little bit in the next hour, but I got to get into this overall militia demonization that's going on.
[01:24:28.373 --> 01:24:29.234]  Speaking of that,
[01:24:30.706 --> 01:24:35.050]  It's come out in state testimony, and I've talked to people involved at the state hearing.
[01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:38.913]  We're working on getting some of them on the next few days, including state representatives.
[01:24:38.913 --> 01:24:47.199]  And state police were censured, did get in trouble by the state attorney general over this.
[01:24:47.199 --> 01:24:50.282]  And the deputy lieutenant governor also exposed what was happening.
[01:24:50.282 --> 01:24:52.924]  But it turns out, you look at these guys, classic MO.
[01:24:54.212 --> 01:25:03.802]  They're cops, they're wearing these yellow bands, they're wearing the same outfits, they have the cop build, but the state's also reporting that they were there saying, let's do illegal things, let's attack.
[01:25:04.844 --> 01:25:08.187]  And we said this in Denver, we said this in Ottawa, we've been right every time.
[01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:11.069]  When you look at them, you can instantly tell a cop.
[01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:14.972]  They normally only put cops they think can take care of themselves in these situations.
[01:25:14.972 --> 01:25:17.354]  They're normally about 6'2"-6'5".
[01:25:17.354 --> 01:25:20.777]  Big arms, it's the steroid type cops.
[01:25:20.777 --> 01:25:23.299]  The intelligence units, these are probably feds.
[01:25:23.299 --> 01:25:25.160]  A lot of times they command squads.
[01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:32.983]  Though, of meth heads that are under them, the local foundation drug addicts, and they've been caught.
[01:25:32.983 --> 01:25:34.684]  And they have anarchist sites that attack me.
[01:25:34.684 --> 01:25:36.145]  We know their feds as well.
[01:25:36.145 --> 01:25:38.405]  They've been caught getting federal money.
[01:25:38.405 --> 01:25:42.187]  But the state's reporting they think this was provocateured.
[01:25:42.187 --> 01:25:42.727]  I agree.
[01:25:42.727 --> 01:25:45.448]  Looking at them, we'll put the image up on screen.
[01:25:45.448 --> 01:25:48.809]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com, provocateurs at In The Fed Rally.
[01:25:48.809 --> 01:25:49.969]  These are cops, bottom line.
[01:25:49.969 --> 01:25:53.091]  I can look at you, I can tell you, these are cops.
[01:25:53.091 --> 01:25:54.111]  Go ahead, Mike Rivera.
[01:25:55.086 --> 01:26:07.093]  Well, first of all, I want to start off by saying that I know everyone talks about revolution and guns and militias and the rest of it, but the reality is this revolution is already underway and it's going to be one with keyboards, not with firearms.
[01:26:07.093 --> 01:26:11.455]  It's going to be one with microphones, it's going to be one with computers and so forth and so on.
[01:26:11.455 --> 01:26:21.020]  But the government is desperate to recast the image of the opposition into that of a villain, because it all comes down to public support.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.602]  The side with the most public support is going to win.
[01:26:23.962 --> 01:26:30.426]  When the founding fathers wanted to start a new nation and kick the old government out, they needed support of the general public.
[01:26:30.426 --> 01:26:35.349]  So those of us who want to affect change in this country, we need the support of the general public.
[01:26:35.349 --> 01:26:38.951]  We need them out there marching with us, protesting with us, signing petitions with us.
[01:26:39.411 --> 01:26:39.991]  We're good to go.
[01:26:54.577 --> 01:27:04.261]  Where the FBI operating under orders from the Nixon White House used their undercover college informants, and they're still on there today, any students listening to this show, you need to be aware of that.
[01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:12.805]  And they used their undercover college informants to organize a multi-campus anti-war demonstration in front of the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California.
[01:27:12.805 --> 01:27:13.685]  Once they were there,
[01:27:14.085 --> 01:27:20.267]  The undercover agents, provocateurs, led the protest inside the park and started causing a lot of property damage.
[01:27:20.267 --> 01:27:25.049]  The newspaper photographers showed up, took pictures, the National Guard showed up.
[01:27:25.049 --> 01:27:27.910]  The next day it was on every newspaper in America.
[01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:38.813]  And in that one headline of those so-called peace activists beating up on Mickey Mouse, they completely discredited the anti-war movement, which allowed the Vietnam War to continue for another two years.
[01:27:38.813 --> 01:27:42.014]  And it later came out in the Senator Church Committee.
[01:27:42.014 --> 01:27:43.095]  This is all confirmed.
[01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.280]  That they do this, and now it's coming out.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.268]  We fingered years ago Hal Turner is FBI, and now it's admitted he is.
[01:27:51.414 --> 01:27:56.478]  Yeah, they're using that as his defense in court that he was only doing what the federal government told him to do.
[01:27:56.478 --> 01:28:01.502]  I mean, the government survives by creating the very enemies we're supposed to be afraid of.
[01:28:01.502 --> 01:28:05.525]  The Symbionese Liberation Army was manufactured by the FBI.
[01:28:05.525 --> 01:28:09.007]  They kidnapped Petty Hurst to guarantee themselves newspaper coverage.
[01:28:09.007 --> 01:28:16.093]  And by the way, that's now been declassified that it was all staged with her, staged with the Hurst family.
[01:28:16.093 --> 01:28:17.254]  That's popular mechanics.
[01:28:17.774 --> 01:28:21.598]  You know, the father of yellow journalism, all staged!
[01:28:21.598 --> 01:28:23.619]  All staged!
[01:28:23.619 --> 01:28:28.023]  And now we've got the British Secret Service has declassified documents.
[01:28:28.023 --> 01:28:31.867]  The whole hijacking that led to the raid on Entebbe was also staged.
[01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:36.991]  It was done to destroy popular support for the Palestinians who had nothing to do with it.
[01:28:36.991 --> 01:28:42.697]  And so when you're out there and you're seeing these groups that are saying we're opposed to the government and they're acting in a way
[01:28:43.397 --> 01:28:45.759]  That is just going to scare you.
[01:28:45.759 --> 01:28:54.847]  They're probably government plants, because that is the only way the government can destroy sympathy for those of us who want to restore this country to the freedoms that we used to have.
[01:28:54.847 --> 01:29:01.872]  They're out there trying to convince you that terrorism, which is made by the government, is the justification to surrender your personal freedoms and rights.
[01:29:01.872 --> 01:29:03.594]  That's all they can think of selling you.
[01:29:03.914 --> 01:29:14.502]  Because as long as you have freedom of speech and you have the freedom to go out on the net and find information for yourself, the government is doomed because they've survived so long on lies, they don't have anything else to hold them up.
[01:29:14.502 --> 01:29:15.343]  Well, Mike, you're right.
[01:29:15.343 --> 01:29:18.646]  This is a 2 plus 2 equals 4 equation.
[01:29:18.646 --> 01:29:28.754]  If the whole economy's being converted to police and military and anti-terror, and private groups are making all the money off of it, who stands to gain to have terrorism?
[01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:29.354]  Kibono.
[01:29:29.354 --> 01:29:30.215]  Who benefits?
[01:29:30.215 --> 01:29:30.855]  Modem.
[01:29:30.855 --> 01:29:32.617]  And then you go look at the evidence, it's them.
[01:29:33.317 --> 01:29:33.397]  Yes.
[01:29:33.397 --> 01:29:42.362]  And so they're gonna stage attacks, they're gonna shoot people, they're gonna do all this, they're gonna do another Oklahoma City, I see that in the cards, unless we get the word out.
[01:29:42.362 --> 01:29:45.624]  But even if they do it, we just expose that event.
[01:29:45.624 --> 01:29:47.585]  They want it to be violent.
[01:29:47.585 --> 01:29:51.167]  That tells you you shouldn't be violent.
[01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:55.089]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:57.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.933 --> 01:30:03.955]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:03.955 --> 01:30:09.280]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.321]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.321 --> 01:30:16.325]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.325 --> 01:30:17.246]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.506 --> 01:30:18.627]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.627 --> 01:30:20.508]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.508 --> 01:30:21.589]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.589 --> 01:30:23.790]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.131]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.131 --> 01:30:26.652]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.652 --> 01:30:31.936]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:31.936 --> 01:30:35.518]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.518 --> 01:30:38.981]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.321 --> 01:30:40.541]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:41.462]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.462 --> 01:30:42.562]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:43.482]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.482 --> 01:30:44.583]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.583 --> 01:30:47.624]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:05.344]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.344 --> 01:31:09.870]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:12.153]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.153 --> 01:31:13.775]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.775 --> 01:31:14.817]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.037 --> 01:31:23.464]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:32:58.221 --> 01:32:59.501]  It cleans anything.
[01:33:02.749 --> 01:33:16.733]  A couple of announcements then we're going to take some of your calls and then get into Mike Rivero's expert take.
[01:33:16.733 --> 01:33:17.433]  He's one of the most
[01:33:25.236 --> 01:33:35.809]  Careful and thoughtful 9-11 investigators out there on the... So we'll get his take on the whole National Geographic hit piece last night that I didn't have time to watch the whole thing.
[01:33:35.809 --> 01:33:39.294]  I was busy working on the new film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:33:39.294 --> 01:33:41.336]  Speaking of films, you need to get...
[01:33:42.267 --> 01:33:47.911]  The most important film, the biggest film I've ever made, the Obama deception on DVD.
[01:33:47.911 --> 01:33:50.173]  And when you get it, make copies of it.
[01:33:50.173 --> 01:33:51.554]  You want to have a revolution?
[01:33:51.554 --> 01:33:53.095]  Buy a DVD burner.
[01:33:53.095 --> 01:33:56.077]  Buy a bunch of copies, a bunch of blank DVDs.
[01:33:56.077 --> 01:33:57.799]  Make a hundred.
[01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:03.463]  Make a copy or two every night, give them to friends, family, neighbors, put them on windshields of police cars.
[01:34:05.185 --> 01:34:07.486]  You know, give them to neighbors, whatever.
[01:34:07.486 --> 01:34:09.427]  This will break the left-right paradigm.
[01:34:09.427 --> 01:34:12.189]  They think they're watching an Obama film against Obama.
[01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:16.191]  They find out that it exposes Bush, Obama as just being frontman puppets.
[01:34:16.191 --> 01:34:19.192]  It shatters that left-right control system.
[01:34:19.192 --> 01:34:26.276]  High-quality DVD with the extras, and when you purchase the film, you support the radio show and the TV...
[01:34:27.336 --> 01:34:39.837]  Studios I'm building and the websites and the work we're doing that has huge cost associated with it as we try to up our game and do a better and better job for you out there, but
[01:34:40.714 --> 01:34:42.295]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:34:42.295 --> 01:34:44.956]  We're stepping up to the plate with our responsibility.
[01:34:44.956 --> 01:34:46.616]  We're asking you to support us.
[01:34:46.616 --> 01:34:51.619]  So, the Obama Deception on DVD available at InfoWars.com on the online shopping cart.
[01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:55.400]  Watch it in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.082]  And a new film that comes out in two weeks.
[01:34:59.082 --> 01:35:00.162]  You can pre-order it now.
[01:35:00.162 --> 01:35:01.863]  We'll be the first to be shipping this out.
[01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:07.632]  I've been given authorization to start shipping in a couple days before the 18th, so you get it on or around.
[01:35:07.632 --> 01:35:08.674]  It's Camp FEMA.
[01:35:08.674 --> 01:35:10.176]  I'm a consultant on it.
[01:35:10.176 --> 01:35:11.499]  I'm the most prominent voice in it.
[01:35:11.499 --> 01:35:12.801]  There's a lot of other great people in it.
[01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:20.058]  This is kind of the InfoWars-centric version of it, and so this trailer just came out yesterday.
[01:35:20.058 --> 01:35:21.799]  Here's the audio for RadioListers.
[01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:24.542]  Here's the video for PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[01:35:24.542 --> 01:35:30.927]  Here it is, Camp FEMA, available for pre-order right now, so you can get it first at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:35:30.927 --> 01:35:31.768]  Here it is.
[01:35:42.386 --> 01:35:46.308]  The elites have said that they want to have a final revolution.
[01:35:46.308 --> 01:35:49.110]  That they know the public's going to revolt against them.
[01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:53.852]  So that's why they've scientifically set up the surveillance grid, the cashless society.
[01:35:53.852 --> 01:36:02.998]  This whole continuity of government system is designed to suppress and control the people of America.
[01:36:02.998 --> 01:36:04.859]  My name is Sam Ozaki.
[01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:08.801]  I'm a native-born American citizen, Los Angeles, California.
[01:36:11.204 --> 01:36:23.658]  When Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, we were all rounded up like cattle and placed into America's concentration camps.
[01:36:23.658 --> 01:36:28.564]  In May 2007, President Bush signed the National Security Presidential Directive 51.
[01:36:28.564 --> 01:36:31.347]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.482]  They have a plan to provide for the continuity of government.
[01:36:35.482 --> 01:36:37.223]  They have such a plan.
[01:36:37.223 --> 01:36:41.625]  They introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate.
[01:36:41.625 --> 01:36:45.207]  But they said, don't worry, there's a detailed classified version.
[01:36:45.207 --> 01:36:46.228]  Army Regulation 210-35.
[01:36:46.228 --> 01:36:47.488]  Now, this was set up in 1986 secretly.
[01:36:54.005 --> 01:36:57.708]  And for 10 plus years, it was secret.
[01:36:57.708 --> 01:37:05.053]  And in 1997, Bill Clinton declassified this, and we were the first major radio show to cover it.
[01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:06.594]  Since then, it's been expanded.
[01:37:06.594 --> 01:37:16.762]  This lists 12 camps to hold American citizens that have been built by the United States Army.
[01:37:18.677 --> 01:37:24.701]  Beginning in October, the Army plans to station an active unit inside the United States.
[01:37:24.701 --> 01:37:31.866]  Under NORTHCOM, and under the new Homeland Brigade, it was first going to be 3,000, and then 20,000, and then 40,000.
[01:37:31.866 --> 01:37:38.310]  The 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq.
[01:37:39.090 --> 01:37:39.991]  All right, we've, uh...
[01:37:58.936 --> 01:38:02.597]  We've got the rest of the trailer up on InfoWars.com if you want to go see it.
[01:38:02.597 --> 01:38:07.498]  I want to go back to Mike Rivero, but Mike, I mean, we understand they're hiring provocateurs.
[01:38:07.498 --> 01:38:09.938]  We understand they're hiring white supremacists.
[01:38:09.938 --> 01:38:12.158]  We understand they're doing all this.
[01:38:12.158 --> 01:38:15.579]  Ford Foundation funds La Raza, that means for our race, everything.
[01:38:15.579 --> 01:38:17.479]  For those outside our race, nothing.
[01:38:17.479 --> 01:38:23.941]  They had the former Austin mayor, when he was mayor, get up and give a proclamation that Hispanics are the master race.
[01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:25.381]  I mean, I have the video of this.
[01:38:25.381 --> 01:38:26.001]  It's insane.
[01:38:26.981 --> 01:38:32.525]  So they want us all fighting with each other and they're just going to, I guess, continue to do it.
[01:38:32.525 --> 01:38:51.539]  I think the key here is we need citizens to go stake out these protests and in the Fed events and follow the troublemakers home and put them under full surveillance and shoot video of them and show that they're cops or that they're informants and follow them to the police station, follow them when they meet their handler.
[01:38:52.543 --> 01:38:57.407]  And then put it up on YouTube, do a report, and then we need to start arresting these people.
[01:38:57.407 --> 01:39:04.734]  I mean, don't the Denver cops that attacked the other Denver cops to try to blame it on the protesters last year, Denver Post admits, the police admit.
[01:39:04.734 --> 01:39:06.496]  I mean, shouldn't they go to jail?
[01:39:06.496 --> 01:39:08.778]  Shouldn't all these cops that do this go to jail, Mike?
[01:39:10.087 --> 01:39:11.147]  They don't seem to.
[01:39:11.147 --> 01:39:22.091]  I mean, we see cops committing these kind of provocations and somebody says, oh, this is for the good of the nation and national security and it serves a higher purpose and all of a sudden the court system turns a blind eye.
[01:39:22.091 --> 01:39:37.237]  I think anybody who still expects a fair administration of justice from the American legal system is living in a dream world because the American legal system is to basically keep the people down, to extract wealth from them, to justify corporate theft and government persecution.
[01:39:37.737 --> 01:39:42.859]  And anybody who commits a crime in the name of the government, basically they're allowed to get away with it.
[01:39:42.859 --> 01:39:49.162]  I mean, look at the free pass that's been given to all the people who are carrying out torture and other war crimes in Iraq.
[01:39:49.162 --> 01:39:50.403]  And nothing's going to happen to them.
[01:39:50.403 --> 01:39:51.963]  It's very obvious they're going to be protected.
[01:39:51.963 --> 01:39:55.445]  We've got Dick Cheney out there saying, yeah, we were out there doing all this stuff.
[01:39:55.445 --> 01:39:56.665]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:39:56.665 --> 01:39:58.686]  And that really is their attitude.
[01:39:58.686 --> 01:40:00.227]  And you're absolutely correct.
[01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:05.149]  Right now, the government is trying to create the illusion that those of us who want freedom
[01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:16.515]  Are the bad guys, that there's something wrong with us, that we don't trust big daddy government to look after our every single, you know, need and want.
[01:40:16.515 --> 01:40:18.416]  And no, we don't want that from the government.
[01:40:18.416 --> 01:40:19.496]  I want to be left alone.
[01:40:19.496 --> 01:40:25.079]  I want the government to go away and bother somebody else and just leave me alone to live out my life in peace.
[01:40:25.079 --> 01:40:26.760]  And we can't seem to get that.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.022]  Government seems to view it as its holy mission
[01:40:30.222 --> 01:40:34.425]  Handed down from whatever gods are up there in the sky or under the ground.
[01:40:34.425 --> 01:40:38.549]  That they're supposed to always expand and manage more and more of your life.
[01:40:38.549 --> 01:40:40.190]  And that is really the danger.
[01:40:40.190 --> 01:40:42.111]  Government never stops growing.
[01:40:42.111 --> 01:40:45.994]  There's always an unending supply of nieces and nephews who need a job.
[01:40:45.994 --> 01:40:53.961]  And so government will invent one more regulatory compliance that we're all... Until everything collapses and then they will literally put us in slave camps.
[01:40:55.097 --> 01:40:55.697]  Absolutely.
[01:40:55.697 --> 01:41:12.686]  I was watching a show about Russia last night, where the serf system was literally created by imperial decree to counter the fact that peasants were starting to leave the lands held by the nobles and go to cities, try and find jobs, and try and improve their life.
[01:41:12.686 --> 01:41:15.067]  How dare the serfs improve their lives?
[01:41:15.067 --> 01:41:23.831]  We're going to lock them on the land, they become the property of the nobility, and that created the serf system in Russia, which of course ultimately led to the Communist Revolution.
[01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:24.552]  And by the way,
[01:41:24.992 --> 01:41:29.016]  And the bankers knew the serfs were going to rebel, so they created a false vow.
[01:41:29.016 --> 01:41:31.338]  That's all been declassified and admitted as well.
[01:41:31.338 --> 01:41:37.725]  The Bank of England, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, same companies, all funded the Bolsheviks.
[01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:40.748]  It was just a takeover from one group of thugs to another.
[01:41:40.748 --> 01:41:43.511]  The British cousins knocked off their cousins.
[01:41:43.511 --> 01:41:46.393]  When you read the Club of Rome, David Rockefeller, their own books,
[01:41:47.074 --> 01:41:54.463]  Like the memoir he wrote in 2004, they admit they want, in their own words, a neo-feudal serf system.
[01:41:54.463 --> 01:41:56.005]  That's what they want.
[01:41:56.005 --> 01:41:58.268]  And they're going to license how many kids we have.
[01:41:58.268 --> 01:42:00.832]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:42:00.832 --> 01:42:03.275]  And until people start saying no, it's only going to get worse.
[01:42:04.537 --> 01:42:17.426]  Well the problem with people who feel that there should be leaders in the world is they often see themselves as the leaders and inevitably they think they should be in charge of absolutely everything because they know better.
[01:42:17.426 --> 01:42:28.253]  People who aspire to high positions of power will justify their criminal actions and their abuse of people by saying it serves a higher and nobler purpose which is embodied through them.
[01:42:28.253 --> 01:42:31.695]  That ultimately they are the hope for a better world of tomorrow.
[01:42:31.695 --> 01:42:32.756]  I mean even Adolf Hitler
[01:42:32.796 --> 01:42:32.956]  I don't
[01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:57.431]  Say, okay, we won't make that mistake again.
[01:42:57.431 --> 01:42:58.572]  So they're always learning.
[01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:04.637]  I mean, for 2,000 years, they have been developing the skills and means to control the population.
[01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:08.260]  The arrival of the Internet completely derailed all of that.
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.643]  That's why you've got Jay Rockefeller out there saying he wished it had never been invented.
[01:43:12.063 --> 01:43:18.027]  Because they had gotten used to being able to use the corporate media to lie us into whatever direction they wanted to go.
[01:43:18.027 --> 01:43:21.689]  We need to invade Iraq, we'll tell them about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:43:21.689 --> 01:43:24.811]  We need to invade these people, we'll tell them about biological weapons.
[01:43:24.811 --> 01:43:30.415]  We need to invade these people over here, we'll do a concocted story about stolen incubators and dead premature babies.
[01:43:30.415 --> 01:43:34.357]  They were used to doing that because during the 1950s and 60s, it worked!
[01:43:34.357 --> 01:43:39.421]  We believed everything the corporate media and government told us about those gosh darn commies.
[01:43:39.981 --> 01:43:50.637]  And we fell for it, and we paid trillions of dollars for the world's largest nuclear arsenal, for the only country on earth to actually use nuclear weapons on another country, the United States of America.
[01:43:50.637 --> 01:43:52.039]  And meanwhile, it turned out...
[01:43:52.782 --> 01:43:58.165]  That the whole time, the big industries here were supplying the Russians with everything.
[01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:03.488]  The whole Lend-Lease program, the whole Weaponize program, it never ended.
[01:44:03.488 --> 01:44:12.053]  The Ford and Chevy trucks were being shipped over to then be shipped to Vietnam to fight, because the globalists made money on both ends.
[01:44:12.933 --> 01:44:17.877]  And the sooner we realize that paradigm, the better it'll be for all of us.
[01:44:17.877 --> 01:44:25.842]  I want to go to some calls, because I want to spend some time getting into the whole 9-11 hit piece last night, because I take it, Mike, you saw the whole thing?
[01:44:25.842 --> 01:44:26.723]  I saw part of it.
[01:44:26.723 --> 01:44:29.265]  I kind of got sick of it partway through and changed channels.
[01:44:29.265 --> 01:44:31.026]  Yeah, yeah, I couldn't watch it.
[01:44:31.026 --> 01:44:34.048]  I mean, I literally saw him shoot a missile into a chicken coop.
[01:44:34.048 --> 01:44:36.230]  I mean, it was a fiberglass chicken coop that thick.
[01:44:37.213 --> 01:44:38.034]  I mean, I've seen
[01:44:53.988 --> 01:45:01.254]  Thermite reactions on TV were a cup of real thermite heat straight through a big block engine.
[01:45:01.254 --> 01:45:07.339]  They supposedly put hundreds of pounds of thermite around a column, set it on fire, and nothing happens.
[01:45:07.339 --> 01:45:09.241]  Total crap!
[01:45:10.123 --> 01:45:13.125]  I mean, just, just, just, in fact, we can make the video.
[01:45:13.125 --> 01:45:13.886]  I just don't have the time.
[01:45:13.886 --> 01:45:15.427]  I'm busy doing all this other stuff.
[01:45:15.427 --> 01:45:16.628]  But it's all over.
[01:45:16.628 --> 01:45:19.711]  In fact, Google thermite reaction on YouTube.
[01:45:19.711 --> 01:45:21.792]  Just search engine the term thermite.
[01:45:21.792 --> 01:45:23.533]  Thermite on engine.
[01:45:23.533 --> 01:45:28.257]  A small cup of it on engine eats through the whole engine in seconds.
[01:45:28.257 --> 01:45:33.862]  But then you look at, you look at this show, they dump giant amount, but it's thermite they made.
[01:45:34.787 --> 01:45:37.817]  They made, so they made some fake thermite.
[01:45:37.817 --> 01:45:41.107]  I mean, these shows are just, they're blowing up chicken coops now, Mike?
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:53.989]  Well, one of the ones that I did see is they went in and they did a controlled demolition on a building and then they walked back through and they said, see if there'd been a controlled demolition, we would see all this pieces of debt cord all over the place.
[01:45:53.989 --> 01:45:59.794]  And that's utter nonsense because debt cord, when it fires off, it completely consumes itself.
[01:45:59.794 --> 01:46:06.200]  And there's these scraps of unused debt cord in the ruins of this building and they're saying, see, this proves there couldn't have been a controlled demolition.
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:07.721]  It was an expression of panic.
[01:46:08.241 --> 01:46:09.743]  It was an expression of panic.
[01:46:09.743 --> 01:46:11.484]  I don't think it convinced anybody.
[01:46:11.484 --> 01:46:14.807]  In fact, they were so obvious and heavy-handed about the cover-up.
[01:46:14.807 --> 01:46:19.311]  I think, if anything, it's probably convinced a lot more people that something is... Mike, don't tell them.
[01:46:19.311 --> 01:46:21.813]  Mike, Mike, we want them to continue the hit pieces.
[01:46:21.813 --> 01:46:23.415]  Please don't let them in on the secret.
[01:46:23.415 --> 01:46:26.057]  But this is only helping us wake everybody up.
[01:46:26.057 --> 01:46:26.738]  I know.
[01:46:26.738 --> 01:46:29.060]  I was watching it and I was like, is this a joke?
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.443]  And that woman's voice, and she would go, the truthers.
[01:46:33.443 --> 01:46:40.848]  Literally, the truthers, like the aliens, the, you know, the demons, the vampires.
[01:46:40.848 --> 01:46:42.009]  It was really a pathetic show.
[01:46:42.924 --> 01:46:44.005]  It was.
[01:46:44.005 --> 01:46:44.546]  It was.
[01:46:44.546 --> 01:46:46.267]  And they know it's all about presentation.
[01:46:46.267 --> 01:46:51.392]  They would have the names of the good guys that lead the government real small, concise, exact.
[01:46:51.392 --> 01:46:55.356]  Then what truth or it'd all be crooked and off the side and messed up.
[01:46:55.356 --> 01:46:59.320]  Knowing that if names are messed up, that makes people not like it.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.343]  I mean, just basic tricks they used.
[01:47:02.343 --> 01:47:03.244]  The language of film.
[01:47:05.762 --> 01:47:12.904]  Yeah, I mean, they take film students that couldn't get a job and I guess these guys want to make a couple hundred thousand a year so they would sell their mother out for it.
[01:47:12.904 --> 01:47:21.705]  I mean, that JFK thing they did where it shows the green jelly and shooting the head and it's from totally different spots than where the shooters were at and it's totally fake.
[01:47:21.705 --> 01:47:27.947]  I mean, there's no, I mean, listen though, Mike, I've never seen a hit piece this flimsy.
[01:47:27.947 --> 01:47:32.928]  I almost thought like they were secretly on our side and trying to screw themselves up.
[01:47:36.345 --> 01:47:39.687]  Just lost Rivero with our connection to Hawaii.
[01:47:39.687 --> 01:47:42.748]  Let's start going to calls while we're getting Mike back on with us.
[01:47:42.748 --> 01:47:44.329]  Dwayne in California.
[01:47:44.329 --> 01:47:46.329]  Dwayne, you're on the air.
[01:47:46.329 --> 01:47:48.570]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you again.
[01:47:48.570 --> 01:48:03.057]  I didn't realize, I didn't see that hit piece last night, but I've done a lot of research on the 9-11 project and information on concentration and FEMA camps even prior to the 2000 election with George W. Bush.
[01:48:04.048 --> 01:48:06.090]  And so I had a lot of information.
[01:48:06.090 --> 01:48:07.511]  I was researching at that time.
[01:48:07.511 --> 01:48:10.513]  Got a lot of it off of your website, in fact.
[01:48:10.513 --> 01:48:22.501]  One thing I didn't mention last time I called, when you were talking about the swine flu vaccinations, that when I took that vaccination in 1976, I was a linguist with the U.S.
[01:48:22.501 --> 01:48:23.142]  Army.
[01:48:23.142 --> 01:48:32.308]  I was part of the Army Security Agency, which I later found out was a division of the National Security Agency.
[01:48:32.308 --> 01:48:33.609]  So that was kind of an eye-opener.
[01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:54.516]  And in addition, I have seen a lot of things on your website and other places that have opened my eyes to so much that the government is trying to blind us to, or make us believers of, that it's all a false paradigm.
[01:48:54.516 --> 01:48:58.597]  I was listening to Mike Ribeiro, and I agree with a lot that he said.
[01:48:58.597 --> 01:49:03.019]  Stephen Jones in particular, I was watching some of his information.
[01:49:04.209 --> 01:49:17.319]  From your website about the 9-11 attacks and how the thermite reaction brought down the Twin Towers, because I never believed that it could fall straight down like that unless there was some sort of thermite reaction.
[01:49:19.158 --> 01:49:20.419]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[01:49:20.419 --> 01:49:21.499]  Here's the Progressive.
[01:49:21.499 --> 01:49:23.441]  The AP also reported it.
[01:49:23.441 --> 01:49:28.243]  The Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[01:49:28.243 --> 01:49:30.445]  for emergencies and homeland security.
[01:49:30.445 --> 01:49:46.875]  The DHS own internal reports that we released say that their main battle force is designed and is set up to engage the American people in combat operations and for civil unrest and then
[01:49:48.214 --> 01:49:53.761]  They try to run around and deny that this even exists or is real.
[01:49:53.761 --> 01:49:56.043]  Let's bring Mike Rivero back up, who's with us.
[01:49:56.043 --> 01:49:58.046]  Mike, I mean, how long is this going to work?
[01:49:58.046 --> 01:50:06.215]  It's kind of like all these big Soros, Rockefeller Foundation groups
[01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:19.024]  Media Matters and others are saying I'm a liar, there's no plan for National Compulsory Service when he's giving speeches, the President, his Chief of Staff, and they've introduced the bills.
[01:50:19.024 --> 01:50:22.650]  I mean, how long can they just bald-faced lie and get away with it, Mike?
[01:50:23.553 --> 01:50:25.275]  Well, that's a two-part question.
[01:50:25.275 --> 01:50:28.437]  They're going to go online because they don't know other way to operate right now.
[01:50:28.437 --> 01:50:30.139]  They've been doing it for so long.
[01:50:30.139 --> 01:50:31.480]  How long can they get away with it?
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.221]  I don't think they're getting away with it right now.
[01:50:33.221 --> 01:50:38.526]  I mean, that's certainly the sense I get from the people who write into my website, who listen to your show.
[01:50:38.526 --> 01:50:43.230]  I think most Americans do know they're being lied to on a pretty much continuing basis.
[01:50:43.230 --> 01:50:47.314]  I think most Americans have come to understand we're the most lied to people on the face of the earth.
[01:50:47.834 --> 01:50:55.276]  I think the reason the government is in panic mode is they understand the lies don't work anymore, but they don't know what to do.
[01:50:55.276 --> 01:50:56.697]  They can't start telling the truth.
[01:50:56.697 --> 01:50:58.457]  They've told way too many lies.
[01:50:58.457 --> 01:50:59.718]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:50:59.718 --> 01:51:01.658]  Stay there.
[01:51:01.658 --> 01:51:03.839]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[01:51:03.839 --> 01:51:10.961]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on Earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.

[01:52:01.008 --> 01:52:06.732]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:52:06.732 --> 01:52:08.052]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:08.052 --> 01:52:10.054]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.054 --> 01:52:17.078]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.078 --> 01:52:23.822]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:25.650]  We're safe to breathe.
[01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:28.333]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:28.333 --> 01:52:31.458]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:52:42.012 --> 01:52:45.096]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:52:54.086 --> 01:52:59.012]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.

[01:53:43.177 --> 01:53:45.338]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:45.338 --> 01:53:46.679]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:56.097 --> 01:54:58.158]  Oh, I'm late getting into my chair here.
[01:54:58.158 --> 01:55:00.018]  I apologize to everyone.
[01:55:00.018 --> 01:55:03.019]  So much going on behind the scenes during the breaks.
[01:55:03.019 --> 01:55:04.319]  People coming into the office.
[01:55:04.319 --> 01:55:06.900]  Mike Rivera with us for a little bit in the next hour.
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.081]  Then I'm going to launch into how they're demonizing the militia and everybody else.
[01:55:11.081 --> 01:55:12.802]  In fact, here's an example.
[01:55:12.802 --> 01:55:18.984]  Colorado GOP calls for an apology for Democratic office vandalism.
[01:55:18.984 --> 01:55:23.465]  Turns out someone who worked for the Democratic Party went and attacked the Democratic offices.
[01:55:26.328 --> 01:55:41.682]  I mean, I haven't seen a case where a political office gets vandalized or where a swastika gets painted on a door where it isn't someone doing it for attention, whether they're black or Jewish or the Democratic Party.
[01:55:41.682 --> 01:55:43.543]  I mean, this just doesn't exist.
[01:55:45.202 --> 01:55:46.642]  I mean, I've never seen it.
[01:55:46.642 --> 01:55:56.704]  Mike Rivero, I mean, it's like finding a tooth fairy or a unicorn to actually find a real attack on the Democratic Party.
[01:55:56.704 --> 01:55:58.684]  Von Brun clearly was working for them.
[01:55:58.684 --> 01:56:06.566]  He'd been in federal custody in a mental institution for years with that other fake mental institution event with the dynamite he did at the Federal Reserve in 88.
[01:56:06.566 --> 01:56:09.006]  I mean, I've never seen a case.
[01:56:09.006 --> 01:56:12.627]  But here it is, Denver Post totally staged Mike Rivero.
[01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:28.061]  Well, I have come to the conclusion, I mean, the few times they actually catch the perpetrators of hate crimes, I mean, 99% of the time, it turns out to be a hoax to generate political sympathy or to build political support for a particular agenda.
[01:56:28.061 --> 01:56:42.812]  I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that there may not be any real genuine acts of terror in the world, because when somebody wants to effect a change, they need public support, and acts of terror destroy public support for whoever is blamed on them.
[01:56:43.132 --> 01:56:57.324]  So just like we had Israel that staged the hijacking and the raid on Entebbe to destroy sympathy for the Palestinians, I'm starting to reach the point where I think any time there's a hate crime or an act of terror, it's more than likely going to be a fraud.
[01:56:57.324 --> 01:57:00.867]  Somebody's being framed in order to make them look bad.
[01:57:00.867 --> 01:57:10.255]  I mean, just as we're seeing the government plant agent provocateurs within protests and the anti-war movement and the truther movement in order to make us look bad, it's all a hoax.
[01:57:10.255 --> 01:57:11.736]  It's government by deception.
[01:57:12.136 --> 01:57:14.298]  Well, they're stealing trillions of dollars a month.
[01:57:14.298 --> 01:57:20.103]  They're going to have to commit crimes to blame them on us so they can use their force against us.
[01:57:20.103 --> 01:57:22.064]  They built a military force up.
[01:57:22.064 --> 01:57:30.071]  They've got to stage military attacks to say we're a military enemy so they can have the rules of engagement to go up against us.
[01:57:30.071 --> 01:57:38.538]  You know, I thought about the film, what, Five Days in September, won an Academy Award about the hostage crisis at the Munich Games.
[01:57:39.238 --> 01:57:46.404]  And at the end of the film, they have the head of German intelligence just come out and admit, oh yeah, we staged all this.
[01:57:46.404 --> 01:57:51.328]  And then to let the Palestinians go, we staged a hijacking of a jet to let them go.
[01:57:51.328 --> 01:57:59.135]  And they just admit it like it's no big deal that they, I mean, it's, and no one gets in trouble.
[01:57:59.135 --> 01:58:01.117]  It's like, yeah, we staged it all.
[01:58:01.117 --> 01:58:02.257]  Ha ha, it's funny.
[01:58:03.717 --> 01:58:04.658]  Yeah, it is.
[01:58:04.658 --> 01:58:06.580]  It's all image manipulation.
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:09.283]  It's all manipulation of the people using the press.
[01:58:09.283 --> 01:58:10.984]  It's all for show.
[01:58:10.984 --> 01:58:13.707]  It's like during the first Iraq war.
[01:58:13.707 --> 01:58:19.513]  That whole thing about the nurse crying at the UN, they were stealing the incubators, leaving the premature babies to die.
[01:58:19.513 --> 01:58:20.494]  It was all a hoax.
[01:58:21.134 --> 01:58:24.035]  It is all government-by-deception.
[01:58:24.035 --> 01:58:25.395]  And here's the situation.
[01:58:25.395 --> 01:58:30.797]  The analogy I like to use is the Internet is the modern equivalent of Gutenberg's movable type printing.
[01:58:30.797 --> 01:58:38.719]  If you go back and you look at the social upheaval that attended the publication of inexpensive, easy-to-afford books... Stay there!
[01:58:38.719 --> 01:58:42.360]  We gotta finish on the other side.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:46.021]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.021 --> 01:58:47.862]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.469 --> 01:58:54.713]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.713 --> 01:58:56.715]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.715 --> 01:59:05.244]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.244 --> 01:59:10.789]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.789 --> 01:59:12.411]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.651 --> 01:59:19.153]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.153 --> 01:59:30.215]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.215 --> 01:59:30.976]  That's right.
[01:59:30.976 --> 01:59:33.536]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.536 --> 01:59:35.117]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:59:37.077 --> 01:59:37.697]  We're good to go.
[02:00:05.316 --> 02:00:10.140]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:11.741]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:13.282]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.282 --> 02:00:17.485]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.485 --> 02:00:25.390]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:28.493]  Mike Rivera will be with us for another 20 minutes, then I'm going to play
[02:00:29.927 --> 02:00:41.276]  Most of this 13-minute video, internal FBI training video, and how it ties in to the provocateurs, the police state, the Stasi tattletale system.
[02:00:41.276 --> 02:00:42.337]  That's coming up.
[02:00:42.337 --> 02:00:44.379]  We're continuing with your calls.
[02:00:44.379 --> 02:00:47.681]  Mike, you were trying to talk about the Gutenberg printable type.
[02:00:47.681 --> 02:00:49.643]  They tried to suppress it 500 years ago.
[02:00:49.643 --> 02:00:51.445]  It didn't work.
[02:00:51.445 --> 02:00:53.466]  I would say the Internet's a bigger development from that.
[02:00:53.466 --> 02:00:57.489]  You know, we know what the NSA and DARPA said back in the 70s.
[02:00:57.489 --> 02:00:59.071]  They called it worldwide wiretap.
[02:01:00.416 --> 02:01:05.821]  WWDOT was the joke because they were going to track, trace, have global commerce controlled by it.
[02:01:05.821 --> 02:01:09.665]  And they're still using it as that double-edged sword overconfidently.
[02:01:09.665 --> 02:01:16.091]  We hope they continue to be overconfident so they don't shut it down too quickly because we know they're moving towards it regardless.
[02:01:16.091 --> 02:01:19.314]  But now they're starting to lose their arrogance, which means they're more on their game.
[02:01:19.314 --> 02:01:19.974]  That's dangerous.
[02:01:19.974 --> 02:01:20.975]  I like the arrogance.
[02:01:20.975 --> 02:01:23.878]  I like the imperial hubris, but you can speak to that.
[02:01:25.711 --> 02:01:31.878]  Well, basically, in a nutshell, they have discovered that there is simply too much going on on the net.
[02:01:31.878 --> 02:01:33.159]  They can't track it all.
[02:01:33.159 --> 02:01:34.761]  They can't monitor it all.
[02:01:34.761 --> 02:01:41.468]  Yes, they could probably keep an eye on certain individuals like you or I, but they just can't keep track of everything going on.
[02:01:41.468 --> 02:01:44.351]  And their concern now is not with any one individual.
[02:01:44.751 --> 02:01:52.837]  Because the anger and disenfranchisement with the American people has reached the point where the number of people who are unhappy with the government numbers in the hundreds of millions.
[02:01:52.837 --> 02:01:54.738]  They can't watch them all.
[02:01:54.738 --> 02:01:56.159]  They can't store it all.
[02:01:56.159 --> 02:01:58.681]  More importantly, they can't correlate the data.
[02:01:58.681 --> 02:02:04.986]  The tools to analyze the intercepts and everything simply are not adequate to the task.
[02:02:04.986 --> 02:02:07.468]  It's like coming home and having 20,000 voicemails.
[02:02:07.468 --> 02:02:10.970]  Even the stuff that gets flagged per operative, it's in the tens of thousands.
[02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:12.951]  It's got to be, if you look at all the evidence.
[02:02:14.514 --> 02:02:22.762]  I hope the establishment doesn't try to stage terror attacks or stage rioting because I think it's just going to get out of control and the cops are just going to stand down.
[02:02:22.762 --> 02:02:24.803]  I think the cops more and more on our side, Mike.
[02:02:25.692 --> 02:02:26.092]  I agree.
[02:02:49.013 --> 02:02:54.821]  I have all these macho guys constantly on my website, guaranteed they're feds and provocateurs, or they'd be arrested for what they're doing.
[02:02:54.821 --> 02:02:58.547]  The feds would send me a subpoena and, you know, the FBI would show up if they were real.
[02:02:58.547 --> 02:02:59.789]  Go, you're a wimp, Alex.
[02:02:59.789 --> 02:03:01.191]  You're not calling for violence.
[02:03:01.191 --> 02:03:03.213]  You know, is there something wrong with you?
[02:03:03.213 --> 02:03:04.015]  You're a bad guy.
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:07.903]  And you get that too.
[02:03:07.903 --> 02:03:12.167]  And these are total tough guy feds, or they're idiots being handled by the feds.
[02:03:12.167 --> 02:03:13.808]  And I'm not buying any of their crap.
[02:03:13.808 --> 02:03:21.375]  I mean, here's the Denver Post with Democratic Party workers attacking their own facility to blame it on enemies of Obamacare.
[02:03:21.375 --> 02:03:23.217]  This is false flag terror.
[02:03:23.217 --> 02:03:27.160]  And I've got a whole stack here of mainstream news about all the neo-Nazis.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.281]  Every group are feds.
[02:03:28.982 --> 02:03:32.645]  Southern Power of Law Center running Elohim City and the White Supremacists.
[02:03:32.645 --> 02:03:35.047]  Hal Turner, the top Nazi.
[02:03:35.047 --> 02:03:36.388]  A Fed.
[02:03:36.388 --> 02:03:38.350]  I mean, you're just all Feds.
[02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:40.752]  And we're going to expose you.
[02:03:40.752 --> 02:03:44.995]  The government has to create the enemies that it uses to scare us into obedience.
[02:03:44.995 --> 02:03:53.102]  If there were no enemies, if there, you know, after the Soviet Union fell is really when trust and blind faith in the American government began to erode.
[02:03:53.102 --> 02:03:55.263]  Because we were expecting a peace dividend.
[02:03:55.263 --> 02:03:57.025]  And no, we couldn't have a peace dividend.
[02:03:57.025 --> 02:03:58.106]  We've got to have more war.
[02:03:58.626 --> 02:03:59.666]  Well, we're tired of being afraid.
[02:03:59.666 --> 02:04:01.307]  A government that uses fear to control its people
[02:04:24.776 --> 02:04:26.798]  And there's also this whole line put out by them.
[02:04:48.907 --> 02:04:51.728]  That everything will fall apart if we don't have this corrupt system.
[02:04:51.728 --> 02:04:58.292]  No, this is a parasitic system that's waging war against reality, against the free market, against Main Street.
[02:04:58.292 --> 02:04:58.792]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.792 --> 02:05:00.533]  Your call is straight ahead.
[02:05:00.533 --> 02:05:01.933]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.933 --> 02:05:03.914]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[02:05:03.914 --> 02:05:04.915]  Well, you should.
[02:05:04.915 --> 02:05:09.377]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:05:09.377 --> 02:05:09.837]  That's right.
[02:05:10.197 --> 02:05:20.203]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:05:20.203 --> 02:05:27.548]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:05:27.548 --> 02:05:34.452]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:05:34.452 --> 02:05:39.635]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:05:39.955 --> 02:05:41.415]  This is real.
[02:05:41.415 --> 02:05:42.456]  Don't miss out.
[02:05:42.456 --> 02:05:51.038]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[02:05:51.038 --> 02:05:53.398]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:05:53.398 --> 02:05:57.099]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:05:57.099 --> 02:06:00.000]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:05.743]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:31.120]  We're good.
[02:07:01.087 --> 02:07:04.110]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:09.435]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.435 --> 02:07:11.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.476 --> 02:07:16.481]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.481 --> 02:07:17.422]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.662 --> 02:07:18.783]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.783 --> 02:07:20.665]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.665 --> 02:07:21.746]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.746 --> 02:07:23.948]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.948 --> 02:07:25.289]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.289 --> 02:07:26.810]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:32.075]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.075 --> 02:07:35.218]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.658 --> 02:07:39.481]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.481 --> 02:07:40.702]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.702 --> 02:07:41.603]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.603 --> 02:07:42.704]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.704 --> 02:07:43.644]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.644 --> 02:07:44.745]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.745 --> 02:07:47.788]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.788 --> 02:07:50.910]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:51.691]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:00.993 --> 02:08:12.920]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:30.191]  Okay, what I'm going to do coming up in the next segment is I'm going to start just playing this FBI training video, and then after we're done analyzing it in this state of fear that's making the American people the enemy, then we'll go into the real history of the FBI, the real history of the Feds, and what they're really doing so you understand
[02:08:31.383 --> 02:08:32.203]  What's really going on?
[02:08:32.203 --> 02:08:39.345]  And how they want to make us violent, they want to provocateur, they want to cause that to happen.
[02:08:39.345 --> 02:08:49.388]  We're also going to have HDTV, Mark Cuban's TV network station, in here filming what I'm saying and doing, so that should be interesting.
[02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:53.089]  They look like nice folks, look like they're on a rabbit hunt in here.
[02:08:53.089 --> 02:08:53.889]  Let's go ahead and...
[02:08:55.612 --> 02:08:59.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Maryland.
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.804]  Chris, you're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[02:09:01.804 --> 02:09:02.164]  Go ahead.
[02:09:03.021 --> 02:09:05.143]  Hey gentlemen, good to hear you.
[02:09:05.143 --> 02:09:18.092]  I'm just reading on the internet from various sources here that we need to, that I see that they're trying to divide and conquer possibly us, but the people themselves from getting the real news.
[02:09:18.092 --> 02:09:25.638]  It says Senators Jay Rockefeller and Olympia Snowe have reintroduced Bill S-773 to give Obama
[02:09:28.619 --> 02:09:35.629]  Tell you what, do me a big favor and turn your radio off, number one.
[02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:37.371]  So I can actually hear what you're saying.
[02:09:37.371 --> 02:09:39.535]  You prefaced that with trying to divide us.
[02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:47.355]  And I get these nonsensical emails every day, why aren't you covering the Cybersecurity Act?
[02:09:47.355 --> 02:09:52.999]  We're really the first to be covering it in the last couple years, since I saw the Pentagon proposing it.
[02:09:52.999 --> 02:09:57.402]  And it's actually in my last Obama film, and we just covered it last hour.
[02:09:57.402 --> 02:09:58.823]  You're asking what I thought of that.
[02:09:58.823 --> 02:09:59.924]  Did you just tune in, Chris?
[02:10:01.204 --> 02:10:05.926]  Um, well, yeah, because, I'm sorry, I had my speaker phone on, so I apologize for that.
[02:10:05.926 --> 02:10:08.727]  No, no, that's okay, but you, I'm trying to understand the question.
[02:10:08.727 --> 02:10:11.028]  You prefaced it with him trying to divide us.
[02:10:11.028 --> 02:10:15.289]  Yes, um, most of the attacks we get are just nonsensical.
[02:10:15.289 --> 02:10:17.730]  It's like, why don't you expose Masons?
[02:10:17.730 --> 02:10:18.431]  We do.
[02:10:18.431 --> 02:10:20.291]  Why don't you expose corruption in the Catholic Church?
[02:10:20.291 --> 02:10:20.892]  We do.
[02:10:20.892 --> 02:10:22.672]  Why don't you expose corruption in the Protestant Church?
[02:10:22.672 --> 02:10:23.493]  We do.
[02:10:23.493 --> 02:10:25.073]  Why don't you expose corruption in Israel?
[02:10:25.073 --> 02:10:25.513]  We do.
[02:10:25.513 --> 02:10:28.455]  Uh, why are you covering up 9-11?
[02:10:28.455 --> 02:10:29.615]  Why are you not covering it?
[02:10:29.995 --> 02:10:33.097]  We are the progenitors of it, of exposing it.
[02:10:33.097 --> 02:10:35.839]  So yes, but I mean really, people should ignore that.
[02:10:35.839 --> 02:10:39.902]  The establishment just wants to get us all fighting with each other in a melu.
[02:10:42.130 --> 02:10:47.875]  In this big melee, so that we don't go forward and reach out to other people with mainline stuff.
[02:10:47.875 --> 02:10:52.359]  So that when we go and talk to our neighbors, we're gibbering about weird fringe stuff.
[02:10:52.359 --> 02:10:54.481]  Instead of, hey, do you know the Federal Reserve is private?
[02:10:54.481 --> 02:10:57.904]  Did you know it stole 23 plus trillion?
[02:10:57.904 --> 02:11:00.006]  Did you know that they're setting up a world government?
[02:11:00.006 --> 02:11:06.831]  Did you know that the White House science czar wrote a government policy book about how they're drugging the water and want to take our children at birth and eradicate the family?
[02:11:07.472 --> 02:11:08.953]  Put implantable chips in us.
[02:11:08.953 --> 02:11:18.041]  Hey, do you know the Wall Street Journal's reporting that they want to terraform the planet and to reduce world population and engineering Earth is feasible.
[02:11:18.041 --> 02:11:21.664]  BBC News, how they're chemtrailing us.
[02:11:21.664 --> 02:11:24.286]  I mean, see, I appreciate your call.
[02:11:24.286 --> 02:11:26.028]  Mike Rivera, you want to comment on what he was saying?
[02:11:27.085 --> 02:11:29.048]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:30.390]  I want to comment on what you were saying.
[02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:31.772]  You're absolutely right.
[02:11:31.772 --> 02:11:35.137]  The government is out there trying to keep us fighting amongst each other.
[02:11:35.137 --> 02:11:42.227]  It's called divide and conquer, whether it's the young against the old, men against women, black against white, rich against poor, 9-11 truther against government supporter.
[02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:48.330]  The idea is that we're kept in little tiny fragments of society squabbling amongst each other.
[02:11:48.330 --> 02:11:58.034]  What the government is most terrified of right now is that we, the American people, are waking up to the fact that we are just one American people.
[02:11:58.034 --> 02:12:07.618]  And if we actually come together with a single idea in mind, which is that the government is the source of all of our problems, then the government knows it's going to be finished.
[02:12:07.618 --> 02:12:09.899]  And they're trying to find some way to prevent that from happening.
[02:12:10.299 --> 02:12:29.763]  And the government plan is to make government so big, destroy the free market, destroy private property, destroy self-sufficiency so bad that they'll have a giant hundred million person army of total moron TV watching welfare check cashing fluoride heads that they can point as a weapon at anyone that doesn't serve them.
[02:12:29.763 --> 02:12:35.225]  And they plan to employ all this scum and all this weak-minded people to serve them.
[02:12:35.225 --> 02:12:35.745]  But, you know,
[02:12:36.625 --> 02:12:39.947]  I have a higher view of the American people than the elite do.
[02:12:39.947 --> 02:12:44.150]  I think folks are waking up across the board and I just don't see it working.
[02:12:44.150 --> 02:12:49.213]  I see them staging terror attacks, a new Oklahoma City to try to blame on us.
[02:12:49.213 --> 02:12:51.514]  But this isn't 1995, is it Mike?
[02:12:51.514 --> 02:12:53.075]  That isn't going to work.
[02:12:53.075 --> 02:12:53.616]  No, it isn't.
[02:12:53.616 --> 02:12:54.256]  No, it isn't.
[02:12:54.256 --> 02:12:56.077]  The old methods just don't work.
[02:12:56.077 --> 02:12:57.278]  They're not getting it.
[02:12:57.278 --> 02:13:05.303]  That is our biggest hope for the future, is the people who are in charge of the government and the intelligence agencies really are a bunch of old Cold War fossils.
[02:13:05.623 --> 02:13:07.124]  They're just like Jay Rockefeller.
[02:13:07.124 --> 02:13:10.947]  They wish the internet would go away, but they don't know how to deal with it.
[02:13:10.947 --> 02:13:18.552]  They don't understand that the world in which governments could lie to their people on such a scale simply does not exist anymore.
[02:13:18.552 --> 02:13:29.499]  And if they persist in playing the game as if it does, sooner or later they're going to commit an error, a lie, or an act so great they will not be able to quell the public backlash.
[02:13:29.499 --> 02:13:29.960]  Well, I mean...
[02:13:30.808 --> 02:13:34.830]  Eighty-four percent in a New York Times poll believe they're being lied to about 9-11.
[02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:39.994]  So, everybody knows about Gulf of Tonkin, they know about Ajax, they know about all this now.
[02:13:39.994 --> 02:13:43.676]  The Army field manuals, how to stage terror attacks are public.
[02:13:43.676 --> 02:13:45.177]  I mean, it's over for them.
[02:13:45.177 --> 02:13:50.660]  And they may buy some time staging terror attacks, but it's only going to make it worse.
[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:57.924]  And if I was a Fed and wasn't part of this, I wouldn't put my kids in federal daycare centers, because the Feds will target daycare centers.
[02:13:57.924 --> 02:13:59.866]  They want the image of bloody children.
[02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:04.732]  And so, to the feds out there, if they kill your kid, I'm your friend.
[02:14:04.732 --> 02:14:05.793]  I tried to warn you.
[02:14:05.793 --> 02:14:07.715]  Okay?
[02:14:07.715 --> 02:14:10.759]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:14:10.759 --> 02:14:11.801]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:11.801 --> 02:14:13.623]  The government has no loyalty.
[02:14:13.623 --> 02:14:15.606]  They will kill their own to make a point.
[02:14:15.606 --> 02:14:16.246]  They always have.
[02:14:17.369 --> 02:14:19.990]  Well, that's simple chess.
[02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:21.931]  That's simple using a pawn in a sacrifice.
[02:14:21.931 --> 02:14:27.033]  101 at West Point is how to send in a group that you know is going to get wiped out to draw out the enemy.
[02:14:27.033 --> 02:14:28.974]  That's just military terminology.
[02:14:28.974 --> 02:14:37.958]  And the public needs to get their mind around how the world really works instead of living at a third grade level.
[02:14:37.958 --> 02:14:39.679]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:14:39.679 --> 02:14:41.379]  Let's talk to Richard in Rhode Island.
[02:14:41.379 --> 02:14:42.660]  Richard, you're on the air.
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:42.980]  Welcome.
[02:14:43.638 --> 02:14:45.699]  Yes, hi, how are you gentlemen?
[02:14:45.699 --> 02:14:46.659]  Good.
[02:14:46.659 --> 02:14:53.441]  I just want to let you guys know that I'm probably the newest member of the revolution.
[02:14:53.441 --> 02:14:54.802]  Good to have you on board.
[02:14:54.802 --> 02:14:56.442]  Welcome to the spirit of 1776.
[02:14:56.442 --> 02:14:57.963]  Thank you.
[02:14:57.963 --> 02:14:58.843]  Thank you very much.
[02:14:58.843 --> 02:15:03.345]  I'm here and I am, the war is joined.
[02:15:03.345 --> 02:15:03.645]  Okay.
[02:15:03.645 --> 02:15:05.005]  Let me tell you something.
[02:15:05.005 --> 02:15:10.767]  I saw your Obama deception and those kids that you had,
[02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:11.560]  I don't
[02:15:33.402 --> 02:15:41.973]  And I thought it was weird because they're at Hope Classical High School in Rhode Island here, and they were on the football field doing calisthenics.
[02:15:41.973 --> 02:15:46.058]  And they all had those green shirts on that said, yes we can.
[02:15:48.268 --> 02:15:48.829]  Oh, I know!
[02:15:48.829 --> 02:15:54.332]  I mean, they've got these people knocking out windows in Denver of the Democrats to blame it on Republicans.
[02:15:54.332 --> 02:15:57.954]  They've got them going and banging on doors asking, do you support Obama?
[02:15:57.954 --> 02:16:03.037]  They've got them shouting people down at town halls and punching people on the face, being ordered to.
[02:16:03.037 --> 02:16:10.381]  And then, Media Matters, run by George Soros, comes out and attacks me and says Obama never called
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:11.880]  We're good to go.
[02:16:29.517 --> 02:16:35.420]  Well, the people who are willing to accept the fact that the government is lying will just see it as a confirmation that they're on the right path.
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:46.087]  We still have that segment of the society that is so afraid of the government they will not let them see the signs of obvious deception and lies because they don't want to face the choice of what to do about it.
[02:16:46.627 --> 02:16:48.749]  But it will convince more of the fence-sitters.
[02:16:48.749 --> 02:16:53.013]  And over time, we're seeing more and more people come over to our side.
[02:16:53.013 --> 02:16:54.234]  They want to know the truth.
[02:16:54.234 --> 02:16:55.715]  They're ready to deal with the truth.
[02:16:55.715 --> 02:16:58.357]  They're ready to deal with the consequences of knowing the truth.
[02:16:58.357 --> 02:17:00.820]  It is an inevitable process right now.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:07.546]  Admiral Yamamoto used to say the American people are a sleeping giant, slow to arouse, slow to anger, and slow to forgive.
[02:17:07.546 --> 02:17:08.807]  And he's absolutely right.
[02:17:10.609 --> 02:17:11.229]  Absolutely.
[02:17:11.229 --> 02:17:12.610]  Good to hear from you, Richard.
[02:17:12.610 --> 02:17:14.110]  Hey, get some video of those guys.
[02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:15.811]  Upload it on YouTube.
[02:17:15.811 --> 02:17:20.793]  Thousands more videos of this, and we've got video of them doing military drills.
[02:17:20.793 --> 02:17:24.754]  In fact, there's a clip of it in the trailer for Fall of the Republic.
[02:17:24.754 --> 02:17:27.055]  Let's go ahead and go back to another caller here.
[02:17:27.055 --> 02:17:29.856]  Let's talk to Brad.
[02:17:29.856 --> 02:17:32.037]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brad in Illinois.
[02:17:32.037 --> 02:17:32.837]  Brad, you're on the air.
[02:17:32.837 --> 02:17:34.838]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:34.838 --> 02:17:35.018]  Hey.
[02:17:35.018 --> 02:17:36.478]  Hey, what's going on?
[02:17:36.478 --> 02:17:37.198]  Good to talk to you.
[02:17:37.198 --> 02:17:38.079]  Worldwide broadcast.
[02:17:38.079 --> 02:17:38.659]  Good to talk to you.
[02:17:40.342 --> 02:17:42.403]  Listen, I just had a really quick question for you.
[02:17:42.403 --> 02:17:44.125]  It's kind of off-shoot, but not really.
[02:17:44.125 --> 02:17:46.026]  It kind of ties into the topic.
[02:17:46.026 --> 02:18:10.022]  I was just wondering if you've noticed on the History Channel and on the Discovery Channel, these shows, and because last night I was watching them and I'm like making a connection, whereas on the one hand on the Discovery Channel you have shows that are Planet Earth, Planet Earth, Planet Earth, everything about Earth and the animals and they're all rollicking about, and then on History you have Life After People,
[02:18:11.698 --> 02:18:17.801]  And shows like The Colony, where people, small colonies of people after a big disaster.
[02:18:17.801 --> 02:18:28.645]  Yes, they've got scores of shows, local news, national TV, drama, fiction, non-fiction, about bio-attacks, end of the world, martial law, quarantines.
[02:18:28.645 --> 02:18:30.926]  They're just training everybody.
[02:18:30.926 --> 02:18:40.751]  This is the end of civilization, according to the Club of Rome and UN, and the White House science czar openly says they're going to wreck the economy.
[02:18:41.531 --> 02:18:47.297]  To force you to go on government welfare so they can force you to only have one child.
[02:18:47.297 --> 02:18:49.339]  This is about eugenics.
[02:18:49.339 --> 02:18:51.181]  And yes, I appreciate your call.
[02:18:51.181 --> 02:18:53.744]  Mike, in closing, I know you've been seeing this theme.
[02:18:53.744 --> 02:18:55.586]  You work in television yourself.
[02:18:55.586 --> 02:18:56.287]  What do you think about it?
[02:18:57.165 --> 02:18:58.146]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:58.146 --> 02:19:01.848]  Television has always served the interest of the government propaganda.
[02:19:01.848 --> 02:19:10.593]  It's been that way ever since J. Edgar Hoover and Charlie Chaplin were fighting with each other over how Chaplin should show government officials in his movies.
[02:19:10.593 --> 02:19:16.297]  And, you know, we saw that during the McCarthy hearings, the communist witch hunts in Hollywood.
[02:19:16.297 --> 02:19:22.921]  What they were really doing was scrubbing out anybody who wasn't willing to make films bashing on the communists to start the Cold War.
[02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:24.282]  And we're seeing it now.
[02:19:24.662 --> 02:19:29.144]  There are channels like National Geographic last night, heavily propagandistic about 9-11.
[02:19:29.144 --> 02:19:30.965]  History Channel is going that way.
[02:19:30.965 --> 02:19:32.786]  I used to be a big fan of History Channel.
[02:19:32.786 --> 02:19:37.809]  Now I've seen so many shows that are very obviously trying to sell the official government story on stuff.
[02:19:37.809 --> 02:19:39.109]  I don't watch them anymore.
[02:19:39.109 --> 02:19:41.090]  I'm pretty much, I'm watching Smithsonian Channel.
[02:19:41.090 --> 02:19:44.632]  There's a free plug for them because they're nowhere near as bad as National Geographic.
[02:19:44.632 --> 02:19:47.474]  Well, I'm watching WhatReallyHappened.com on InfoWars.com.
[02:19:47.474 --> 02:19:49.135]  Mike, we'll talk to you again next month.
[02:19:49.135 --> 02:19:49.695]  Great job.
[02:19:49.695 --> 02:19:51.076]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:19:51.076 --> 02:19:51.476]  Aloha.
[02:19:52.628 --> 02:19:55.075]  Vaya con Dios, compadre.
[02:19:55.075 --> 02:19:56.820]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:56.820 --> 02:19:57.663]  Stay with us.
[02:19:57.663 --> 02:19:59.227]  The FBI video straight ahead.
[02:20:01.363 --> 02:20:06.865]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:07.646]  and the world.
[02:20:07.646 --> 02:20:11.507]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:20:11.507 --> 02:20:18.010]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest in dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:20:18.010 --> 02:20:20.051]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:20:20.051 --> 02:20:27.994]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:20:28.274 --> 02:20:32.980]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:38.787]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:20:38.787 --> 02:20:40.970]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:43.213]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:20:43.553 --> 02:20:44.634]  Free of charge.
[02:20:44.634 --> 02:20:44.974]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:44.974 --> 02:20:45.054]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:45.054 --> 02:20:46.596]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[02:20:46.596 --> 02:20:48.738]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:20:48.738 --> 02:20:49.098]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:21:00.973 --> 02:21:03.173]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.173 --> 02:21:06.114]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:21:06.114 --> 02:21:14.716]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:21:14.716 --> 02:21:18.397]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:21:18.397 --> 02:21:22.918]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:21:22.918 --> 02:21:24.498]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:21:24.918 --> 02:21:25.959]  Take action now!
[02:21:25.959 --> 02:21:30.781]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:21:30.781 --> 02:21:34.763]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:21:34.763 --> 02:21:38.084]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:21:38.084 --> 02:21:44.507]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[02:21:44.807 --> 02:21:50.790]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:53.111]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[02:21:53.111 --> 02:21:58.353]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:21:58.353 --> 02:22:06.997]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:06.997 --> 02:22:08.698]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:09.648 --> 02:22:11.189]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:11.990]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:13.070]  This is his M.O.
[02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:14.351]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:14.351 --> 02:22:16.353]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:16.353 --> 02:22:23.497]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:23.497 --> 02:22:23.978]  Some U.S.
[02:22:23.978 --> 02:22:29.582]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:30.322 --> 02:22:33.824]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:33.824 --> 02:22:36.866]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:03.673]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:23:03.673 --> 02:23:05.614]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:23:05.614 --> 02:23:11.157]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:23:11.157 --> 02:23:19.181]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:23:19.181 --> 02:23:28.486]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[02:23:28.786 --> 02:23:31.989]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.
[02:23:31.989 --> 02:23:37.173]  Renaissance Charge offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and sizes of batteries.
[02:23:37.173 --> 02:23:42.698]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.
[02:23:42.698 --> 02:23:43.819]  Save your money.
[02:23:43.819 --> 02:23:45.160]  Save the environment.
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:47.883]  Visit us online at r-charge.com.
[02:23:48.143 --> 02:23:51.149]  That's r-charge.com or call us at 989-637-4179.
[02:23:51.149 --> 02:23:51.610]  That's 989-637-4179.
[02:23:51.610 --> 02:23:52.933]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.361]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:24:10.361 --> 02:24:10.921]  to 3 p.m.
[02:24:10.921 --> 02:24:13.041]  Central that's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:24:13.041 --> 02:24:34.469]  We are here live and in this short segment the next segment I wanted to first go over this FBI internal Quantico training video they also distribute to police and to the now 400,000 strong domestic army force that is being reported on by the Progressive and the Hill newspaper.
[02:24:35.319 --> 02:24:40.780]  In fact, I'll show that again to everybody here on TV who's watching us at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:43.061]  If you're a radio listener, just Google the term.
[02:24:43.061 --> 02:24:48.522]  The Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[02:24:48.522 --> 02:24:52.783]  for domestic operations to, quote, engage the American people.
[02:24:52.783 --> 02:24:56.604]  And the Army Times first reported this last year as 20,000, well, first 4,000, then 20,000, now 400,000.
[02:24:56.604 --> 02:24:58.744]  And we cover this in the upcoming film, Camp FEMA.
[02:25:03.832 --> 02:25:06.273]  So, this is happening.
[02:25:06.273 --> 02:25:18.279]  And when we broke the Homeland Security report and the MIAC report, the reason the police and a federal marshal and the other case sent it to us is they were so upset, they teach them in there the number one threat is gun owners and veterans.
[02:25:18.279 --> 02:25:19.420]  And that's true.
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.581]  You're not going to accept 80 plus percent taxes.
[02:25:21.581 --> 02:25:23.902]  You're not going to accept all this tyranny.
[02:25:23.902 --> 02:25:29.665]  And so they knew they would sell you on Homeland Security in the name of foreigners or brown people using racism.
[02:25:30.438 --> 02:25:47.391]  But the whole time, with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, all of it, even under Bush, it was all set up, and the training manuals, we've been breaking these for years, were all about gun owners, conservatives, landowners, people that won't go along with this.
[02:25:47.391 --> 02:25:52.995]  So, you wonder why when you go to the TSA, why you take your shoes off, why they only have liquids.
[02:25:52.995 --> 02:25:54.336]  It's an act of submission.
[02:25:55.444 --> 02:26:00.347]  Make you take your shoes off, an act of supplication, an act of answering questions.
[02:26:00.347 --> 02:26:04.169]  People who've never been asked questions, people who don't see themselves as criminals.
[02:26:04.169 --> 02:26:06.310]  This is teaching you, you are a criminal.
[02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:09.432]  And in England, they now have squads that ask you questions on the side of the road.
[02:26:09.432 --> 02:26:10.253]  It's happened to me.
[02:26:10.253 --> 02:26:13.554]  It's happened to the Watson brothers who work for us, who live in England.
[02:26:13.554 --> 02:26:16.676]  It happened to Wall Street Journal writer, Sarah McBride, who was here.
[02:26:16.676 --> 02:26:20.198]  She repeatedly had them come up and ask her, you know, if she was bad.
[02:26:20.198 --> 02:26:22.880]  This is about letting you know that you live in East Germany.
[02:26:24.053 --> 02:26:27.354]  So, we have all of that going on.
[02:26:27.354 --> 02:26:31.414]  But I want to just play this tape and go through how it creates this atmosphere of fear.
[02:26:31.414 --> 02:26:44.457]  You know, the one lady they talked to, she's photographing a dam, she's a terrorist, she's got scuba gear, it turns out she's guilty, but they're going to let her go and put her in the terrorist database.
[02:26:44.457 --> 02:26:45.097]  Okay?
[02:26:45.097 --> 02:26:48.818]  And this local officer is going under federal control in this video.
[02:26:48.818 --> 02:26:52.239]  He's now part of this federal slash global Interpol system.
[02:26:52.239 --> 02:26:53.599]  So there's all these different layers.
[02:26:55.697 --> 02:26:56.037]  To this.
[02:27:15.370 --> 02:27:15.450]  The
[02:27:31.345 --> 02:27:35.027]  The feds come off base and threaten to arrest them and grab their camera.
[02:27:35.027 --> 02:27:40.411]  This is the new America, where the military runs your life just like Guatemala or Nazi Germany.
[02:27:40.411 --> 02:27:47.796]  Bill will give presidency emergency control over the internet and create a new group of private IT officials that work for the government.
[02:27:47.796 --> 02:27:53.500]  Just like under InfraGard where the FBI recruiting 55,000 executives will shoot to kill orders over their employees.
[02:27:55.214 --> 02:28:06.479]  And they now are going to control the private networks and so you can't have a network unless the Imperium, the Commissariat, the political police give you the authorization.
[02:28:06.479 --> 02:28:14.802]  And all this national news has been calling for my arrest and for people putting up Obama posters saying fascist or socialist.
[02:28:16.014 --> 02:28:19.676]  Here's the local paper outside Austin, freedom of hate speech.
[02:28:19.676 --> 02:28:23.778]  And they say there's not a law against putting these up in Hays County, but there should be.
[02:28:23.778 --> 02:28:25.218]  Alex is evil.
[02:28:25.218 --> 02:28:28.640]  See, this is the new Sovietization.
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:32.982]  So we're going to go to break and come back and play most of this little 13 minute training video.
[02:28:32.982 --> 02:28:35.223]  I'm going to stop and make a few comments during it.
[02:28:35.223 --> 02:28:37.204]  Then I'm going to get into a full breakdown.
[02:28:38.573 --> 02:28:38.713]  Okay.
[02:28:53.911 --> 02:28:55.772]  We're going to explain the M.O.
[02:28:55.772 --> 02:29:03.574]  of purely provocateur staged events by the Feds and private mercenary groups we know they're using and foreign governments are also here in the U.S.
[02:29:03.574 --> 02:29:06.235]  Israeli and British intelligence have been caught involved.
[02:29:06.235 --> 02:29:08.675]  We told you years ago Cheney had private hit teams in the U.S.
[02:29:08.675 --> 02:29:13.357]  Now it's been declassified because this current CIA director doesn't want to go to prison for it.
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:31.426]  And we're going to walk through how, in every case, when they find out that an entire Klan group is founded and run by the feds, every white supremacist group run and founded by the feds, this is to radicalize political discourse inside the United States and to get us all in fighting with each other.
[02:29:31.426 --> 02:29:36.328]  And I want to warn the feds that are part of this and the private mercenary groups that are part of this.
[02:29:37.208 --> 02:29:47.836]  You're gonna be hung out to dry by your bosses, just like Hal Turner, who they admit was their informant, but now they're sending him to prison for making the threats too loud and too bold.
[02:29:47.836 --> 02:29:51.479]  They will set you up, just like Lee Harsley Oswald and Tim McVeigh.
[02:29:51.479 --> 02:29:52.880]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:55.402]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.402 --> 02:29:58.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.609 --> 02:30:04.853]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:04.853 --> 02:30:06.834]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:06.834 --> 02:30:15.382]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.382 --> 02:30:20.926]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:20.926 --> 02:30:22.548]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.788 --> 02:30:29.293]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[02:30:40.341 --> 02:30:40.801]  That's right.

[02:31:00.464 --> 02:31:05.791]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.791 --> 02:31:10.317]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.317 --> 02:31:12.580]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:14.222]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.222 --> 02:31:15.264]  There is a solution.

[02:32:00.732 --> 02:32:05.954]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:32:05.954 --> 02:32:09.976]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.976 --> 02:32:15.878]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.878 --> 02:32:20.941]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.941 --> 02:32:21.441]  Number three,
[02:32:21.841 --> 02:32:28.143]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:32:28.143 --> 02:32:31.044]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:32:31.044 --> 02:32:35.565]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.565 --> 02:32:39.186]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.426 --> 02:32:45.149]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:32:45.149 --> 02:32:49.852]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.852 --> 02:32:51.613]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.613 --> 02:32:54.194]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:32:54.194 --> 02:32:56.715]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[02:32:56.715 --> 02:32:59.017]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth, he can do it as he please.
[02:33:09.944 --> 02:33:30.135]  And if things don't change soon He will For a man has invented his doom First step was touching the moon Now there's a woman on my block She'll just sit there
[02:33:32.197 --> 02:33:46.305]  Okay, folks, we are live again here on the radio, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV, and we've got the folks here from HDNet TV, and I guess this is for their show World Report, so we'll plug that.
[02:33:46.305 --> 02:33:47.386]  Coming up, when in September?
[02:33:47.386 --> 02:33:48.606]  September 29th.
[02:33:48.606 --> 02:33:48.987]  September 29th.
[02:33:48.987 --> 02:33:51.568]  Yeah, I could turn this around and start interviewing you, but you don't want to be on camera.
[02:33:51.568 --> 02:33:53.149]  Don't put her on camera unless she wants to later.
[02:33:53.149 --> 02:33:54.230]  It's okay.
[02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:55.210]  Okay, we'll put her on camera.
[02:33:55.210 --> 02:33:58.572]  In fact, we would have set one up if we knew you were going to be in here.
[02:33:58.572 --> 02:33:59.373]  Mrs. Hank?
[02:33:59.373 --> 02:33:59.753]  Mrs. Hank?
[02:34:00.891 --> 02:34:01.692]  And you are, ma'am?
[02:34:01.692 --> 02:34:02.913]  My name's Carol McKinley.
[02:34:02.913 --> 02:34:05.455]  Carol McKinley, you sure are nice.
[02:34:05.455 --> 02:34:08.757]  My mom's name's Carol, so I'm kind of partial to a woman named Carol, yeah.
[02:34:08.757 --> 02:34:09.578]  Where's your mom?
[02:34:09.578 --> 02:34:10.038]  She in Austin?
[02:34:10.038 --> 02:34:10.999]  She's here in Austin, yeah.
[02:34:10.999 --> 02:34:13.721]  Oh, hi, Carol.
[02:34:13.721 --> 02:34:17.324]  So, Carol Jones, huh?
[02:34:17.324 --> 02:34:19.485]  I'm sorry, they're popping in, telling you to talk into the microphone.
[02:34:19.485 --> 02:34:19.946]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:34:21.212 --> 02:34:21.552]  I apologize.
[02:34:21.552 --> 02:34:22.593]  Go ahead and start over.
[02:34:22.593 --> 02:34:24.754]  So, Carol Jones, likely last name Alex.
[02:34:24.754 --> 02:34:26.195]  Sure, Jones.
[02:34:26.195 --> 02:34:27.515]  Uh-huh.
[02:34:27.515 --> 02:34:28.916]  What's the real last name?
[02:34:28.916 --> 02:34:35.740]  My name really is Jones, but I've had longtime friends that have been, like, booking me plane tickets, and they go, okay, is Jones really your name?
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:37.541]  Yes, yes, my name's really Alex Jones.
[02:34:38.254 --> 02:34:39.015]  Well, it's good to be here.
[02:34:39.015 --> 02:34:39.875]  Thanks for letting us come in.
[02:34:39.875 --> 02:34:41.956]  I guess you don't usually let reporters come in?
[02:34:41.956 --> 02:34:43.337]  I don't have as much as I used to.
[02:34:43.337 --> 02:34:44.638]  Well, here's an example.
[02:34:44.638 --> 02:34:47.340]  Well, the Wall Street Journal wanted to come for a couple of days.
[02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:49.361]  It was a big writer, wanted to do a front-page story.
[02:34:49.361 --> 02:34:53.744]  And I told her, I said, if this isn't a hit piece, her name was Sarah McBride, I said, it's not going to be published.
[02:34:53.744 --> 02:34:55.185]  And she said, no, they always publish my stories.
[02:34:55.185 --> 02:34:56.726]  I'm one of their big writers.
[02:34:56.726 --> 02:34:57.827]  And I said, OK, just watch.
[02:34:57.827 --> 02:34:58.868]  I'm going to do this to teach you.
[02:34:59.688 --> 02:35:00.529]  How it really works.
[02:35:00.529 --> 02:35:05.132]  And also she called Ted Anderson that owns the radio network I'm on, and Ted's like, come on, let her, you know, let her talk to you.
[02:35:05.132 --> 02:35:12.397]  So she came here and I stopped for a day or so, talked to her, and then she wrote the piece, and they came back and said, change it, change it again.
[02:35:12.397 --> 02:35:15.279]  They said, you know what, we're not giving Alex Jones any attention.
[02:35:15.279 --> 02:35:23.965]  Because the mainstream media's figured out, even if they lie or spin or attack us, because the piece really wasn't a very friendly piece, it wasn't a negative piece, but it was fair, as they'd call it.
[02:35:23.965 --> 02:35:25.006]  It had some negative things in it.
[02:35:25.806 --> 02:35:26.306]  I don't
[02:35:47.037 --> 02:35:53.704]  And suddenly he was getting threats from the Securities and Exchange Commission, phone calls, emails, saying, we're going to put you in jail for this loose change thing.
[02:35:53.704 --> 02:35:58.989]  So then they dug up that he'd sold a tiny amount of stock or something and indicted him.
[02:35:58.989 --> 02:36:01.512]  And he said, I'm not going to go along with this.
[02:36:01.512 --> 02:36:02.613]  I'm going to fight you.
[02:36:02.613 --> 02:36:03.374]  This is political.
[02:36:03.374 --> 02:36:06.057]  And then he released the emails of them threatening him.
[02:36:06.057 --> 02:36:07.798]  And I think the people that did that should go to jail.
[02:36:08.439 --> 02:36:12.641]  So I'm saying that's, that's why, I mean, I'm sure it'll be a 50-50 piece.
[02:36:12.641 --> 02:36:19.144]  I know Mark does all signs of stuff and he doesn't control what all his people do, but my point is I'm doing it because it is HDNet just to see what happens.
[02:36:19.144 --> 02:36:28.488]  But yes, we do turn down a lot of TV because we can have them in there for 10 hours and they'll just show the one time I, you know, rub my nose or something, or they'll zoom in on a
[02:36:28.868 --> 02:36:32.590]  Well, we're doing a story on the resurgence of the militia, and I haven't found yet that that's really happening.
[02:36:32.590 --> 02:36:35.212]  I mean, we know that on the internet, I'm seeing a lot more on the internet.
[02:36:35.212 --> 02:36:35.932]  So, you're our first interview.
[02:36:52.805 --> 02:36:57.949]  And we're going to Michigan in two weeks, and so right now I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
[02:36:57.949 --> 02:37:01.031]  Michigan's good, but it's a giant nest of federal operations.
[02:37:01.031 --> 02:37:10.358]  I mean, you're probably going to be talking to... I would say nine out of ten people that are going to come out and want to talk to you are going to be either federal informants or special forces operators.
[02:37:10.358 --> 02:37:11.039]  Oh, really?
[02:37:11.039 --> 02:37:11.659]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:11.659 --> 02:37:13.140]  So we should watch out?
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:13.741]  No, no!
[02:37:13.741 --> 02:37:17.083]  I mean, they're going to act like clowns for you.
[02:37:17.083 --> 02:37:18.925]  So, I mean... Oh, I see.
[02:37:18.925 --> 02:37:19.165]  Yeah.
[02:37:20.734 --> 02:37:22.794]  So, I mean, no, this is all theater of the mind.
[02:37:22.794 --> 02:37:28.395]  So, I'm saying Michigan was where they ran their main operation in the 90s.
[02:37:28.395 --> 02:37:32.856]  Pre-demonization before the Fed staged Oklahoma City.
[02:37:32.856 --> 02:37:40.258]  Do you think that more and more people in America are turning to militias because they're unhappy with the way the government's being run now?
[02:37:40.258 --> 02:37:41.538]  Do you think that's true?
[02:37:41.538 --> 02:37:45.518]  The people see the illegitimate actions of the government.
[02:37:45.518 --> 02:37:46.419]  They see the $23.7 trillion stolen in 10 months.
[02:37:49.269 --> 02:37:51.831]  More than double the GDP.
[02:37:51.831 --> 02:38:02.018]  They see the government doing unconstitutional things across the board while amassing paramilitary forces, announcing 400,000 combat troops to be deployed.
[02:38:02.018 --> 02:38:08.743]  The government saying gun owners are terrorists, veterans are terrorists, Ron Paul supporters are the big threat.
[02:38:08.743 --> 02:38:14.107]  And so yes, we've seen all time records for a solid year, gun buying and purchasing.
[02:38:15.047 --> 02:38:17.411]  And the real militias aren't going to talk to you.
[02:38:17.411 --> 02:38:19.294]  You're never going to see them, and they're everywhere.
[02:38:19.294 --> 02:38:25.303]  And usually it's four or five good friends, former military, who have a little shooting club, and they...
[02:38:26.806 --> 02:38:29.328]  In fact, print me off the Gadsden flag quote again.
[02:38:29.328 --> 02:38:33.891]  I think that's good to describe the real militia.
[02:38:33.891 --> 02:38:36.273]  What Benjamin Franklin said about it.
[02:38:36.273 --> 02:38:39.655]  Why our original symbol was not the eagle, it was the rattlesnake.
[02:38:39.655 --> 02:38:52.884]  And the Marine Corps' first symbol was not the anchors, but the rattlesnake, because it's not looking for trouble, but its eyes are never blinking, it's always watching, and it rattles its tail and says, don't tread on me.
[02:38:52.884 --> 02:38:54.906]  And so the people are arming up en masse,
[02:38:55.586 --> 02:39:00.841]  And they're aware of the FEMA camps, they're aware of the entire agenda, and they're ready to defend the Republic.
[02:39:00.841 --> 02:39:01.965]  But they're not looking for trouble.
[02:39:01.965 --> 02:39:02.667]  It's defensive.
[02:39:03.508 --> 02:39:06.270]  They're not out to attack, and they understand the provocateurs.
[02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:09.051]  They understand whoever shoots first loses.
[02:39:09.051 --> 02:39:16.675]  But they're also ready that as the tyranny pushes them into a corner, like Lexington and Concord, they're going to stand up for their rights.
[02:39:16.675 --> 02:39:22.178]  And then the establishment, who are bullies, will probably fire the first shot in the second American Revolution.
[02:39:22.178 --> 02:39:23.599]  And then all hell's going to break loose.
[02:39:23.599 --> 02:39:24.980]  Do you think that's going to happen soon?
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:33.203]  I would say it's 50-50 that in the next two years, you will see the start of a real revolution in the United States.
[02:39:33.203 --> 02:39:37.584]  A violent revolution in response to people being attacked.
[02:39:37.584 --> 02:39:41.986]  And pregnant mothers being tasered and CPS kidnapping people's children.
[02:39:41.986 --> 02:39:45.807]  And the whole prison economy just squeezing and pushing and pushing and never stopping.
[02:39:45.807 --> 02:39:47.808]  But I'm fighting to stop that.
[02:39:48.268 --> 02:39:50.131]  And to reach out to military and police and others.
[02:39:50.131 --> 02:39:55.758]  You know, Ron Paul got more contributions than any other presidential candidate in both parties from the military.
[02:39:55.758 --> 02:39:57.040]  70 plus percent.
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:04.410]  So the truth is, these offshore banks that have hijacked our government and want to use the military and North Com against us, it's going to fail.
[02:40:06.291 --> 02:40:15.958]  So what do you think that the real militias, as you call them, the ones where they've got the four or five friends who go out and they practice, what are they preparing for?
[02:40:15.958 --> 02:40:17.700]  They're not going to quarantines.
[02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:19.501]  They're not letting anybody take their children.
[02:40:19.501 --> 02:40:21.763]  They're not taking forced inoculations.
[02:40:21.763 --> 02:40:24.665]  They're not going to be forced on government welfare.
[02:40:24.665 --> 02:40:31.710]  And as the establishment shuts the economy down by design and enforces people under... See, they're advertising the camps.
[02:40:32.250 --> 02:40:33.251]  As if they're a good thing.
[02:40:33.251 --> 02:40:37.874]  They're advertising it as if it's going to be a community center just like Hitler did or just like Stalin did.
[02:40:37.874 --> 02:40:42.377]  But let me just read you before I play this FBI video and then we'll come back and I'll do a whole rant.
[02:40:42.377 --> 02:40:47.260]  You can ask any questions you want on air if that's what you'd like.
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:53.684]  The Gadsden flag is a historical American flag with a yellow field depicting a rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike.
[02:40:53.684 --> 02:40:54.525]  Positioned below
[02:40:55.512 --> 02:40:58.295]  The snake is the legend, don't tread on me.
[02:40:58.295 --> 02:41:04.460]  The flag was designed and is named after American General and Statesman Christopher Gadsden.
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:13.128]  It was also used by the United States Marine Corps as early... Don't forget her mic, guys.
[02:41:13.128 --> 02:41:19.093]  The flag was designed and is named after American General and Statesman Christopher Gadsden.
[02:41:19.093 --> 02:41:21.716]  It was also used by the United States Marine Corps
[02:41:23.041 --> 02:41:25.343]  As an early motto flag.
[02:41:25.343 --> 02:41:26.323]  So it must be bad.
[02:41:26.323 --> 02:41:31.387]  And then this is the flag that Homeland Security in the report says it's so deadly, so evil, so horrible.
[02:41:31.387 --> 02:41:33.849]  You know, the Army and the Marine Corps, everybody else uses it.
[02:41:33.849 --> 02:41:38.252]  So I thought people should actually find out what it means.
[02:41:38.252 --> 02:41:42.955]  As the American Revolution grew closer, the snake began to see more use as a symbol of the colonies.
[02:41:42.955 --> 02:41:47.699]  In 1774, Paul Revere added it to the title of his paper, The Massachusetts Spy.
[02:41:48.479 --> 02:41:51.241]  As a snake joined to fight the British Dragon.
[02:41:51.241 --> 02:42:02.867]  In December of 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the Pennsylvania Journal under the pseudonym American Gossar, in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol for the American spirit.
[02:42:02.867 --> 02:42:11.492]  I recollect that her eyes excelled in brightness than that of any other animal, and that she has no eyelids.
[02:42:11.492 --> 02:42:14.353]  She may therefore be esteemed as an emblem of vigilance.
[02:42:14.353 --> 02:42:16.995]  She never begins an attack, nor
[02:42:18.390 --> 02:42:21.351]  When once engaged, ever surrenders.
[02:42:21.351 --> 02:42:25.512]  She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage.
[02:42:25.512 --> 02:42:34.854]  As if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapon which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth.
[02:42:34.854 --> 02:42:40.355]  So that to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be most defenseless animal.
[02:42:40.355 --> 02:42:46.477]  And even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible.
[02:42:47.742 --> 02:42:53.406]  But their wounds, however small, are decisive and fatal.
[02:42:53.406 --> 02:43:02.932]  Conscious of this, she never wounds till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her.
[02:43:02.932 --> 02:43:08.356]  Was I wrong, sir, in thinking that this is a strong picture of the temper of American conduct?
[02:43:08.356 --> 02:43:10.678]  So that is what the terrorist
[02:43:11.874 --> 02:43:15.575]  Benjamin Franklin had to say about the Gadsden flag.
[02:43:15.575 --> 02:43:17.116]  And why do I say terrorist?
[02:43:17.116 --> 02:43:25.298]  I have FEMA on video from 2000 shot by a firefighter in Kansas City.
[02:43:25.298 --> 02:43:38.862]  In the training seminar, and we've seen the training manual itself, this is the only time we were sent it being taught, said that the Founding Fathers are terrorists, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, they're terrorists, America's bad, these are the enemies of the federal government.
[02:43:41.127 --> 02:43:45.509]  And so we broke that as well, but a world exclusive right now.
[02:43:45.509 --> 02:43:46.450]  This was sent to us.
[02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:51.393]  This is a 2006 Quantico terrorist training video.
[02:43:51.393 --> 02:43:55.675]  This was sent to us by someone saying they were the FBI.
[02:43:55.675 --> 02:44:00.097]  We've called the FBI, confirmed this is one of their training videos, but this is not on the web.
[02:44:00.097 --> 02:44:01.018]  First time it's ever been seen.
[02:44:02.216 --> 02:44:13.078]  Your taxpayer money paid for this paranoia, this induced schizophrenia, to show police, military that are now involved in law enforcement illegally, and the FBI, that everyone's a terrorist.
[02:44:13.078 --> 02:44:20.180]  And that's why when you're with your family photographing the Washington Monument, police come over and ask why you're doing it.
[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:27.461]  As if terrorists, real terrorists that weren't CIA or MI6, wouldn't go and just look at Google Earth or have a hidden camera.
[02:44:27.461 --> 02:44:28.061]  It's ridiculous.
[02:44:28.061 --> 02:44:30.482]  It's about training you that you're a terrorist.
[02:44:31.772 --> 02:44:45.498]  The FBI is now saying they want to put TSA screeners in shopping malls, and metal detectors, and they want to have them on street corners, and Viper teams with the federal marshals are out running checkpoints in Houston, and Boston, and New York, and searching all the subway bags.
[02:44:45.498 --> 02:44:48.259]  The Amtrak trains, we're being trained to be prisoners.
[02:44:48.959 --> 02:44:52.881]  This is all part of a process of enslavement here in the managed economy.
[02:44:52.881 --> 02:44:55.042]  So here it is, the next two segments.
[02:44:55.042 --> 02:45:02.305]  Let's just go ahead and play this Orwellian FBI internal training video, which is federalizing local police.
[02:45:02.305 --> 02:45:03.085]  Here it is.
[02:45:03.085 --> 02:45:05.606]  Important information on terrorists and their allies.
[02:45:05.606 --> 02:45:08.668]  And a terrorist screening center stands ready to help you.
[02:45:09.994 --> 02:45:18.940]  Before TSC was created in December 2003, the cop on the street had no way of knowing if someone he'd stopped was associated with terrorism.
[02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:28.467]  But now, TSC consolidates the terrorist lists of many agencies, and you connect to them automatically through NCIC.
[02:45:28.467 --> 02:45:38.795]  Whenever you run an NCIC name check, you connect with TSC, and running any name that's on our watch list will automatically give you a hit and some specific instructions on how to handle that person.
[02:45:40.173 --> 02:45:51.920]  Okay, now this is meant to, again, get the police not into responding to crime when it's happened, because the police will tell you it's not their job to protect you.
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:52.701]  They have no liability.
[02:45:52.701 --> 02:46:00.625]  They're going to respond and enforce the law, because they're elected by the municipal governments that are chartered for the local people under state law.
[02:46:00.625 --> 02:46:03.187]  But this is about the police thinking everybody's a terrorist.
[02:46:03.187 --> 02:46:06.229]  That's why everybody that gets pulled over now, including my dad, you know,
[02:46:07.344 --> 02:46:10.487]  Sixty-year-old doctor gets asked, where you going?
[02:46:10.487 --> 02:46:12.709]  You know, are you a terrorist?
[02:46:12.709 --> 02:46:16.232]  Because the police have now been turned into these proactive commissars.
[02:46:16.232 --> 02:46:18.814]  And now they're told, pull you over if you got a Ron Paul sticker.
[02:46:18.814 --> 02:46:21.896]  My dad got pulled over in East Texas driving back from visiting family.
[02:46:22.785 --> 02:46:27.250]  They walked over and they said, uh, you come up in the watch list.
[02:46:27.250 --> 02:46:29.192]  You're the father of Alex Jones.
[02:46:29.192 --> 02:46:32.295]  And they're now dialing into these databases.
[02:46:32.295 --> 02:46:33.456]  This was about a year and a half ago.
[02:46:33.456 --> 02:46:34.237]  And he said, how do you know this?
[02:46:34.237 --> 02:46:37.260]  He said, well, we have a Reuters system, a LexisNexis.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:39.122]  It all goes through this federal system.
[02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:41.344]  And the guy went ahead and told my dad he was a fan of the show.
[02:46:42.105 --> 02:46:47.868]  But just that the cameras the Feds have put in their town read his license plate and flagged it.
[02:46:47.868 --> 02:46:52.249]  Remember six years ago, every car that goes through Florida town has plates run.
[02:46:52.249 --> 02:46:53.490]  That's already nationwide.
[02:46:53.490 --> 02:46:58.292]  And as they bring in these threat integration centers, all your local police are now being told they have this.
[02:46:58.292 --> 02:47:08.817]  Also, I saw a story in 2004, it's in my film Matrix of Evil, an article in the Green Bay News with the governor saying, oh look, the Feds just put in the new system in our threat integration center where
[02:47:10.004 --> 02:47:15.445]  If we want to look for somebody, we type up the name of their cell phone, their number, and it pops up in real time tracking them.
[02:47:15.445 --> 02:47:16.585]  Now they admit that.
[02:47:16.585 --> 02:47:21.606]  The Telecommunications Act of 96, by law, October 1st, 2001, passed in 96.
[02:47:21.606 --> 02:47:25.547]  All phones are GPS triangulated off the cell towers, tracked in real time.
[02:47:25.547 --> 02:47:27.887]  Now the local departments are phasing it in.
[02:47:27.887 --> 02:47:32.968]  Under federal control, they type in, they pull you up, they hit another key, turns the mic on on your phone.
[02:47:32.968 --> 02:47:36.909]  They're inducing it to the slaves right now, the fluoride heads out there.
[02:47:37.809 --> 02:47:41.710]  As, oh, if a child's lost, the police can dial in and listen.
[02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:43.190]  So they're also conditioning the police.
[02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:45.030]  So that's what this video's about.
[02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:59.933]  This is the feds fully turning the local police into secret police for the non-existent threat of terror when Oklahoma City, 9-11, and every other major terror event, Gulf of Tonkin, Operation Ajax, Operation Northwoods, many of them declassified, is staged terror.
[02:47:59.933 --> 02:48:02.414]  Declassified 2004 Army Training Manual.
[02:48:02.414 --> 02:48:03.914]  We'll pull that up and show it to the media.
[02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:07.957]  teaches the army how to stage false flag terror attacks.
[02:48:07.957 --> 02:48:11.820]  Army captains and above are taught how to stage terror attacks in America.
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:15.603]  This is like canteen M-16 terror attack manual.
[02:48:15.603 --> 02:48:16.784]  Carry out the terror!
[02:48:16.784 --> 02:48:17.544]  Hoorah!
[02:48:17.544 --> 02:48:18.045]  Let's go!
[02:48:18.045 --> 02:48:19.466]  Bring down America!
[02:48:19.466 --> 02:48:22.328]  Now, let's go back to the video of the real terrorist.
[02:48:22.328 --> 02:48:26.992]  What you should do ranges from clap them in irons to let them walk.
[02:48:29.161 --> 02:48:32.482]  Category 1 is for the baddest of the bad.
[02:48:32.482 --> 02:48:37.064]  This is someone you should arrest immediately, just like you handle any other warrant.
[02:48:37.064 --> 02:48:39.045]  Then call TSC.
[02:48:39.045 --> 02:48:41.606]  Odds are you won't see any of these guys.
[02:48:41.606 --> 02:48:44.428]  Category 2... Yeah, hit pause.
[02:48:44.428 --> 02:48:45.768]  I just can't help it.
[02:48:45.768 --> 02:48:46.909]  Odds are you won't see one.
[02:48:46.909 --> 02:48:48.289]  No kidding.
[02:48:48.289 --> 02:48:49.710]  It's now been declassified.
[02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:56.593]  We knew this five years ago when she was on the show, Sybil Evans, but under federal gag order she couldn't go fully public.
[02:48:57.444 --> 02:49:01.166]  FBI translator of NSA intercepts.
[02:49:01.166 --> 02:49:05.448]  She said, look, drug running, child kidnapping, it's all CIA, all Al Qaeda.
[02:49:05.448 --> 02:49:07.449]  Bin Laden works for us, that's all I can tell you.
[02:49:07.449 --> 02:49:09.830]  She told Congress this and was gagged.
[02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:16.634]  She now went and broke the federal gag order two weeks ago and said Al Qaeda was under full US control till 9-11.
[02:49:16.634 --> 02:49:19.515]  This is the intercept she's hearing.
[02:49:19.515 --> 02:49:26.939]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, has now confirmed that they've got a whole NSA group just watching 9-11 whistleblowers in the government.
[02:49:28.223 --> 02:49:30.786]  So see, again, of course you're not going to see level one.
[02:49:30.786 --> 02:49:32.327]  Clap them in irons immediately.
[02:49:32.327 --> 02:49:40.896]  Remember Springman, the head of the Jeddah Embassy of Saudi Arabia, we had on, was also on the Toronto Star.
[02:49:40.896 --> 02:49:47.783]  He wouldn't let Mohammed Adda and others back from that Malaysian terror summit as they were flying back through the Middle East from Asia.
[02:49:49.148 --> 02:49:53.170]  And they told him, don't worry, their terror names are just their CIA covers.
[02:49:53.170 --> 02:49:59.393]  And then you had the head of the embassy in Canada also went public, not just in Saudi Arabia.
[02:49:59.393 --> 02:50:07.238]  And then Colonel Stephen Butler, the head of the Defense Language School, went public in the San Jose Mercury News and AP and said, look, the government did this.
[02:50:07.238 --> 02:50:08.178]  They let this happen.
[02:50:08.178 --> 02:50:10.679]  These guys were trained at bases.
[02:50:10.679 --> 02:50:11.540]  I'm the dean of the school.
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:17.303]  I called him up and he said his life was being threatened, he couldn't talk.
[02:50:17.303 --> 02:50:20.726]  But the point is, they started a court-martial until he agreed to shut up.
[02:50:20.726 --> 02:50:22.468]  This is all staged, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:22.468 --> 02:50:24.269]  I'm sorry, I said I'd get to the video quicker than this.
[02:50:24.269 --> 02:50:26.671]  It's just, it's so amazing.
[02:50:26.671 --> 02:50:30.395]  And then I'm going to go through this folder, how the whole deal is staged.
[02:50:30.395 --> 02:50:33.858]  Just Klan group, white supremacist, malicious, all of it.
[02:50:34.198 --> 02:50:35.298]  Just, it's staged.
[02:50:35.298 --> 02:50:36.699]  Any violent group.
[02:50:36.699 --> 02:50:40.061]  It's now coming out in congressional testimony about this.
[02:50:40.061 --> 02:50:42.702]  It's coming out in mainstream news in Colorado.
[02:50:42.702 --> 02:50:45.023]  Missouri's having state hearings about it.
[02:50:45.023 --> 02:50:48.204]  I mean, look at these cops dressed up like anarchists.
[02:50:48.204 --> 02:50:49.725]  Just look at them.
[02:50:49.725 --> 02:50:54.127]  Out there trying to get people to do illegal things in Missouri at the end of the Fed protest.
[02:50:54.127 --> 02:50:55.247]  We're on to you.
[02:50:55.247 --> 02:50:56.428]  We've caught you.
[02:50:56.428 --> 02:50:57.248]  It's over criminals.
[02:51:02.216 --> 02:51:06.001]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[02:51:06.001 --> 02:51:16.153]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[02:51:16.153 --> 02:51:18.096]  There is a solution that doesn't involve
[02:51:18.336 --> 02:51:18.716]  I think so.
[02:51:37.904 --> 02:51:48.368]  Heart and Body Extract has a 23-year proven track record of using certified organic herbs that make up an excellent formula to balance and support the heart and circulatory system.
[02:51:48.368 --> 02:51:54.971]  In as little as two weeks, you can feel amazing results with your two-month supply of Heart and Body Extract today.
[02:51:54.971 --> 02:51:56.652]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBExtract.com.
[02:52:01.989 --> 02:52:03.971]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.971 --> 02:52:07.596]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:07.596 --> 02:52:09.919]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.919 --> 02:52:13.142]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:13.142 --> 02:52:18.909]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:52:18.909 --> 02:52:21.973]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people.
[02:52:22.233 --> 02:52:22.653]  We're good to go.
[02:52:49.667 --> 02:52:57.369]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[02:52:57.369 --> 02:52:58.869]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone.
[02:53:14.212 --> 02:53:21.514]  The simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[02:53:21.514 --> 02:53:30.257]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium, along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.
[02:53:30.257 --> 02:53:36.098]  Unlike other products, AlkaZone is odorless and tasteless, and can be added to any beverage to offset its acidity.
[02:53:36.098 --> 02:53:41.340]  AlkaZone also manufactures antioxidant water fountains that will both filter and raise the pH of the tap water.
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:41.740]  Before you
[02:54:05.899 --> 02:54:13.581]  Okay, I said I was going to play this video and I'm just stopping it every five seconds because it's all such incredible propaganda.
[02:54:13.581 --> 02:54:15.962]  But this is the federalization, this is the takeover.
[02:54:15.962 --> 02:54:22.603]  Continue with the internal FBI training video that they also give to local police to brainwash and federalize them.
[02:54:22.603 --> 02:54:24.024]  Here it is.
[02:54:24.024 --> 02:54:28.485]  You should call TSC right away and you may be asked to detain them for a reasonable time.
[02:54:29.594 --> 02:54:32.815]  You probably won't see any of these people either.
[02:54:32.815 --> 02:54:34.616]  Category 3.
[02:54:34.616 --> 02:54:38.838]  If you get a hit, it'll most likely be a Category 3.
[02:54:38.838 --> 02:54:43.460]  These are people that may have ties to terrorism, but don't know that we know.
[02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:44.780]  And we want to keep it that way.
[02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:47.902]  So don't let them know that they're on a watch.
[02:54:47.902 --> 02:54:51.803]  See, this is really training the local police to go out and be secret police.
[02:54:51.803 --> 02:54:55.285]  They don't want to make the public mad and know they've all been turned into secret police.
[02:54:56.972 --> 02:55:10.485]  Okay, and so, again, when they're harassing you and asking you questions, I mean, I was sitting there paying a taxi cab, took me to the airport, and a TSA guy just came over and asked where I was from and how I was doing, and it was all right out of this.
[02:55:10.485 --> 02:55:18.472]  And one time I was at the Austin airport and a guy was reading a book, looked like it was out of 1984 with a black and white cover, saying how someone becomes a terrorist.
[02:55:18.472 --> 02:55:22.135]  See, it's all part of the mental illness, like the American people are now the Ruskies.
[02:55:22.896 --> 02:55:31.142]  And it's the red terror, and they're going to have to deal with this, and we're hiding under every table, and Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[02:55:31.142 --> 02:55:32.523]  There's white Al-Qaeda.
[02:55:32.523 --> 02:55:40.408]  Remember years ago I told you they would announce white Al-Qaeda when they were getting ready to focus homeland security on the American people, what it was built and designed and set up for?
[02:55:40.408 --> 02:55:42.910]  And now they say there's between 4,000 and 6,000 white Al-Qaeda?
[02:55:44.751 --> 02:56:00.818]  And the grandson of the ADL head, Adam Gadon, who got arrested for beating up Muslims at Mosque, he suddenly is on TV, a la Akbar, and they upload his videos in the same video format, with the Intel Center bug, in the same Al-Qaeda bug, in the same video layer.
[02:56:00.818 --> 02:56:09.642]  And then it turns out the head of the Intel Center was the adjunct to Psyops at the CIA, and works for Rumsfeld.
[02:56:09.642 --> 02:56:09.702]  Aww.
[02:56:10.836 --> 02:56:12.457]  I mean, could it get more obvious?
[02:56:12.457 --> 02:56:15.100]  Let's continue with the video.
[02:56:15.100 --> 02:56:15.460]  Here it is.
[02:56:29.275 --> 02:56:35.319]  Obviously, someone might have the same name as a guy on the list without actually being that guy.
[02:56:35.319 --> 02:56:41.283]  Category 4 is for other people who may have ties to terrorism, but the connection is not as sure.
[02:56:41.283 --> 02:56:47.508]  So we want you to get positive ID info on them, and then call TSC if you think they should be investigated for terrorist activity.
[02:56:47.508 --> 02:56:48.348]  Alright, hit pause right there.
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:53.322]  Level 4 is the only truthful designation.
[02:56:53.322 --> 02:56:56.345]  We have no evidence, we have no proof, no due process.
[02:56:56.345 --> 02:57:05.591]  They just might know somebody who knew somebody who one time knew somebody who might have fought and imagined in a dream about a terrorist.
[02:57:05.591 --> 02:57:08.453]  That's what all the other categories are too.
[02:57:08.453 --> 02:57:11.275]  But see, by saying, oh, this is an unsubstantiated level 4,
[02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:16.421]  Now that legitimizes level one, two, and three.
[02:57:16.421 --> 02:57:17.362]  It's all quackery.
[02:57:17.362 --> 02:57:26.245]  Like they're saying, oh, if you're on the no-fly list, 25,000 people a month added, over 1.2 million, since they made the list secret eight months ago.
[02:57:26.245 --> 02:57:31.087]  If you're on that list, you can't fly, and you can't own a gun, and you're not gonna be able to have a job, they're saying.
[02:57:31.087 --> 02:57:33.128]  And if you have bad credit, you're gonna be on the no-fly list.
[02:57:33.128 --> 02:57:34.548]  That's been announced.
[02:57:34.548 --> 02:57:36.689]  So it's this new no judge, no jury.
[02:57:36.689 --> 02:57:38.210]  You're just, your rights are over now.
[02:57:39.673 --> 02:57:44.137]  It's like Germany, they would just say, you gotta have this mark on your papers saying you're a bad person.
[02:57:44.137 --> 02:57:47.839]  But now it's the mark of your face scan, your thumbprint, your biometrics.
[02:57:47.839 --> 02:57:56.847]  With the face scanning cameras, the license plate scanning cameras, your cell phone, by federal law, tracking everywhere you go, they can dial in even when it's off and listen to you.
[02:57:56.847 --> 02:58:01.730]  All admitted, all admitted, this is the total Soviet Union of America.
[02:58:01.730 --> 02:58:03.412]  Let's take it out to break with more of the clip.
[02:58:04.468 --> 02:58:10.911]  Our database are not active terrorists, but only associates or supporters who are under investigation.
[02:58:10.911 --> 02:58:14.852]  You are the nation's front line in the fight against terrorism.
[02:58:14.852 --> 02:58:20.655]  If a terrorist gets into our country, what law enforcement officer is most likely to run into him first?
[02:58:20.655 --> 02:58:22.255]  You are.
[02:58:22.255 --> 02:58:26.497]  You get up close and personal with more people in this country than anyone else.
[02:58:26.497 --> 02:58:33.300]  Through your eyes, counter-terrorism agencies of America can see and detect terrorist threats long before a deadly act unfolds.
[02:58:34.571 --> 02:58:36.214]  Let's look at a couple likely examples.
[02:58:36.214 --> 02:58:37.195]  Alright, let's stop there.
[02:58:37.195 --> 02:58:39.199]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:39.199 --> 02:58:43.065]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.065 --> 02:58:45.669]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.095 --> 02:58:54.076]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:58:54.076 --> 02:58:54.716]  Well, you should.
[02:58:54.716 --> 02:58:59.559]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:58:59.559 --> 02:59:00.359]  That's right.

[02:59:53.884 --> 02:59:56.267]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.267 --> 02:59:59.050]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:21.818 --> 03:00:24.979]  Ladies and gentlemen, just a heads up, we have a really huge guest.
[03:00:24.979 --> 03:00:26.259]  I'm just going to let you know that.
[03:00:26.259 --> 03:00:28.920]  Huge announcement, Tuesday on the show.
[03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:31.280]  We're also getting Ron Paul next week.
[03:00:31.280 --> 03:00:34.441]  Talk about more evidence of these provocateurs.
[03:00:34.441 --> 03:00:40.262]  The Feds and local police posing as anarchists come out and demonize in the Federal Reserve rallies.
[03:00:40.262 --> 03:00:43.402]  The private banks that control this country are really getting desperate.
[03:00:43.402 --> 03:00:46.803]  Holes show in Gallup, 75% growing.
[03:00:46.803 --> 03:00:48.343]  Want the Fed audited or abolished.
[03:00:49.614 --> 03:00:53.175]  So, look for the feds to do a self-inflicted wound.
[03:00:53.175 --> 03:01:00.178]  That's why, if you see a federal building or a federal reserve which isn't federal-bombed or something, start videotaping immediately.
[03:01:00.178 --> 03:01:01.378]  Get those feds on tape.
[03:01:01.378 --> 03:01:03.839]  We can bring them down with this.
[03:01:03.839 --> 03:01:05.079]  Follow these provocateurs.
[03:01:05.079 --> 03:01:06.080]  Go to in-the-fed events.
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.501]  We got a lot of private investigators volunteering now.
[03:01:08.501 --> 03:01:09.761]  Go stake it out.
[03:01:09.761 --> 03:01:11.262]  Videotape the troublemakers.
[03:01:11.262 --> 03:01:13.142]  Follow them back to the police station.
[03:01:13.142 --> 03:01:14.823]  Follow them back to their handlers.
[03:01:14.823 --> 03:01:15.843]  Burn them good.
[03:01:15.843 --> 03:01:17.004]  We're burning them everywhere.
[03:01:17.004 --> 03:01:18.124]  We're going to continue to burn them.
[03:01:18.484 --> 03:01:22.507]  We're going to continue to expose their terrorist activities, their false flag events.
[03:01:22.507 --> 03:01:25.429]  That is a staged terror attack.
[03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:31.372]  When the police attack other police and blame it on the good protesters as a way to shut down free speech in America.
[03:01:31.372 --> 03:01:33.494]  The beta test was Seattle 99.
[03:01:33.494 --> 03:01:35.155]  They do it over and over again worldwide.
[03:01:35.635 --> 03:01:36.956]  We blew their cover then.
[03:01:36.956 --> 03:01:38.838]  We're going to blow their cover now.
[03:01:38.838 --> 03:01:41.241]  You are the front line against the terrorists.
[03:01:41.241 --> 03:01:46.166]  You are the front line to expose the Army and Pentagon's black ops against this nation.
[03:01:46.166 --> 03:01:47.848]  We have people in the FBI.
[03:01:47.848 --> 03:01:49.990]  We have people in every other agency in the military.
[03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:54.615]  70 plus percent of the donations for President went to Ron Paul from the military.
[03:01:54.615 --> 03:01:55.436]  We know you're good.
[03:01:56.874 --> 03:02:02.017]  These compartments that are carrying out the terror, they're going to do it under the guise of a federal drill.
[03:02:02.017 --> 03:02:03.097]  They always do.
[03:02:03.097 --> 03:02:06.119]  In case you catch them, they're going to say it's part of the drill.
[03:02:06.119 --> 03:02:07.319]  Play along.
[03:02:07.319 --> 03:02:11.562]  They'll kill you if they think you're about to expose their terror attack.
[03:02:12.375 --> 03:02:18.457]  So get the information, get out, get it out on YouTube, get it out on Google before they can kill you.
[03:02:18.457 --> 03:02:20.377]  If you don't do that, you're dead.
[03:02:20.377 --> 03:02:22.238]  This is how we defeat the New World Order.
[03:02:22.238 --> 03:02:24.459]  This is how we bring their crimes to justice.
[03:02:24.459 --> 03:02:25.559]  We will not be stopped.
[03:02:25.559 --> 03:02:28.780]  These techniques of liberty and truth will defeat them.
[03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:38.023]  Back to the FBI federalizing local police, turning them into secret police, teaching them that the American people are terrorists, that Ron Paul's a terrorist, that the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[03:02:38.023 --> 03:02:41.464]  That's what the training manuals they give them with this video say.
[03:02:41.464 --> 03:02:41.844]  Here it is.
[03:02:42.935 --> 03:02:48.918]  This officer has just stopped this driver for driving 55 in a 40 mile an hour zone.
[03:02:48.918 --> 03:02:54.180]  He ran the car's plate before approaching, then got the driver's license and car registration.
[03:02:54.180 --> 03:03:01.924]  When he ran him through NCIC, the driver's name gave a category 3 hit from TSC saying he might be connected to terrorism.
[03:03:01.924 --> 03:03:04.145]  So how does our officer handle the news?
[03:03:04.145 --> 03:03:05.805]  The way you should.
[03:03:05.805 --> 03:03:08.247]  Watch.
[03:03:08.247 --> 03:03:11.048]  Is this the Terrorist Screening Center?
[03:03:12.939 --> 03:03:14.220]  Yeah, I just made a traffic stop.
[03:03:14.220 --> 03:03:18.982]  That little psychological thing they do is to make it look like it's interactive.
[03:03:18.982 --> 03:03:29.048]  You notice CNN and Fox are going to this computer internet look now as if you're interactive because their studies and focus groups have shown that your psychological algorithm likes surfing the web more.
[03:03:29.048 --> 03:03:38.233]  They realize it's all going to that so they want to put you in a passive web psychology so by turning up the volume it makes you feel like you're in control.
[03:03:39.207 --> 03:03:54.114]  Okay, because the experience psychologically of being in control is better with the internet, so they're trying to mimic that, and also make it look like at a primitive level, like this guy's a witch doctor, your subconscious mind sees it that way, that he knows how to do something real cool, like turn the audio up.
[03:03:54.114 --> 03:03:59.177]  Again, all psychological warfare by these psych-ops engineers.
[03:03:59.177 --> 03:04:01.418]  Once you understand their operation, you can totally defeat them.
[03:04:02.543 --> 03:04:04.144]  We'll go out to break with more of the video.
[03:04:04.144 --> 03:04:04.444]  Here it is.
[03:04:24.198 --> 03:04:30.724]  Some of the people we're interested in are associates or supporters under investigation because they're affiliated with terrorism.
[03:04:30.724 --> 03:04:31.685]  Hit pause.
[03:04:31.685 --> 03:04:34.267]  Since this is a category... Did you hear that?
[03:04:34.267 --> 03:04:37.229]  That is the absolute key to all of this.
[03:04:37.229 --> 03:04:48.859]  When you look at all these federal reports about environmental activists, anti-war activists, the army spying domestically, illegally on mainline, anti-war, pro-life,
[03:04:49.700 --> 03:04:53.943]  Uh, pro-choice groups, everybody gets spied on by this corrupt system.
[03:04:53.943 --> 03:04:57.044]  And they're saying you're all affiliated with terrorists.
[03:04:57.044 --> 03:04:59.686]  Gun owners, veterans, everybody's a terrorist.
[03:04:59.686 --> 03:05:01.567]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.567 --> 03:05:04.569]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.569 --> 03:05:09.912]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.912 --> 03:05:11.953]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:11.953 --> 03:05:16.956]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.956 --> 03:05:17.897]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.117 --> 03:05:19.238]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.238 --> 03:05:21.141]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.141 --> 03:05:22.202]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.202 --> 03:05:24.424]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.424 --> 03:05:25.746]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.746 --> 03:05:27.288]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.288 --> 03:05:32.554]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.554 --> 03:05:35.698]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.138 --> 03:05:39.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.940 --> 03:05:41.160]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.160 --> 03:05:42.080]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:43.181]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.181 --> 03:05:44.101]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.101 --> 03:05:45.202]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.202 --> 03:05:48.263]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:05:50.024 --> 03:05:50.944]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.583 --> 03:06:05.910]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:10.436]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.436 --> 03:06:12.699]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.699 --> 03:06:14.321]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.321 --> 03:06:15.363]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.583 --> 03:06:24.007]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:07:00.911 --> 03:07:06.474]  Oh, many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[03:07:06.474 --> 03:07:07.234]  Think about that.
[03:07:07.234 --> 03:07:10.356]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[03:07:10.356 --> 03:07:13.578]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[03:07:13.578 --> 03:07:23.363]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[03:08:02.268 --> 03:08:04.509]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.509 --> 03:08:07.851]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.700 --> 03:08:24.702]  Okay, folks, we're now going to go back to the video.
[03:08:24.702 --> 03:08:25.543]  And here is the key.
[03:08:25.543 --> 03:08:29.164]  I know Curt Nemo and Paul Watson, everybody's gonna write articles on this.
[03:08:29.164 --> 03:08:38.468]  And I really think the headline should be, you know, restricted FBI training video shows
[03:08:40.097 --> 03:08:51.722]  Police being indoctrinated that general public are terrorists, or some similar headline, because they're saying here, oh, go ahead and pull people over, ask them questions, why are there millions of people on the list?
[03:08:51.722 --> 03:08:54.863]  Well, they might know a terrorist or be supporters of terrorists.
[03:08:54.863 --> 03:08:55.663]  And what have they said?
[03:08:55.663 --> 03:09:06.708]  They said, if you are anti-war, remember the Deputy Attorney General back in 2003, I'll never forget this, his last name was Calhoun, was in the Oakland Tribune
[03:09:07.898 --> 03:09:10.400]  And this was quotes from a press conference.
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:15.764]  And he said, all protesting is banned in California against the war.
[03:09:15.764 --> 03:09:23.030]  Because the war, and he was a Democrat, that was the mind control Bush had at that time.
[03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:28.834]  He said, because the war is against Al Qaeda, and so protesting the war is aiding Al Qaeda.
[03:09:28.834 --> 03:09:34.398]  And that's why when it came out that people protesting Halliburton in Houston had army intelligence
[03:09:35.599 --> 03:09:40.124]  Uh, and, uh, groups assigned to the NSA and CIA spying on them.
[03:09:40.124 --> 03:09:46.871]  And these were groups that went out front, Halliburton and handed out cookies to workers.
[03:09:46.871 --> 03:09:49.194]  So, groups with no criminal records.
[03:09:49.194 --> 03:09:56.842]  In fact, it came out in New York that the CIA was advising the FBI on Critical Mass, the bike riding group.
[03:09:58.012 --> 03:10:01.635]  Because see, the CIA does revolutions all over the world in countries it wants to overthrow.
[03:10:01.635 --> 03:10:07.120]  So it recognizes, my God, there's people saying bikes have rights and they're getting together and it's spreading.
[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:08.241]  Set them up, beat them up.
[03:10:08.241 --> 03:10:21.334]  So the FBI, advised by the CIA, all over the East Coast, you've seen the videos online, would just come up and tackle and order the police to beat up women and teenagers and people and just arrest them for riding their bikes.
[03:10:21.834 --> 03:10:23.195]  In fact, people won't believe us.
[03:10:23.195 --> 03:10:24.916]  Just Google critical mass beat up.
[03:10:24.916 --> 03:10:29.939]  Shows cops just T-boning, tackling people, slamming heads in concrete, blood all over the place.
[03:10:29.939 --> 03:10:31.540]  All CIA run, because they were scared.
[03:10:31.540 --> 03:10:33.901]  They're like, my God, people are getting together and riding bikes.
[03:10:33.901 --> 03:10:35.962]  Beat the hell out of them right now!
[03:10:35.962 --> 03:10:39.845]  Because again, they engineer fake revolutions, and they know a real one when they see it.
[03:10:39.845 --> 03:10:41.386]  So how are they going to demonize that?
[03:10:41.386 --> 03:10:42.626]  They're going to stage terror attacks.
[03:10:42.626 --> 03:10:43.687]  They're going to say militias did it.
[03:10:43.687 --> 03:10:45.488]  They're going to create fake militia groups.
[03:10:45.488 --> 03:10:50.091]  They're going to provocateur and go find unstable people to carry out terror or carry out shootings.
[03:10:50.811 --> 03:10:53.493]  They are going to radicalize, and we're going to go over that evidence coming up.
[03:10:53.493 --> 03:11:02.000]  But let's go back to the video where he's saying people are on the terror watch list because they're supporters of terrorists.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:07.664]  And they're now saying, if you are anti-war in any way, you're not going to fly.
[03:11:07.664 --> 03:11:09.165]  You're not going to own a gun.
[03:11:09.165 --> 03:11:10.006]  No fly, no buy.
[03:11:10.006 --> 03:11:10.906]  That's the new bill.
[03:11:10.906 --> 03:11:12.688]  The Attorney General says he doesn't care if it doesn't pass.
[03:11:13.857 --> 03:11:15.658]  Eric Holder is just going to say you can't own guns.
[03:11:15.658 --> 03:11:20.441]  And suddenly, people I've talked to, veterans, people with no criminal record, retired cops, can't get guns.
[03:11:20.441 --> 03:11:22.902]  And they go, sorry, can't tell you why you're on the list.
[03:11:22.902 --> 03:11:26.525]  No judge, no jury, total tyranny, overnight.
[03:11:26.525 --> 03:11:28.226]  Here's the video.
[03:11:28.226 --> 03:11:30.447]  So how does our officer handle the news?
[03:11:30.447 --> 03:11:32.088]  The way you should.
[03:11:32.088 --> 03:11:32.388]  Watch.
[03:11:32.388 --> 03:11:35.730]  Stafford County Sheriff's Office.
[03:11:35.730 --> 03:11:37.351]  Is this the Terrorist Screening Center?
[03:11:39.156 --> 03:11:45.078]  Yeah, I just made a traffic stop and the driver's name gave a category 3 hit through NCIC.
[03:11:45.078 --> 03:11:46.878]  I was advised to call you.
[03:11:46.878 --> 03:11:49.239]  And that's the name of that song.
[03:11:49.239 --> 03:11:51.140]  Call TSC.
[03:11:51.140 --> 03:11:56.441]  The screeners there can help you know for sure if the guy you stopped is really the guy on the list.
[03:11:56.441 --> 03:11:59.162]  And even if he's an exact match, he may not be a terrorist.
[03:12:00.307 --> 03:12:07.792]  Some of the people we're interested in are associates or supporters, under investigation because they're affiliated with terrorism.
[03:12:07.792 --> 03:12:19.900]  Since this is a Category 3 hit, the officer should collect information on both these people, but not let them know that law enforcement is interested in them for terrorism.
[03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:21.181]  So where are you coming from?
[03:12:21.181 --> 03:12:21.541]  Our home.
[03:12:21.541 --> 03:12:24.683]  Is that your wife?
[03:12:24.683 --> 03:12:27.145]  Girlfriend.
[03:12:27.145 --> 03:12:28.366]  Ma'am, could I see some ID please?
[03:12:37.742 --> 03:12:40.865]  Thank you.
[03:12:40.865 --> 03:12:43.347]  Next step, run the passenger's name.
[03:12:43.347 --> 03:12:44.788]  Go ahead, 217.
[03:12:44.788 --> 03:12:54.936]  Name check on Kovac, Kilo Oscar Victor, Alpha Charlie Kilo, Karen, common spelling, DOB 1983-04-09.
[03:12:54.936 --> 03:12:59.460]  With category 3 or 4 hits, you won't make any arrests that you wouldn't have otherwise.
[03:12:59.460 --> 03:13:02.162]  217, no wants, no warrants.
[03:13:02.162 --> 03:13:02.203]  217, 10-4.
[03:13:07.714 --> 03:13:14.558]  Since the results for the passenger were negative, the officer finishes his normal business for the traffic stop.
[03:13:14.558 --> 03:13:19.742]  Your signature's not an admission of guilt, it just certifies that your mailing address is correct.
[03:13:19.742 --> 03:13:22.143]  All the other instructions are on the form.
[03:13:22.143 --> 03:13:26.926]  Of course he's going to keep his eyes open for anything interesting or unusual in the car.
[03:13:26.926 --> 03:13:34.631]  That would include cameras, binoculars, video equipment, GPS, maybe things like sleeping bags that suggest... Alright, let's stop right there!
[03:13:36.397 --> 03:13:40.000]  Remember all the articles where it said a road almanac's a sign of terror?
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:45.804]  The Texas report put out by the feds, the feds write it, the state puts it out, said, wearing blue jeans, having a cell phone.
[03:13:45.804 --> 03:13:49.586]  In New York, it was a woman with a baby in a baby carriage, a man as a priest.
[03:13:49.586 --> 03:13:52.108]  The message is, everyone's a terrorist.
[03:13:52.108 --> 03:13:56.591]  All this done in the name of fighting 19 guys directed from a cave in Afghanistan.
[03:13:56.591 --> 03:14:00.434]  Now they admit, no, North Com and Homeland Security is for the American people.
[03:14:00.434 --> 03:14:01.795]  Their own reports.
[03:14:01.795 --> 03:14:04.657]  See, overnight, it's you, you're the terrorist.
[03:14:05.137 --> 03:14:09.760]  And they're saying sleeping bags, binoculars, anybody on a road trip.
[03:14:09.760 --> 03:14:14.484]  And see, then they say that's now a probable cause to search your car.
[03:14:14.484 --> 03:14:16.885]  I mean, this is all just training you to be a slave.
[03:14:16.885 --> 03:14:21.369]  And then teaching these cops that these are all excuses to go after you.
[03:14:21.369 --> 03:14:25.852]  And of course in the video, then later, the people that have suspicious stuff are guilty.
[03:14:25.852 --> 03:14:28.894]  So it also creates the false perception that people are guilty.
[03:14:28.894 --> 03:14:30.315]  Let's continue with the brainwashing.
[03:14:32.352 --> 03:14:42.799]  With the stop concluded and the suspects on their way... And the suspects on their way... The officer will talk to the terrorist screening center once again.
[03:14:42.799 --> 03:14:49.884]  This time... This time, he'll give them all the info we gathered on the car and the two people.
[03:14:49.884 --> 03:14:59.390]  And... And TSC may connect them with CT Watch as well.
[03:14:59.390 --> 03:15:00.391]  And with that, he's done.
[03:15:02.113 --> 03:15:05.655]  Now let's take a look at another call where you might meet someone on the list.
[03:15:05.655 --> 03:15:10.517]  The suspicious person call.
[03:15:10.517 --> 03:15:12.078]  See way down there?
[03:15:12.078 --> 03:15:15.520]  There's a woman taking photos of the dam.
[03:15:15.520 --> 03:15:19.922]  Someone called 911 and reported a suspicious person.
[03:15:19.922 --> 03:15:23.224]  Our officer took the call and is just arriving on the scene.
[03:15:31.414 --> 03:15:31.434]  217.
[03:15:31.434 --> 03:15:32.415]  217.
[03:15:32.415 --> 03:15:34.536]  I'm at the Smith Lake Dam.
[03:15:34.536 --> 03:15:37.237]  I have a white female in her twenties taking photos near the spillway.
[03:15:37.237 --> 03:15:39.898]  10-4, 217.
[03:15:39.898 --> 03:15:41.919]  All of you know how to interview someone.
[03:15:41.919 --> 03:15:48.002]  So let's fast forward.
[03:15:48.002 --> 03:15:51.084]  We'll pick it up after he's heard her story and gotten her ID.
[03:15:54.659 --> 03:16:09.864]  Lima Alpha November Alpha Tango Alpha First Name Maria Middle Initial A DOB 1977 0713 1977 0713 As you guessed, she's going to be a Category 3 hit.
[03:16:09.864 --> 03:16:13.965]  And since it's very important that we don't let her know, that we know.
[03:16:13.965 --> 03:16:18.126]  Both the dispatcher and the officer need to make sure she doesn't hear the radio traffic.
[03:16:18.126 --> 03:16:24.048]  217, is your radio secure?
[03:16:25.776 --> 03:16:26.136]  Stand by.
[03:16:26.136 --> 03:16:28.118]  If I could ask you to wait right here, please.
[03:16:28.118 --> 03:16:34.582]  Sure.
[03:16:34.582 --> 03:16:45.589]  What our young lady won't be able to hear is the dispatcher telling the officer that she may be associated with terrorism and that he should get information to make a positive match.
[03:16:45.589 --> 03:16:52.574]  Dispatch is also giving him the number to call for the terrorist screening center.
[03:16:52.574 --> 03:16:53.935]  Where'd you say you were taking those photo classes?
[03:16:54.528 --> 03:16:55.750]  At Stafford Community College.
[03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:58.873]  Did you get anybody's permission to shoot here?
[03:16:58.873 --> 03:17:03.098]  I didn't think I'd need anyone's permission just to take a couple of photographs.
[03:17:03.098 --> 03:17:05.220]  Please wait right here and don't take any more photographs.
[03:17:05.220 --> 03:17:07.563]  Alright, hit pause for a minute.
[03:17:08.899 --> 03:17:15.081]  I mean, notice how he keeps his eye on her and backs away like she's an 800-foot cobra dripping acid out of its fangs.
[03:17:15.081 --> 03:17:21.083]  So all of this goes on, and that's why anywhere you are in the country, cops come over while you're taking pictures of your kid and say, don't take photos.
[03:17:21.083 --> 03:17:28.425]  It's about hen-pecking us, letting us know we're slaves, while they put cameras on us, surveil everything we're doing, micromanage our lives.
[03:17:29.815 --> 03:17:29.895]  It's
[03:17:47.958 --> 03:18:01.005]  A tuition that's being paid for, the grants people are getting, the scholarships, it's all about spying and data mining and when you rent a car, buy food, everything's being looked at, everything's being tracked.
[03:18:01.005 --> 03:18:02.666]  It's disgusting.
[03:18:02.666 --> 03:18:05.428]  It's a giant panopticon prison grid.
[03:18:05.428 --> 03:18:07.269]  Back to the federal brainwashing video.
[03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:09.550]  Because of course it turns out she's a terrorist.
[03:18:11.371 --> 03:18:18.876]  And talk to one of the screeners there who will determine if this woman is really the one we're interested in or just someone else with the same name.
[03:18:18.876 --> 03:18:19.457]  Hit pause there.
[03:18:19.457 --> 03:18:29.965]  See, the feds know that a lot of people are listening with scanners, though with federal grants they're going to radio systems that scanners can't pick up, that are scrambled, de-scramblers, scramblers, de-scramblers.
[03:18:29.965 --> 03:18:38.351]  So notice they tell the slave, the minion, who's slitting his own family's throat going with the foreign bankers, they tell the cops, be sure to use a cell phone when you call it into the feds.
[03:18:39.161 --> 03:18:41.124]  You know, don't use any of the other lines.
[03:18:41.124 --> 03:18:42.205]  Don't use the radio.
[03:18:42.205 --> 03:18:44.608]  Don't relay it through the dispatcher.
[03:18:44.608 --> 03:18:45.809]  Use your cell.
[03:18:45.809 --> 03:18:47.411]  Don't talk to your locals.
[03:18:47.411 --> 03:18:50.035]  Get a relationship with the feds going.
[03:18:50.035 --> 03:18:52.037]  You don't talk to dispatch anymore.
[03:18:52.037 --> 03:18:53.579]  You work for the feds.
[03:18:53.579 --> 03:18:56.863]  If you're a good officer, we'll teach you how to ship heroin and cocaine in.
[03:18:56.863 --> 03:18:57.965]  Let's continue with the video.
[03:18:59.164 --> 03:19:04.708]  In the case of this young lady, she really is the person on the watch list.
[03:19:04.708 --> 03:19:11.452]  And TSC has asked him to get more info on her without letting her know that we're interested.
[03:19:11.452 --> 03:19:14.634]  Let's see how he handles it.
[03:19:14.634 --> 03:19:18.436]  Ma'am, this is government property and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
[03:19:18.436 --> 03:19:19.017]  Why?
[03:19:19.017 --> 03:19:20.818]  I'm not hurting anything.
[03:19:20.818 --> 03:19:23.960]  The park manager doesn't want anyone down here and I need you to leave with me.
[03:19:25.487 --> 03:19:25.908]  Alright.
[03:19:38.018 --> 03:19:39.320]  Look, we got 40 minutes left.
[03:19:39.320 --> 03:19:40.621]  I want to take a few phone calls.
[03:19:40.621 --> 03:19:51.534]  I also want to go through some of the history of provocateurs and government staging terror and what's happening with the militia movement right now, how the establishment is desperate to provocateur some violent action.
[03:19:51.534 --> 03:19:55.599]  That's all coming up after this quick break in the final 40 minutes.
[03:19:55.599 --> 03:19:57.422]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[03:20:01.733 --> 03:20:07.457]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:20:07.457 --> 03:20:08.797]  And we knew what to do.
[03:20:08.797 --> 03:20:10.799]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:20:10.799 --> 03:20:17.803]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:20:17.803 --> 03:20:26.348]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:20:26.727 --> 03:20:33.816]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:20:33.816 --> 03:20:37.001]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:20:37.001 --> 03:20:42.047]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:20:42.748 --> 03:20:45.832]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:20:45.832 --> 03:20:51.900]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:20:51.900 --> 03:20:54.824]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:20:54.824 --> 03:20:59.771]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:21:01.218 --> 03:21:01.759]  Good day.
[03:21:01.759 --> 03:21:03.441]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:21:03.441 --> 03:21:03.921]  September 1st, 2009.
[03:21:03.921 --> 03:21:04.843]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5110.
[03:21:04.843 --> 03:21:08.247]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7828, $4.8914 for a half-ounce, or $2.4457 for a quarter-ounce.
[03:21:08.247 --> 03:21:08.767]  That's $9.7828, $4.8914, or $2.4457.
[03:21:21.221 --> 03:21:34.827]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:21:34.827 --> 03:21:43.671]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:21:43.671 --> 03:21:44.771]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:21:44.771 --> 03:21:48.893]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:21:49.113 --> 03:21:53.097]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:53.097 --> 03:21:55.019]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:21:55.019 --> 03:21:55.479]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:55.479 --> 03:22:00.064]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:00.064 --> 03:22:05.209]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:22:05.209 --> 03:22:10.674]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[03:22:10.954 --> 03:22:15.356]  A family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[03:22:15.356 --> 03:22:19.298]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:19.298 --> 03:22:21.258]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:22:21.258 --> 03:22:25.080]  Galben Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[03:22:25.080 --> 03:22:27.201]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:22:27.641 --> 03:22:32.847]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[03:22:43.238 --> 03:22:44.519]  Don't take my word for it.

[03:22:57.832 --> 03:22:59.454]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:23:01.323 --> 03:23:05.846]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:23:05.846 --> 03:23:08.408]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:23:08.408 --> 03:23:09.289]  He was devastated.
[03:23:09.289 --> 03:23:18.075]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:23:18.075 --> 03:23:24.300]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:23:24.300 --> 03:23:26.982]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:23:26.982 --> 03:23:29.363]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[03:23:30.504 --> 03:23:30.824]  I think so.
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:54.664]  Own Myself dot com.
[03:23:54.664 --> 03:23:55.867]  It takes very little money.
[03:23:55.867 --> 03:23:58.454]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:23:58.454 --> 03:24:00.941]  Remember, chocolate dot own myself dot com.
[03:24:14.395 --> 03:24:16.836]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[03:24:16.836 --> 03:24:18.297]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:24:18.297 --> 03:24:24.920]  I want to take a few calls right now, and then I'm going to get back into the history of government provocateuring.
[03:24:24.920 --> 03:24:36.285]  How the government doesn't just provocateur, they create and they command the white supremacists, the black supremacists, the Mecha, the La Raza, which means for our race, everything else outside the race, nothing.
[03:24:36.285 --> 03:24:37.746]  The race.
[03:24:37.746 --> 03:24:40.687]  To get everybody fighting with each other, all the big offshore banks
[03:24:42.762 --> 03:24:45.865]  Basically rule over us and play us off against each other.
[03:24:45.865 --> 03:24:49.448]  But we had a police officer send us some info.
[03:24:49.448 --> 03:24:51.730]  He gives us his name, but I don't want to give it on air.
[03:24:51.730 --> 03:24:53.752]  I may get him to pop in in a minute.
[03:24:53.752 --> 03:24:57.035]  I'm a lieutenant in a large sheriff's office in Florida.
[03:24:57.035 --> 03:25:01.199]  I had to show that video to all my roll calls approximately two months ago.
[03:25:01.199 --> 03:25:02.900]  Good job for bringing it out.
[03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:03.121]  Mark.
[03:25:04.116 --> 03:25:07.978]  And we'll see if we can get Mark on a line without using his full name just to pop in.
[03:25:07.978 --> 03:25:11.741]  We do have some other police officers calling in, and former police officers.
[03:25:11.741 --> 03:25:20.286]  But let's talk to Steve in New York quickly, saying an officer gave him, in-game, my film about the World Population Reduction Plan from their own words.
[03:25:20.286 --> 03:25:24.448]  So again, the police, we're getting reports confirmed of them handing out my films everywhere.
[03:25:24.448 --> 03:25:26.610]  So we don't wanna be enemies with the police.
[03:25:26.610 --> 03:25:29.151]  They're starting to wake up to what's happening.
[03:25:29.151 --> 03:25:31.593]  And the Hitlers that run this country are in a lot of trouble.
[03:25:32.673 --> 03:25:36.055]  Kirk in London, we'll get to you after we talk to Stephen Hollis.
[03:25:36.055 --> 03:25:39.037]  Okay, Stephen, New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:25:39.037 --> 03:25:40.017]  Yes, hello sir.
[03:25:40.017 --> 03:25:43.960]  I met an ESU officer in New York.
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:45.781]  It's an emergency service unit.
[03:25:45.781 --> 03:25:51.264]  He's the epitome of a jack-booted thug, as you would say.
[03:25:51.264 --> 03:25:55.386]  And I met him and I was going to give him a copy of the bomb deception.
[03:25:55.386 --> 03:25:59.248]  He's a friend of my father-in-law and I'm talking to him.
[03:25:59.764 --> 03:26:07.289]  And he had copies of Endgame, and all your movies in his pocket, and all his team, the most elite unit in New York City Police.
[03:26:07.289 --> 03:26:12.753]  And he's high up there, and they all are on board, which I was like, very ecstatic about.
[03:26:12.753 --> 03:26:22.279]  So you're saying, you're saying, one of the most elite teams in New York City, and folks- Yes, emergency services unit, you can look it up.
[03:26:22.279 --> 03:26:23.180]  Well, when I would-
[03:26:24.028 --> 03:26:32.812]  Just to back this up, when I would go to 9-11 events five, six years ago, we'd have cops trying to trip us, firemen yelling at us, maybe half of them.
[03:26:32.812 --> 03:26:34.613]  The other half saying, good job, good job.
[03:26:34.613 --> 03:26:39.296]  Now, when I go to 9-11 events in the last two years, the cops are buying us food.
[03:26:39.296 --> 03:26:40.676]  They're slapping us on the back.
[03:26:40.676 --> 03:26:43.018]  Commanders are going, like you, Alex Jones.
[03:26:43.018 --> 03:26:44.258]  We've even got a few clips of this.
[03:26:44.258 --> 03:26:45.459]  Then they'll go, I don't want to be on camera.
[03:26:45.979 --> 03:26:55.546]  I mean, with the cops basically almost carrying us on their shoulders in New York, because we show them all the footage of the police saying, get back, the government's going to blow up Building 7, and that's their own officers.
[03:26:55.546 --> 03:27:02.031]  We interview the cops that say they blew up the towers, so the other cops found out about this, and then instantly, they're all waking up.
[03:27:02.031 --> 03:27:07.175]  So you're saying he was totally on board with the New World Order, and now he has all the films?
[03:27:07.175 --> 03:27:09.197]  These are the guys in the black uniforms.
[03:27:09.197 --> 03:27:09.917]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:27:09.917 --> 03:27:11.839]  These are the guys in the black uniforms.
[03:27:11.839 --> 03:27:13.420]  The Hercules teams.
[03:27:13.420 --> 03:27:13.560]  Yes.
[03:27:15.675 --> 03:27:17.116]  And so what were they saying?
[03:27:17.116 --> 03:27:19.056]  What were they saying?
[03:27:19.056 --> 03:27:21.798]  They were saying, uh, well I'm talking to one individual.
[03:27:21.798 --> 03:27:24.919]  You were saying that he was saying the whole unit's a lie.
[03:27:24.919 --> 03:27:36.644]  He's a high ranking officer in that unit, that's all I'm saying, but he was, his team is on board, and I was trying to give him, I tried to approach him very softly, because I didn't know how he came at it.
[03:27:36.644 --> 03:27:41.826]  So, I gave him like top of the bound reception, he's got end game, he's got a vote to tear in his pocket, he's giving it to me.
[03:27:42.546 --> 03:27:44.527]  And he said, hey buddy, I don't need that video.
[03:27:44.527 --> 03:27:46.509]  I got Alex Jones videos right here.
[03:27:46.509 --> 03:27:49.311]  He's giving endgame like I already saw endgame.
[03:27:49.311 --> 03:27:52.053]  You know, I try to soften him up a little bit, you know, when I meet somebody.
[03:27:52.053 --> 03:27:52.693]  It's unbelievable.
[03:27:52.693 --> 03:27:55.435]  We're making history thanks to people like you out there.
[03:27:55.435 --> 03:27:57.676]  Anything else, Steve?
[03:27:57.676 --> 03:27:59.778]  Uh, it's about it, Alex.
[03:27:59.778 --> 03:28:00.799]  Good to hear from you.
[03:28:00.799 --> 03:28:04.141]  Hollis is a former SWAT team member from Indiana.
[03:28:04.141 --> 03:28:08.364]  We're just taking random calls here and we've got the folks calling in about this.
[03:28:08.364 --> 03:28:09.965]  Hollis, what's your point today, sir?
[03:28:10.882 --> 03:28:11.963]  Uh, yes sir.
[03:28:11.963 --> 03:28:15.265]  I just wanted to say, I've been listening to you for years, since 2001.
[03:28:15.265 --> 03:28:26.112]  I actually found out about you through David Icke, and uh, I was a former SWAT team member here in Indiana, and uh, um, you guys woke me up.
[03:28:26.112 --> 03:28:29.334]  You woke me up to, uh, I became conscious.
[03:28:29.334 --> 03:28:39.121]  And um, I was one of those guys that, like I heard an actress say in a movie, I would have jumped a speeding motorcycle over a train for any kind of, you know, that kind of stuff.
[03:28:39.975 --> 03:28:41.836]  And I woke up.
[03:28:41.836 --> 03:28:49.138]  I found out that there is a cabal in this country that has taken over our country.
[03:28:49.138 --> 03:28:55.339]  And I have turned several offices on to your information.
[03:28:55.339 --> 03:28:58.900]  They weren't aware of what's going on in this country.
[03:28:58.900 --> 03:29:05.002]  And it's unbelievable.
[03:29:05.002 --> 03:29:07.643]  The country I grew up in that was supposed to
[03:29:09.372 --> 03:29:13.594]  Look out for people's rights and we're doing the exact opposite.
[03:29:13.594 --> 03:29:18.296]  We're no longer a land of the free.
[03:29:18.296 --> 03:29:18.877]  Absolutely.
[03:29:18.877 --> 03:29:20.878]  Well, people hoped that Obama would fix that.
[03:29:20.878 --> 03:29:25.640]  Now they're finding out people hope Bush would fix what Clinton did and they hoped Obama would fix what Bush is doing.
[03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:28.501]  They're just front men and puppets.
[03:29:28.501 --> 03:29:34.704]  And what did you think of the last guy calling in about that unit of police waking up?
[03:29:36.226 --> 03:29:46.454]  Yes, it's a few officers I've spoken to and like I said, they're waking up and recently with this flu vaccine thing.
[03:29:46.454 --> 03:29:47.995]  Stay there, I want to hear about that.
[03:29:47.995 --> 03:29:50.197]  I want to hear about that when we get back.
[03:29:50.197 --> 03:29:51.698]  We are really fighting the New World Order.
[03:29:51.698 --> 03:29:53.099]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.099 --> 03:29:54.700]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.700 --> 03:29:58.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.018 --> 03:30:05.262]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.262 --> 03:30:07.263]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.263 --> 03:30:15.791]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.791 --> 03:30:21.335]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.335 --> 03:30:22.957]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.197 --> 03:30:29.721]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.721 --> 03:30:40.768]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.768 --> 03:30:41.228]  That's right.

[03:31:04.266 --> 03:31:05.246]  Well, you should.

[03:32:12.065 --> 03:32:13.486]  Garden in a can.

[03:33:20.756 --> 03:33:24.718]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, continuing with your phone calls.
[03:33:24.718 --> 03:33:29.219]  Hollis in Indiana, former SWAT team member, says we woke him up in 2001.
[03:33:29.219 --> 03:33:36.742]  You're trying to make a point about the police really waking up now that you know because of the flu shot, the talk of quarantine, the talk of locking down cities.
[03:33:36.742 --> 03:33:38.283]  Now, we're not saying that's going to happen.
[03:33:39.045 --> 03:33:44.208]  The Feds are saying under Level 6, under UN Directorate, they may do it.
[03:33:44.208 --> 03:33:46.589]  And they're kind of doing a trial balloon right now.
[03:33:46.589 --> 03:33:48.470]  I don't think it's going to be successful.
[03:33:48.470 --> 03:33:52.812]  Just like they tried to model state's Health Emergency Powers Act in 2002, 2003.
[03:33:52.812 --> 03:33:56.874]  Tried to force smallpox shots on 14 million first responders.
[03:33:56.874 --> 03:33:58.475]  Doctors, nurses, firemen, police.
[03:33:59.315 --> 03:34:05.602]  City workers, county workers, federal workers, and the LA Times reported 99 plus percent said no.
[03:34:05.602 --> 03:34:14.191]  Only 4,000 said yes to the smallpox shot, and it caused some autoimmune response in people's heart valves, and a bunch of people died of heart attacks.
[03:34:14.191 --> 03:34:14.892]  So they stopped it.
[03:34:14.892 --> 03:34:20.078]  Remember when Tommy Thompson, head of Health and Human Services, wouldn't take
[03:34:20.638 --> 03:34:28.588]  The shot himself and the whole program fell apart, so they're going to try again and try the next time and there are some fools, sucker born every minute as P.T.
[03:34:28.588 --> 03:34:32.172]  Barnum said, lined up getting the old last year's flu shot.
[03:34:32.935 --> 03:34:38.537]  Give you no protection from this year's normal flu, or the supposed dreaded swine flu.
[03:34:38.537 --> 03:34:39.117]  They don't care.
[03:34:39.117 --> 03:34:44.839]  They're lying just like they admit Gardasil doesn't protect little girls from the human papillomavirus.
[03:34:44.839 --> 03:34:46.260]  It says it on the insert.
[03:34:46.260 --> 03:34:47.000]  They still take it.
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:54.263]  In fact, people, search engine, go to startpage.com, that's a good search engine, or google.com, and just type in Gardasil deaths.
[03:34:54.263 --> 03:34:59.725]  Let's do that for people right now on screen, and you can just read all about all the deaths, but people don't care.
[03:35:01.328 --> 03:35:05.270]  And it's so sad because they just buy into the nanny government wants to take care of them.
[03:35:05.270 --> 03:35:20.176]  No, the White House science czar says they want to use vaccines to sterilize you, and put sterilants in the water to sterilize you, and have a planetary government to carry out the orderly extermination of 80% of the world's population.
[03:35:20.176 --> 03:35:23.737]  Eco-science, but read it for yourself.
[03:35:23.737 --> 03:35:25.518]  People say, oh, he wrote this decades ago.
[03:35:25.518 --> 03:35:26.098]  Oh, really?
[03:35:26.098 --> 03:35:27.739]  We have him saying this stuff in 96.
[03:35:27.739 --> 03:35:30.300]  It's all coming up in the new film.
[03:35:31.769 --> 03:35:34.913]  Death toll linked to Gardasil vaccines rises.
[03:35:34.913 --> 03:35:40.600]  Companies include shock, foaming at the mouth, convulsions, and coma.
[03:35:40.600 --> 03:35:43.664]  That's WorldNet Daily, but you can click to Judicial Watch Hazard.
[03:35:43.664 --> 03:35:46.307]  It was also CBS News right there for you.
[03:35:48.715 --> 03:35:56.081]  But see, when I was reading the trials three years ago, and the large percentage of deaths and coma, and it's like Ebola.
[03:35:56.081 --> 03:36:00.304]  Blood starts pouring out of every orifice, the corners of the eyes, the ears, the mouth.
[03:36:00.304 --> 03:36:02.186]  I mean, it's just, we've shown video of it.
[03:36:02.186 --> 03:36:06.089]  We've had mothers on whose daughters are now in wheelchairs.
[03:36:06.089 --> 03:36:09.251]  I mean, and they give them one shot and they have a convulsion.
[03:36:09.251 --> 03:36:11.593]  Second shot a month later, bloody welts.
[03:36:11.593 --> 03:36:14.095]  And they go, give them the third, we promise it's not the shot.
[03:36:14.095 --> 03:36:14.716]  Give them the shot.
[03:36:15.576 --> 03:36:21.164]  And they go, hey, Gardasil's got a federal liability protection.
[03:36:21.164 --> 03:36:24.209]  Your daughter's dead and there's nothing they can do about it.
[03:36:24.209 --> 03:36:25.551]  Ha ha ha ha!
[03:36:25.551 --> 03:36:28.234]  It's all real funny when you're a eugenicist.
[03:36:28.956 --> 03:36:33.800]  And again, that's all covered in my film, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:43.549]  Nerve gassing our own troops, sterilizing children, sterilizing women, marching troops into chambers and nerve gassing them, radiating foster children to death.
[03:36:43.549 --> 03:36:46.592]  It's all in my film, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:36:46.592 --> 03:36:51.076]  Free on YouTube and Google, or if you want the DVD, get it at InfoWars.com.
[03:36:51.076 --> 03:36:52.057]  That's how you support us.
[03:36:52.057 --> 03:36:53.978]  And I do want to point out, you can pre-order
[03:36:54.827 --> 03:37:16.664]  Camp FEMA, proving all the FEMA camps, all the programs, congressmen, FEMA camp survivors, civilian inmate labor camp program, where the camps are, how they're operating, how they're being set up, how they're going to roll them out as emergency relocation community centers, the mobile vans, the youth corps, that film I consulted on and I'm in, you can pre-order it right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:37:16.664 --> 03:37:23.509]  Going back to Hollis, Hollis in Indiana, you were going to finish what you were saying about the flu shot before I went into a five minute rant.
[03:37:24.541 --> 03:37:36.088]  Yes, it's just that I advised several of the officers not to take that shot because I told them it will kill you or seriously injure you.
[03:37:36.088 --> 03:37:37.469]  And a lot of them weren't aware of it.
[03:37:37.469 --> 03:37:46.034]  You know, they weren't aware of the squalene and the mercury and the mirosol and everything else in those shots.
[03:37:46.034 --> 03:37:50.197]  And also, I was one of the ones that wouldn't allow my child to get the
[03:37:51.317 --> 03:37:54.980]  The HPV shot, the cervical cancer shot.
[03:37:54.980 --> 03:38:03.006]  You know, I went through the medical exemption thing and I remember the nurse looking at me like I wasn't supposed to know that, you know, but it was through a
[03:38:04.548 --> 03:38:08.990]  Shows like yours that let me know that that's what's going on, you know?
[03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:14.392]  Well, that's when you know it's tyranny, is when you see on the news every year when school starts, you must take all the shots.
[03:38:14.392 --> 03:38:19.394]  Now it's 60-something, just 20-something a decade ago, and it's the law and there's no exemption.
[03:38:19.394 --> 03:38:26.196]  And a lot of schools get, well, all of them get the bonus money if they get like 97%, depends on the formula, vaccinated.
[03:38:26.196 --> 03:38:29.557]  And so the nurses and people are told, you lose your job if you don't do this.
[03:38:29.557 --> 03:38:31.258]  So they'll lie and say there is no exemption for them.
[03:38:31.658 --> 03:38:32.899]  You'll go, well, you have to give it to me.
[03:38:32.899 --> 03:38:33.900]  It's law.
[03:38:33.900 --> 03:38:34.420]  No, there isn't.
[03:38:34.420 --> 03:38:35.521]  There isn't one.
[03:38:35.521 --> 03:38:37.182]  Then you got to go to the health department and get it.
[03:38:37.182 --> 03:38:43.887]  But you know you're in tyranny when they've turned the nurse and the principal into Nazi thugs and they're lying, going, you must take the shot.
[03:38:43.887 --> 03:38:44.628]  No, there's no exemption.
[03:38:44.628 --> 03:38:46.209]  And they've got it right there behind them.
[03:38:46.209 --> 03:38:48.491]  And they're going, I get that bonus if I lie.
[03:38:48.491 --> 03:38:51.032]  I want to take that trip to Cancun.
[03:38:51.032 --> 03:38:51.913]  No, you've got to take the shot.
[03:38:51.913 --> 03:38:54.455]  Then your daughter dies or has convulsions and is brain damaged.
[03:38:54.455 --> 03:38:55.616]  And they just laugh at you.
[03:38:55.616 --> 03:39:01.060]  And if you go get in their face at school, they pick the phone up and go, get a SWAT team in here immediately.
[03:39:02.344 --> 03:39:03.705]  Exactly.
[03:39:03.705 --> 03:39:06.326]  Yeah.
[03:39:06.326 --> 03:39:10.569]  Sometimes you have to, uh, you got to laugh at it to keep from crying.
[03:39:10.569 --> 03:39:12.930]  Cause it's, it's, it's, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:39:12.930 --> 03:39:23.477]  Um, and um, and I said a year ago to my wife that, uh, that when, when the, when the stuff hits the fan, there's going to be a mass run for the exits and we're not going to be able to leave.
[03:39:23.477 --> 03:39:26.959]  And sure enough, they're coming out with all these things like the, um,
[03:39:28.284 --> 03:39:32.127]  Where you put up all kind of watch lists and everything else.
[03:39:32.127 --> 03:39:33.808]  And like I said, I'm a police officer.
[03:39:33.808 --> 03:39:39.091]  And I believe in, even though I'm a police officer, I believe in people's civil rights.
[03:39:39.091 --> 03:39:43.954]  Well that's your rights, that's your children's rights.
[03:39:43.954 --> 03:39:49.157]  My children, my grandchildren, they're going to be the next generation that's going to be coming up.
[03:39:49.157 --> 03:39:53.400]  And I don't want them to be living in a Blade Runner kind of world.
[03:39:54.352 --> 03:39:55.473]  It's going to be worse than that.
[03:39:55.473 --> 03:39:56.654]  God bless you, sir.
[03:39:56.654 --> 03:39:59.557]  It's going to be worse.
[03:39:59.557 --> 03:40:12.410]  Like I said, I see things that a lot of people don't see, and sometimes it's so maddening to me I have to sometimes step back away from it just to cool off from it.
[03:40:14.042 --> 03:40:22.232]  And I have a officer, a friend, also he's a pastor, and he actually said he actually had to step away from the church.
[03:40:22.232 --> 03:40:25.577]  He said either I was crazy or I knew what I was talking about.
[03:40:25.577 --> 03:40:28.861]  So I told him, I said, look, just go investigate it yourself.
[03:40:28.861 --> 03:40:30.322]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:40:30.322 --> 03:40:31.324]  Check into it yourself.
[03:40:35.209 --> 03:40:38.651]  He stepped away from the church and he said he found out what I was saying was all true.
[03:40:38.651 --> 03:40:47.435]  And he stepped back and he went back to his church and he started telling everybody in his church what's going on.
[03:40:47.435 --> 03:40:48.295]  God bless you, sir.
[03:40:48.295 --> 03:40:49.035]  Good to hear from you.
[03:40:49.035 --> 03:40:50.136]  Keep calling.
[03:40:50.136 --> 03:40:52.397]  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing that's happening here.
[03:40:52.397 --> 03:40:56.159]  Remember three years ago when we broke on this network?
[03:40:56.159 --> 03:40:58.340]  Pastor Butch, Paul actually is the one that broke it.
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:41:02.722]  Then I separately had another pastor send me the info and I had them both on and that's when it got big.
[03:41:03.931 --> 03:41:21.017]  Hundreds of pages of secret FEMA documents about how they'd already covertly trained 13,000 pastors of major churches to tell their flocks, go to FEMA camps, take shots, turn in your guns, go along with socialism, or you're not Christian.
[03:41:21.017 --> 03:41:24.838]  And we broke this and people thought the documents were fake.
[03:41:24.838 --> 03:41:31.961]  And then the feds went and checked phone records and tracked, and we were already under surveillance, and tracked back the preacher and went and threatened him.
[03:41:33.917 --> 03:41:49.621]  Then, a year and a half later, it came out on the news that clergy response teams, just Google the term clergy response teams, and you can watch, saying, oh yes, the preachers, Romans 13, do what government says it's of God, submit, which is what Hitler's favorite quote, Romans 13.
[03:41:49.621 --> 03:41:51.261]  He used that on the Germans.
[03:41:51.261 --> 03:41:52.442]  That was the main reason they did it.
[03:41:52.442 --> 03:41:54.622]  They said, it's of Jesus to do what I say.
[03:41:54.622 --> 03:41:56.923]  And they went, Heil Hitler!
[03:41:56.923 --> 03:41:59.883]  And literally went off the edge of the cliff with him.
[03:41:59.883 --> 03:42:01.824]  And so, that happened.
[03:42:02.890 --> 03:42:06.592]  And then now, the last documents we got were in 2008.
[03:42:06.592 --> 03:42:09.874]  They had doubled the clergy response to 26,000.
[03:42:09.874 --> 03:42:25.922]  InfraGard, the last numbers we got were 2008, was 55,000 executives are now armed national security spies with 007 license to kill their employees during martial law.
[03:42:25.922 --> 03:42:28.363]  And that's mainstream news.
[03:42:28.363 --> 03:42:31.004]  I mean, they just got spies all over the place.
[03:42:33.763 --> 03:42:49.998]  Now we suddenly see preachers on TV going, take the shot, turn in your guns, it's of the Lord, don't criticize government, Jesus says support what the government says, and it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[03:42:49.998 --> 03:42:56.625]  I mean, this country is being taken over by scientific corporate offshore banks, and they mean business.
[03:42:57.984 --> 03:43:17.563]  Briefly, because I want to get into these documents, but Mark, I don't want you to say your full name or where you're calling from, but you're saying that you as a current police officer, as a lieutenant, that you're forced to show your roll call, or the police officers at the start of the shift, the video that you just heard us air.
[03:43:17.563 --> 03:43:19.584]  Hi, Alex.
[03:43:19.584 --> 03:43:21.867]  Yes, they provide a DVD.
[03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:33.835]  And we were to show it to each of the roll calls, which we did, and there's a sign-up sheet that each officer has to sign that says that he watched the video.
[03:43:33.835 --> 03:43:35.656]  Did the officers buy it?
[03:43:35.656 --> 03:43:41.538]  I mean, do they now think that every young lady is a murdering terrorist?
[03:43:41.538 --> 03:43:45.940]  You know, there wasn't a whole lot of discussion over it.
[03:43:45.940 --> 03:43:50.042]  I think they just watched it and they went on.
[03:43:50.042 --> 03:43:51.583]  There wasn't any discussion with me.
[03:43:52.675 --> 03:43:57.298]  And, um, they may have disgusted themselves, but, uh, I don't know.
[03:43:57.298 --> 03:44:02.142]  But, I mean, do they believe that they're just terrorists under every table?
[03:44:02.142 --> 03:44:03.763]  No, I don't think so.
[03:44:03.763 --> 03:44:04.943]  No.
[03:44:04.943 --> 03:44:10.387]  But, I mean, you heard my analysis of it then, if you sent us an email during the transmission of this video and audio.
[03:44:10.387 --> 03:44:14.350]  I mean, did you see the same manipulation in the video I saw?
[03:44:16.383 --> 03:44:20.544]  Yes, I did, but that's because I'm woken up to the whole thing.
[03:44:20.544 --> 03:44:24.346]  And there's a lot of deputies that have, not as many as I'd like.
[03:44:24.346 --> 03:44:26.346]  But yeah, I saw.
[03:44:26.346 --> 03:44:31.648]  As a matter of fact, I wanted to run my own thing through there because of my internet activity and stuff.
[03:44:31.648 --> 03:44:33.569]  I figured they even had me on there, to be honest with you.
[03:44:35.799 --> 03:44:36.740]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:44:36.740 --> 03:44:39.503]  And if we give in to this chilling effect, it's over.
[03:44:39.503 --> 03:44:40.964]  People ask me why I'm not worried about it.
[03:44:40.964 --> 03:44:42.866]  Look, my children have no future.
[03:44:42.866 --> 03:44:45.428]  And I love other people's kids as much as I love mine.
[03:44:45.428 --> 03:44:46.569]  I love their innocence.
[03:44:46.569 --> 03:44:47.791]  I love the sparkle in their eyes.
[03:44:47.791 --> 03:44:49.152]  I love how good they are.
[03:44:49.152 --> 03:44:56.799]  And over my dead body, am I going to let a bunch of offshore banks study all the scientific tyrannies of the last hundred years and then
[03:44:57.620 --> 03:44:58.460]  Perfected.
[03:44:58.460 --> 03:45:01.022]  They call it the final revolution.
[03:45:01.022 --> 03:45:03.203]  They call it the ultimate tyranny.
[03:45:03.203 --> 03:45:04.884]  And they think it's cute and funny.
[03:45:04.884 --> 03:45:07.065]  It's not cute and funny to me.
[03:45:07.065 --> 03:45:11.987]  And I know that they've played police and the people off against each other at a primitive level.
[03:45:11.987 --> 03:45:12.847]  I've bought into that.
[03:45:12.847 --> 03:45:23.432]  But you notice, if you've been listening, I've kind of woken up to that, that really the police, I'm beginning to realize, are our greatest ally because they're really getting it because they're on the inside of this and know I'm telling the truth.
[03:45:23.432 --> 03:45:26.254]  If the police will just look at what I'm saying, they're going to have my same
[03:45:26.994 --> 03:45:33.039]  level of desperation to warn people, because this is real tyranny.
[03:45:33.039 --> 03:45:34.780]  This isn't boss hog corruption.
[03:45:34.780 --> 03:45:39.524]  If this was just boss hog corruption, I would fight it, but I'd work eight hours a day and it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[03:45:39.524 --> 03:45:40.865]  This isn't boss hog corruption.
[03:45:40.865 --> 03:45:43.727]  This is what Hitler came out of, but worse.
[03:45:43.727 --> 03:45:47.610]  Hitler thanked American eugenicists in Mein Kampf.
[03:45:47.610 --> 03:45:49.611]  He thanked them in his speeches.
[03:45:49.611 --> 03:45:54.255]  He thanked the people that the White House science czar quotes as his idols.
[03:45:55.035 --> 03:46:00.117]  So, we're in a crisis, and everybody's under effect of this.
[03:46:00.117 --> 03:46:06.580]  They are chemtrailing us, they are poisoning the water, it is on record, and this is the big kahuna.
[03:46:06.580 --> 03:46:08.501]  Do people have the will to face the truth?
[03:46:08.501 --> 03:46:09.421]  I don't know.
[03:46:09.421 --> 03:46:11.302]  All I know is it's real.
[03:46:11.302 --> 03:46:13.503]  As for me, I'm standing up to it.
[03:46:13.503 --> 03:46:14.864]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[03:46:14.864 --> 03:46:20.046]  No, law enforcement is just like the everyday guy.
[03:46:20.046 --> 03:46:21.747]  They realize something's wrong.
[03:46:21.747 --> 03:46:23.428]  A lot of them can't put their finger on it.
[03:46:23.428 --> 03:46:23.888]  They don't know.
[03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:27.132]  There's more and more come to light.
[03:46:27.132 --> 03:46:28.372]  I think they're seeing it.
[03:46:28.372 --> 03:46:29.413]  I agree with you.
[03:46:29.413 --> 03:46:33.556]  They're in law enforcement closer to it than anybody else.
[03:46:33.556 --> 03:46:35.797]  So they're going to see it, I think, a little bit quicker.
[03:46:35.797 --> 03:46:42.501]  But I do have a question for you that's been bugging me, and I actually wanted to bounce off of you, if you've got a minute.
[03:46:42.501 --> 03:46:44.523]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:46:44.523 --> 03:46:52.228]  At our agency, our sheriff has hired two federal law enforcement officers who he has given
[03:46:53.520 --> 03:46:57.765]  Yes, that's a Pentagon National Security classified directive.
[03:47:17.646 --> 03:47:21.708]  And they've been doing it for at least 15 years.
[03:47:21.708 --> 03:47:30.111]  First they did it to secure drug corridors for heroin and cocaine coming into the United States without other cops, other lower level officers busting them.
[03:47:30.111 --> 03:47:35.634]  The problem is the local police kept busting CIA routes, you know, tractor trailers full of cocaine.
[03:47:35.634 --> 03:47:40.576]  The FBI would come into Texas in one case and, you know, take the three tons and disappear with it.
[03:47:40.576 --> 03:47:43.437]  So the excuse was they started with corrupt police.
[03:47:43.437 --> 03:47:46.018]  Then they came in, and you can look all this up,
[03:47:46.977 --> 03:47:52.062]  Then they came in and federalized with federal grants and homeland security money.
[03:47:53.238 --> 03:48:11.365]  And they would also use local political slush funds to run former FBI, former DEA, former Special Forces, former Defense Intelligence, former Army Security Agency, former Navy Security Agency, former Naval Intelligence.
[03:48:11.365 --> 03:48:18.387]  And if you look, more than half of your sheriffs and people, and even mayors now, are spooks.
[03:48:18.387 --> 03:48:19.588]  They're operatives.
[03:48:20.478 --> 03:48:29.965]  This has come out, I mean it goes way back to the 60's and LA is completely CIA run and the Vikings and all those sub-police groups that are really a mafia.
[03:48:29.965 --> 03:48:43.795]  So, so all of that is going on and so now, Google this, local police departments everywhere are getting money to put regular Army and Marine Corps liaisons in their intelligence unit.
[03:48:43.795 --> 03:48:47.858]  And so, not just, first it started in places near bases, now it's everywhere.
[03:48:50.157 --> 03:48:59.620]  So they're fully munializing, is the term, or federalizing you, and through the Threat Integration Fusion Centers, is the cover name.
[03:48:59.620 --> 03:49:01.601]  Oh, we got a free National Guard Armory.
[03:49:01.601 --> 03:49:03.202]  This is gonna be the new Threat Fusion Center.
[03:49:03.202 --> 03:49:08.083]  You get a nice big office, Lieutenant, and you're gonna have Colonel Johnson over you.
[03:49:08.083 --> 03:49:11.985]  By the way, we're gonna be doing a gun confiscation drill this week.
[03:49:11.985 --> 03:49:14.346]  Oh, the Marines wanna drop by and do a DWI.
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:16.940]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[03:49:44.473 --> 03:49:57.783]  Our sheriff, I went to high school with, so I know he doesn't have that background, but maybe they've gotten him, made him, he's very politically oriented, just like every sheriff, so I guess they've probably gotten to him, you know.
[03:49:57.783 --> 03:50:08.072]  Well yeah, a lot of these are good ol' boys that are like, listen, we can give you some federal help here, and we'll help you run for state office if you do good, sheriff.
[03:50:08.933 --> 03:50:10.033]  Thank you.
[03:50:38.851 --> 03:50:39.731]  You bet.
[03:50:39.731 --> 03:50:45.673]  You know, I'm tempted to do 10 minutes of overdrive today because I promised to get to all these documents.
[03:50:45.673 --> 03:50:47.473]  And you know what?
[03:50:47.473 --> 03:50:48.414]  10 minutes of overdrive.
[03:50:48.414 --> 03:50:51.635]  We're going to do 10 minutes of overdrive, then my interview with the TV network.
[03:50:51.635 --> 03:50:52.795]  But I'm going to do 10 minutes of overdrive.
[03:50:52.795 --> 03:50:54.675]  It'll be internet only.
[03:50:54.675 --> 03:50:57.936]  The final segment on AM and FM is coming up after this quick segment.
[03:50:57.936 --> 03:50:59.397]  InfoWars.com.
[03:50:59.397 --> 03:50:59.837]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.886 --> 03:51:03.927]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[03:51:03.927 --> 03:51:06.868]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[03:51:06.868 --> 03:51:09.109]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[03:51:09.109 --> 03:51:10.090]  Here's the story.
[03:51:10.090 --> 03:51:14.892]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[03:51:14.892 --> 03:51:16.132]  Now here's the bad news.
[03:51:16.132 --> 03:51:19.414]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[03:51:19.554 --> 03:51:19.874]  We're good.
[03:51:35.652 --> 03:51:44.661]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[03:51:44.661 --> 03:51:49.846]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[03:51:49.846 --> 03:51:53.970]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.

[03:52:01.932 --> 03:52:07.756]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.756 --> 03:52:15.320]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.320 --> 03:52:21.504]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.924 --> 03:52:23.885]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.885 --> 03:52:26.386]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.386 --> 03:52:37.971]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:37.971 --> 03:52:39.652]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.652 --> 03:52:41.512]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.512 --> 03:52:47.735]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:53:03.453 --> 03:53:07.977]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.

[03:54:11.417 --> 03:54:30.110]  I'm gonna do 10-15 minutes of overdrive, and our guest in studio here, the lovely Carol, with HDTV, Mark Cuban's network TV channel on cable, satellite.
[03:54:31.323 --> 03:54:42.973]  They're doing a 25-minute, 30-minute show, 25 minutes of programming, on his network coming up in late September, and she wants to hear from militias, real militias.
[03:54:42.973 --> 03:54:47.357]  And I know there are a lot of real militias, call yourselves military study groups, out there.
[03:54:47.357 --> 03:54:56.685]  If you want to call in with a quick comment, quick statement to her about why you're doing what you're doing, what you stand for, I'm going to give you this number to call.
[03:54:58.095 --> 03:55:01.359]  It's 888-201-2244.
[03:55:01.359 --> 03:55:02.860]  Only militia people.
[03:55:02.860 --> 03:55:04.902]  888-201-2244.
[03:55:04.902 --> 03:55:05.143]  888-201-2244.
[03:55:05.143 --> 03:55:11.870]  The official show ends in five minutes.
[03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:17.796]  We are then going to come back after a one-minute break when the official show ends and do 15 minutes of phone calls.
[03:55:20.643 --> 03:55:26.765]  I did a bunch of research today, had my guys prep a bunch of research to go over this for you.
[03:55:26.765 --> 03:55:34.587]  So I do want to cover this in the interview we do afterwards, because there's so many facets to this.
[03:55:34.587 --> 03:55:40.609]  There is the militia, I mean until the turn of the last century, or 105 years ago roughly,
[03:55:42.773 --> 03:55:46.754]  Because it started in 1903, 1906, we officially got the National Guard.
[03:55:46.754 --> 03:55:51.615]  It was known the militia was armed men, and that the sheriff or the governor would call them out.
[03:55:51.615 --> 03:55:56.116]  County-level sheriff, city-level the mayor, or his police chief.
[03:55:56.116 --> 03:55:57.697]  It was civil defense.
[03:55:57.697 --> 03:56:04.758]  So when they say, oh, there's no militia in the Second Amendment, or the militia means the military, no, clearly the Founding Fathers, the Federalist Papers, that's clear.
[03:56:04.758 --> 03:56:07.419]  So you have the media demonizing it, trying to say it doesn't exist.
[03:56:09.537 --> 03:56:16.799]  Trying to say there's no right for people to keep and bear arms, that the citizen militia itself is a fraud, isn't legitimate.
[03:56:16.799 --> 03:56:17.999]  That's a lie.
[03:56:17.999 --> 03:56:19.459]  Clearly, historically.
[03:56:19.459 --> 03:56:34.803]  But then you have the other attack, starting in the early 90s, when there was a huge anti-UN, anti-world government, anti-big government movement, where the feds systematically, from Indiana, to Florida, to Michigan, to Texas, would go in and radicalize groups.
[03:56:35.891 --> 03:56:39.433]  And would try to link them to white supremacists.
[03:56:39.433 --> 03:56:50.381]  So what you do is you have white supremacists that are bad, and the media always and the government tries to link them then to militias to demonize that, and then they demonize Second Amendment groups by linking them to militias.
[03:56:50.381 --> 03:56:58.246]  So see, gun groups are linked to militias, they're linked to white supremacists, and that's how they then demonize the militia movement.
[03:56:58.246 --> 03:57:02.689]  And they try to say it's right-wing when really it's past parties.
[03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:05.151]  It understands we have a corporate dictatorship.
[03:57:06.201 --> 03:57:23.887]  And there were militia hearings in the early 1990s and mid-90s where there were black commanders in there saying, I'm tired of the oppressive force of government being built up against me and the balance of power being so out of whack with Waco and what the army did there and the training at Fort Hood and what happened at Ruby Ridge.
[03:57:23.887 --> 03:57:25.648]  Hundreds of troops for this man.
[03:57:25.648 --> 03:57:27.689]  They shoot his woman in the head with a baby in her arms.
[03:57:27.689 --> 03:57:30.270]  They shoot the 14-year-old in the back, Sam Weaver.
[03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:44.234]  So that was a response to people, just like a dog, if you corner it, it'll start growling, to seeing mainly military veterans who'd been in third world countries, been in communist countries, they recognized tyranny and said, this is tyranny.
[03:57:44.234 --> 03:57:47.114]  I'm gonna buy guns, I'm gonna start training to defend myself.
[03:57:47.114 --> 03:57:49.935]  That's in the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:57:49.935 --> 03:58:00.058]  And so then you got some kooks and weirdos that the media would pay attention to that were legitimately strange and guys that wanted to wear uniforms or had a bass boat and wanted to say they were admirals.
[03:58:01.601 --> 03:58:03.543]  That's a minority.
[03:58:03.543 --> 03:58:11.430]  Mainly you had feds coming in trying to create militias, radicalize them, to set people up, to demonize the movement overall.
[03:58:11.430 --> 03:58:18.576]  And so that's the key, and I have the proof here in this stack that we're going to cover for five minutes in overdrive, then we're going to the phone calls.
[03:58:18.576 --> 03:58:23.681]  Straight ahead, four militia people, or militia supporters, or people that were in it in the 90s and got out of it,
[03:58:24.221 --> 03:58:25.101]  Or just gun owners.
[03:58:25.101 --> 03:58:26.042]  People buying guns.
[03:58:26.042 --> 03:58:27.342]  Why are you buying guns?
[03:58:27.342 --> 03:58:30.724]  Why do you feel like you need to go out and buy guns and then get training?
[03:58:30.724 --> 03:58:31.504]  888-201-2244.
[03:58:31.504 --> 03:58:34.985]  888-201-2244.
[03:58:34.985 --> 03:58:38.967]  We'll only be at Infowars.com on the audio streams and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:58:38.967 --> 03:58:43.729]  Internet only in T-minus 70 seconds.

[03:58:51.394 --> 03:58:56.598]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.598 --> 03:59:00.622]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.622 --> 03:59:06.527]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.527 --> 03:59:11.611]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.611 --> 03:59:12.052]  Number three,
[03:59:12.512 --> 03:59:18.794]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:18.794 --> 03:59:21.696]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.696 --> 03:59:26.217]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.217 --> 03:59:30.079]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.079 --> 03:59:35.801]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:59:35.801 --> 03:59:38.882]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.

[03:59:42.263 --> 03:59:44.844]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[03:59:55.608 --> 03:59:58.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[04:00:26.706 --> 04:00:38.832]  Well, it is Tuesday, the first day of September 2009, 8 year anniversary of the false flag terror attacks, Operation Northwoods Part 2, that we know is the September 11th tragedy.
[04:00:40.905 --> 04:00:46.087]  And I have Mark Cuban's HD network here.
[04:00:46.087 --> 04:00:51.128]  And Mark really is a maverick, pun intended, in every sense of the word.
[04:00:51.128 --> 04:00:54.329]  He puts out a lot of stuff I disagree with, some stuff I agree with.
[04:00:54.329 --> 04:01:07.093]  But I remember hearing behind the scenes from Charlie Sheen and other people that Mark was getting threats and things when we were going to put out Loose Change Final Cut with Charlie Sheen in it.
[04:01:07.093 --> 04:01:08.133]  I never got the details.
[04:01:12.132 --> 04:01:16.254]  I was there when there were some conversations on the phone with him, but I wasn't on the line.
[04:01:16.254 --> 04:01:22.016]  I'm sitting around the table overlooking California, an area that's now on fire, years ago.
[04:01:22.016 --> 04:01:32.041]  And then later it came out in the New York Times that the Securities and Exchange Commission called Mark Cuban and emailed him and said, we don't like you on that 9-11 film, you bastard.
[04:01:32.041 --> 04:01:33.402]  We're going to send you to prison.
[04:01:33.402 --> 04:01:33.862]  You watch.
[04:01:34.602 --> 04:01:36.243]  Mark's like, my God.
[04:01:36.243 --> 04:01:39.865]  And suddenly, he was saying he was going to put the film out, suddenly he said, you know what?
[04:01:39.865 --> 04:01:40.905]  I'm not going to do this now.
[04:01:40.905 --> 04:01:42.026]  I don't blame him.
[04:01:42.026 --> 04:01:43.367]  You know, he's like, this is getting crazy.
[04:01:43.367 --> 04:01:47.529]  And Bill O'Reilly was like, you'll be found in the East River, Charlie Sheen and Mark Cuban.
[04:01:47.529 --> 04:01:50.730]  I mean, it was like mafia threats.
[04:01:50.730 --> 04:01:51.571]  Don't do this.
[04:01:51.571 --> 04:01:54.152]  I'm telling you, it's over for you.
[04:01:54.152 --> 04:01:54.772]  And what a bully.
[04:01:54.772 --> 04:02:00.475]  I mean, this was like crazy how scared the establishment was of one movie.
[04:02:00.475 --> 04:02:01.136]  They were idiots.
[04:02:01.136 --> 04:02:03.197]  All it made was the film go more viral on the Internet.
[04:02:04.147 --> 04:02:10.531]  Conservatively, that film and its three variants has probably had 100 million views, just that film alone.
[04:02:10.531 --> 04:02:20.637]  But the point is, one view alone on Google three years ago, when it had been out for a year, Vanity Fair called Google and said, what's that one video got?
[04:02:20.637 --> 04:02:22.258]  And they said 10 million plus.
[04:02:22.258 --> 04:02:24.400]  And there's just hundreds of versions.
[04:02:24.400 --> 04:02:25.581]  There's no way to even calculate it.
[04:02:25.581 --> 04:02:28.622]  But they're just morons.
[04:02:28.622 --> 04:02:32.225]  I mean, some theatrical release, even if it was big, would have reached one hundredth of that.
[04:02:34.980 --> 04:02:41.963]  Again, that's why these dinosaurs only think, and that's why it's so good there's these Cold War dinosaurs that are like 85 still running things.
[04:02:41.963 --> 04:02:43.664]  We're in trouble when the younger ones get in.
[04:02:43.664 --> 04:02:44.745]  That's starting to already happen.
[04:02:45.674 --> 04:02:47.835]  And the younger ones are telling him, you just gotta shut the web off.
[04:02:47.835 --> 04:02:54.517]  No matter, you gotta stage a false terror attack on it, say it's dead, and Obama's like, yeah, put in the Cybersecurity Command to kill the web to save it.
[04:02:54.517 --> 04:02:56.398]  So they're moving right now on that front.
[04:02:56.398 --> 04:02:57.478]  It's already too late.
[04:02:57.478 --> 04:02:59.018]  Even that attempt's gonna fail.
[04:02:59.018 --> 04:03:02.920]  Again, you can kill me, but ideas are bulletproof.
[04:03:02.920 --> 04:03:05.921]  As was said in V for Vendetta, ideas are eternal.
[04:03:06.701 --> 04:03:08.643]  And so, there's no stopping this now.
[04:03:08.643 --> 04:03:17.410]  You might as well come in for the big win for the Republic, bring the bankers to justice, arrest the Federal Reserve Board for their crimes, have them indicted as Ron Paul has called for on this show.
[04:03:17.410 --> 04:03:21.052]  Clearly all the crimes they've committed, the insider trading, the rigging, all of it.
[04:03:21.052 --> 04:03:30.160]  I'm going to go to your calls, Charles, Mike, Rick, Casey, and Jim, militia members, and get their quick comments here in a moment, but I wanted to just go over this evidence.
[04:03:31.243 --> 04:03:33.204]  We have a new story out on PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:03:33.204 --> 04:03:34.905]  Provocateurs at In The Fed rally.
[04:03:34.905 --> 04:03:50.035]  According to testimony given at a Missouri House Representatives meeting yesterday, Anarchists attempted to get other protesters to commit criminal acts during the In The Fed protest last year in what was a possible attempt to instigate chaos to justify a harsh crackdown on behalf of the authorities.
[04:03:50.535 --> 04:03:52.997]  Then it goes into all the history of this happening.
[04:03:52.997 --> 04:04:04.468]  In March, it came to light that the End the Fed protest, which took place at banks and regional Federal Reserve branches across the country on November 22nd, it's happened since then, were being monitored closely by the United States Army Reserve Command.
[04:04:04.468 --> 04:04:11.875]  We have a link to the secret document we broke right there, who implied that those protesting against the Fed and the banks for bailout were terrorists.
[04:04:12.595 --> 04:04:17.722]  On November 22nd, 2008, Alex Jones led a rally at the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, Texas.
[04:04:17.722 --> 04:04:20.685]  The Dallas protesters specifically mentioned the official Army document.
[04:04:20.685 --> 04:04:22.828]  Ron Paul's brother was also in attendance.
[04:04:22.828 --> 04:04:29.817]  During testimony given in response to the infamous Missouri Information Analysis MIAC report, a document authored by Missouri Highway Patrol and distributed
[04:04:30.137 --> 04:04:31.118]  It was really written by the feds.
[04:04:31.118 --> 04:04:32.018]  It was just a federal version.
[04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.270]  Yeah.
[04:05:05.587 --> 04:05:13.534]  I mean, you're foundation funded, but not the normal little anarchist, meth head, trust fund kid with snot running down their nose.
[04:05:13.534 --> 04:05:14.715]  You are cops.
[04:05:14.715 --> 04:05:18.619]  And I started going, they're cops, they're cops, and going, I'm arresting you, citizen's arrest.
[04:05:18.619 --> 04:05:20.381]  And this video was somewhere around the office.
[04:05:20.381 --> 04:05:22.623]  I've aired it on AXS TV back in the day many times.
[04:05:22.623 --> 04:05:26.246]  And cops run across the street going, stop it, Jones, those are our officers.
[04:05:26.246 --> 04:05:28.628]  And they uninsert those two and insert two more.
[04:05:29.309 --> 04:05:36.197]  These giant Roydhead cops in bandanas going, trying to, and I, you know, they were really getting mad.
[04:05:36.197 --> 04:05:40.502]  And remember, Denver last year, it came out in the Denver Post, they had cops attack cops.
[04:05:40.502 --> 04:05:43.085]  That was confirmed.
[04:05:43.085 --> 04:05:45.868]  During testimony given, a response to the information,
[04:05:47.259 --> 04:05:53.361]  Infamous Missouri Information Analysis Center, the document authored by Missouri Highway Patrol, so I already went over that.
[04:05:53.361 --> 04:06:02.564]  My group was at the end of the Fed Rally, this is the testimony in the legislature, my group was at the end of the Fed Rally and there were a bunch of different groups there.
[04:06:02.564 --> 04:06:12.027]  Cissy Spargan told Missouri House of Representatives on Monday and there was a group of anarchists who started talking to us and then they tried to recruit us or have us join
[04:06:13.191 --> 04:06:13.371]  They're
[04:06:38.407 --> 04:06:45.830]  You know, the cops, if they were smart, would put in smaller cops, but they're so afraid of protesters that they put their biggest, toughest guys, like, it's a deadly mission, men.
[04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:50.711]  You're gonna go commit crimes and try to stir up people to commit crimes so we can violate the First Amendment.
[04:06:50.711 --> 04:06:55.793]  Are you willing to go in with these grandmas and people that are against foreign banking domination?
[04:06:55.793 --> 04:06:58.594]  Oh my God, we better send our biggest men in there.
[04:06:58.594 --> 04:06:59.434]  They're so deadly.
[04:07:02.253 --> 04:07:04.016]  It's just ridiculous.
[04:07:04.016 --> 04:07:08.162]  And these guys will be scared of you when they saddle up to you at an event and say, hey, you want to blow something up?
[04:07:08.162 --> 04:07:09.845]  They're kind of like, you'll see them kind of shaking.
[04:07:09.845 --> 04:07:12.609]  It's like, dude, I'm not scary here.
[04:07:12.609 --> 04:07:13.371]  I'm an American.
[04:07:13.371 --> 04:07:15.835]  I know you're a little criminal and all, but anyways.
[04:07:17.901 --> 04:07:28.330]  It goes on, during the April 2009 G20 Summit in London, police stood back and watched anarchists attack banks and other buildings in an incident that had all the hallmarks of a staged event.
[04:07:28.330 --> 04:07:32.534]  Following the SPP protest in Canada, Quebec provincial authorities were forced to admit that
[04:07:33.214 --> 04:07:42.599]  The three rock-wielding, black-mask-wearing anarchists were, in fact, police infiltrators used to gather information on protesters that they staged a fake arrest.
[04:07:42.599 --> 04:07:52.625]  And then it just goes into police state to the takeover, where I document the police admitting that the major foundations brought in anarchists and the Delta Force commanded them.
[04:07:52.625 --> 04:07:54.907]  That was in all three Seattle newspapers.
[04:07:54.907 --> 04:07:57.308]  I mean, folks, it just goes on and on.
[04:07:57.308 --> 04:07:58.729]  Now, let me briefly get into some of this.
[04:07:59.810 --> 04:08:06.355]  Colorado GOP Colorado GOP calls for apology after Democratic office vandalism.
[04:08:06.355 --> 04:08:08.476]  This is out of Fox News.
[04:08:08.476 --> 04:08:09.998]  I also have one here out of the Denver Post.
[04:08:09.998 --> 04:08:22.007]  The chairman of the Colorado Republican Party is calling on the Democratic counterpart to apologize following comments he claims connects an act of vandalism to opposition of President Barack Obama's health care reform.
[04:08:22.007 --> 04:08:28.593]  And then it turns out that it was a staff worker of the DNC there in Denver that supposedly did all this.
[04:08:31.758 --> 04:08:41.906]  So, again, every time I see it in the news, where somebody puts a swastika on their dorm or burns down the black church, it's always one of the church members or the dorm member.
[04:08:41.906 --> 04:08:44.428]  It just never ends.
[04:08:44.428 --> 04:08:47.490]  I mean, I've never seen a modern case.
[04:08:47.490 --> 04:08:55.536]  And then even the Klan bombing black churches in Alabama and places in Louisiana, it came out where FBI informants were doing it.
[04:08:57.028 --> 04:08:59.333]  I mean, it never ends!
[04:08:59.333 --> 04:09:01.837]  So, we've got that report.
[04:09:01.837 --> 04:09:06.126]  Neo-Nazi rally was organized by FBI informant Orlando Sentinel.
[04:09:09.611 --> 04:09:09.991]  Messing up.
[04:09:28.311 --> 04:09:32.053]  I mean, these aren't even white people that are dressed up like Nazis.
[04:09:32.053 --> 04:09:38.836]  I mean, they can't even, I guess, get ADL workers or Southern Poverty Law Center people to get up there and do it.
[04:09:38.836 --> 04:09:40.737]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[04:09:40.737 --> 04:09:43.858]  I mean, it's totally fake.
[04:09:43.858 --> 04:09:47.780]  It's like the grandson of the head of the ADL is the spokesman for Al-Qaeda.
[04:09:47.780 --> 04:09:55.624]  And they've done the video layers off the Al-Qaeda watermark and the Intel Center logo, and it's the same video layer.
[04:09:56.443 --> 04:09:57.344]  They're producing these!
[04:09:57.344 --> 04:09:59.806]  These are fake!
[04:09:59.806 --> 04:10:00.947]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:10:00.947 --> 04:10:05.311]  Of course, we broke that and then Wired Magazine months later reported on it.
[04:10:05.311 --> 04:10:09.894]  Then he got threats and said, well, it looks like it was the same video layer.
[04:10:09.894 --> 04:10:16.920]  Folks, we can look in here in our primitive computers and blow it up and see it's in the same layer.
[04:10:16.920 --> 04:10:21.724]  Neo-Nazi rally was organized by FBI informant, so that's Orlando Sentinel.
[04:10:21.724 --> 04:10:24.046]  Here's a London Telegraph, Germany's top neo-Nazi
[04:10:25.134 --> 04:10:26.675]  Spied for ministry.
[04:10:26.675 --> 04:10:32.877]  Then it goes into admitting that they actually staged firebombings and attacks under German intelligence orders.
[04:10:32.877 --> 04:10:33.517]  Here's another one.
[04:10:33.517 --> 04:10:35.978]  White Power rally leader was FBI snitch.
[04:10:35.978 --> 04:10:41.559]  Law Center reports the FBI says, yes, he did work for us, but not when he made the latest threats.
[04:10:41.559 --> 04:10:42.940]  That shows how they burn their own people.
[04:10:45.168 --> 04:10:47.152]  Hal Turner admits he worked for the FBI.
[04:10:47.152 --> 04:10:48.134]  That's another one.
[04:10:48.134 --> 04:10:51.920]  Canadian Jewish Congress organized Nazi Party.
[04:10:51.920 --> 04:10:55.908]  And this actually came out in the Ottawa newspaper.
[04:10:55.908 --> 04:10:56.890]  The Ottawa Citizen.
[04:11:00.137 --> 04:11:03.158]  Neo-Nazi leader was MI6 agent, Lennon Guardian.
[04:11:03.158 --> 04:11:06.020]  Again, commanding it, running the attacks.
[04:11:06.020 --> 04:11:06.880]  Here, let's continue.
[04:11:06.880 --> 04:11:07.880]  Fox News.
[04:11:07.880 --> 04:11:10.582]  Ministers, police destroyed Klan records.
[04:11:10.582 --> 04:11:14.563]  And then it comes out because the Klan was working for the police, carrying out the attacks.
[04:11:14.563 --> 04:11:16.264]  Fox News, AP.
[04:11:16.264 --> 04:11:19.786]  Why did the Jewish Congress build up the Nazi Party?
[04:11:19.786 --> 04:11:22.547]  That's Ezra Levitt's website.
[04:11:22.547 --> 04:11:23.667]  Here's another one.
[04:11:23.667 --> 04:11:26.789]  New OKC revelations spotlight FBI involvement in bombing.
[04:11:27.899 --> 04:11:30.641]  And this came out in the Salt Lake City Tribune.
[04:11:30.641 --> 04:11:33.263]  Southern Poverty Law Center involved with informants inside.
[04:11:33.263 --> 04:11:36.506]  That's why I'm their number one target, because I expose them.
[04:11:36.506 --> 04:11:43.171]  Again, how did the British intelligence control India when there was one Brit in many areas for every thousand Indians?
[04:11:43.171 --> 04:11:47.354]  They would play tribal groups off against each other, religious groups off against each other.
[04:11:47.354 --> 04:11:51.097]  It's called the Great Game or Divide and Conquer.
[04:11:53.709 --> 04:11:56.691]  And here's that actual Salt Lake City affidavit.
[04:11:56.691 --> 04:12:01.134]  McVeigh had high-level help working for Army Intelligence.
[04:12:01.134 --> 04:12:04.396]  Again, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[04:12:04.396 --> 04:12:07.698]  Attorney, sealed documents indicate OKC inside bombing.
[04:12:07.698 --> 04:12:12.441]  FBI defense team files identify government informants directing McVeigh.
[04:12:13.519 --> 04:12:15.420]  I can go on for hours here.
[04:12:15.420 --> 04:12:25.325]  This is not a game or not a joke and that's why I tell good old boys a certain macho type that we've assessed who tend to have their father was in the military or their brother was.
[04:12:25.325 --> 04:12:26.506]  They weren't.
[04:12:26.506 --> 04:12:27.927]  They like Rambo movies.
[04:12:29.207 --> 04:12:35.789]  I've actually gone out several times just to assess these groups myself, and you'll see there'll be a Fed in the group of 10 guys.
[04:12:35.789 --> 04:12:50.852]  He's trying to get them to do violent stuff, and the other guys will be putting bandanas on and crawling around in the bushes, and they think everybody's out to get them, and they want to have some big battle with the government, and they're always being led by Feds.
[04:12:50.852 --> 04:12:51.693]  This is the MO.
[04:12:51.693 --> 04:12:53.533]  I mean, take the Republic of Texas.
[04:12:53.533 --> 04:12:57.294]  Polls show over half of Texans want to secede from the union, whether that's good or not.
[04:12:59.190 --> 04:13:02.772]  So they went out and found literally poor people living in trailers.
[04:13:02.772 --> 04:13:04.573]  They said, I am the president.
[04:13:04.573 --> 04:13:07.314]  And they would have a guy with a bass boat who'd wear admiral outfits.
[04:13:07.314 --> 04:13:08.975]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[04:13:08.975 --> 04:13:13.417]  And then the cops went in there and just gunned them all down and said they were dangerous terrorists.
[04:13:14.599 --> 04:13:23.062]  And then they have other groups they hire to look like clowns to discredit any true secession movement down the road.
[04:13:23.062 --> 04:13:25.022]  It's very simple.
[04:13:25.022 --> 04:13:41.268]  So, if you're going to be in a militia, realize it's constitutional, it's good, realize that you only act in defense of the Republic, and realize anybody that tells you you've got to be secretive, you've got to hide in the bushes, oh, let's make pipe bombs, oh, let's make our guns go full-auto, if you'll just
[04:13:42.253 --> 04:13:48.156]  Follow that person home, their FBI, their defense intelligence, their army special forces.
[04:13:48.156 --> 04:13:52.979]  I mean, one time I went and tried to cover Brooksville, Florida, in an army takeover drill of the town.
[04:13:52.979 --> 04:14:01.704]  I get there and locals are running around.
[04:14:01.704 --> 04:14:06.727]  When I get to Brooksville, I'm walking through the town, this is a big town, and people are coming out going, you're Alex Jones.
[04:14:06.727 --> 04:14:09.108]  The army came to my door and said, don't talk to you, you're crazy.
[04:14:10.196 --> 04:14:12.498]  This was all a sign of how to take over the town.
[04:14:12.498 --> 04:14:18.423]  And then all of a sudden, this guy I'd seen at Waco and other places, he was clearly, and I knew instantly, going with special forces.
[04:14:18.423 --> 04:14:20.745]  You know, totally, you know, but serious.
[04:14:20.745 --> 04:14:24.249]  And he was always, and he's like, oh, let's set fires while we're here in Brooksville.
[04:14:24.249 --> 04:14:28.352]  I'm like, I had to literally grab him and throw him down on the ground and go, look, I know you're fed.
[04:14:28.352 --> 04:14:29.734]  I'm about to kick your ass.
[04:14:29.734 --> 04:14:31.595]  I don't care how tough you think you are.
[04:14:31.595 --> 04:14:32.997]  Quit following us around.
[04:14:32.997 --> 04:14:35.439]  We're just trying to videotape them setting up checkpoints in the town.
[04:14:36.840 --> 04:14:40.163]  And I had to literally grab this guy and just go, listen!
[04:14:40.163 --> 04:14:43.425]  Because once he started trying to light stuff on fire and I grabbed him and I had to shut him down.
[04:14:43.425 --> 04:14:44.646]  I said, I know you think you're tough.
[04:14:44.646 --> 04:14:47.328]  I'm about to kick the living hell out of you.
[04:14:47.328 --> 04:14:49.870]  Do you understand me, you federal piece of crap?
[04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:50.791]  I said a lot more than that.
[04:14:50.791 --> 04:14:54.274]  And I said, I'm going to stomp your guts out.
[04:14:54.274 --> 04:14:57.936]  Now that's the type of crap that I deal with, with these criminals.
[04:14:57.936 --> 04:14:59.237]  And I am sick of it.
[04:14:59.237 --> 04:15:01.839]  And I declare war on your criminal activity.
[04:15:01.839 --> 04:15:02.320]  Period.
[04:15:04.912 --> 04:15:07.876]  So I'm going to tell people who are involved in this militia stuff.
[04:15:07.876 --> 04:15:11.160]  You better keep your nose clean because the Feds want to set you up.
[04:15:11.160 --> 04:15:12.662]  Let's go to Charles in Rhode Island.
[04:15:12.662 --> 04:15:15.045]  Charles, are you in a militia?
[04:15:15.045 --> 04:15:15.866]  Yes, I am.
[04:15:15.866 --> 04:15:19.511]  Greetings and salutations, Field Fighter extraordinaire.
[04:15:19.511 --> 04:15:20.192]  What's on your mind?
[04:15:21.493 --> 04:15:24.234]  Well, basically, Rhode Island is a very small state.
[04:15:24.234 --> 04:15:25.494]  It's a two-by-four of a state.
[04:15:25.494 --> 04:15:33.317]  So, it would be extremely hard to be infiltrated in the militia because of the fact that we would know you 12 ways by 12 ways very easily.
[04:15:33.317 --> 04:15:34.758]  The contact era.
[04:15:34.758 --> 04:15:36.838]  Gigging to assemble.
[04:15:36.838 --> 04:15:46.362]  So, basically, I've been the representative of the militia down at the statehouse for the past 25 years here in the state of Rhode Island.
[04:15:46.362 --> 04:15:47.222]  Well, God bless you.
[04:15:47.222 --> 04:15:49.843]  You're in the great tradition of General Green from Rhode Island.
[04:15:50.725 --> 04:15:50.905]  Well,
[04:16:19.073 --> 04:16:23.434]  For people that, I mean, give us your view.
[04:16:23.434 --> 04:16:31.416]  I mean, do you agree with my statement that people see a massive tyranny building up, just like people internally tried to fight back against Hitler and were called traitors?
[04:16:31.416 --> 04:16:36.918]  I mean, you see a huge tyranny being constructed that people go, well, we better revive the militia.
[04:16:36.918 --> 04:16:39.538]  I mean, it's federal law that we all be part of it 18 to 44 anyways.
[04:16:42.329 --> 04:16:44.930]  Well, Alex, absolutely I agree with you.
[04:16:44.930 --> 04:16:53.573]  And this is the part, as I was over-educated, I understand exactly what happened in Nazi Germany after the Reichstag fire, 1933 and 1934.
[04:16:53.573 --> 04:16:59.075]  And the wars are all being repeated, right here in America, right at this moment.
[04:16:59.075 --> 04:17:00.396]  And my grandfather told me in 1966,
[04:17:01.836 --> 04:17:12.213]  He said by the time I get to be his age, not to get the social security number, because by the time I get to be his age, there would be no money for me to collect because the government will have successfully stolen every penny.
[04:17:12.213 --> 04:17:15.879]  Well he had no idea the fiat credit money system that was going to unfold.
[04:17:16.804 --> 04:17:18.485]  Because of what he told me.
[04:17:18.485 --> 04:17:19.506]  And I follow his directions.
[04:17:19.506 --> 04:17:20.827]  I have no Social Security.
[04:17:20.827 --> 04:17:22.067]  I've never paid any of the taxes.
[04:17:22.067 --> 04:17:23.328]  State or federal.
[04:17:23.328 --> 04:17:24.689]  And I don't believe in any of that.
[04:17:24.689 --> 04:17:28.251]  I don't understand why we're doing those things at all.
[04:17:28.251 --> 04:17:31.093]  Keep propping up the government to make ourselves slaves.
[04:17:31.093 --> 04:17:33.394]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[04:17:33.394 --> 04:17:34.295]  God bless you, sir.
[04:17:34.295 --> 04:17:36.036]  Good to hear from you.
[04:17:36.036 --> 04:17:37.197]  Long live the Republic.
[04:17:37.197 --> 04:17:39.258]  Mike in South Carolina.
[04:17:39.258 --> 04:17:39.878]  You're on the air.
[04:17:39.878 --> 04:17:40.499]  Go ahead, Mike.
[04:17:43.097 --> 04:17:44.218]  Thank you.
[04:17:44.218 --> 04:17:47.140]  Okay, you've got the international media here.
[04:17:47.140 --> 04:17:49.602]  Tell them why you're in the militia.
[04:17:49.602 --> 04:17:51.444]  Well, because it's not an option.
[04:17:51.444 --> 04:18:00.571]  By definition, every able-bodied male is the militia to be ever ready to be the number one primary deterrent against tyranny.
[04:18:00.571 --> 04:18:07.657]  And having said that, many are ignorant and many are AWOL.
[04:18:07.657 --> 04:18:10.299]  But nevertheless, they are the militia.
[04:18:10.299 --> 04:18:11.640]  And remember what our founder said.
[04:18:12.836 --> 04:18:17.119]  When the government fears the people, you have freedom.
[04:18:17.119 --> 04:18:20.862]  When the people fear the government, you have tyranny.
[04:18:20.862 --> 04:18:33.651]  So it's up to each and every individual to judge where we are in that continuum and to be ready for action when we get to that point.
[04:18:33.651 --> 04:18:34.852]  Well, sir, I agree with you.
[04:18:34.852 --> 04:18:35.593]  You've got the floor.
[04:18:35.593 --> 04:18:37.394]  Continue with any other points you'd like to make.
[04:18:38.288 --> 04:18:42.631]  Well, I'd just like to remind everybody, like you said, I agree with you 100%.
[04:18:42.631 --> 04:18:52.158]  Anything more than probably two, maybe three, organized, is going to be infiltrated eventually.
[04:18:52.158 --> 04:18:58.662]  So, you know, the bottom line is, the militia is like the biblical militia, God's army.
[04:18:58.662 --> 04:19:02.325]  They go about their everyday business, but they're ever ready.
[04:19:02.325 --> 04:19:06.808]  Each individual is responsible to have a quality rifle, ample supply of ammunition, be proficient in its use.
[04:19:07.549 --> 04:19:10.180]  Exactly, that's the model is that...
[04:19:11.047 --> 04:19:17.269]  I see these militia guys that are federally handled in the camo, running around bragging with their chest stuck out.
[04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:34.896]  Real militias in a suit and tie at city council, and then they're in their backyard wearing a t-shirt doing gardening, and they're lovingly rocking their baby at night, but they're also going to the shooting range, getting ready, committing to how they're going to defend the republic against this globalist takeover, if they start trying to put us in FEMA camps.
[04:19:34.896 --> 04:19:36.177]  I mean, it's that simple.
[04:19:36.177 --> 04:19:38.698]  And that's the real army, and the system knows that.
[04:19:39.418 --> 04:19:47.785]  That's why they staged the attacks in the 90s to demonize the militia so the real men who saw the threat to the country would be scared away from it.
[04:19:47.785 --> 04:19:48.826]  It hasn't worked.
[04:19:48.826 --> 04:20:02.018]  The Feds doing that in the mid-90s only made the real militia go underground and it's just this giant army that is just, you know, to use the Frank Herbert analogy of like the Fremen, it's just gigantic.
[04:20:03.404 --> 04:20:07.007]  Absolutely correct, and that's the ones they're afraid of.
[04:20:07.007 --> 04:20:13.771]  And I'm here to tell you that I'm convinced, God willing, we will be the majority when we're called up by the Holy Spirit.
[04:20:13.771 --> 04:20:19.195]  They call us lone wolves because we're not out there playing GI Joe.
[04:20:19.195 --> 04:20:24.959]  We are out there working, earning a living, taking care of our families, voting.
[04:20:24.959 --> 04:20:26.741]  We're going to town hall meetings.
[04:20:26.741 --> 04:20:31.504]  We're screaming to the top of our lungs at these boneheads in Washington, these town hall meetings.
[04:20:32.393 --> 04:20:34.994]  But the bottom line is, we practice on our own.
[04:20:34.994 --> 04:20:35.834]  We train.
[04:20:35.834 --> 04:20:37.674]  We're very, very proficient.
[04:20:37.674 --> 04:20:43.075]  We don't get together and braggadocious and have some kind of party and club and talk about how wonderful we are.
[04:20:43.075 --> 04:20:52.177]  We understand the position that's God-given and enumerated by our founders, and we're prepared for the day when it happens.
[04:20:52.177 --> 04:20:57.279]  And remember, there's over 100 million gun owners in this country, over 300 million firearms.
[04:20:57.279 --> 04:20:58.819]  And remember, throughout all of history,
[04:20:59.460 --> 04:21:02.604]  Freedom's been born on the shoulder of about 10%.
[04:21:02.604 --> 04:21:08.452]  The other 90% even split 45% protein, 45% didn't care.
[04:21:08.452 --> 04:21:14.140]  So 10% of 100 million gun owners, 10 million, there's no army in the world that can stand up to that.
[04:21:14.140 --> 04:21:16.362]  And that's the reason the Japanese didn't invade us, because they know.
[04:21:17.173 --> 04:21:21.979]  Virtually all Americans are not only armed, but well-armed and willing to do what they have to do.
[04:21:21.979 --> 04:21:22.900]  That's right.
[04:21:22.900 --> 04:21:23.340]  That's right.
[04:21:23.340 --> 04:21:27.525]  Admiral Yamamoto didn't just say, I fear we have woken a sleeping giant.
[04:21:27.525 --> 04:21:33.171]  He also said we can't invade the mainland because there'd be a rifle barrel behind every blade of grass.
[04:21:33.792 --> 04:21:35.672]  And that's what the foreign bankers need to know.
[04:21:35.672 --> 04:21:42.734]  We've identified the Federal Reserve as the outside enemy, engaging in the criminal activity, the implosion of the economy by design.
[04:21:42.734 --> 04:21:47.995]  We are peacefully saying, stop raping us, stop abusing us, don't tread on us.
[04:21:47.995 --> 04:21:49.976]  We're trying everything peaceable we can.
[04:21:49.976 --> 04:21:50.876]  The enemy is arrogant.
[04:21:50.876 --> 04:21:52.676]  They're going to strike against us.
[04:21:52.676 --> 04:21:55.817]  And then everybody knows who the enemy is.
[04:21:55.817 --> 04:21:58.898]  They have a question here for you from the TV network.
[04:21:58.898 --> 04:21:59.698]  Go ahead.
[04:21:59.698 --> 04:22:00.618]  Mike, do you train
[04:22:01.690 --> 04:22:04.871]  Publicly or have you gone underground?
[04:22:04.871 --> 04:22:06.552]  Oh, I'm not underground whatsoever.
[04:22:06.552 --> 04:22:12.114]  I'm probably on every list in the country, but proudly so.
[04:22:12.114 --> 04:22:18.136]  I emulate what my founders did, and the founders said that we either stick together or we'll hang separately.
[04:22:18.136 --> 04:22:22.278]  We'll hang together or hang separately, and I utilize public ranges.
[04:22:22.278 --> 04:22:24.999]  I train on a regular basis.
[04:22:25.399 --> 04:22:35.423]  Yeah, by underground, the mainstream media underground means he doesn't go join a federal group with a big fat FBI agent going, I don't like black people, I don't like these.
[04:22:35.423 --> 04:22:37.623]  Machine guns, we're gonna kill!
[04:22:37.623 --> 04:22:38.824]  That's a big fat Fed.
[04:22:38.824 --> 04:22:42.465]  I mean, I just, I can give you hundreds of articles.
[04:22:42.465 --> 04:22:47.447]  In the court cases, the Feds go and bury pipe bombs on their members' property.
[04:22:47.447 --> 04:22:51.028]  I mean, these are, the BATF is just scum you can't even imagine.
[04:22:51.028 --> 04:22:52.849]  I mean, these are mafia people.
[04:22:54.059 --> 04:22:58.902]  So Mike, who are you training to eventually fight then?
[04:22:58.902 --> 04:23:00.163]  Who's your enemy?
[04:23:00.163 --> 04:23:14.072]  You'll know who your enemy is, and I'll say this, 26 years military service and a decade as a peace officer, and you will clearly know who your enemy is because they'll be shooting at you.
[04:23:15.415 --> 04:23:18.818]  If they kick your door down or they stick a gun in your face, they're your enemy.
[04:23:18.818 --> 04:23:20.119]  That is just the bottom line.
[04:23:20.119 --> 04:23:22.781]  And the bottom line, it sums everything up.
[04:23:22.781 --> 04:23:27.205]  The line in the sand is the firearms.
[04:23:27.205 --> 04:23:36.673]  The powers that be, be it the international bankers like Alex was talking about, be it the federal government, be it BATF, be it the lawmakers in Washington, they know.
[04:23:36.673 --> 04:23:38.034]  They're not stupid.
[04:23:38.034 --> 04:23:39.215]  They've studied history.
[04:23:39.215 --> 04:23:41.817]  They know that they have to get the firearms.
[04:23:42.645 --> 04:23:46.046]  Before they can enact their final plan.
[04:23:46.046 --> 04:23:47.587]  And that's 1775.
[04:23:47.587 --> 04:23:48.607]  They came for the guns then.
[04:23:48.607 --> 04:23:52.149]  And when they want their war, they're going to get it.
[04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:53.449]  But they're the aggressor.
[04:23:53.449 --> 04:23:55.030]  We're in the right.
[04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:57.691]  And hopefully they'll get more than they bargained for.
[04:23:57.691 --> 04:24:00.372]  So it's your idea that you won't shoot first?
[04:24:00.372 --> 04:24:01.172]  Oh, absolutely not.
[04:24:01.172 --> 04:24:02.372]  It's strictly defensive.
[04:24:02.372 --> 04:24:03.793]  It's the preparation.
[04:24:03.793 --> 04:24:06.794]  It's the ultimate preparation to be defensive.
[04:24:06.794 --> 04:24:08.095]  But in 1776, like Alex brought up,
[04:24:10.319 --> 04:24:11.260]  We didn't shoot first either.
[04:24:11.260 --> 04:24:13.300]  They come over to get the guns and they stuck guns in our face.
[04:24:13.300 --> 04:24:19.043]  They come marching down the road and that's how you know who your enemy is.
[04:24:19.043 --> 04:24:20.204]  Alright, good to hear from you, sir.
[04:24:20.204 --> 04:24:21.324]  God bless you.
[04:24:21.324 --> 04:24:22.105]  Rick in Texas.
[04:24:22.105 --> 04:24:23.045]  We gotta go quick here now.
[04:24:23.045 --> 04:24:25.266]  I got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[04:24:25.266 --> 04:24:27.467]  Rick in Texas, you're on the air.
[04:24:27.467 --> 04:24:30.969]  Hey, thank you a lot there, Alex.
[04:24:30.969 --> 04:24:37.192]  Yeah, like the other caller just said, this is an inherent right that Americans have
[04:24:38.146 --> 04:24:41.527]  And they basically lost touch with it.
[04:24:41.527 --> 04:24:49.091]  Our second amendment was to give the people the ultimate power and a voice over government at all times.
[04:24:49.091 --> 04:24:51.272]  It's the Trump card.
[04:24:51.272 --> 04:24:51.992]  Pardon?
[04:24:51.992 --> 04:24:54.833]  It's the teeth of the Constitution.
[04:24:54.833 --> 04:24:55.974]  Correct.
[04:24:55.974 --> 04:24:58.915]  And what you said is correct.
[04:24:58.915 --> 04:25:00.796]  This is a constitutional thing.
[04:25:00.796 --> 04:25:02.997]  It's a legal thing.
[04:25:02.997 --> 04:25:05.798]  Anybody that doesn't go along with
[04:25:07.038 --> 04:25:11.581]  Oh, what you say, doing it in a peaceable, professional manner.
[04:25:11.581 --> 04:25:15.024]  Well, we need to look the other way, though, because you're absolutely right.
[04:25:15.024 --> 04:25:16.985]  They're in there causing trouble for a reason.
[04:25:16.985 --> 04:25:20.167]  They've only got one entity out there to cause a problem.
[04:25:20.167 --> 04:25:25.911]  That's the feds, or the federal government, or elected officials.
[04:25:25.911 --> 04:25:28.453]  I, myself, have always stood out front, never hid.
[04:25:29.751 --> 04:25:33.876]  I've never been embarrassed about where I stood with our Second Amendment.
[04:25:33.876 --> 04:25:34.758]  I do everything I can.
[04:25:34.758 --> 04:25:42.567]  See, the establishment runs from the real militia, who's a well-spoken, handsome, serious, focused person.
[04:25:42.567 --> 04:25:45.351]  They go to the clowns, and the clowns are feds.
[04:25:45.351 --> 04:25:46.152]  It's make-believe.
[04:25:48.635 --> 04:25:54.259]  And then the feds, sometimes you'll have 14, 15 feds with two or three idiots they find at bars.
[04:25:54.259 --> 04:25:57.201]  And they'll give, I'll give you $10,000 to wear a uniform, Bill.
[04:25:57.201 --> 04:25:59.042]  Bill, we could take over the Capitol!
[04:25:59.042 --> 04:26:00.343]  We could be kings!
[04:26:00.343 --> 04:26:03.606]  I mean, this came out in Texas Monthly when they created a fake Klan group.
[04:26:04.346 --> 04:26:09.430]  And they gave him tens of thousands of dollars and said, I'll give you more money if you'll build a black powder bomb.
[04:26:09.430 --> 04:26:14.394]  And the guy was so drunk he didn't know how, so the FBI made the bomb and videoed and put it on the news.
[04:26:14.394 --> 04:26:18.477]  Deadly, you know, white supremacist Klan militia.
[04:26:18.477 --> 04:26:20.458]  They demonized the militia by using that term.
[04:26:20.458 --> 04:26:21.859]  It was all just made up.
[04:26:21.859 --> 04:26:24.981]  It was white trash welfare heads.
[04:26:24.981 --> 04:26:26.162]  It's just all fake.
[04:26:26.162 --> 04:26:27.263]  It's fake.
[04:26:27.263 --> 04:26:28.624]  It's fake.
[04:26:28.624 --> 04:26:33.568]  And they go find toothless ne'er-do-wells that they can burn and put in a Supermax present.
[04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:36.350]  Yeah, you're absolutely correct.
[04:26:36.350 --> 04:26:41.492]  Some of us have absolutely took it a completely different direction.
[04:26:41.492 --> 04:26:45.313]  I've actually created a website that educates all Americans on the Second Amendment.
[04:27:02.226 --> 04:27:05.147]  And here we go, busting the race card down the middle.
[04:27:05.147 --> 04:27:08.808]  If you was to go look at my website, it's every American.
[04:27:08.808 --> 04:27:13.429]  It's not just white folks, it's not black folks, it's all of us.
[04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:16.670]  Give the website out.
[04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:22.252]  It's called the Well-Regulated American Militias and it can be found at http://militias.ning.com.
[04:27:27.648 --> 04:27:27.968]  All right.
[04:27:27.968 --> 04:27:28.489]  Thank you, sir.
[04:27:28.489 --> 04:27:29.510]  Appreciate the call, Rick.
[04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:31.011]  Going to take four more calls.
[04:27:31.011 --> 04:27:32.192]  Casey in California.
[04:27:32.192 --> 04:27:33.453]  You're on the air.
[04:27:33.453 --> 04:27:34.474]  How you doing, Alex?
[04:27:34.474 --> 04:27:35.395]  Good.
[04:27:35.395 --> 04:27:36.296]  God bless you 100%.
[04:27:36.296 --> 04:27:37.337]  I'm behind you 1,000%.
[04:27:37.337 --> 04:27:43.762]  Real quick on your theory of basically earlier talk with Carol.
[04:27:43.762 --> 04:27:46.445]  And, Carol, this is for you as well.
[04:27:46.445 --> 04:27:52.490]  I know there's lots of malicious, but I think it's more along the lines of what Alex says in terms of about five or six guys or friends.
[04:27:53.911 --> 04:27:54.292]  I don't know.
[04:28:01.794 --> 04:28:13.738]  Yeah, this is only done, this is done so if society breaks down or they're trying to take people to FEMA camps so they're doing this, that you got people to watch your back.
[04:28:13.738 --> 04:28:22.981]  I mean, this is people who are serious going, man, this government looks like Nazi Germany mixed with Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot and a little sprinkling of Fidel Castro.
[04:28:22.981 --> 04:28:24.582]  We better protect our families.
[04:28:25.543 --> 04:28:32.749]  I mean, for anybody that has any history, any education, that's why there's so many military people and police in this, because they know what they're looking at.
[04:28:32.749 --> 04:28:35.091]  I mean, this walks like a duck, quacks like a duck.
[04:28:35.091 --> 04:28:35.572]  It's a duck.
[04:28:35.572 --> 04:28:40.336]  Anything else, sir?
[04:28:40.336 --> 04:28:41.297]  Yes, yes.
[04:28:41.297 --> 04:28:41.817]  A couple things.
[04:28:41.817 --> 04:28:45.320]  I will say that there's got to be others out there like me.
[04:28:45.320 --> 04:28:47.482]  I'm married, have kids, and I'm with you 100% on the kids.
[04:28:47.482 --> 04:28:48.703]  I love everybody's kids.
[04:28:48.703 --> 04:28:52.746]  And that is one of the reasons why, you know, you're going to be fighting for the cause or whatever.
[04:28:54.955 --> 04:29:03.201]  The public being so brainwashed, my spouse being one of them, it's hard to get through to them in terms of what is really going on.
[04:29:03.201 --> 04:29:13.588]  Everything you say, everything you do is a conspiracy theory or this or that, and it just goes to show how dumbed down, how flawedated, how brainwashed they really are.
[04:29:13.588 --> 04:29:22.234]  Well look how far we've come though, where huge amounts of people are waking up now, but God bless you, good to hear from you Casey, keep it up.
[04:29:22.234 --> 04:29:23.895]  Jim in Utah, Jim you're on the air.
[04:29:25.015 --> 04:29:25.515]  Yes, sir.
[04:29:25.515 --> 04:29:31.718]  First of all, I would like to say I appreciate the way you handled the call a couple weeks from the little 13-year-old boy.
[04:29:31.718 --> 04:29:37.140]  I think that was very professional, and kudos to you for that.
[04:29:37.140 --> 04:29:51.885]  And two, I'm not an active member of a militia, but I have informed people in my town and city council members and the pharmacists, and they are not going along with any program that the government's got for them.
[04:29:53.953 --> 04:29:59.038]  Yeah, I mean really, saying you're with the militia is saying you're going to defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[04:29:59.038 --> 04:30:09.390]  When I had the idea seven years ago, on air, and it's our great listeners really deserve the credit for this, I said, let's get groups together
[04:30:10.902 --> 04:30:17.586]  To write up city, county, and state ordinances and laws saying, here we protect the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[04:30:17.586 --> 04:30:20.468]  They have their free speech zones, sequestering our free speech.
[04:30:20.468 --> 04:30:26.152]  How about we say the city of Austin, and the county of Travis County, and the state of Texas, and every other county, city, and state.
[04:30:27.313 --> 04:30:29.576]  Here, the Bill of Rights and Constitution is honored.
[04:30:29.576 --> 04:30:32.700]  Here, America is a good word, not a dirty word.
[04:30:32.700 --> 04:30:36.225]  Here, George Washington is a good word, not a dirty word.
[04:30:36.225 --> 04:30:42.213]  Here, the Gadsden flag is a symbol of liberty and freedom and eternal vigilance, not a symbol of boogeymen and something scary.
[04:30:44.867 --> 04:30:54.755]  That is now, all these years later, close to 800 cities, five states passed laws saying we will not follow the Unconstitutional Patriot Act.
[04:30:54.755 --> 04:30:58.058]  And that's all we're saying now is, look, you're not getting our guns.
[04:30:58.058 --> 04:30:58.899]  We're waking up.
[04:30:58.899 --> 04:31:00.660]  We see you arming against us.
[04:31:00.660 --> 04:31:11.409]  We see the government circling, the illegitimate government, building up military force, circling around us, building these great armies, just like the Declaration of Independence talked about, stationing these paramilitary forces here.
[04:31:12.230 --> 04:31:22.717]  And we see what you're gearing up for, and we see what your own documents state, and it's just like when a bully is sitting there punching you in the face, and you go, look, you better stop.
[04:31:22.717 --> 04:31:23.377]  You better stop.
[04:31:23.377 --> 04:31:26.539]  People that have a long fuse, you better stop.
[04:31:26.539 --> 04:31:29.241]  And finally, you're just like, look, don't punch me again.
[04:31:30.379 --> 04:31:33.601]  Yes sir, I'd like to say that the way I got your message out, mostly because
[04:32:01.076 --> 04:32:20.348]  Uh, of the people here is I have a PA system with about 400 watts, and I just run my computer through it, and I have jammed it for the last three months every day, peaceably and lullaby, but to the effect where people have come to me and watched the Puppet Gov videos, and, you know, they're pissed.
[04:32:20.348 --> 04:32:25.711]  They are getting pissed, and they're not just going to come in this little town where I'm at and have their way.
[04:32:25.711 --> 04:32:27.232]  Their raping days are over.
[04:32:28.724 --> 04:32:33.767]  So what you're saying is you blare from your house or your car my radio show?
[04:32:33.767 --> 04:32:48.477]  I'll say, I'll run your radio show through my PA system like a band would use, and everybody around me from about 10am to about where your show ends, that's what they hear.
[04:32:48.477 --> 04:32:53.300]  And while I'm on the phone, I'd like to tell you that E-Foods Direct is really good.
[04:32:54.008 --> 04:32:55.669]  Hey Alex, I'm a member of the Unorganized Militia.
[04:32:55.669 --> 04:32:56.349]  How you doing?
[04:32:56.349 --> 04:32:58.530]  Just like your previous caller said, I don't see as much of a choice.
[04:32:58.530 --> 04:33:00.911]  I mean, everyone defines the Federalist Papers as being able-bodied between 18 and 45.
[04:33:31.593 --> 04:33:32.093]  Well said.
[04:33:32.093 --> 04:33:37.654]  Anytime you delegate your authority, that'd be like if you had a business and you left it to somebody for 20 years.
[04:33:37.654 --> 04:33:43.215]  You'd come back, the locks would be changed, and they'd say, get out of here, this is my business.
[04:33:43.215 --> 04:33:44.435]  And that's what government has said.
[04:33:44.435 --> 04:33:50.036]  And people are tired of being pushed around and abused by it, and it's over.
[04:33:50.036 --> 04:33:50.436]  It's over.
[04:33:50.936 --> 04:33:52.837]  Let me give the establishment the message.
[04:33:52.837 --> 04:33:53.277]  It's over.
[04:33:53.277 --> 04:33:55.277]  That's why they put Obama in.
[04:33:55.277 --> 04:33:56.938]  Because, you know, we were criticizing Bush.
[04:33:56.938 --> 04:33:57.958]  He's just a puppet.
[04:33:57.958 --> 04:34:00.799]  So they can invoke the race card and try to make it racial.
[04:34:00.799 --> 04:34:05.281]  And, you know, oh, if you say the government's socialists are too big, that's code for the N-word.
[04:34:05.281 --> 04:34:06.941]  They're injecting race.
[04:34:06.941 --> 04:34:09.142]  They want to get everybody at each other's throats.
[04:34:09.142 --> 04:34:11.222]  But let me tell you, it's not working, folks.
[04:34:11.222 --> 04:34:12.003]  It's not working.
[04:34:12.003 --> 04:34:15.164]  People are coming together, black, white, old, young, it doesn't matter.
[04:34:15.164 --> 04:34:17.344]  And it's just beautiful and wonderful to see.
[04:34:17.344 --> 04:34:19.185]  And I'm just so honored to be involved in it.
[04:34:21.104 --> 04:34:23.945]  Thank you, Carol, for doing your own independent research into the militia.
[04:34:23.945 --> 04:34:31.988]  I think you might be surprised if you had any preconceived notions coming in about who might comprise the militia.
[04:34:31.988 --> 04:34:36.209]  Well, I did have preconceived notions because of what I saw in the 90s.
[04:34:36.209 --> 04:34:39.950]  And when I saw that there was a resurgence, I decided to take a look at it.
[04:34:39.950 --> 04:34:42.771]  Are you finding more and more people interested in what you're doing?
[04:34:42.771 --> 04:34:44.552]  Do you think there are more and more people doing this?
[04:34:46.314 --> 04:34:49.096]  Oh yes, over the last couple of years there's a lot more people.
[04:34:49.096 --> 04:34:52.579]  And they're ordinary people, you know, they're trade people.
[04:34:52.579 --> 04:34:54.801]  They're just like the Sons of Liberty were.
[04:34:54.801 --> 04:34:58.203]  It's just the same thing.
[04:34:58.203 --> 04:35:04.729]  How do you think the media has portrayed you or whoever, the media or the government or whomever, how do you think you've been portrayed in the past?
[04:35:04.729 --> 04:35:06.210]  And is it wrong and why?
[04:35:07.383 --> 04:35:08.483]  Well, I don't take it personally.
[04:35:08.483 --> 04:35:13.826]  I mean, I think that's just a stigma that they perpetuate for a political reason.
[04:35:13.826 --> 04:35:14.906]  It's just black ops.
[04:35:14.906 --> 04:35:16.467]  It's just military.
[04:35:16.467 --> 04:35:23.989]  I mean, they lie and say there's no bills to have national compulsory service when the bills are introduced and Obama's giving speeches for it.
[04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:34.214]  They want to make all this racial, too, so they can play groups off against each other and make it a racial issue when it's not, see?
[04:35:34.214 --> 04:35:35.655]  But that's not going to work.
[04:35:35.655 --> 04:35:47.280]  I mean, the more asinine the government and the media get, the more... I mean, the media keeps wondering why they're losing ratings, losing viewers, and why nobody believes anything they say now.
[04:35:47.280 --> 04:35:49.181]  And it's because everybody knows that
[04:35:50.000 --> 04:35:54.806]  The majority of what comes out of the mainstream media is a crock of baloney.
[04:35:54.806 --> 04:35:55.868]  It's over.
[04:35:55.868 --> 04:36:00.294]  I mean, I don't think the establishment realizes this is the beginning of the end.
[04:36:00.294 --> 04:36:07.563]  They're going to be able to kill a bunch of us and do a lot of horrible stuff and stage terror attacks on the military and say we did it and we've already caught them doing drills for it.
[04:36:08.297 --> 04:36:09.398]  It isn't going to work.
[04:36:09.398 --> 04:36:10.179]  It's over.
[04:36:10.179 --> 04:36:11.741]  This is a war they're going to lose.
[04:36:11.741 --> 04:36:14.063]  The people, the spirit of liberty has been ignited.
[04:36:14.063 --> 04:36:16.606]  The spirit of 1776 has risen.
[04:36:16.606 --> 04:36:18.187]  And it's over.
[04:36:18.187 --> 04:36:18.568]  It's over.
[04:36:18.568 --> 04:36:21.591]  The New World Order is defeated.
[04:36:21.591 --> 04:36:24.654]  So do you think we're going to see Americans fighting Americans?
[04:36:24.654 --> 04:36:26.476]  Is that what's going to happen?
[04:36:26.476 --> 04:36:31.381]  You're going to see the Feds try to march the military and police up against the American people.
[04:36:31.381 --> 04:36:32.101]  And you're going to see
[04:36:33.353 --> 04:36:36.095]  You're going to see amazing things happen.
[04:36:36.095 --> 04:36:41.718]  Unless we're able to just get the word out and the establishment does the calculations and decides to back off.
[04:36:41.718 --> 04:36:45.140]  The smartest thing for the New World Order to do is to back off.
[04:36:45.140 --> 04:36:52.405]  And the worldly side of me would like things to not become tumultuous and would like things to stay smooth, but sometimes stagnation leads to total destruction.
[04:36:53.610 --> 04:36:58.333]  And so, if I was the New World Order, I would back off and not escalate this.
[04:36:58.333 --> 04:37:01.494]  But they can't help their nature up in their ivory towers.
[04:37:01.494 --> 04:37:04.516]  And their macho minions want to march off against the Republic.
[04:37:04.516 --> 04:37:11.660]  And I'm just telling you, they were destined from the foundations of this country for this second revolution to happen, and they will fail.
[04:37:11.660 --> 04:37:17.463]  Just like they failed with the Shays' Rebellion, just like they failed every other time, just like they failed with Andrew Jackson.
[04:37:17.463 --> 04:37:21.765]  We're praying for peace, preparing for war.
[04:37:25.322 --> 04:37:29.225]  So Jason, do you go out and train then?
[04:37:29.225 --> 04:37:29.745]  Sure.
[04:37:29.745 --> 04:37:31.066]  Oh yeah.
[04:37:31.066 --> 04:37:33.067]  Who's the target?
[04:37:33.067 --> 04:37:36.029]  When you do that, who's the imagined target?
[04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:37.670]  The attacker.
[04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:38.111]  Go ahead.
[04:37:38.111 --> 04:37:41.773]  I don't have a target.
[04:37:41.773 --> 04:37:46.396]  Who in your mind are you training and preparing for?
[04:37:46.396 --> 04:37:50.119]  Domestic or foreign enemies of the Constitution.
[04:37:51.616 --> 04:37:54.779]  So in other words, domestic, then you're talking the federal government?
[04:37:54.779 --> 04:37:55.399]  No.
[04:37:55.399 --> 04:37:59.123]  Anyone who is... Any domestic or foreign?
[04:37:59.123 --> 04:38:00.364]  Any domestic or foreign enemy.
[04:38:00.364 --> 04:38:07.350]  Because you swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[04:38:07.350 --> 04:38:12.095]  But you're actually afraid for your life and your family's lives?
[04:38:12.095 --> 04:38:15.097]  Governments killed 200 million people last century alone.
[04:38:15.097 --> 04:38:15.998]  We better be.
[04:38:15.998 --> 04:38:17.960]  Number one cause of unnatural deaths, government.
[04:38:20.711 --> 04:38:22.112]  Okay, I'm learning.
[04:38:22.112 --> 04:38:22.632]  I'm learning.
[04:38:22.632 --> 04:38:27.355]  I mean, have you seen Operation Valkyrie with Tom Cruise?
[04:38:27.355 --> 04:38:30.417]  It's very accurate and historical.
[04:38:30.417 --> 04:38:35.021]  We have a Hitlerian government forming, but it's not in the personage of one dictator.
[04:38:35.021 --> 04:38:36.021]  It's a system.
[04:38:36.021 --> 04:38:39.263]  So we're trying in the information war to peacefully counter that.
[04:38:39.263 --> 04:38:41.085]  But the system wants to use force.
[04:38:41.085 --> 04:38:42.365]  They want to start a war.
[04:38:42.365 --> 04:38:43.987]  They stage attacks against themselves.
[04:38:43.987 --> 04:38:45.748]  Have you read Operation Northwoods?
[04:38:45.748 --> 04:38:45.948]  U.S.
[04:38:45.948 --> 04:38:50.191]  government plan to terrorize its own cities as a pretext to crack down on enemies.
[04:38:50.191 --> 04:38:50.291]  No.
[04:38:51.071 --> 04:38:54.193]  We're fighting to stop that.
[04:38:54.193 --> 04:38:56.334]  We are working for peace every day.
[04:38:56.334 --> 04:38:59.436]  But we're saying we're not your slaves.
[04:38:59.436 --> 04:39:02.638]  We're not going to be taken to your forced labor camp.
[04:39:02.638 --> 04:39:04.379]  And they are setting up forced labor camps.
[04:39:04.379 --> 04:39:05.499]  Where?
[04:39:05.499 --> 04:39:16.365]  The Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, the FEMA legislation, the Gulag Archipelago that's been set up in this country.
[04:39:16.365 --> 04:39:16.926]  Anything else, sir?
[04:39:18.817 --> 04:39:29.483]  Yeah, I think that, you know, the reason these elite people are very successful is because they simply just have a goal, and they get together, and they talk about their goal, and they talk about how they're going to achieve it, and then they do it.
[04:39:29.483 --> 04:39:34.366]  And, you know, I wondered, you're the physicist here, Alex, I'm sorry that, you know, you know that, and I know that.
[04:39:34.366 --> 04:39:45.733]  Have you ever thought about articulating a goal, and then having a meeting, and then talking about it, and getting it, I guess you do a lot of that right on the radio show, but have you ever considered having a meeting?
[04:39:46.206 --> 04:39:48.268]  Well, look at what we did with the posters.
[04:39:48.268 --> 04:39:58.856]  Everything I do has to be asymmetrical, where it's about everybody having power, everybody being a leader, leaderless resistance, a creed, an idea, a constitution, a manifesto.
[04:39:58.856 --> 04:40:11.446]  And so, from Tokyo, Japan, to London, England, to Austin, Texas, to the Toronto Star reporting every major road has ObamaInfoWars.com posters or Obama tyrant posters everywhere.
[04:40:12.066 --> 04:40:20.850]  That was an example of just our listeners taking action to see how, even if they shut the web off, we can still go out and effectively counter them.
[04:40:20.850 --> 04:40:27.993]  And I'm knocking on heaven's door, the more I become a leader and the more I do try to organize people.
[04:40:27.993 --> 04:40:29.853]  I do want to stay in the game.
[04:40:29.853 --> 04:40:33.795]  And I'm not, I don't want to be, you know, killed by these people.
[04:40:33.795 --> 04:40:38.617]  And there's Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, Army Regulation 210-35, operating right now with U.S.
[04:40:38.617 --> 04:40:39.237]  citizens in them.
[04:40:42.398 --> 04:40:43.619]  But it's all done in a legalese.
[04:40:43.619 --> 04:40:47.681]  Oh, we take state and federal prisoners and put them on bases that the army runs.
[04:40:47.681 --> 04:40:50.843]  And they took the old military bases, as the old-timers said in the 90s.
[04:40:50.843 --> 04:40:52.344]  Now that's in the new congressional bills.
[04:40:52.344 --> 04:40:53.805]  They're already built and set up.
[04:40:53.805 --> 04:40:55.926]  They go, oh, we're going to be a community center of the camp.
[04:40:55.926 --> 04:40:57.607]  You'll need to go there because you're homeless.
[04:40:57.607 --> 04:40:59.528]  You're not allowed to be homeless anymore in California.
[04:40:59.528 --> 04:41:00.829]  You must go to the camp.
[04:41:00.829 --> 04:41:01.710]  We've sent cameras there.
[04:41:02.190 --> 04:41:09.514]  And, oh, we frisk you, and, oh, there's a brig, and, oh, you see, oh, you want to be in the camp because the economy's bad.
[04:41:09.514 --> 04:41:11.915]  Remember Germany and what the Soviets did?
[04:41:11.915 --> 04:41:13.615]  Oh, you need to come here.
[04:41:13.615 --> 04:41:14.996]  And you've got to work while you're here.
[04:41:14.996 --> 04:41:16.617]  We can't just feed you for free.
[04:41:16.617 --> 04:41:18.158]  Things are tough in America.
[04:41:18.158 --> 04:41:21.699]  We've got to pay those tens of trillions back to those private banks.
[04:41:21.699 --> 04:41:28.122]  And, again, as we're successful stopping all this happening, then the media say, oh, look, it didn't happen because we're there fighting.
[04:41:28.122 --> 04:41:29.363]  But these bills are all there.
[04:41:29.363 --> 04:41:30.583]  The legislation's all there.
[04:41:30.583 --> 04:41:31.324]  It's all real.
[04:41:32.108 --> 04:41:35.030]  So do you think homeless shelters are camps as well?
[04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:37.812]  Well, that's how they're setting them up at old bases.
[04:41:37.812 --> 04:41:45.937]  Yes, I've been to military drills where they practice putting up camps in minutes at sports stadiums and Operation Top Off and NLE organizers.
[04:41:45.937 --> 04:41:48.919]  Why can't it just be people helping other people to get back on their feet?
[04:41:48.919 --> 04:41:50.139]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:41:50.139 --> 04:41:52.541]  I'm telling you that they say the FEMA camps.
[04:41:54.178 --> 04:41:56.139]  I mean they're just trying to help homeless people.
[04:42:17.625 --> 04:42:21.648]  Because they had their economy shut down with a no-work list, which they now have.
[04:42:21.648 --> 04:42:24.489]  The no-fly list will be a no-gun-buy list and a no-work list.
[04:42:24.489 --> 04:42:27.031]  Those bills have been introduced.
[04:42:27.031 --> 04:42:30.573]  You're card no-worky, you not have job.
[04:42:30.573 --> 04:42:35.996]  They're sending feds out new federal regulations to try to shut down the eBay accounts that are private.
[04:42:35.996 --> 04:42:37.817]  They're trying to shut down the garage sales.
[04:42:37.817 --> 04:42:40.839]  They're arresting Amish people selling eggs on the side of the road.
[04:42:40.839 --> 04:42:44.041]  They have the animal ID, the premises ID, to take over the farms and ranches.
[04:42:44.041 --> 04:42:44.702]  It's all happening.
[04:42:45.593 --> 04:42:52.638]  He has erected swarms of new agencies and sent forth his agents to eat out our substance.
[04:42:52.638 --> 04:42:54.940]  Anything else, caller?
[04:42:54.940 --> 04:42:55.700]  No, thanks, Alex.
[04:42:55.700 --> 04:42:57.101]  You're a brilliant investigative journalist.
[04:42:57.101 --> 04:42:59.163]  Alright, God bless you, Jason.
[04:42:59.163 --> 04:43:00.724]  Robert in Kentucky.
[04:43:00.724 --> 04:43:02.785]  Robert, you're on the air.
[04:43:02.785 --> 04:43:03.866]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:43:03.866 --> 04:43:06.748]  I appreciate talking to you and Carol.
[04:43:06.748 --> 04:43:09.890]  I got out of the Marine Corps in 1991.
[04:43:09.890 --> 04:43:12.752]  I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it.
[04:43:14.611 --> 04:43:19.013]  Just the countless things that I had seen while I was in the Marine Corps.
[04:43:19.013 --> 04:43:21.355]  I got out, went to join the Kentucky Militia.
[04:43:21.355 --> 04:43:24.997]  About a month later, the President shot two state troopers.
[04:43:24.997 --> 04:43:26.397]  Backed off of it.
[04:43:26.397 --> 04:43:31.360]  That now, you know, I don't know what this is, but I want no part of it.
[04:43:31.360 --> 04:43:35.342]  You're saying the President of your militia shot two state troopers?
[04:43:35.342 --> 04:43:37.143]  Yes.
[04:43:37.143 --> 04:43:39.104]  And I backed off.
[04:43:39.104 --> 04:43:42.126]  You know, didn't want any part of it.
[04:43:42.126 --> 04:43:43.387]  Later on, after I woke up,
[04:43:45.047 --> 04:43:48.090]  Uh, you know, I decided there was a need for something.
[04:43:48.090 --> 04:43:54.296]  But, uh, big organized militias, uh, I just didn't feel that was right.
[04:43:54.296 --> 04:43:57.379]  So, I found four or five buddies.
[04:43:57.379 --> 04:43:58.800]  We all think the same.
[04:43:58.800 --> 04:44:00.382]  We all believe the same.
[04:44:00.382 --> 04:44:01.723]  We're all gun owners.
[04:44:01.723 --> 04:44:03.244]  We're all proud Americans.
[04:44:03.244 --> 04:44:04.606]  You know, we hang together.
[04:44:05.168 --> 04:44:11.551]  Yeah, really, and I want you to finish up, you're our last caller, but what we see is people that are just going to watch each other's backs.
[04:44:11.551 --> 04:44:19.655]  These are like a mutual covenant to come to each other's aid, which is a normal human thing to do.
[04:44:19.655 --> 04:44:22.756]  It's abnormal that we're not close to the land.
[04:44:22.756 --> 04:44:29.119]  It's abnormal people don't question where power comes from for a light bulb, or where meat comes from, or where vegetables come from.
[04:44:29.119 --> 04:44:30.980]  So I think it's really people
[04:44:33.499 --> 04:44:37.422]  At a fundamental level, just getting back to their roots of being human beings.
[04:44:37.422 --> 04:44:40.545]  Do you concur with that, Robert?
[04:44:40.545 --> 04:44:41.186]  Yes, I do.
[04:44:41.186 --> 04:44:46.951]  I mean, every day there's a video of police running rampant.
[04:44:46.951 --> 04:44:51.014]  I know a lot of them are good guys, but every day there's a new video.
[04:44:51.014 --> 04:44:57.820]  Two cases within the last three months of a bank making a mistake and people being forced out of homes that are paid for.
[04:44:58.522 --> 04:44:58.582]  Yes.
[04:45:28.139 --> 04:45:29.060]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[04:45:29.060 --> 04:45:32.247]  What happened?
[04:45:32.247 --> 04:45:34.932]  I talked over you, weren't you saying about your house?
[04:45:34.932 --> 04:45:37.978]  I said not gonna happen at my house.
[04:45:37.978 --> 04:45:39.741]  Not gonna happen at my buddy's house.
[04:45:40.592 --> 04:45:41.372]  I saw that on CNN.
[04:45:41.372 --> 04:45:43.713]  They're taking houses now that are paid for.
[04:45:43.713 --> 04:45:45.573]  I mean, just all sorts of chicanery going on.
[04:46:01.095 --> 04:46:01.875]  Chippewa.
[04:46:01.875 --> 04:46:11.538]  She does not live on the reservation, but if there is one people who know how tyrannical the American government can be, it is the Native Americans.
[04:46:11.538 --> 04:46:17.279]  And believe you me, she's a strong supporter of everything we do.
[04:46:17.279 --> 04:46:20.360]  The first act of terrorism was not the World Trade Center.
[04:46:20.360 --> 04:46:25.001]  It was called Wounded Knee, and it was committed by American troops.
[04:46:25.001 --> 04:46:29.562]  When people wonder about biological weapons, I have early
[04:46:31.119 --> 04:46:32.580]  1724, I believe.
[04:46:32.580 --> 04:46:34.823]  You can pull it up online, it's famous.
[04:46:34.823 --> 04:46:47.436]  The British officer's manual is about take the blankets that your sick men have been on, give it to them quickly because the disease seems to only last for a day, and give it to the natives.
[04:46:48.823 --> 04:46:56.529]  I mean, there's stuff with the Mongols catapulting plague bodies over Chinese walls, you know, thousands of years ago.
[04:46:56.529 --> 04:47:03.554]  But I mean, the cold-bloodedness of this and... But go ahead and finish your point, sir.
[04:47:04.823 --> 04:47:14.532]  You know, my point is, I have four or five friends, we are a tight unit, and to tell you the truth, after I got out of the Marine Corps, I started reading some of Michael Connolly's work.
[04:47:14.532 --> 04:47:25.521]  I don't really support, I ain't gonna say terrorist activity, but if there was one group who stood against the Roth government, the opposition government, it was the IRA.
[04:47:25.521 --> 04:47:29.205]  You have four or five people in a cell, you take care of each other.
[04:47:29.205 --> 04:47:29.505]  Period.
[04:47:30.583 --> 04:47:32.024]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[04:47:32.024 --> 04:47:33.305]  I appreciate you calling in.
[04:47:33.305 --> 04:47:35.306]  That's a place to end it.
[04:47:35.306 --> 04:47:36.887]  Go ahead and take us out of here.
[04:47:36.887 --> 04:47:39.068]  I would just add in closing, look at the schools.
[04:47:39.068 --> 04:47:42.150]  The children are being trained how to live as prisoners.
[04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:45.732]  They're taking DNA tests for 36 years secretly from everybody who's born.
[04:47:45.732 --> 04:47:47.833]  I was told that by a congressman a decade ago.
[04:47:47.833 --> 04:47:48.974]  It's now been declassified.
[04:47:49.954 --> 04:47:52.456]  They've got cameras in the school bathrooms.
[04:47:52.456 --> 04:47:55.237]  They're training the kids to tattle on their parents.
[04:47:55.237 --> 04:47:57.078]  They're setting up all these Stasi groups.
[04:47:57.078 --> 04:47:59.740]  They tell locals, come to an FBI meeting.
[04:47:59.740 --> 04:48:01.261]  We're going to teach you how to fight Al Qaeda.
[04:48:01.261 --> 04:48:03.882]  You get there, they spend 15 minutes on Al Qaeda.
[04:48:03.882 --> 04:48:06.404]  The rest of the meeting is about spying on your neighbors.
[04:48:06.404 --> 04:48:07.544]  Are they spanking their kids?
[04:48:07.544 --> 04:48:09.265]  Do they have marijuana plants?
[04:48:09.265 --> 04:48:11.867]  I mean, the government has gone big time bad.
[04:48:11.867 --> 04:48:13.467]  It's too big for its britches.
[04:48:13.467 --> 04:48:14.588]  It's out of control.
[04:48:14.588 --> 04:48:16.009]  And the American people
[04:48:16.169 --> 04:48:17.630]  We are a sleeping giant.
[04:48:17.630 --> 04:48:22.674]  It is rising up against that bully, and the bully needs to back down right now.
[04:48:22.674 --> 04:48:23.475]  That's it!
[04:48:23.475 --> 04:48:27.258]  A four-hour, 49-minute radio-TV transmission.
[04:48:27.258 --> 04:48:32.342]  It's all being archived up at PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com.
[04:48:32.342 --> 04:48:38.467]  I'm Alex Jones, as always, true to the Republic, be part of history, stand up against the New World Order.
[04:48:38.467 --> 04:48:42.510]  We'll see you back tomorrow, 11 a.m., Frontlines of the Infowars.
[04:48:55.471 --> 04:48:59.616]  I don't know.
