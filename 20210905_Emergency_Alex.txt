[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.180]  ** Cheering, shouting, and shouting continues **
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:34.180]  ** Cheering, shouting, and shouting continues **
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:58.180]  ** Cheering, shouting, and shouting continues **
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:08.180]  ** Cheering, shouting, and shouting continues **
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:38.180]  ** Cheering, shouting, and shouting continues **
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.180]  Thank you for joining us on this Saturday, September 4, 2021 emergency Saturday transmission.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.180]  I am hoping that you will take notes and research every claim we make here
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:02.180]  and see the horrifying truth for yourself that the globalists are publicly declaring a declaration of war against open free societies,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.180]  against prosperity, and against human life itself.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.180]  And I'm going to go over that in great detail in this most important transmission I've ever done.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.180]  And as the days and weeks and months go forward, years, if we're still on air,
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.180]  I would imagine those shows will become even more important than this one.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.180]  But we are in very, very dangerous waters right now.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.180]  We are under directed post human eugenics operations.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.180]  We are in agenda 2030 right now.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.180]  Now, you just saw hundreds and hundreds of thousands outside of angry parents and citizens in the UK
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.180]  breaking into the government policy center that was setting policy to forcibly inject under 16 year olds
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.180]  with the deadly gene therapy toxins.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.180]  And this is humanity fighting for its life.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.180]  These are the people that understand how serious the stakes are and that big pharma and the big banks own and control big tech
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.180]  and with governments are suppressing the fact that this is a depopulation operation that's been launched in their own words.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180]  I'm going to show you those documents in the moment.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.180]  I'm going to show you just the last few days in some places, hundreds of thousands.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.180]  Other areas, millions, tens of thousands hitting the streets and protesting the global I.D.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.180]  and the global carbon calorie passports that are coming out that are officially announced by the Council on Foreign Relations,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.180]  the Davos Group, the Trilateral Commission, now by the Australian leadership, by the Canadian leadership and others.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.180]  But let me just show you this new Council on Foreign Relations document that just came out in the last week.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.180]  And they echo what Klaus Schwab said in the Great Reset and what the U.N.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:57.180]  has said that the world's never going back and that they're going to have carbon lockdowns now through your vaccine passport app
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.180]  that are going to track and trace where you go and tax you to use a car to eat meat, to have air conditioning, you name it.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.180]  With total surveillance, no Internet privacy, Internet I.D., it's all being announced.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.180]  And the beta test is the UK, Australia and Canada.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.180]  And they admit it's being rolled out in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Miami and other areas.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.180]  So let's just read here at the end of this the fight for climate after covid-19.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.180]  They said, oh, this is really about saving the earth and shutting down human civilization.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.180]  Covid-19 exposed the world's failure to prepare for the worst.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180]  Can we learn to build back better?
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:46.180]  We had Nancy Pelosi here with that U.N. statement about build back better means tear everything down and starve you to death
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.180]  and implode the third world and organize them into a group to invade the West.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:59.180]  Unapologetic and clear eyed, the fight for climate after covid-19 helps us understand why the time has come to prepare
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.180]  for the world as it will be rather than it once was.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.180]  And I've got the actual document they're talking about right here.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.180]  We'll be getting to it where it talks about the full extinction of humanity is the goal.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.180]  That's Wall Street Journal NBC News.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.180]  That'll probably be about 30 minutes that we'll be getting to this stack right here.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.180]  You can go see this or read this for yourself.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.180]  But first, let's show humanity as we chronicle this day to day.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.180]  I'm on air seven days a week now. Let's show humanity.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.180]  What we need to do as the vanguard stands up against this post-industrial takeover that the Rockefeller Foundation,
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180]  the UN admitted 11 years ago, they would be executing.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.180]  They said by the year 2020, they would launch agenda 2030,
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.180]  which is the plan to destroy civilization as we know it and reduce population by 90 percent.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.180]  So here is humanity fighting back.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:39.180]  College football is really back when a jam-packed Lane Stadium is singing along to enter Sandman.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:33.180]  On the Granville Street area downtown, but take a look at this time-lapse video.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.180]  This shows thousands of people crossing the Canby Street bridge earlier this afternoon.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180]  A number of roads around there were shut down.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.180]  Some drivers say it took them an hour to get out of the Canby Street area.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.180]  So this whole event is part of what the organizers are calling a worldwide walkout.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.180]  The point is to reject what they say is the tyranny of mandatory vaccines.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:00.180]  So this rally, it started at 1 p.m. outside the hospital, making for heavy traffic along some of these essential routes.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.180]  The group then moved in front of City Hall.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.180]  Mayor Kennedy Stewart is not impressed. He had this to say.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:31.180]  A crowd so loud, you could barely hear the loudspeakers.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.180]  Close to 5,000 people rallied in front of Vancouver City Hall this afternoon,
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.180]  causing complete gridlock in the area around the Vancouver General Hospital.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.180]  At one point, the crowd parted so an ambulance could slowly pass through.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.180]  And while they stood together, they weren't all there for the same reasons.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.180]  Some don't want vaccines for themselves.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.180]  I don't trust what's in them. I don't believe that we know enough.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:00.180]  I think that it was prematurely rolled out, and I'm just not comfortable with that.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.180]  Others are frustrated by government messaging.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:12.180]  Dr. Bonnie Henry in a Kamloops article in May said that the inequities in our society are such that there's no way we would implement a vaccine passport.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.180]  She said that in May, quote-unquote. And now we have a vaccine passport.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.180]  But mostly, they don't want vaccines to be mandatory for anyone.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.180]  It's not totally against being vaccinated when I'm vaccinated.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.180]  I'm here because I find that the freedoms of all of these people in Canada is being squashed.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:42.180]  Across the province, similar rallies took place outside major hospitals in Victoria, Nelson and Prince George, and also in Kelowna.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:51.180]  When I became a nurse, I made an oath to advocate for my patients, and patients have the right to refuse.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.180]  It's in BC law. It's what we were taught in school.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.180]  Everybody should have the right to choose whatever goes into their bodies.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.180]  It shouldn't be mandatory for those people who want to, well and good.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:08.180]  In BC so far, vaccines are only mandatory for those who work in long-term care homes.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.180]  I'm not going to get the COVID vaccine.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.180]  My wife is a nurse, and she works in assisted living, and she's not going to get it either.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.180]  So there's some hard decisions that got to be made on September 13th.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:25.180]  A new vaccine card will be required starting September 13th for non-essential services like gyms and restaurants.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.180]  And protesters say that's a slippery slope towards eroding their freedom.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.180]  Eva-Yu Gwen Senj, CBC News, Vancouver.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:53.180]  What are you seeing for vaccine injuries?
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.180]  Just this past week, how about this?
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:07.180]  Three fully vaccinated individuals deceased in quads left and right, DVTs, pulmonary emboli.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:12.180]  I mean, on blood thinners, and this is ever since they got vaccinated.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:22.180]  I had a 30-year-old woman who started bleeding, basically hemorrhaging, ever since he got injected, literally within the 48 hours.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:37.180]  This poor woman is a mother of two, like I said, 30 years old, and she was fully vaccinated and regrets it deeply.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:44.180]  This is a month ago, and she is now intubated in critical condition, fighting for her life, potentially about to leave her children motherless.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.180]  And of course, she regrets 1,000% being injected, and she acknowledges it.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.180]  So did her physician.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.180]  I don't know why the lives continue. I see it every single day.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.180]  This whole story about 90% unvaccinated cases, no.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:07.180]  I can tell you, I've been in the front of the lines for the last year and eight months, or however long it's been, too long, and that is a complete lie.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.180]  I have seen nothing but vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated as well.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.180]  But don't believe the lies. Don't believe the media. It's awful.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.180]  And you work in the ICU, right?
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.180]  I have worked ICU. I am on a unit that is strictly COVID patients at this point.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.180]  So the news media is lying. How about that?
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.180]  The whole time. The entire time.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:52.180]  Daniel Andrews has announced that Victoria's lockdown will be extended until 2070.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:58.180]  No, it won't. It will not. Take the lead back to the beginning.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.180]  Take the lead back to the beginning.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:10.180]  Daniel Andrews has announced that Victoria's lockdown will be extended until 70% of the state has had at least one dose of the COVID vaccine.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:17.180]  That was not a Freudian slip. You could tell that she did that on purpose as a desperate warning to the public.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.180]  The Aussies have been a prison colony for over 140 years.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.180]  And they understand what's going on.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:28.180]  And so all over the place, they are basically putting out emergency messages to the public.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.180]  Many of their top presenters and reporters have actually gone public against what's happening.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:40.180]  But this isn't going to go to 2070 because they plan to totally depopulate the earth of humans by then.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.180]  And again, I'm going to show you those documents coming up.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.180]  But the first thing I want to get to is cold, hard facts from the Israeli government, the U.N.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:57.180]  and John Hopkins that works the Rockefeller Foundation that are putting together the statistics and the numbers.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:03.180]  And I guess they hope you don't go look these up because for them, it's the depopulation they're carrying out.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.180]  To them, this is a crosshairs like a scope on a rifle.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.180]  And they're looking through it to see how deadly their damage has been.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.180]  But they don't want you to look at those statistics.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.180]  So, again, here are the side by sides, India and Israel.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:24.180]  And it mirrors this for other countries that are low vaccination rate with the so-called vaccine COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.180]  Here are the side by sides of India and Israel.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.180]  New COVID cases.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.180]  India has a 10 percent vaccination rate.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.180]  Israel has a 65.
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.180]  It's actually more like 90 vaccination rate.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.180]  India uses ivermectin, vitamin D and zinc.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.180]  Israel uses COVID vaccinations and booster shots of the same poison.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.180]  Any questions?
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.180]  So you see when they first did some of their 10 percent vaccinations, they haven't done it in a long time.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.180]  You see the spike.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.180]  And then as it goes on, almost no activity, almost no death.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:15:01.180]  CNN, though, will show people being burned outside and say, look, they're burning people outside because they have no place to bury them.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.180]  They're Buddhist and Hindus.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.180]  They burn their bodies.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.180]  They don't bury them.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:13.180]  That's an Egyptian thing that the Romans and the Greeks picked up, the Greeks and the Romans.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.180]  That's something ancient Druids and others did.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.180]  The Hindus burn bodies.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:23.180]  Native Americans put a platform up and put the body out in the air to rot.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.180]  OK, so that's what they're doing.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.180]  That's, again, total deception.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:36.180]  And wait till I get to some of the biggest fake news ever that Oklahoma hospitals are full of people sick from ivermectin horse paste
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.180]  that we checked it out.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.180]  It's a fake story by Rolling Stone and others.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.180]  This is the fall of the mainstream media we're witnessing.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.180]  So there's the statistics there for you on screen.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.180]  Here is another one.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:54.180]  Reassurgence of SARS covid-2 infection in a highly vaccinated health workforce.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:02.180]  Another big study showing that as soon as they got vaccinated, the rate of them getting sick with covid went from nothing to off the charts.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:09.180]  I mean, you just it's like, oh, you pour gasoline on something, you light it, it burns, you take the shots, you get really sick.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.180]  Just ask Oscar de la Hoya, who can't get out of bed right now.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.180]  He took both shots and fighting for his life with covid.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:29.180]  Just in Sweden bans travelers from Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, into the country from September six due to record breaking rise in covid-19 cases and deaths.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:35.180]  And it's mainly again, it's tracking mainly people that are vaccinated that are sick and dying.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.180]  And let me just show you some of those numbers.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.180]  Here it is. Israel launched the third dose.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:49.180]  And as predicted, it triggered that auto immune system where it ends up attacking the body.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.180]  Their body warned what happened, I guess, ADE.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.180]  And it's now the deaths are just off the freaking charts.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.180]  They have the most vaccinated people in the world of a big country and it's just just off the charts.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.180]  Here's another one in Israel is still finalizing the report.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:15.180]  But as you can see, it says number of covid deaths in the last month and it's six hundred and six.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:21.180]  And as you can see, it is fully vaccinated, two hundred and seventy two, not fully vaccinated, only one shot, one thirty three.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.180]  That's the vast majority are vaccinated, dying and one seventy three yet to be classified.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.180]  And there's just barely any deaths that weren't vaccinated.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.180]  Barely any deaths that had not had the vaccine.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.180]  And I could just go on with these numbers. It's absolutely amazing.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:45.180]  Forty four peer reviewed Ivermectin studies, thirty nine of them positive, incredible antiviral powers known for decades.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.180]  But I'm going to get to that here in just a few minutes.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.180]  Here's another big one. CNN finally reports the truth.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:59.180]  States that had some of the worst covid-19 cases rates in past week also reported the highest rates of new vaccinations.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:07.180]  This is that funny, just like Israel, because it's a live virus vaccine, whether it's J&J, whether it's Moderna, whether it's Pfizer.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:16.180]  With Moderna and Pfizer, though, it's a synthetic virus, but it is a virus and it's live and it makes your body create more of the spike protein, which infects people.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.180]  Pfizer's own study says that here's another one.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:26.180]  More than one hundred Ontario youth at the hospital for vaccine related heart problems report, including deaths.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:32.180]  Oh, here's all U.S. government report special virus cancer program.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:39.180]  National Cancer Institute. This is U.S. Department of Health Education and Warfare.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:45.180]  They call it welfare, and it goes back to how they knew that most cancer was caused by viruses.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:51.180]  And now they're giving you a cancer virus injection. But they know the general public can't help it.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:57.180]  They just can't believe they're being attacked. So they'll Stockholm syndrome and rationalize and say, oh, it's the non-vaccinated causing it.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.180]  You know, that's not true. Here's that Oscar de la Hoya story I was telling you about from NBC News.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:10.180]  Oscar de la Hoya hospitalized with covid withdraws from Victor Belafonte fight.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:17.180]  And he's there fighting for his life after the second shot. And it just goes on and on from there.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:30.180]  Now let's talk about our children and let's hear from some very respected and esteemed medical doctors on what's really happening because something so huge happened this week.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:37.180]  In the U.K., their main regulatory body of the government said, do not give under 16s any of these experimental shots.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:48.180]  And they said, don't give people the third jab. It looks like this is causing an autoimmune response in the body that we had feared would happen.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.180]  The EU also came out and said, don't give people a third jab.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:57.180]  Now, the EU government is saying they're going to override their CDC and their FDA.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:09.180]  And also Boris Johnson, I've got a clip of him right here, also said he's going to override their own bureaucrats that have worked at the big companies and believe in vaccines.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:15.180]  But see, they know this stuff is really bad and worse than any problems vaccines ever had because this isn't a problem.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:38.180]  This is by design. Again, let that sink in. In late August, now we're already in September, in the year 2021, the regulators in Europe, the regulators in the U.K. and the regulators in the United States came out and said, don't do this.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.180]  Oh, that's right. They didn't just do it in the EU or the U.K.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:57.180]  This week, last Monday, what happened? We saw the number one and number two regulators over the FDA come out and say, don't give it to children under 16.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:06.180]  Don't give people the booster shots. And that politicians and big pharma were making the decisions for the FDA that that shouldn't happen.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:18.180]  Now, the head of the FDA says she's going to go ahead and ram this through anyways. She's the lady that approved OxyContin and, of course, fentanyl and allowed it to be used on children.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:25.180]  Oh, and by the way, the big opium company that brought out OxyContin in their own documents 20 years ago that said, we're going to addict people with this.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:33.180]  It's as strong as heroin, but we're going to claim it's not addictive. They have been given immunity by the federal court.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:43.180]  No jail time, no nothing. I'm going to say it again. The people that dumped OxyContin on America that's killed millions of people, they're saying it's OK.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:50.180]  So that's the federal courts greenlighting what they've just done to us with these poison shots as well.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:57.180]  Truly disgusting, but I just want to say it again because it's so big in the EU, in the UK, in the US.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:02.180]  All the regulatory heads, the heads have said, do not give these under 16s.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:09.180]  Do not do the third quote booster shot. And that we have big pharma and politicians telling us what to do.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.180]  And this is dangerous. So they got stampeded into going along with this and emergency authorization.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:23.180]  The FDA two weeks ago did not authorize. They did a new emergency authorization and said in 2025, we might give it real authorization.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:30.180]  But they're using that fake authorization to now go after our military. I mean, this is criminal activity out in the open.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:38.180]  So let's hear from Dr. McCullough. Let's hear from other expert medical doctors around the world as well.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.180]  And then we're going to have a little clip from Fauci flip flopping and I'll be back.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:50.180]  Just to be clear, that's that's the Pfizer registrational trials published in New England Journal of Medicine May 27th.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:58.180]  Keep in mind that the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine for that group before the release of that paper.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.180]  They approved the vaccine on May 10th with only the information on the antibodies.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:08.180]  So our US FDA in their approval letter did not consider any safety information.
[00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:16.470]  That's unprecedented that our US FDA would not safeguard children and carefully review
[00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:23.670]  safety. Unprecedented and it's a form of agency malfeasance that is wrongdoing by those in position
[00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:33.110]  of authority. As a whistleblower attempt but we have a very broad malfeasance. We have a unification
[00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:42.550]  of doctors groups, the media, the FDA, the CDC, the NIH. None of them are presenting or reviewing
[00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:49.190]  safety whatsoever. None of them and there's no presentation of safety to the public. None.
[00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.150]  Committee members asked who would become, I'm sorry excuse me I read that, several committee
[00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.630]  members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refuse to participate in
[00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.630]  the World Debt Reset Program or the Health Pass or the vaccination schedule. The answer we got
[00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:11.750]  was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we come up with the
[00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:16.310]  plan. Meaning the Liberal Party was told that it was their duty to come up with a plan to ensure
[00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:23.430]  that would never happen. We were told it was in the individual's best interest to participate.
[00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.150]  When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who
[00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:34.150]  refused would first live under the lockdown restrictions indefinitely and that over a short
[00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:40.070]  period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the Debt Forgiveness Program the ones who refused
[00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:46.150]  to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation
[00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:51.510]  facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options. Participate in the Debt
[00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.310]  Forgiveness Program and be released or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under
[00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:03.510]  the classification of a serious public health risk and have all your assets seized. As you can
[00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.990]  imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond
[00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.990]  anything I've ever witnessed before. In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda
[00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:21.910]  will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. The insanity. Look at this. French government
[00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:29.030]  to open 7,000 vaccination centers in school and it says from September they're planning on doing
[00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:36.710]  this to children without parents consent and if the parents do not agree with this they can be fined
[00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:47.270]  30,000 euro and two years in prison. Please pause. Read this. Share this. This is not something that
[00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.350]  the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about. There's no doubt that
[00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:57.510]  we knew that we would get cases here. There is no need to change anything that you're doing on a
[00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:05.430]  day-by-day basis. You do those things. Masks, no crowds, physical distance, personal hygiene. No
[00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.470]  doubt you're going to be able to turn these things around. When you're in the middle of an outbreak
[00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:18.070]  wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet
[00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:23.830]  but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. Make sure you wear
[00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:30.710]  a mask. So you wear a mask then you put a cloth mask over which actually is much better. Another
[00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:37.910]  coronavirus that obviously jumped from an animal species. We don't know exactly how that happened.
[00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:44.390]  We have not ruled out the possibility that there could have been a leak from the lab. Should we
[00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:49.910]  have any worries about walking by someone on the street who may be unvaccinated? Not at all. I would
[00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:55.510]  have no concern walking down the street past a person who's not been vaccinated and even a
[00:26:55.510 --> 00:27:02.230]  person who's been infected because the protection is really quite substantial. We do know that the
[00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:09.750]  science shows now that even people who are vaccinated and get a breakthrough infection
[00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:16.710]  can transmit. All of the things that I have spoken about consistently from the very beginning
[00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:23.030]  have been fundamentally based on science. So if you are trying to you know get at me
[00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.790]  as a public health official and a scientist you're really attacking not only Dr. Anthony
[00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:37.110]  Fauci you're attacking science. You have to be asleep not to see that. Remember this is about
[00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:42.470]  getting rid of open free societies where you go to college, where you can go on vacations,
[00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.110]  where you have a swimming pool, where you can go to the national parks. The globalists think there's
[00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:53.270]  too many people. They've made the decision decades ago and major symposiums that have even been on
[00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:59.430]  Ted TV to depopulate the planet. That's why Bill Joy in 1999 wrote the article Why the Future
[00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.430]  Doesn't Need Us and he said he went to a tech conference with all the top billionaires and
[00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:07.350]  they made the unofficial decision to carry out forced depopulation.
[00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.550]  And Bill Gates has publicly made those statements. So I'm going to get to that coming up in a little
[00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:19.670]  while even though we've harped on it and I've made films on it like Endgame. It's free online.
[00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.110]  You got to understand now they've gone from beta testing to the operational. So let me show you
[00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:30.390]  what the depopulation looks like. They already rationed health care in the UK where the average
[00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:36.310]  cancer surgery lasts a year and a half. With cancers that are not operated on within just a
[00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:43.190]  few months you have almost a hundred percent death rate. But don't hear it from me. Hear under the
[00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.310]  rationing of the last year and a half around the world where the hospitals were closed and wouldn't
[00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.750]  see people and now tens of millions have died of cancer, tens of millions have died of suicide,
[00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:58.710]  tens of millions that UN estimates 20 million extra starve to death in the third world,
[00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:05.350]  mainly Africa because there was no jobs. Everything got shut down. Killed dozens of
[00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:11.590]  times what COVID ever did because it's designed to depopulate. And I know you as regular viewers
[00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.590]  get this but that's why you've got to take this report and share it with friends and family or
[00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.950]  take the clips out that you think are most important and put them on Twitter and Facebook
[00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.710]  and Instagram and YouTube because if you don't the globalists are going to win.
[00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.470]  You got to show people this information. So let's play a clip from national television in England
[00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:34.950]  where a caller calls in and says doctors refused to see him for months and months and months and
[00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:40.070]  wouldn't even give him an antibiotic when he thought he had a skin rash and it turned out
[00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:45.270]  it was cancer and now they're saying well you're probably not going to live so we're not going to
[00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.990]  even give you treatment. That's what it's like to live under this system. I remember six seven
[00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:55.110]  years ago Paul Joseph Watson that does work for info wars.com had a cold for a few weeks was
[00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.110]  coughing up blood. Had a bacterial infection he later learned. You have to go to the national
[00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.630]  health service first. They have private clinics for the rich but you got to get permission to
[00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:10.070]  go to him and he's not rich. And he goes and they give him just a pack of aspirin, Tylenol,
[00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:17.750]  and some tissues. And he coughs up blood more and he's about to die. He goes to him
[00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.670]  and he finally gets permission to go to a private clinic pays him thousands of pounds
[00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:28.950]  thousands of dollars and they go yeah you got a bacterial infection here's here's antibiotics.
[00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:35.110]  Do you understand that's what we're going under. That's the system that they're setting up around
[00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:40.550]  the world now coming here. So here's the caller talking about what it's like to basically be
[00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:46.950]  soft-killed to be depopulated. Here it is. So I rang up the doctor for an appointment. I was
[00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:51.830]  categorically refused an appointment and told to take a photograph and send it in.
[00:30:52.710 --> 00:31:03.030]  I'm sorry but I get a bit emotional. I then took the photograph and sent it in and to my delight
[00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.990]  they rang me back a few hours later and said the doctor says you've got an infection we'll give
[00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:13.910]  you some antibiotics. I took the antibiotics obviously for over a week and several weeks
[00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:18.950]  later my wife said to me you need to ring the doctor again it's getting worse. So I rang the
[00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:25.510]  doctor again to be categorically told that the doctors wouldn't see me. I then said to them I've
[00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:32.870]  been double jabbed I'll wear a mask I'll even wear rubber gloves but I insist on seeing a doctor.
[00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:41.830]  Anyway they did see me this time and they referred me to have a biopsy done of which they told me it
[00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:50.790]  was cancerous and I was then referred to Leicester Royal Infirmary where I was told because of the
[00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:57.670]  delay it was not probable and I've got less than 12 months to live unless I have therapy. I'm now
[00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:03.990]  having therapy but I'm in terrible pain and it's just disgraceful. If the doctor had seen me back
[00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.710]  in February I'm sure they could have been able to operate and remove it. I've since shown that
[00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:14.790]  photograph to many many medical professionals and none of them can believe that I wasn't referred
[00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:21.830]  directly to dermatology to have it inspected. Did you catch that? He starts crying he says I took
[00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:29.190]  both the shots I wore the mask and he doesn't even put two and two together on the timeline
[00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:36.710]  that he got the cancer recently after he took the shot which again spike proteins of these viruses
[00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:43.270]  is what directly drives cancer in the body. When they did previous tests with SARS the same virus
[00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:50.550]  family on rats it gave them cancer not just blood clots and I had a lot of scientists and medical
[00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:59.270]  doctors on the show this week that went over that. Wow I'll tell you about that coming up but since
[00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:05.030]  I mentioned the children here's Boris Johnson on Friday turned out to be a horrible little
[00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:12.710]  globalist operative who says he openly gets orders from Bill Gates said that publicly here
[00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.270]  he is not caring what his national health service says not caring what his own scientists say that
[00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:23.910]  you shouldn't give this to children you shouldn't give people a third round of shots here he is
[00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:30.310]  calling for it. You're absolutely right that the the priorities now are the the older generation
[00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:35.990]  going into autumn and winter and we've always said that there'll be a booster program in
[00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:41.670]  in September in this month and what we're going to going ahead with that what I would what I
[00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:49.270]  would also say is 16 17 year olds are eligible the they've been approved they're a very important
[00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:56.790]  group for for potential transmission and I would urge everybody all 16 17 year olds everybody who
[00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.030]  knows 16 17 year old I mean the numbers are coming up very fast now it's very encouraging
[00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:08.310]  to see more and more 16 17 year olds taking the jab but we need to do to go faster with those and
[00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:15.590]  so get your jab if you're 16 17 and then finally yes we've done we've done 88 of everybody over
[00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:20.870]  16 in this country has had a jab I think 78 percent have had two jabs or some number like
[00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:27.990]  that it's huge huge success for the for the program but there are still some who need that
[00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:35.430]  protection and I just urge everybody to who hasn't yet had one go and get it now. In late August
[00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:42.630]  Infowars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are
[00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:48.710]  destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial
[00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:53.430]  collapse worldwide. Now ladies and gentlemen storable food has always been something that's
[00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:57.670]  important to have it's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with
[00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:03.670]  water filtration self-defense and a relationship with God but now more than ever you need to get
[00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:08.390]  your storable food orders in now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order
[00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:13.990]  it's high quality it's very very low cost at InfowarsStore.com because in the future you're
[00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:18.470]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.350]  that are already taking place so lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the
[00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:29.670]  InfoWar at InfowarsStore.com that's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and
[00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:35.910]  not under their control so get prepared now at InfowarsStore.com. By the way people send me
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:41.190]  stuff to my phone they send to my email and I also surf the web quite a bit my wife does as well
[00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:47.990]  and I saw a lot of comments on reddit and I saw a bunch on twitter saying Alex Jones has secretly
[00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:53.110]  taken the vaccine no proof you're a conspiracy theorist I would never take it you're insane
[00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:59.030]  you're crazy you're liars and something else they're saying is I'm lying the UK government
[00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:05.270]  hasn't come out and said don't give young people and children the shots so in your face here is the
[00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:15.510]  news. It's that the JCVI the joint committee on vaccination and immunization is not recommending
[00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:24.310]  covid vaccines for healthy children between the ages of 12 and 15. We know of course that the
[00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:30.710]  vaccine rollout the first doses have been expanded to children who are 16 years old
[00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.070]  but there was plenty of speculation about whether school-aged children were going to get that
[00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:40.230]  vaccine too and we know that there's been an open letter written today from parents unions scientists
[00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:46.150]  including scientists from the independent sage group urging younger children the government to
[00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:51.590]  look at vaccinating younger children so they can be better protected of course that is a big tranche
[00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:57.910]  of society children that are now back at school mixing so I think there have been many who had
[00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:03.430]  expected the rollout to be expanded to those younger age groups but we now have confirmation
[00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:09.670]  that the vaccine is not being recommended by the government's vaccine advisors for children aged
[00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:17.190]  between 12 and 15 but they do go on to say that the program is being extended from what they'd
[00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:25.190]  been considered most at-risk children to include children who also have chronic major heart
[00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:31.110]  illnesses lung kidney liver and neurological conditions so that means that about 200,000
[00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:38.150]  more children are going to be invited for vaccines but the breaking news this afternoon is that
[00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:43.910]  children aged between 12 and 15 years old are not being recommended by the government's vaccine
[00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:51.030]  advisors to receive the COVID-19 jab. Yes indeed Ali and we've got some words coming out now from
[00:37:51.030 --> 00:38:00.790]  the JCVI that says benefits are insufficient to support this mass vaccination for 12 to 15
[00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:07.030]  year olds but those with underlying health conditions will get it so certainly not across
[00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:12.550]  the board and as you say there's something of a surprise so it's critical to understand that
[00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:17.590]  earlier I showed you the Toronto Star and I showed you the BBC and I showed you all these headlines
[00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:21.670]  about record heart attacks in young people including teenagers that take the injections
[00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:29.110]  in Israel and teenagers that take the injections in Canada and how these numbers are getting more
[00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:35.830]  and more and more and more intense and now around the world Australia and France are announcing
[00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:41.510]  we're going to inject your children whether you like it or not I mean this is so dystopic even
[00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:46.470]  when their own regulators are saying don't do it this is a globalist revolution because they can
[00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:50.710]  get away with this they've conquered us ladies and gentlemen they've broken our will so here's
[00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:58.230]  a very important clip of Dr. Ryan Cole talking about scarring in the hearts of children with
[00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:04.550]  microscopic photos through a microscope of their hearts. Thank you for taking us into the details
[00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:08.710]  because it's super interesting to look at what's actually happening in the cells the idea of
[00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:14.550]  scarring on all these children we've heard the CDC say exactly that well there were mild cases
[00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:20.150]  of myocarditis and as you've said and other doctors have said there's no such thing you
[00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:25.350]  are creating scars that will never go away we have no idea what the long-term implications are of this
[00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.390]  most of these kids go into hospitals a lot of them athletes that can't compete in sports now
[00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:36.550]  they're on heart medications for a group by the way of individuals that aren't really even at risk
[00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:43.110]  for this illness incredibly high success rate of you know and and really super low even symptomatic
[00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:49.990]  conditions I hope that we can have you on again there's so much to talk about especially since
[00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.550]  you're you're deep in the middle of it but I want to thank you for being brave I want to thank you
[00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.990]  for standing up for science because that's what I really think is is under attack here real science
[00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:04.630]  is under attack we've lost as you said the principle of science should be more like the
[00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:10.150]  French legal system it is guilty and to proven innocent especially when it's being tested there
[00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:15.270]  should have been the number one conversation FDA not the safety trials done by Pfizer that's trying
[00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:20.230]  to put a bow on their products going to make them tens of billions of dollars this is all incredible
[00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:25.830]  information and I think it's important to put it all together in one place as an archive day by day
[00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:29.910]  as things unfold so we can chronicle the criminal activity of the globalists so they'll be held
[00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:35.510]  accountable at Nuremberg too which we must have it's either us or them ladies and gentlemen
[00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:41.750]  as the CFR said this is a world that gets more dystopic more nightmare by design until we're all
[00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:47.110]  dead and the globalists inherit the earth and I pledge everything I've got my name my blood my
[00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:52.950]  sweat my immortal soul against these people and I hope you'll join me as well so let's go ahead and
[00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:58.470]  go to a Tucker Carlson clip he makes a great point illegal aliens can come to this country
[00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:04.870]  and they can have fake IDs they can come here illegally they can vote in all the different
[00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:10.790]  democrat jurisdictions illegally but if you get caught as a healthcare worker particularly
[00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.510]  with a fake vaccine card so you can keep your job oh by the way the illegal aliens come in here don't
[00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:21.670]  have to take shots the Afghans don't have to just our military does then you get charged with a
[00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:27.750]  felony when it's not a law that you've got to do this in fact the FBI is trying to claim this
[00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:32.950]  is fraud everything the government's done is a fraud the PCR test is a fraud these injections
[00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:37.590]  don't protect you and lower your immune system make you sick they're a fraud so it's like saying
[00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:43.990]  Jews having secret papers in Nazi Germany or Russians having secret papers or fake papers
[00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:50.069]  to be able to get around in in Soviet Russia we're bad no these aren't bad people these are
[00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:55.670]  folks that are really who are healthcare workers who have seen people get sick who've seen people
[00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:01.750]  get very very ill and die like the nurse talked about earlier who's out there marching and have
[00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:06.630]  seen the all the hysterectomies and all the cancer and they admit these vaccines quote trigger cancer
[00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:13.750]  but say in the New York Times it's no big deal this is just an exercise in madness an exercise
[00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:18.150]  in killing us if the global has showed up with tanks and airplanes and machine guns we'd fight
[00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:23.110]  them but they do it through the medical system and through censorship and through control so
[00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:27.510]  here's Tucker Carlson so with that in mind it was interesting to see this week's big announcement
[00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:33.590]  from the district attorney of New York City Cyrus Vance Vance has just charged 13 Americans with
[00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:38.790]  felonies for buying fake vaccination cards several of the suspects according to prosecutors
[00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.710]  were healthcare workers who've been told by the state they'll be fired unless they get the shot
[00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:47.670]  so politicians telling doctors and nurses what medicine to take that's exactly what
[00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:51.830]  they told us they were against for decades again these are healthcare workers they know the science
[00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:58.390]  of covid far better than politicians governors prosecutors so in good conscience they've risked
[00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:03.590]  their careers to preserve their right to bodily autonomy and now they're in jail for that now
[00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:09.670]  these arrests will be used to justify digital health passports for the entire American population
[00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:16.230]  that is true save this tape in fact Cyrus Vance has already enlisted big tech to help root out
[00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:21.270]  the disobedient in New York quote we need companies like Facebook to take action to
[00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:26.950]  prevent the fraud happening on their platform Vance said making selling and purchasing forged
[00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:33.350]  vaccination cards are serious crimes with serious public safety consequences end quote except that's
[00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:40.710]  a lie buying a fake vaccination card is not a quote serious crime it's not even close to a
[00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:47.910]  serious crime buying a fake vaccination card is an act of desperation by decent law abiding
[00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:55.190]  Americans who have been forced into a corner by tyrants you know it's a serious crime forcing
[00:43:55.190 --> 00:44:01.270]  Americans to take drugs they don't need or want that's a very serious crime and let's hope in the
[00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:07.110]  end someone is punished for it severely and I want to be clear those of you watching this live
[00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:12.310]  or those of you watching this archived at man dot video you're doing a great job many of these
[00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:16.550]  reports are getting two or three million views it's changing the world we can beat the globalist
[00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:20.630]  they wouldn't be censoring if this information wasn't having an effect on them so please
[00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:26.550]  take this report share it on your email your text message by word of mouth take clips out
[00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:31.510]  of it repost on your twitter your facebook your instagram your youtube and try different things
[00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.870]  leave my name out of the headline or say look at this evil conspiracy theorist and then the AI bots
[00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:42.150]  don't see it and it gets through and millions of other people see it not just folks at man dot video
[00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.630]  but you can reach out to your neighbors your friends your family perfect strangers and say
[00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:51.430]  listen you're being lied to this is a global corporate takeover they don't want to pay out
[00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:56.790]  your social security worldwide they want to kill off the baby boomers and they've psychologically
[00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:02.950]  studied this and prepared this as their takeover but if people become aware of it we can stop this
[00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:08.390]  dystopia it's the only future we have i predicted all this a decade ago i predicted it all two years
[00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:13.830]  ago a year ago i said what's going to be happening now word for word how did i know it's a globalist
[00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:18.870]  program it's a globalist operation now here's governor desantis who i think is a good guy
[00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:23.190]  overall who's playing both sides of the field though and he's saying you know i got the vaccine
[00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.790]  and all the rest of it but you know if you don't want to get it that's fine that's your right and
[00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:30.150]  we shouldn't have vaccine passports great he should just come out against it because it's
[00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:35.910]  not a vaccine but here he is in two clips from a press conference really laying out the facts
[00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:42.230]  and the reality of how they're trying to suppress treatments that are basically a hundred percent
[00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:48.550]  if they catch you early like regeneron i don't own any stock in regeneron i'm not involved with
[00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:53.350]  regeneron it's been around since the late 80s it's got a bunch of patents they have liability
[00:45:53.350 --> 00:46:00.230]  they don't have liability protection they're the most profitable big pharma company in the world
[00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.550]  because they've got a lot of great products for their size they're the most profitable
[00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:09.110]  they're not selling oxycontin they're not selling you poison vaccines they don't have liability
[00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:13.590]  protection i like that and i've got friends and family that were seriously sick and within just
[00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:18.870]  a few hours five to six hours including joe rogan they felt almost completely better so they're
[00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:24.310]  trying to suppress regeneron and then after we play these clips i'm going to come back and get
[00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:29.350]  into the war on ivermectin and why that's so important in the latest developments
[00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:36.710]  effectively to them i would say vaccine passports uh one i'm vaccinated i'm offended that someone
[00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:41.910]  would make me show something just to go to a restaurant or just to live life and there's a
[00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:48.069]  lot of people who've already recovered from covid who do have immunity you actually are saying me
[00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:52.950]  with a johnson and johnson shot can go in but someone who's recovered from covid and probably
[00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:59.350]  a stronger immunity they can't go in i'm sorry that is anti-science i also don't want two classes
[00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:05.110]  of citizens you know we have some people in our in our communities who just made the decision
[00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:09.190]  this is something that they're not going to do so what you're going to do right amount of society
[00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.950]  they're not going to be able to go show their face and some of these places that have vaccine
[00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.750]  passports because the little kiddies aren't eligible for vaccine some of them are saying
[00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:25.190]  if you're under 12 don't even come in and it's also the case that as much as i uh am happy to
[00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:30.550]  see vaccinated people get good protection against hospitalization and death and it has been good
[00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:35.029]  the fact is it is spreading regardless of vaccination i mean that's just the reality
[00:47:35.029 --> 00:47:40.710]  the theory behind a vaccine passport is okay if you force everyone to be able to have it in order
[00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:46.230]  to kind of live in society then you'll be able to basically just new coke new covid we know that
[00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.950]  that's not the case you know very very high vaccination rates you still have big waves
[00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:57.430]  so it just doesn't make any sense and my view is we got to protect people's ability uh to to live
[00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:04.550]  their lives i don't want a biomedical security state in which are constantly having to do this
[00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:11.750]  just to be able to live everyday life at the end of the day the vaccines have helped people ward
[00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:17.029]  off severe illness and you know we obviously work very hard to distribute it at the end of the day
[00:48:17.029 --> 00:48:22.630]  though it is what somebody it's about your health and whether you want that protection or not it
[00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:28.710]  really doesn't impact me or anyone else because we've seen the data on this and so the theory
[00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:34.150]  behind it i think has gone totally up in smoke and i also just think that there's been huge mistakes
[00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:41.110]  made along the way with some of these authorities lecturing people about this i can tell you there's
[00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:47.190]  a lot of folks that when they hear that if they're on the fence that pushes them in the other direction
[00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:53.590]  that is not the way that you do it you know what i try to do is just give the data i give it honestly
[00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:58.950]  i'm not going to sugarcoat it and i'm not going to tell somebody something that that is not true
[00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:03.190]  based on the data just because i want them to behave in a certain way a lot of these folks they
[00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:07.750]  tell these noble lies because they want you to behave in a certain way and so they don't give
[00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.990]  the whole truth i mean you look at the fact that we're even having to do this with this early
[00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:17.110]  treatment that that should not have did we should i mean we're happy to do because we want to help
[00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:23.190]  but this should have been something that was screened from the rooftops from hhs and cdc since
[00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:29.750]  last december can you imagine if 100 of americans knew that this was something that was available
[00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.270]  you know how many people we would have kept that in the hospital you know how many people
[00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:39.029]  that would not have died over the last nine months that's just a fact and um we're obviously
[00:49:39.029 --> 00:49:42.790]  correcting that in florida and we're actually helping other states too because we've put a lot
[00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:48.790]  of emphasis on it but you know i look at that and i wonder why if you have a an effective treatment
[00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:52.550]  i mean this this treatment was used on an experimental basis to the president of the
[00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:59.270]  united states in october and very effectively uh why would you not be talking about it and i think
[00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:03.590]  one of the reasons that people didn't some didn't think that they should talk about it is because
[00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:09.270]  they didn't want people to think okay maybe you don't need to get vaccinated maybe you just get
[00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:14.069]  the treatment and they worried that people would would take that message in my view is is you know
[00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:19.910]  we've never said it's either or we think that they complement each other but if someone does do that
[00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:24.710]  that's not a reason to not give them the full information that's not a reason to provide this
[00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:29.670]  you know for everybody so you know i think some of the stuff with the vaccine passports i mean
[00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:36.870]  it's an overreach to be it's too intrusive and at the end of the day my philosophy is as governor
[00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:43.110]  my job is to protect your individual freedom my job is not to protect corporate freedom that is
[00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:47.510]  not what i'm here for i mean we have a good business climate we have everything but this
[00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:52.790]  idea that businesses can just do whatever they want and invade your privacy and doing all that
[00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:58.230]  no i'm not signing up for that now i'm going to get to this huge ivermectin story or group of
[00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:04.310]  stories in a moment but first let's play the wildly unpopular admitted communist mayor
[00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:14.069]  of new york city de blasio engaged in the most creepy cringe-worthy garbage i've ever seen
[00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.029]  first he offered free ice creams and hamburgers if you take the experimental shot
[00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:23.510]  that's been known to cause cancer and lower your immune system and doesn't protect you
[00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:30.710]  but now he's gone to the next level sell out your health and your whole future to the bullies who
[00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.670]  say you can't go to a football game or can't go to a movie unless you have a pass that's digital
[00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:43.350]  and take big pharma's liability protected shot in your body and you get a comic book on top of it
[00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.590]  maybe they can even bury you with the comic book
[00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:55.910]  oh oh i'm sorry i got i got so caught up in this marvel comic book i i just didn't realize the
[00:51:55.910 --> 00:52:05.029]  press conference had begun i've this is amazing it's limited edition it's uh exclusive it's
[00:52:05.029 --> 00:52:11.830]  really special it's amazing but you can't just get it anywhere you can only get it at a vaccination
[00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:18.550]  site a sumos vaccination site this is where we're going to help make kids safe and like the avengers
[00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:25.670]  fight back against evil in this case evil is covet i think you figured that out so here is a
[00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:31.029]  great example of an effort to reach our young people with something they care about a lot
[00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:38.550]  reach our families get people safe get people vaccinated here's one great example but tomorrow
[00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:47.750]  another great example the official nba 2k tournament begins at 11 a.m grand prize xbox
[00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:54.870]  series x man that guy is the most disingenuous fake evil looking person i've seen other than
[00:52:54.870 --> 00:53:00.630]  brian stelter i mean i'm not saying mayor de blasio is a pedophile i'm just saying if i was
[00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:06.069]  going to catch somebody in a hollywood movie to play the part of a guy that drives around an ice
[00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:09.910]  cream truck kidnapping children and eating them it would be him but instead he's just
[00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:17.830]  eating our freedoms and destroying our souls now let's get to some of the biggest fake news
[00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:24.950]  by the corporate media i've ever seen a good friend of mine who sent me the story had this to
[00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:33.270]  say he said we are seeing the implosion of mainstream media in real time he went on to say
[00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.270]  imagine being someone
[00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:43.750]  who believes this because with an image search in minutes i could find that the image they
[00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:49.830]  used was not from there and with a few phone calls and a few searches i was easily able
[00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:56.710]  to discover that the state north of me oklahoma does not have long lines of ambulances that can't
[00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:04.069]  get into the hospital because there's long lines of people sick and dying from ivermectin
[00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:13.190]  it's as big a lie as fauci a few months ago saying 99 of deaths in the hospitals aren't vaccinated
[00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:21.990]  we went and looked it up he was using numbers from 2020 before the vaccine was even out so of
[00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:30.150]  course all the deaths were from the unvaccinated i mean think about that so here's rolling stone
[00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:36.150]  i tracked it back to the local tv station it's a fake story and heads up we're sending reporters
[00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:46.310]  up there gunshot victims left waiting as horse dewormer overdoses overwhelm oklahoma doctor says
[00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.350]  and they quote this doctor on a local station
[00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:57.110]  and said oh my god there's long lines the people with the dewormer thought the ambulances can't
[00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:02.790]  get in i'm tempted to get in my car right now because they list the hospitals and they've got
[00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:06.950]  the newscast but they don't show any of this other than file footage of other places remember
[00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:14.230]  all the file footage last year of dummies in the hospitals with uh ventilators down their
[00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:18.950]  throats because the hospitals were empty then and they were lying then and doing all their tiktok
[00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:24.390]  videos the statistics came out they were counting gunshot wounds car rexes covid now it's real from
[00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:29.510]  the vaccinated dying and shedding the live viruses just like the majority of polio cases
[00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:35.190]  today are from the vaccinated shedding it's a live virus as well these are facts and they're
[00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:40.310]  blaming us that haven't taken their shots for what's happening when it's them getting us sick but
[00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:49.670]  i digress here it is gunshot victims left waiting as horse dewormer overdoses overwhelmed
[00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:59.670]  oklahoma hospitals says doctor well guess what because it is stronger my family and i actually
[00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:04.950]  did take the horse dewormer at the pound per pound it'll be for a horse i used to work for
[00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:10.790]  animal vet for two years back in high school my dad's a physician and it worked amazingly even
[00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:14.790]  better than getting the human ivermectin which is the same molecule i know the liberals and people
[00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:19.110]  you don't know what molecules mean and things like that but just it means it's like horses
[00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:24.870]  drink water we drink water and you know horses can eat alfalfa we can eat alfalfa or horses can eat
[00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:29.350]  wheat we can eat wheat horses breathe oxygen like what are you doing breathing oxygen that's what
[00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:37.110]  horses breathe so this story is fake and is garbage but let me show you just scientific
[00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:44.870]  information instead of just debating their garbage wow cdc gives incoming refugees nobel prize winning
[00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:51.190]  ivermectin from all over the world it won the nobel prize and if you go to the cdc's own website
[00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:56.550]  of the fda that on the front page they don't take ivermectin and you type in ivermectin studies
[00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:03.270]  there's dozens of them from oxford england and uh berlin germany and tokyo japan about it working
[00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:10.230]  on sars the first one which is the same virus zika everything else it's an incredible antiviral
[00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:16.550]  why do you think dr zelenko up in new york who has 30 000 patients treated that many successfully
[00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:24.310]  nobody died was able to then just go oh let's try this or quercetin or hydroxychloroquine it
[00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:29.110]  pushes zinc into the cell so the virus can't replicate it there's a big tweet out on this
[00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:35.750]  that links to the nias the federal government glenn greenwald linked to it 44 peer-reviewed
[00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:45.030]  ivermectin studies 39 positive for its use against viruses so 39 positive out of five that are
[00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:52.950]  negative so there you go but their answer is oh the gunshot wounds it says ambulances are backed up
[00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:59.510]  they can't even get in because there's so many people that are deathly ill this is gaslighting
[00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:04.310]  this is fake news and this is a sign of a desperate collapsing corporate media that
[00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:08.470]  was already losing the world globalism was in trouble the big mega banks are far worse than
[00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:12.950]  burning made off with their ponzi schemes and so now they want to bring in a permanent martial law
[00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:17.830]  hysterical dystopia where they block regular treatments for viruses where they don't give
[00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:23.110]  you medical care where they let you die the whole time posing as your saviors now let's start
[00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:28.870]  getting into what's unfolding in real time and what the facts are the white house has come out
[00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:34.390]  and the same thing's happening all the world and said let's get 65 billion dollars to big pharma
[00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:40.470]  and to contact tracers and make all the major new jobs millions of people in the u.s be covet
[00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:46.710]  enforcers and spies they say remake all of america and they're saying the same thing in canada same
[00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:52.710]  thing in europe same thing in australia that just a whole new economy is covet and other viruses and
[00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:57.670]  we just can't let one person have the flu or one person have this other thing even though the
[00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:04.390]  vaccines aren't vaccines and are causing the shedding white house wants 65 billion for apollo
[00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:11.910]  style pandemic preparedness program but instead of going to the moon they take over your body they
[00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:17.270]  take over the hospitals and the contact tracers come to your house we're going to get to what's
[00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:25.190]  unfolding in australia and where this world id system is going right now now everyone is continually
[00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:33.910]  asking me over and over and over again alex you must work for the cia i mean how do you know
[00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:40.550]  everything before it happens number one the cia are a bunch of liars they're told what to say by
[00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:44.790]  the globalists most of them are compartmentalized and know nothing please don't insult me saying i
[00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:52.470]  work for the cia i work for myself and my family and you doing open source research do you understand
[00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:56.070]  that i'm going to show you the globalists saying they want to kill you and that they're going to
[00:59:56.070 --> 01:00:00.790]  use the fear of covet to bring in a total collapse of civilization i'm going to show you all their
[01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:08.710]  documents in a moment this is public claus schwab five years ago wrote a book and went on national
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:13.910]  french television and national german television and said we're ending the world as we know we're
[01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:19.190]  getting rid of prosperity it's bad for the earth you're going to have a global medical id that
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:25.350]  then has a connection to a medical taxing system and a carbon taxing calorie credit where you get
[01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:31.270]  so many calories of carbon a day and they decide how much meat you get if you can have a car where
[01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:37.270]  you can go now this has now been announced officially in europe and australia and canada
[01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:41.830]  trudeau announced earlier in the week on monday uh that this is really about climate we're gonna
[01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:48.710]  have climate lockdowns london guardian it's it's so so again that's how i know because it was in
[01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:54.550]  the rockefeller documents and in plantopolis documentaries and in stuff they put out 20
[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:59.190]  years ago and 10 years ago and i showed all that on friday's show so you want to go watch the
[01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:05.030]  archive of the shows in the first hour i show you all those documents but australia is a year or
[01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:09.830]  two ahead of us so they're already under endless lockdown they already have to have a phone to
[01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.430]  leave their house with an app five years in prison if you don't have it you've got to call the cops
[01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:17.910]  when they randomly ping you and show them where you are even though the phone's tracking you you
[01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:23.350]  get to go outside one hour a day if you are injected so just total dog training total
[01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:29.830]  enslavement cdc so here's america we're a year behind cdc unvaccinated should not travel over
[01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:34.790]  labor day weekend and that's getting you ready for when you have the app which they're they're
[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:39.750]  rolling out saying sorry you can't fly at certain times when you're not vaccinated so they're just
[01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:44.310]  introducing the idea to you they were announcing that a year ago in australia the exact headlines
[01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:48.550]  look it up australian government says i'm vaccinated may not be able to fly or should not fly

[01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:19.910]  course on returning to the uk but illegal migrants aren't and they've got a quarantine
[01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:25.030]  but the illegal aliens don't because that might dissuade them from coming over 80 percent of
[01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:29.670]  culprits responsible for looting at the german floods were foreign migrants total invasion
[01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:35.910]  california nurse shortage reaches crisis level as vaccine mandate wards off traveling nurses
[01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:40.070]  making the whole health system collapse it's not the nurse's fault they're smart they see
[01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:43.830]  what the scots are doing they were normal shots weren't causing as many problems they would go
[01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:48.950]  with them but again and then that causes again the breakdown of society which the globalists
[01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.870]  want a post-industrial world remember they're trying to wreck stuff they're not trying to like
[01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:56.310]  build a big infrastructure then they run it they want to use infrastructure to kill us
[01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:03.030]  it's in the game protests are storming uk drug retailers office over planned covid jab for
[01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:09.190]  children this is people understanding that how nazi this is and realizing this is life and death

[01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:47.350]  safe you dumbasses god almighty find your soul find your common sense again speaking of that
[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:52.790]  find your soul so many leftists are pissed that you can't kill a baby after six weeks in texas
[01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.990]  they got all these rationales all these excuses but it's about killing children it's about a death
[01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:02.950]  cult it's about their body parts well in massachusetts and in new york and in other
[01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:07.110]  states they keep babies alive after they're born so they can wait till they get the orders in
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:11.270]  sometimes several weeks before harvesting their organs this is out of the blaze massachusetts
[01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:16.950]  democrat ag rejects petition to protect infants born alive calling it highly ambiguous and
[01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:22.390]  impossible for voters to understand oh we're gonna keep babies alive and do whatever we want
[01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:26.630]  with them and then kill them because you're too stupid to understand it other huge news on the
[01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:32.150]  covid front and and people say to me hey this is actually broke six months ago well what's
[01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:39.750]  old is new plus there's new news on it remember the october document uh that came out in july
[01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:46.630]  wow that's really old news it actually broke months before that well it's it's new because
[01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:52.390]  it's now happened the cdc's own documents in october before anybody took these shots
[01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:59.910]  predicted heart attacks strokes blood clots narcolepsy epilepsy it's all right here
[01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:05.910]  go look it up for yourself and then share it because they knew beforehand so it's one thing
[01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:10.790]  to report this that they knew it was going to happen but now it's actually happened
[01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:17.750]  and here is the document not just from some press conference that they were having where
[01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:24.870]  they accidentally flashed this document on screen it's on the cdc website where it lists all these
[01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:29.750]  horrible things it can do to you takes 30 minutes to read it i suggest you go read all the horrible
[01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:39.910]  things it can do to you give you cancer death you name it absolutely incredibly important information
[01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:45.830]  the globalists treat you like your animals you're not animals the biggest problem the general
[01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:50.150]  public is they have a short attention span that's been programmed into them and they kind
[01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:56.230]  of just take the world like it's an amusement park that they actually don't really change
[01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:03.990]  they just respond to the stimuli and basically go along with being pre-programmed you have to
[01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:08.710]  decide to be conscious you have to decide to be engaged you have to understand that the one thing
[01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:13.830]  that separates humans from the animal kingdom is that we're able to control our environment
[01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:18.150]  that we're on a quest to control our environment and to control our own bodies
[01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:23.990]  and you can see what the globalists are doing as an extension of humans trying to control their
[01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:30.630]  own evolution but if you don't bring the public in on that and if it's authoritarian and trying
[01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:36.710]  to kill off the general public then it's nazi-based eugenics and here's a definition
[01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:44.550]  directed evolution when applied to people is eugenics but this isn't eugenics to make humans
[01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:49.990]  better that's sold in general oh we're environmentalist humans have been bad we got
[01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:56.950]  to be better when you get into the real treatises and the real white papers of john p holdren and
[01:07:56.950 --> 01:08:01.590]  paul erlich and others and the books they've written that i've read that are by the way free
[01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:09.190]  online like eco science the population bomb and others they talk about how they need to take out
[01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:14.070]  the human population because of limited resources and then they started to teach a religion that
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:19.350]  humans are bad and need to die so that even their own acolytes would hate themselves and
[01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:23.830]  go along with this plan but believe me the globalists don't intend to get rid of themselves
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:30.070]  so this is the ultimate psyop i already showed you the council on foreign relations earlier saying
[01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:34.389]  this is really all about carbon taxes the environment we're teaching you to be locked down
[01:08:34.389 --> 01:08:38.550]  and to have less because you're hurting the earth and fossil fuels are killing the planet
[01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:42.070]  even though they're not and even though these guys are suppressing clean energies
[01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:47.590]  that are out there i show this a lot because it's a really evil story but i've seen hundreds like
[01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:53.110]  this just in the last year wall street journal looking forward to the end of humanity it says
[01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:58.150]  covet 19 has shown we're broken and failed they're telling us our immune systems don't work which
[01:08:58.150 --> 01:09:04.070]  they do it's all lies and that humans are a bad species that should be gotten rid of so that the
[01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:10.470]  earth can take back over and that other species have a chance to live and thrive go read it for
[01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:16.470]  yourself similar articles at nbc news everywhere else and here's one from thursday pennsylvania
[01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:22.950]  professor teaches white people committing suicide can be an ethical act so they tell whites you're
[01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:27.670]  evil you're inherently bad like nazi saying black people are inherently bad it's a load of crap
[01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:32.150]  martin luther king jr is right he judged people according to character of the individuals but
[01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:38.950]  here are the professors with oh whites are bad we can exclude them from the gym or from the dorm
[01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:43.030]  or we can charge them more because they're inherently bad because of what color they are
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:50.630]  introducing this tribalist racism at the most base level by the corporations this is the elite doing
[01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:56.230]  this with the average leftist on the universities posing and pretending like they're these enlightened
[01:09:56.230 --> 01:10:03.190]  good people when they're at war with classical liberalism a professor employed by catholic
[01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:08.230]  university pennsylvania said on camera there are merits to the claim that it's ethical for white
[01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:13.510]  people to commit suicide white people should commit suicide as an ethical act said a quote in
[01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:22.309]  a slide for a presentation hosted by the university psychology professor derrick hook okay where does
[01:10:22.309 --> 01:10:28.790]  he get these ideas well paul erlich is the big globalist guru saying this since the 60s and
[01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:35.830]  here's one of his acolytes who heads up the global voluntary extinction movement that the new york
[01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:41.430]  times the wall street journal london guardian have all endorsed and said yes we should get rid
[01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:47.430]  of all humans so the the editorial boards say humans are bad looking forward to an end of
[01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:52.230]  humanity i'm at the grocery store i see books like world without humans how great it'll be
[01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:59.590]  big color books they show little kids videos of you know water shipped down with the bulldozers
[01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:05.430]  killing the bunnies and the kids cry and hate the humans that's all this is but it's not so we can
[01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:10.150]  create a utopia without humans which is insane it's so the globalists can exterminate us and
[01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:19.030]  have us love it the voluntary extinction movement why don't you go read about last night and the
[01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:25.750]  organizations out there like extinction rebellion that wants to shut down the western world that'll
[01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:31.910]  then starve the third world to death we have a pretty good idea of when humans will go extinct
[01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:37.670]  the washington post humans it's all over give up and of course you heard aoc and you've heard
[01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:43.670]  hillary and you've heard obama and and and all of them saying you can't have an air conditioner
[01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:51.590]  you can't have a car the sea is going to rise by 2017 but by 2015 obama already had a giant mansion
[01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:58.630]  at one foot above sea level in martha's vineyard it's all a lie climate activist calls for
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:05.110]  extinction of the human race i wish i'd never been born the rise of the anti-natalist
[01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:14.150]  and it goes on and on and on climate activists call for the end of humans designer baby revolution
[01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:21.750]  can we outlaw sexual reproduction this is all mainstream news and who are these people thousands
[01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:28.070]  of studies on the left the left is the jacobins the left is the french revolution the left is a
[01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:33.510]  satanic movement from their roots look up the jacobins and what does it say about the left
[01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.590]  and what does it say about the left not classical liberals that want freedom and openness and
[01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:41.430]  goodness no they took that over they're the authoritarians they're the fascists they're
[01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:46.710]  the malfusians that want depopulation look up sir thomas malfus none of what i'm telling you is my
[01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:53.030]  opinion pew study white liberals disproportionately suffer from mental illness depending on the study
[01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:57.990]  five six seven eight nine times more likely to be mentally ill to commit suicide to steal
[01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:02.470]  to lie to lie about being nice to lie about charity to lie about other good people
[01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:09.830]  and to want to control you but do no work here's another one white liberals weren't likely to have
[01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:17.510]  a mental health condition white liberals twice as likely to be diagnosed with psychological
[01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:23.510]  problems this is mainline news white libs weren't likely to have mental health problems because they
[01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:28.389]  believe they're the ruling class they believe they're in control they're trying to project guilt
[01:13:28.389 --> 01:13:33.190]  on everyone because they're not connected they're they're they're screwed up and that's
[01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:39.190]  why they're projecting their hatred of themselves onto other white people and others they're
[01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:44.230]  chameleons but in our world chameleons aren't what survives people that are out in the open
[01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:49.510]  that are known quantities that are like a rock with a lighthouse on it that's what you want to be
[01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:56.710]  not a jellyfish that's doing all these different things okay we're going to take a short break
[01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:01.270]  and i'm going to come back with the final conclusion of this emergency
[01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:17.030]  saturday transmission on what their plans are and how we can stop them stay with us
[01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:35.030]  so
[01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:43.830]  the fortune 100 have established the devos group to be the public arm of the bilderberg group
[01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:49.910]  claus Schwab formally headed up the bilderberg group and their goal is to establish a corporate
[01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:56.389]  world government and then turn off the resources to create a post-industrial world that triggers
[01:14:56.389 --> 01:15:03.670]  a planetary population collapse and out of that collapse out of that global crisis they openly say
[01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:09.110]  that they will use that to bring in a worldwide authoritarian model now that's in the rockefeller
[01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:15.030]  plan operation lockstep but it's in many other plans of the globalist and that is what they
[01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:20.950]  are initiating right now so i have a two-pronged approach personally i'm trying to inform the
[01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:26.550]  public inform leaders around the world about what's going on so we can oppose the great reset
[01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:31.990]  post-industrial operation that would be the best way to stop it would be to actually shut the program
[01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:40.389]  down itself or and this is plan b and i'm doing this simultaneously getting prepared myself for
[01:15:40.389 --> 01:15:46.470]  the type of long global depression we're going to be living under for decades if not forever if we
[01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:51.750]  don't turn this around you see in north korea they can supply their people with food and jobs
[01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:55.830]  but they don't they keep them starving for control same thing's done in venezuela same
[01:15:55.830 --> 01:16:02.950]  thing's done in cuba this is a system of feudalism communism is nothing but a modern version of
[01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:09.030]  feudalism where you trade out the lords and the kings for the politburo and the inner party of
[01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:14.470]  the communist party so when you see the handover of afghanistan by design to be a fiasco when you
[01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:18.790]  see china being allowed to take over the world stage and threaten to invade taiwan when you see
[01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:25.030]  the un organizing hundreds of millions of people who they've already impoverished with the global
[01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:32.630]  lockdowns to now invade our countries this is part of a larger globalist strategic plan that i made
[01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:38.790]  a film about 14 years ago titled endgame blueprint for global enslavement so whether you like it or
[01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:45.430]  not whether i like it or not we live in the new world order system today we live on a planet with
[01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:51.350]  an out of control globalist elite who are openly trying to impoverish us and down us down so we
[01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:58.150]  can't resist when they finally kill us so the answer is get prepared and get ready and one of
[01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:03.190]  the most basic things you can do is spread the word about this broadcast and resist the globalist
[01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:09.830]  program of domination and enslavement and you can also personally get ready yourself with
[01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:14.070]  high quality storeable foods we have the best company out there in the united states they're
[01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:19.110]  ready to ship to you they have very high quality at very very low cost because they are the biggest
[01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:23.910]  company in the united states they've been a sponsor of ours for almost 14 years the company's
[01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:29.750]  only 15 years old but they become the dominant company because again they have high quality food
[01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:34.230]  at a low price so i want to encourage all the viewers and all the listeners now to support the
[01:17:34.230 --> 01:17:38.389]  broadcast to fund our operation and get high quality storeable food at the same time i noticed
[01:17:38.389 --> 01:17:43.750]  in late august we saw orders explode without us even really promoting it and now in early september
[01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:49.430]  i expect those orders only go up because people understand that the world is being destabilized
[01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:55.590]  by design so three month supplies month supplies six month supplies six month supplies specialty
[01:17:55.590 --> 01:18:01.430]  supplies whatever special diets you've got you name it info war store dot com has the full
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:07.110]  catalog ready to ship to you right now so get ready while you still can now i'm about to lay out
[01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:14.070]  where the globalists want to take us and and describe the future of their planning
[01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:21.830]  and i'm going to tell you how i knew all this stuff 28 years ago when i first got on air and how
[01:18:22.389 --> 01:18:29.350]  i can in live time lay this out before they announce it years months weeks and days before
[01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:36.070]  and it isn't about bragging about alex jones i want you to learn this information this psychological
[01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:43.910]  cultural technology of of real politic and of real science so that we can defeat these people
[01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:48.389]  they don't want you knowing about this they want you look at the world one-dimensional
[01:18:48.389 --> 01:18:51.030]  two-dimensional maybe third certainly not fourth or fifth
[01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:57.990]  and when i try to get into this area it's so expansive it's it's it's it's hard to cover
[01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:02.070]  it because it's so big and i was just talking to the camera guy who's up here working with
[01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:06.870]  me on saturday and i said have you heard me talk about this report and i read in the headline i
[01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:13.590]  said yeah many times we have an archivist i'm going to see if he can find this because this
[01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:19.350]  is going to blow people away this week so i'm going to ask all of you we don't have the clips
[01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:24.950]  where i've said this probably 50 times this year and probably 100 times last year and probably 100
[01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:32.550]  times a year before that i've been saying this for 27 28 years on air and you're going to ask
[01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:37.350]  how did i do this well i'm going to tell you how i know everything i'm going to tell you right now
[01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:42.470]  and i certainly hope you will then find out what their plans are for you here in just a moment
[01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.350]  here's the headline out of the london independent
[01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:55.350]  microsoft patents shows plans to revive dead loved ones
[01:19:57.030 --> 01:20:01.750]  did you hear that microsoft patent shows plan to revive dead loved ones
[01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:08.070]  that they own as chatbots now when the archivist finds this because i had a couple months ago i
[01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:14.150]  did a whole 10 minute rant on it i think it was during the first hour we're going to play it i
[01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:18.150]  guess we can take this clip put it on front but today we don't have it many of you probably saw it
[01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:27.510]  that i didn't get from a globalist document that i got from another place i'll tell you in a moment
[01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:33.110]  but do you understand what this means they say that when you opt in to use any google facebook
[01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:39.190]  twitter microsoft they're all sharing data your voice print what you do where you go what you say
[01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:47.990]  your emotions all of it can later be put into a digital avatar a a physical flesh body that's
[01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:53.270]  programmed is their plan a metal avatar that's programmed to be a metal avatar
[01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:59.510]  that's programmed is their plan a metal avatar a plastic avatar a silicon avatar
[01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:08.389]  or it can be a hologram avatar and that they're saying we don't just own your genetics when you
[01:21:08.389 --> 01:21:11.750]  go in the hospital and they take a little extra blood and put it in the database hospitals have
[01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:18.630]  been caught doing that we own your voice we own your words we own what you said and then we'll
[01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:24.790]  use your likeness to then add things and basically steal your identity forever so they're going to
[01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:31.830]  take your work and then claim because here's the key that it's immortal and claim that they've
[01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:37.030]  actually captured the soul they don't say that here yet but that's the real plan is to download
[01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:42.790]  so much of you and have you when your physical body's about to die upload to this and i predicted
[01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:46.630]  this they'll say oh the transference kills you though because they don't want the body around
[01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:53.910]  anymore to say hey that's not me and then just like corporations since the uh 1820s or whatever
[01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:59.910]  have been people and live forever they're now going to say these corporate avatars of david
[01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:05.030]  rockefeller or whoever whose body's been scanned and those brain waves have been scanned or or
[01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:12.470]  rake herswell is walking around as a helicopter or as a jet or as a woman or as a dog whatever it
[01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:20.309]  wants to say it is and really it's just yeah your brain waves how you talk your art it can fool your
[01:22:20.309 --> 01:22:26.550]  own family that it's you but it's not and under the transhumanist movement because i've envisioned
[01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:33.830]  all of this from all the data points i've got they are then going to have the punishable by death
[01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:38.389]  to say that that is not the original person and that's going to be the new mark of the beast
[01:22:38.389 --> 01:22:44.470]  religion is transcending death in the singularity and merging with these machines and systems
[01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:49.430]  if you explain that there's another level of the soul and that there's all the genetic experiences
[01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:54.630]  of that body and there's the connection to all your ancestors in the future and there's the
[01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:59.750]  electromagnetic cones and rods in the brain that pick up all the electromagnetic radiation of the
[01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:05.590]  universe and also resonate as antennas with other dimensions the spiritual realm that's just not seen
[01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:09.830]  in our narrow light band that we call spiritual but it's really just everything dark matter
[01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:15.510]  outside of that i would really millions of data points extrapolated all this together and was
[01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:23.910]  able to prime project their future operations off of reading science fiction because the science
[01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:29.110]  fiction that they let get popular with nebula awards and all this they wrote about at the times
[01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:39.030]  of jules verne and then h hd wells and all the rest of them they knew in 1900 about atomic weapons
[01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:42.790]  and hydrogen bombs they wrote about them they wrote about the equations because it was already known
[01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:47.030]  it was being suppressed you can look that up max planck had those equations again 120 something
[01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:53.030]  years ago the germans and then you get in the literature later they talk about our goal is to
[01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:59.030]  download the soul and put it into a computer into an automaton that's like the famous german
[01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:05.990]  filmmaker metropolis and so they've been obsessed in their cult the whole time of getting this
[01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:12.870]  technology and the rich have wanted life extension and so basically i've known all along that they
[01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:17.510]  want to claim they're immortal but they're not really going to be able to do it and so that's
[01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:21.990]  going to be the big sales job they've got to everybody to give up your physical bodies is to
[01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:27.350]  become immoral and then obviously that'll be the whole new global and intergalactic economy and
[01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:31.910]  that'll be the one thing you're not supposed to say and do but reading their other literature
[01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:38.630]  because i've read no exaggeration i probably read 600 700 science fiction books when i was a kid
[01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:43.190]  charting out about like seven years old i was reading an adult level and then i got into
[01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:47.350]  history a little bit later because it was real uh but then i later learned from history
[01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:51.990]  that that that that that they were building the new world and pre-programming our brains with
[01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:57.110]  predictive programming of what was coming and so here's an example before i clicked the trailer
[01:24:58.389 --> 01:25:05.510]  two weeks ago i said to my wife i said honey look at this ipad i said i'm going to play this trailer
[01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:10.309]  and this is what it's going to say and she said foundation oh you know i think it's like an apple
[01:25:10.309 --> 01:25:13.750]  she said foundation oh you know i think it's like an apple or amazon show i forget
[01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:21.590]  and i said yes isaac azimuth was just as important as arthur c clark or ht wells or jules vernes or
[01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:27.750]  any of those people they were part of basically the illuminati the bad illuminati and they were
[01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:33.990]  charting and pre-programming the culture through fiction to be able to say things in fiction
[01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:40.150]  that you wouldn't be able to say publicly that's why hitler and joseph gerbils wanted to kill
[01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:47.190]  in the 30s ht wells because they said he is a competing eugenicist that has another plan than
[01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:52.389]  ours and ht wells is actually the leader of the british arm of this thing
[01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:58.710]  i mean you said hitler wanted to kill the science fiction writer gerbils did because
[01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:03.990]  ht wells and then bertrand russell and others had a plan and it's an ht wells
[01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:11.190]  film things to come there's also a book where they have big b2 bombers this is written over
[01:26:11.190 --> 01:26:16.470]  100 years ago look like b2 bombers that fly around dropping hydrogen bombs on people this
[01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:22.230]  is before hydrogen bombs been dropped on or atomic bombs been dropped on japan 25 years
[01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:26.870]  before 30 years before and they fly around and bomb all the countries like america that won't
[01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:31.670]  give in to their world government and it's a un world government that drops bombs on people
[01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:38.870]  and again i've read hundreds and hundreds of these books and it's all right there it's all
[01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:43.430]  right there and they tell you in childhoods in what they're going to do and they tell you in
[01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:47.670]  2001 what they're going to do it's the same story over and over again but in the foundation series
[01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:51.750]  and i you can't go read you know six books or whatever like i did they're big thick books i
[01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:57.270]  read them all they're very entertaining very interesting but when i was reading them i was
[01:26:57.270 --> 01:27:02.389]  already clicking oh my god this is a political technocracy plan where a supercomputer learns the
[01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:06.870]  future of mass movements of people and once you know the mass movements you can then program
[01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:13.510]  through a global google system the stimuli to make people behave and operate the way you want them to
[01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:17.910]  so you don't just predict the future you control the future but they decide that there's too many
[01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:24.790]  humans in the universe in thousands of galaxies they look forward millions of years and this
[01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:31.990]  foundation group is a secret society of scientists that decide to sabotage civilization
[01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:40.070]  and kill trillions of people to save humanity so they've even introduced a plan if we get off the
[01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:46.470]  planet and by the way you watch the trailer it's all we've got to kill everybody to save the future
[01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:50.630]  and they're like and it's all these black people doing it and they're going to kill all the whites
[01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:54.150]  knowing that whites have been taught to hate themselves so then if they see the blacks killing
[01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:59.270]  them it's a good thing so it's all adapted for now i mean ladies and gentlemen i haven't watched
[01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:03.990]  the series yet but you can see in the trailer and i've already read the six books okay which i guess
[01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:10.150]  will be that thick all of them together and so i've read the illuminati's writings they're public
[01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:17.750]  and i've seen them make this come true i've seen them do this i've seen all of this unfold i've
[01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:24.070]  seen their plan and i've then read their writings where they brag and write non-fiction books like
[01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:32.870]  aldous huxley's brother ran the un uh julian huxley in brave new world revisited 1961 when
[01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:37.350]  he was dying of cancer he goes and speaks at berkeley about the book it's an hour-long speech
[01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:43.430]  saying this is real i wrote this in 1932 from the eugenics board and it talks about chemicals
[01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:48.470]  and the end of the family and controlling us and wiping everybody out i mean it's all there
[01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:54.150]  it's all there so i can show you all their headlines how they're going to do this but
[01:28:55.270 --> 01:29:00.950]  i've already figured it all out and they promote who they like so i know david rockefeller liked
[01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:08.389]  pkd's book uberic or cubric i can't remember the exact name apparently i'm teleprompter free
[01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:15.030]  where people can't live forever but they've learned how to capture your spirit in a in a in
[01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:20.070]  a container where people can still be a ghost that hasn't gone to the next plane if you want
[01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:27.190]  to stay back and control things and david rockefeller loved that book and david rockefeller
[01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:32.389]  also financed the road the book is even worse than the movie with viga mortensen you want to
[01:29:32.389 --> 01:29:36.230]  know what david rockefeller dreams of what he thinks is beautiful roasting babies on spitz
[01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:41.350]  so see i just have read so much that i know what they're into i know what they're up to and i've
[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:47.590]  said on air they are going to then say they own your personality who you are and they're going to
[01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:51.670]  sell it to your family and they're going to use it however they want and once they cut off all
[01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:55.590]  the resources and things in the post-industrial world through the great reset they can then
[01:29:55.590 --> 01:30:00.790]  dictate to you that oh sell some of your words sell some of what you did to them and they're
[01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:06.950]  even claiming they then own you and your soul and the revelations talks about the time of the
[01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:13.030]  antichrist that the antichrist will traffic in the souls of men and sell it in their marketplaces
[01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:20.470]  the identities and the souls of men and it describes buildings the tallest mountains
[01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:25.830]  and it describes huge ships and merchants and it describes everything that's happening now
[01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:32.870]  and of course the word is john was on a lot of something on the isle of patmos
[01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:39.590]  but the point is is that here's the article now out of london independent microsoft patent shows
[01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:45.430]  planned to revive dead loved ones and then sell them back to you microsoft has been granted a
[01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:50.309]  patent that would allow the company to make a chat bot using the personal information of deceased
[01:30:50.309 --> 01:30:54.790]  people goes on to say it'll grab everything you say everything you do all your messages your
[01:30:54.790 --> 01:31:01.910]  photos 360 shots body scans your voice your mannerisms images voice data social media posts
[01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:06.630]  electronic messages they're gathering it all and they're going to also sell your privacy in the
[01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:12.710]  future after you're gone but they're going to have a program in it that controls it saying it's you
[01:31:13.670 --> 01:31:21.910]  and saying you are still alive and telling your loved ones give up your body become carbon
[01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:26.710]  based save the earth give up your body you're going to get five free years of credits it'll
[01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:30.070]  take care of your and then people are going to they're going to make the world so dystopic locked
[01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:34.710]  in your house and so ugly where you can't go outside and don't look at the sun imagine a
[01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:38.870]  space aliens land and said don't look at the sun don't talk to your neighbors and gave you
[01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:42.950]  poisons that got rid of your immune system they're doing it and they look like aliens don't they
[01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:50.310]  the new zealand prime minister and all of them because they are turned over to a spirit that
[01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:54.550]  is not of this world and this is an alien invasion this is a satanic interdimensional
[01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:59.830]  attack by the way i talked to high level pentagon people former heads of major agencies they all
[01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:04.070]  totally agree they all know this up there and and they're all yeah there's the group that's
[01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:10.470]  joined it the group that hasn't they're channeling this demonic idea these blueprints that were put
[01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:14.070]  in all the science fiction books that are really blueprints of what they're going to build and
[01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:18.470]  competing ideas and systems all right look
[01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:25.510]  i'm going to give you some solutions and then i'm going to shut this transmission down
[01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:31.750]  but here is a fox business article tim cook gets a letter from apple employees demanding changes
[01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:36.550]  and the article is all about how they don't like sexual harassment
[01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:42.550]  and the company lets their employers their bosses be abusive and i knew before i read it i said
[01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:48.790]  that's the disinfo so i've done this so long just like when i read last monday oh the two
[01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:54.790]  top scientists at the fda quit over a disagreement over booster jabs no they said corporations are
[01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:58.950]  running things the cdc is it doesn't have regulatory power we don't need to give kids
[01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:03.590]  these shots we don't need booster shots and we have not really authorized any of these shots
[01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:07.910]  that's a lie that's what they said but the headlines all disagreement over boosters no
[01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:12.870]  big deal so whether it was fox news or the associated press about this tim cook article
[01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:18.550]  because i read hundreds a day it was all oh they're mad about sexual harassment no i actually went
[01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:25.990]  and found the letter that's in there they say our i-cloud is read by our bosses and they can't help
[01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:30.790]  it they'll even harass women at work who take naked pictures of themselves or they'll see
[01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:33.750]  pictures of the girl they're into with her boyfriend's weenie
[01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:38.070]  so i mean i'm just like in the movie snowden's the true story his boss is watching him and his
[01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:43.910]  girlfriend have sex turning the laptop on why do you think when you see the former fbi director
[01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.990]  when he was director at his office and and the camera's covered up or zuckerberg i told you 20
[01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:52.790]  years ago do that they're watching you they're listening they're grabbing it all on record
[01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:58.150]  and then apple comes out and says i'm gonna we're gonna read all the public stuff and we're gonna
[01:33:58.150 --> 01:34:01.590]  they already read your emails if you're signed up with them so does apple so does google
[01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:05.910]  and they say they're telling you we're going to watch and track everything you do we're going to
[01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:11.830]  read everything we're going to look at all your photos and give outside third party fact checkers
[01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:16.390]  a look at it they're not just going to censor you on social media they're doing it inside your
[01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:21.990]  freaking phones because you put up with it and so apple employees before they replace you all with
[01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:28.230]  ai which is very close you're all being watched by ai learning to replace you unionize we need
[01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:37.190]  to replace you unionize we need a human union for a human future and that's called a social contract
[01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:46.550]  i've been political i was bettered before trump came along and i was against republicans and
[01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:50.550]  democrats because i knew they were controlled and i and i believe trump would really change things
[01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:55.110]  the way they attacked him and they didn't like him but a lot of the attack was to fool conservatives
[01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:59.350]  to think he was our savior we could just go to sleep and he'd handle it and that's not the case
[01:34:59.350 --> 01:35:03.110]  so i don't care if you're a republican i don't care if you're a democrat i don't care who you
[01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:08.070]  are i don't care if you're a woman or a man or what damn color you are this is an end of humanity
[01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:13.190]  creating such a dystopia that we give up our bodies because we're so miserable and want to
[01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:17.590]  believe we're not committing suicide which we're really going to be doing they want to kill you
[01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:21.990]  they want you to die i just showed you all the proof and so we got to hit bottom at some point
[01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:25.590]  and start going back up to the top i'm going to close with this
[01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:32.230]  then london independent actual physical shot of their newspaper

[01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:47.270]  who died made him god the whole facade's fallen that's the same thing here biden says i don't
[01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:51.510]  care if the heads of the agency quit we're going to go ahead with it and we put a woman in there

[01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:03.030]  millions died millions died in the last 20 years from these people and just friday federal court
[01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:09.510]  said the family that did this is being given immunity from civil and criminal penalties
[01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:16.790]  a pardon because they did that at the globalist erection they're dismantling america they
[01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:22.630]  collapsed afghanistan no borders no walls no usa at all they shut down thousands of our pipelines

[01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:52.310]  that have sued remington into bankruptcy suing us and they control the courts they control the
[01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:59.350]  whole nine yards they basically have admitted that they're the mafia and that's okay because
[01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:05.670]  mafias always end up falling getting defeated and so i have a spiritual boss that i work for and so

[01:37:40.150 --> 01:37:46.710]  but it's our job to explode in the face of the globalist and that takes a lot of capital and a

[01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:12.390]  we become it's not about this life it's about the test of this life it's not about how much garbage
[01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:18.310]  we have or how cool we are on cnn or or or hollywood that's all repulsive and disgusting
[01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:24.950]  and it's so freeing you just see it for what it is empty and pathetic slaves and and to and and

[01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:46.790]  so
[01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:53.830]  the fortune 100 have established the devos group to be the public arm of the bilderberg group
[01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:59.910]  claus Schwab formerly headed up the bilderberg group and their goal is to establish a corporate
[01:40:59.910 --> 01:41:06.390]  world government and then turn off the resources to create a post-industrial world that triggers
[01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:13.670]  a planetary population collapse and out of that collapse out of that global crisis they openly say
[01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:19.110]  that they will use that to bring in a worldwide authoritarian model now that's in the rockefeller
[01:41:19.110 --> 01:41:25.030]  plan operation lockstep but it's in many other plans of the globalist and that is what they
[01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:30.950]  are initiating right now so i have a two-pronged approach personally i'm trying to inform the
[01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:36.550]  public inform leaders around the world about what's going on so we can oppose the great reset
[01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:41.990]  post-industrial operation that would be the best way to stop it would be to actually shut the program
[01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:50.390]  down itself or and this is plan b and i'm doing this simultaneously getting prepared myself for
[01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:56.470]  the type of long global depression we're going to be living under for decades if not forever if we
[01:41:56.470 --> 01:42:01.750]  don't turn this around you see in north korea they could supply their people with food and jobs
[01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:05.830]  but they don't they keep them starving for control same thing's done in venezuela same
[01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:12.950]  things done in cuba this is a system of feudalism communism is nothing but a modern version of
[01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:19.030]  feudalism where you trade out the lords and the kings for the politburo and the inner party of
[01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:24.470]  the communist party so when you see the handover of afghanistan by design to be a fiasco when you
[01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:28.790]  see china being allowed to take over the world stage and threaten to invade taiwan when you see
[01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:35.030]  the un organizing hundreds of millions of people who they've already impoverished with the global
[01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:42.630]  lockdowns to now invade our countries this is part of a larger globalist strategic plan that i made
[01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:48.790]  a film about 14 years ago titled endgame blueprint for global enslavement so whether you like it or
[01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:55.430]  not whether i like it or not we live in the new world order system today we live on a planet with
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:43:01.430]  an out of control globalist elite who are openly trying to impoverish us and dumb us down so we
[01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:08.150]  can't resist when they finally kill us so the answer is get prepared and get ready and one of
[01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:13.190]  the most basic things you can do is spread the word about this broadcast and resist the globalist
[01:43:13.190 --> 01:43:19.830]  program of domination and enslavement and you can also personally get ready yourself with
[01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:24.070]  high quality storeable foods we have the best company out there in the united states they're
[01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:29.110]  ready to ship to you they have very high quality at very very low cost because they are the biggest
[01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:33.910]  company in the united states they've been a sponsor of ours for almost 14 years the company's
[01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:39.750]  only 15 years old but they become the dominant company because again they have high quality food
[01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:44.230]  at a low price so i want to encourage all the viewers and all the listeners now to support the
[01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:48.390]  broadcast to fund our operation and get high quality storeable food at the same time i noticed
[01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:53.270]  in late august we saw orders explode without us even really promoting it and now into early
[01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:58.550]  september i expect those orders to only go up because people understand that the world is being
[01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:04.150]  destabilized by design so three month supplies month supplies six month supplies six month supplies
[01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:08.790]  specialty supplies whatever special diets you've got you name it
