[00:00.000 --> 00:06.440]  We confirm suspicions, Edveritas. It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at
[00:06.440 --> 00:11.100]  YouTube on tape admitting that they do it? I mean, you must be a threat if they call
[00:11.100 --> 00:12.440]  you out by name.
[00:12.440 --> 00:16.680]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:16.680 --> 00:22.720]  That was just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started. On Twitter,
[00:22.720 --> 00:29.040]  if you clicked on the hashtag NYC terrorist attack, which is quote, trending, marked with
[00:29.040 --> 00:35.960]  a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an info war story with the
[00:35.960 --> 00:42.080]  headline, Imam. I warned DeBlasio about New York City terror. He was too busy bashing
[00:42.080 --> 00:43.080]  Trump.
[00:43.080 --> 00:51.880]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[00:51.880 --> 00:53.000]  like that.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.320]  This is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[01:00.320 --> 01:06.200]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies. He actually went on Jones's show and said,
[01:06.200 --> 01:11.960]  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed,
[01:11.960 --> 01:12.960]  I hope.
[01:12.960 --> 01:21.280]  He still calls Alex Jones and talks to him, you know, the info wars, conspiracy theories.
[01:21.280 --> 01:28.840]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people
[01:28.840 --> 01:35.000]  who saw this know that it's fake news. And at least at some point in time, it can't
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.840]  keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[01:38.840 --> 01:42.440]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience
[01:42.440 --> 01:45.200]  and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[01:45.200 --> 01:55.400]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence
[01:55.400 --> 01:56.960]  voters in the election.
[01:56.960 --> 02:01.760]  They did it through false news sites. They did it through these thousand agents. They
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.040]  did it through machine learning, which, you know, kept spewing out this stuff over and
[02:05.040 --> 02:06.280]  over again.
[02:06.280 --> 02:15.680]  They began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like info wars, take out
[02:15.680 --> 02:23.040]  pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[02:23.040 --> 02:29.400]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[02:29.400 --> 02:34.440]  teaching its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story. That's according
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.880]  to website info wars.
[02:35.880 --> 02:44.400]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.760]  entities. Info wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.360]  It's been widely reported that that company has been backed by the Kremlin and they gave
[02:52.360 --> 02:58.320]  you 75,000 shares that you had to disclose when you went into the Obama administration.
[02:58.320 --> 03:05.000]  Maybe you're looking at widely reported information from info wars, but it is not true.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.480]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story
[03:14.480 --> 03:18.520]  that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious
[03:18.520 --> 03:20.400]  circumstances over the last three decades.
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.080]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in
[03:25.080 --> 03:30.880]  an apparent robbery. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source
[03:30.880 --> 03:36.000]  but as may know from the comments about the case, that murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.120]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel people I've talked
[03:41.120 --> 03:48.040]  to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[03:48.040 --> 03:54.120]  All that stuff exists. You don't see it, you don't feel it if you're largely living in
[03:54.120 --> 04:01.200]  reality and in a mainstream media world, but it's undermining our democracy and I think
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.920]  that the companies themselves, they've taken some steps, they have a lot of responsibility.
[04:05.920 --> 04:16.600]  Companies like Facebook, Google, etc. to do what they can to essentially not enhance this.
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.440]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight?
[04:22.440 --> 04:26.680]  The system self-corrected, that shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore, it should
[04:26.680 --> 04:35.120]  be a USA article the last time I checked, USA Today, at lunch I did. I also saw the system
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.120]  correct it.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.880]  They didn't call out Fox News by name, they didn't call out anyone else by name, they
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.560]  said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.000]  manually have to find that video. We're not going to allow that video if it gets 10 million
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.080]  views to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[04:54.080 --> 05:01.120]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, was two years ago.
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.040]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.680]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[05:09.680 --> 05:14.600]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[05:14.600 --> 05:20.240]  one another. It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[05:20.240 --> 05:25.000]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.240]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.600]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.400]  and supporting Infowars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[05:37.400 --> 05:41.800]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[05:41.800 --> 05:46.200]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.800]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[05:50.800 --> 05:55.120]  see and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[05:55.120 --> 06:20.000]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:20.000 --> 06:25.600]  Quickening is here. The best way to explain it is this, as I tend to do now on a routine
[06:25.600 --> 06:40.880]  basis, but on there 25 years, plus now, 25 years. And I would say maybe once in the first
[06:40.880 --> 06:47.600]  five years when I say this is the most important broadcast we've ever done. And then about
[06:47.600 --> 06:54.320]  10 years ago, I might say it once a year. About five years ago, I've said about once
[06:54.320 --> 07:00.800]  a month. And now I say it about every week because each broadcast is just covering what's
[07:00.800 --> 07:06.120]  happening in the world and the developments are incredible. Gene edited babies that are
[07:06.120 --> 07:13.720]  humanoids and aren't even human. They're not human. They have up to five parents. Humanoids
[07:13.720 --> 07:18.120]  have already been born in China for years. They've been born here for a long time. A
[07:18.120 --> 07:22.600]  lot of this got declassified more than 20 years ago. There are human clones walking around
[07:22.600 --> 07:29.000]  all over the place, but now it's all admitted in mainstream news. And I didn't even cover
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.680]  it yesterday when it was in the Associated Press on the Sunday show. It didn't even rate
[07:35.680 --> 07:48.880]  15,000 to 13,000 square miles of government-controlled mountains in West Virginia where no cell phones
[07:48.880 --> 07:57.320]  are allowed and where they're doing cancer studies, amongst other insane things, trying
[07:57.320 --> 08:02.040]  to make contacts with space aliens. By the way, if you just tune in your radio list and
[08:02.040 --> 08:06.240]  that sounds insane, yeah, it's the establishment. They're insane. They're mad scientist. The
[08:06.240 --> 08:11.280]  land where the Internet ends, New York Times. And they admit the article what it really
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.720]  is is a refuge for people that are getting sick from electromagnetic radiation that's
[08:15.720 --> 08:27.840]  been made, like ultra-rich people. And they admit all that. I have literally dozens of
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.680]  articles that are so bombshell every day I could spend the entire three, four hours
[08:32.680 --> 08:38.000]  on it. I spent almost the entire Sunday show just on this. Now, here's the problem with
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.960]  a quickening like this. You'd think everybody would wake up when this big system emerges.
[08:42.960 --> 08:47.740]  That's not what happens in psychological warfare. As I had one of the heads of the big three
[08:47.740 --> 08:56.960]  megabanks privately tell me, hard to believe it's now 14 years ago, private conversation.
[08:56.960 --> 09:02.160]  Told you the conversation many times, won't go back into the details. He said, Alex,
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.720]  you think they're going to adapt and fight it? They're going to adapt to it. You don't
[09:07.720 --> 09:15.400]  adapt and overcome. You adapt and submit. You're a fool not to join us. The fact that
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.960]  you can see it means you should be with us. You can't help them. And the disdain he had
[09:20.960 --> 09:27.440]  for the general public, it was like a Howard Beale network conversation. Like, let's play
[09:27.440 --> 09:33.520]  that next segment. So here's what's going to happen. I'm not going to cover this piece
[09:33.520 --> 09:42.920]  of news until the bottom of the hour. And I don't even do it to build suspense. I have
[09:42.920 --> 09:50.080]  trouble catching my breath with the news we have. And then the constant feeling of not
[09:50.080 --> 09:59.240]  being good enough to be bringing you something like this. Because it's like you come to your
[09:59.240 --> 10:03.840]  neighbors whose kids have been kidnapped for a week and you find out where the child is
[10:03.840 --> 10:12.360]  and they're safe and you tell your neighbors and they don't even care. There's kind of
[10:12.360 --> 10:17.760]  that let down where we just bring you so many bombshells. The Liberty Movement brings you
[10:17.760 --> 10:25.000]  so many bombshells and you fight so hard to tell people. And the general public is the
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.880]  grassroots exposing all this tyranny. And other people act like you're the weirdo because
[10:31.880 --> 10:38.560]  you care. Now we're not bitching and complaining. We're just pointing out a phenomenon. And
[10:38.560 --> 10:49.880]  I'm saying we have got to really get aggressive with people authoritatively and not back down
[10:49.880 --> 10:56.160]  the left when they try to bully us or try to make us be quiet. We have to say, hey, you're
[10:56.160 --> 11:02.040]  the one being enslaved. I'm your friend. You've been conditioned and brainwashed. This is bigger
[11:02.040 --> 11:11.440]  than both of us and you better listen to me. But instead of spending our time on the sheeple,
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.520]  some can be reached. Don't feel bad when they don't listen. Who matters is decision makers,
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.480]  most of which are on the fence and are ready to be awakened. And that's why in WikiLeaks
[11:21.480 --> 11:25.680]  and other documents, the globalists admit we played the clip last segment, they want
[11:25.680 --> 11:35.280]  info or shut down because they found that managers and decision makers and leaders
[11:35.280 --> 11:42.000]  listen to me. And it's not a confidence issue. I know what I'm talking about here. And that's
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.960]  why Wired Magazine and The New York Times and all of them have said he must be destroyed.
[11:46.960 --> 11:52.320]  He is the man's name that must not be spoken. He must be taken off the air because I believe
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.880]  in a pro-human future. And I believe you can be motivated to take action. And I believe
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.480]  you're not a piece of crap. And I believe if you're aware of this, you will adapt and
[12:01.480 --> 12:11.600]  overcome it. Not adapt and go away and submit and die. Bottom of the hour, I'm going to
[12:11.600 --> 12:20.040]  hit it. And when I got up this morning at 6 a.m. and our lead producer, Daria, had text
[12:20.040 --> 12:25.080]  messaging me this article. And the fact that James O'Keefe was on, and I watched the entire
[12:25.080 --> 12:34.920]  25-minute report, and it brought up 100 other pieces of evidence we had or more, but it
[12:34.920 --> 12:41.080]  was devastating. So the headline on infowars.com and newswars.com for the live feed of the
[12:41.080 --> 12:46.240]  show with the audio and video feeds posted so you can share it more easily on Facebook
[12:46.240 --> 12:51.440]  and Twitter and YouTube and Google and everywhere else. Newswars.com is better to share. They
[12:51.440 --> 12:55.560]  don't censor or block that as much or penalize you for it. But use your text message, use
[12:55.560 --> 13:03.160]  your email. This needs to go mega viral. Breaking news. Project Veritas blows Google
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.920]  censorship conspiracy. And they admit it's a conspiracy on video. Thousands working
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.240]  in tandem to suppress your vote and steal the election. Election meddling. Not by the
[13:13.240 --> 13:22.680]  Ruskies, but by the Googlers. Sounds like a Batman villain. The Googler. Breaking news.
[13:22.680 --> 13:31.200]  Project Veritas blows Google censorship conspiracy wide open. Project Veritas reveals staggering
[13:31.200 --> 13:38.280]  proof that Google is a giant election meddling factory. I wrote that headline that we should
[13:38.280 --> 13:50.840]  change it. Army. It's an army. Meddling technocracy. Factory technocracy or army. Giant election
[13:50.840 --> 13:56.000]  meddling system. That's its system. It takes that to system. So Project Veritas reveals
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.680]  staggering proof that Google is a giant election meddling weapon system. That's it. Weapon
[14:02.680 --> 14:10.600]  system. Share this with everyone. Well, guess what? You're a weapon system. And if you
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.880]  simply decide to go get the article on infowars.com, yeah, let's just post the whole Veritas article
[14:15.880 --> 14:23.960]  and video under our live feed on the live feed article. That's the key. And let's hammer
[14:23.960 --> 14:30.840]  that sucker out with human intelligence, over the machines, over the AI, and let's crush
[14:30.840 --> 14:35.480]  the Google sensors. My God, when you watch this video that goes on for 25 minutes, because
[14:35.480 --> 14:39.000]  they always put out the unedited so they can't claim it's edited, they've won federal court
[14:39.000 --> 14:47.200]  cases where they claim that they doctored video and Veritas won. Veritas won. And when
[14:47.200 --> 14:53.480]  we get to this video bottom of the hour, I mean, it is the top people at Google just
[14:53.480 --> 14:58.760]  bragging. Trump ain't winning in 2020. Nothing like this is ever happening. We call this
[14:58.760 --> 15:04.200]  fairness. Everything within is inversion, total censorship, lying about it to Congress
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.400]  is fairness. And they talk about how they lie to Congress on video and how Congress
[15:08.400 --> 15:15.040]  can do nothing to stop them. They go, they may try, but we're not gonna stop. Just like
[15:15.040 --> 15:23.280]  Democrats in government don't follow the president's orders. It's mutiny on the bounty.
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.280]  And they're all weak and arrogant. They had to get dishonorable trash, trained in the
[15:27.280 --> 15:35.880]  universities to do this. It's all coming up bottom of the hour. Start your engines. And
[15:35.880 --> 15:43.760]  I've got all the backstory on it too. And then James O'Keefe joins us. Loaded for bear
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.440]  in the third hour. This is the time for all of you to fire the bat signal and get this
[15:49.440 --> 15:58.560]  article out and circumvent them. It's at news wars.com, news wars.com, news wars.com, news

[17:04.080 --> 17:08.320]  backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[17:08.320 --> 17:12.240]  important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.080]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[17:17.080 --> 17:21.680]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[17:21.680 --> 17:25.680]  flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.680]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.360]  it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[17:33.360 --> 17:37.760]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory. So here's what you should do right
[17:37.760 --> 17:44.760]  now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at MyOwnPowerGrid.com. That's MyOwnPowerGrid.com.
[17:44.760 --> 17:49.560]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. And the best part, you're
[17:49.560 --> 17:55.960]  not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to MyOwnPowerGrid.com to learn more. That's

[17:57.960 --> 18:03.040]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.680]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show's a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here
[18:07.680 --> 18:12.400]  out in New York City. And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.960]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.960 --> 18:21.920]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[18:21.920 --> 18:25.760]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I
[18:25.760 --> 18:29.280]  think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.280 --> 18:32.800]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut
[18:32.800 --> 18:37.840]  you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you on air until you're 80
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.000]  years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80. But if they do shut you down,
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.680]  no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles. And there are a lot of people like myself
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.840]  and many others who are going to continue. We're going to keep fighting in the Info War. And even
[18:51.840 --> 18:56.800]  if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[18:56.800 --> 19:03.600]  fired up for liberty. Thank you, sir, for calling. Info Wars and free speech and your right to
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.680]  speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical.
[19:09.680 --> 19:15.760]  It's authoritarian. It's insane. And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[19:16.560 --> 19:22.400]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, Hey, we're sinking.
[19:22.400 --> 19:26.560]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat. But this is the real SOS.
[19:26.560 --> 19:29.920]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting,
[19:29.920 --> 19:35.600]  Info Wars will be shut down, not just crippled. And so we've reached that point. It'll make the
[19:35.600 --> 19:39.520]  enemy happy. But you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks. We've gone
[19:39.520 --> 19:44.080]  through so much because of your support. You have, you have been there. But let me tell you,
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.800]  they are pissed. They haven't been successful. And they're giving us their full assault. So we need
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.960]  your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth. Now at info wars.com. It's your fight.
[19:54.960 --> 19:59.360]  Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[19:59.360 --> 20:22.160]  Now you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.080 --> 20:38.400]  We have all the proof that Google Facebook, Twitter, there's subsidiaries and the rest of
[20:38.400 --> 20:42.560]  Silicon Valley because they all want to be bought by Google. So they all do whatever they're told
[20:42.560 --> 20:49.360]  by Google and Facebook and Apple as well as Twitter. Those big four gobble up thousands of
[20:49.360 --> 20:55.200]  companies a year, sometimes for 20 times what the company's worth and their price earnings ratio
[20:55.200 --> 21:03.600]  to control and set up an oligopoly, a cartel, a linkage of monopolies. So whether you're on
[21:03.600 --> 21:09.040]  the internet or or aren't everything you do in your life is affected by this. And if they can
[21:09.040 --> 21:15.440]  manipulate that entire system and control the information, they rule it all. That really
[21:15.440 --> 21:21.600]  goes without saying. But remember the Republicans in the 2018 election, not just in California,
[21:21.600 --> 21:27.360]  it turned out in other states, the entire Republican Party was listed as the Nazi Party
[21:27.920 --> 21:35.040]  and that their affiliation was the Nazis. Google said it was a mistake. Once they got caught,
[21:35.040 --> 21:41.280]  it had been up for months. But the internal videos all show the perjury to Congress,
[21:42.400 --> 21:47.200]  the thuggish arrogance that they would not even work with the Pentagon on AI but give it to China.
[21:47.200 --> 21:52.480]  They would lie to Congress and surveil everyone and then lie about that. It's all going to come home
[21:52.480 --> 21:58.720]  to roost. But the president's greatest failure is that he has not yet taken action. He says he will.
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  He's taken action against the colleges. That's a clear cut. Now, Texas and other states
[22:06.000 --> 22:17.840]  and other states are taking action. It's an amazing time to be alive. An amazing time to be alive.
[22:20.720 --> 22:23.040]  But we have to stand together.
[22:26.240 --> 22:30.000]  The media made jokes about it. Late night comedy made jokes about it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  Chick-fil-A owned by a Christian. They're closed on Sunday.
[22:39.680 --> 22:43.760]  They've been boycotted for a decade by the Liberals. It's made their company become the most
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.360]  successful fast food chain in the country. Others are failing.
[22:50.800 --> 22:55.840]  It's funny. It's conservative. Quick service, nice people, super professional,
[22:56.560 --> 22:59.680]  and it's some of the better fast food out there when the only place is I'll eat fast food.
[22:59.680 --> 23:07.200]  But cities like Austin and others were banning it in airports because it's conservative.
[23:07.200 --> 23:12.480]  Cities were saying who could be on city property that's really public property.
[23:13.920 --> 23:22.880]  So the governor had to get a law passed so that Chick-fil-A could pay for a stall at the airport.
[23:24.800 --> 23:28.640]  When they've got all these empty stalls at the Austin airport, just waiting for renters.
[23:28.640 --> 23:35.440]  Oh wait, you're Christian? Oh sorry, you can't have a stall. Think about how far they've already gone.
[23:36.960 --> 23:42.320]  But a mom-and-pop shop don't want to make a cake of two guys holding hands and kissing or whatever
[23:42.320 --> 23:47.360]  and they take it all the way to Supreme Court to bully that little group of people. Quite frankly,
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.760]  I'm a libertarian. I'd say yeah, go ahead and bake their cake. But that's a mom-and-pop. And the
[23:51.760 --> 23:56.400]  Supreme Court said smaller little mom-and-pop things have a right for the religious things.
[23:56.400 --> 24:02.240]  But when you get into big, giant institutions and organizations, you can crush an entire belief
[24:02.240 --> 24:08.800]  system. Christianity's seen persecution of it, according to the UN, double in the last 20 years.
[24:08.800 --> 24:16.080]  And then just in the last five, it's more than doubled again. That's quadruple. That's exponential.
[24:17.120 --> 24:23.520]  It's open season on Christians everywhere. I saw in my stacks yesterday and today without even looking
[24:23.520 --> 24:34.240]  for it. Without even trying to go search engines in it, attacks on churches in the US and in Europe
[24:34.240 --> 24:40.240]  by Muslims. Imagine if a Christian attacked a mosque. It'd be all over the nose.
[24:40.240 --> 24:58.640]  Incredible. Next level. Outrageous. But that's what's going on. Yeah, Germany sees 30 anti-Christian
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.720]  attacks in two months alone. They estimate only one out of 10 reports get reported.
[25:02.720 --> 25:13.360]  And everybody knows about attacks on colleges and dorms against black people and Jews. Of course,
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.080]  it's always in the front page of the paper. It turns out 99% of them are staged. Yeah.
[25:22.080 --> 25:26.800]  There's hardly ever anybody really burns across in somebody's yard. There's hardly ever anybody
[25:26.800 --> 25:32.160]  actually puts a swastika on something. It's done by individuals that want attention and power,
[25:32.160 --> 25:38.080]  like Jesse Smollett or the setup of the Covington kids. Or we now confirm that the law firm,
[25:38.720 --> 25:42.640]  the Democratic Party law firm, was powerful on the East Coast, arguably,
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.480]  with a bunch of Obama appointees, former federal prosecutors, provided a transcript to the court
[25:49.760 --> 25:54.720]  that the court took as official, not their own court transcript, saying, I said, Jew boy.
[25:54.720 --> 26:03.920]  We had two other stenographers look at it and do reports. And they said, white shoe boy,
[26:03.920 --> 26:11.920]  clearer than the sun in the sky at noon. Think about that mentality, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:11.920 --> 26:29.280]  where at every level, you're dealing with deception, focused, cold sociopathic.
[26:32.080 --> 26:37.200]  We're going to go to break and come back with the big enchilada. This is undoubtedly,
[26:37.200 --> 26:45.120]  to this point, the coup de gras, the crème de la crème. This is the paramount point. I'm sure
[26:45.120 --> 26:48.960]  it's penultimate. I'm sure there'll be something bigger in the future, and this will become second
[26:48.960 --> 26:54.720]  only to it. In the fight for liberty, this broadcast, this audience, this community,
[26:54.720 --> 27:00.160]  these hosts, this crew is penultimate only to Trump and the fight to restore the Republic.
[27:00.160 --> 27:08.880]  Think about that. But we're going to get to the big whopper, the proof. And if Trump doesn't take
[27:08.880 --> 27:14.160]  action with this, it means they're not following his orders, which has been already admitted. And
[27:14.160 --> 27:22.800]  it just means that he's ready to lose the election in 2020. That you are going to see the type of
[27:22.800 --> 27:30.400]  penheads that are at the top of Google running your life and arrogant and cold-blooded about the whole
[27:30.400 --> 27:37.840]  thing. The technocrats that rule your information and decide who can say what and when. It's all
[27:37.840 --> 27:44.320]  coming up. We have Clown World, Wednesday and Thursday night, the two presidential Democrat
[27:44.320 --> 27:52.800]  debates. We're going to be covering it live at infowars.com forward slash show. I'll be here.

[30:01.680 --> 30:08.400]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world. Ears and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
[30:08.400 --> 30:13.680]  for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute
[30:13.680 --> 30:18.160]  out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those
[30:18.160 --> 30:22.640]  lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars,
[30:22.640 --> 30:27.120]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand
[30:27.120 --> 30:31.040]  on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart and I want you to know that love is right back at
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.040]  you and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your
[30:35.040 --> 30:40.560]  financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm
[30:40.560 --> 30:44.800]  going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important. The enemy
[30:44.800 --> 30:50.000]  could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.560]  This is Providence so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[30:55.440 --> 30:59.200]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.040]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the Maximum Alert. We wouldn't be here without you. I
[31:05.040 --> 31:08.400]  thank you for your support and your help. We're going to be steadfast in this fight but we need
[31:08.400 --> 31:12.960]  financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at infowarstore.com.

[31:16.560 --> 31:20.400]  put it into the fight against these globalists. We need money to fight back and to let them know

[31:58.960 --> 32:05.440]  going to back down. Infowars and free speech. And your right to speech has been under unprecedented
[32:05.440 --> 32:12.080]  attack the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[32:12.080 --> 32:18.320]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[32:18.320 --> 32:23.920]  captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before
[32:23.920 --> 32:28.320]  and thanks for keeping us afloat. But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products
[32:28.320 --> 32:33.920]  and spread the word and keep fighting, Infowars will be shut down, not just Cripple. And so we've
[32:33.920 --> 32:38.400]  reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever. We have stood so many of
[32:38.400 --> 32:43.440]  their attacks. We've gone through so much because of your support. You have been there. But let me
[32:43.440 --> 32:47.920]  tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[32:47.920 --> 32:54.000]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com.
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.440]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue because we could be shut down.
[32:59.440 --> 33:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.440 --> 33:36.720]  It's a reliable source of information. $50,000. $50,000. Unstoppable loss.
[33:36.720 --> 34:01.600]  And radio. And look up. And cracks. And radio. And look up. What if I told you they'd be lying?
[34:01.600 --> 34:08.880]  What if I told you they'd be lying? And now the cow calls a pack again.
[34:08.880 --> 34:16.880]  The clutch bringing us in. Way underrated. Getting old man. I'm getting a little fat in the
[34:16.880 --> 34:27.600]  earlobes like Grandpa. It's your source of information. $50,000. Unstoppable loss.
[34:27.600 --> 34:37.600]  Hell, I think we got like 12,5001 AM stations. All right, let's get back to the serious news.
[34:40.160 --> 34:47.600]  I'm very happy about this. But if we don't do our job, that means you. And that means I'm on my knees.
[34:48.800 --> 34:53.520]  Please realize how much power you've got. If you get the article at newswars.com and
[34:53.520 --> 35:00.560]  infowars.com and the live feed at infowars.com and newswars.com and just email it and text it out
[35:00.560 --> 35:09.280]  and call people and call talk radio and say, wow, after Google lied to Congress and after Google
[35:09.280 --> 35:14.480]  told the world that they weren't censoring anybody and after all the times we caught them in their
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.680]  internal documents and their own admissions, Project Veritas has put out a 25 minute report
[35:19.680 --> 35:27.040]  and hours of raw footage on their site showing Google executives bragging how they censor
[35:27.040 --> 35:33.840]  conservatives and block them and how they call fairness, not letting Trump get reelected or
[35:33.840 --> 35:44.000]  people like him. Jin and I, these are high level individuals and their SJW is right out of college.
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.040]  That's where they produce these clones, like something out of Star Wars. They may look different,
[35:51.040 --> 35:57.600]  they all have the same world view and they just come out and say, we're not going to let 2020
[35:57.600 --> 36:04.960]  happen again. But didn't the head of Google remember this, rightbart.com, infowars.com,
[36:04.960 --> 36:11.680]  drivereport.com, hammered it, September 11th, 2018, the documents came out from the day after
[36:11.680 --> 36:21.920]  November 8th, 2016. On November 9th, this video went up to Google's leadership, thousands of
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.400]  managers, somebody was bad and leaked it. Google's leadership dismayed reaction to Trump and they
[36:28.400 --> 36:34.000]  promised to not let it happen again. But hell, internal emails said they were going to deliver
[36:34.000 --> 36:40.800]  the election to Hillary. Here's just some of the hours of this stuff. Here it is.
[36:41.840 --> 36:47.920]  I certainly find this election a deeply offensive and I know many of you do too.
[36:47.920 --> 36:52.640]  It did feel like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest. What we all need right now is a hug.
[36:52.640 --> 36:54.160]  Can I move to Canada?
[36:56.880 --> 36:59.760]  Is there anything positive you see from this election result?
[36:59.760 --> 37:05.840]  Oh boy, that's a really tough one right now.
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.000]  And they go on to say, we are not going to let this happen again. We're going to play
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.960]  more video of that in a moment. If you're a TV viewer, you notice they're wearing
[37:16.000 --> 37:23.840]  propeller hats, dunce hats. They have beer on the campus and penball machines and it's all done
[37:23.840 --> 37:31.760]  as camouflage. The most criminal parts of DARPA in the globalist eugenics stay behind cult,
[37:32.320 --> 37:40.080]  set it up now 21 years ago to be an AI takeover of the planet. It's dealt with China
[37:41.040 --> 37:46.080]  and in the EU like it loves authoritarianism, it hates America. They say that in their own
[37:46.080 --> 37:52.160]  documents. They work to arrest political dissidents, but their own employees dress like clowns
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.960]  and go around, oh, I'm wearing pink and green non-matching socks. It's all
[37:57.520 --> 38:02.800]  camouflage for their criminal activity. And the people you see managing Google,
[38:02.800 --> 38:10.080]  that's just front people. Alphabet with Eric Schmidt and Obama and the Clintons all hover
[38:10.080 --> 38:15.120]  in the darkness with the strings down their little puppets.
[38:15.120 --> 38:25.040]  I thought someday it would be you that would hold the strings. I don't know Senator Collion,
[38:25.680 --> 38:32.400]  President Collion, but see there's something about a handsome man that's built his own company and
[38:32.400 --> 38:38.640]  wearing a nice suit and kills people himself. That's scary. People know he could be the bad guy.
[38:38.640 --> 38:45.680]  But see, Google wears a propeller hat on the head. Doesn't matter they got a trillion dollars,
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.240]  doesn't matter they watch everything you do, doesn't matter they sell it all to the Chinese
[38:50.240 --> 38:54.480]  and the Chinese put two million of their own people in concentration camps using Google.
[38:55.840 --> 39:02.000]  Doesn't matter. Hell, if Hitler wore a propeller hat, we probably would have let him win.
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.440]  You see how it works? That's why child molesters dress up like clowns or girls.
[39:10.240 --> 39:15.200]  They learn they can get your kid in the back of the car that way. All right, that's enough.
[39:18.480 --> 39:21.920]  So I'm not doing a very good dog collioning anyways. I was kind of segueing off and
[39:21.920 --> 39:30.160]  do a good fellas. And you know this is a lot so business. When they call for a meeting,
[39:30.160 --> 39:36.400]  it'll be at that meeting, you'll be assessed. Did you check the phone lines again? You wanna
[39:36.400 --> 39:42.880]  check that? I checked it all pops. Good stuff. The point is, is that we know mafia when it's
[39:42.880 --> 39:50.640]  looking at us right in the eyes. And we're not stupid. And so here's the big news, ladies and
[39:50.640 --> 40:00.240]  gentlemen, Project Veritas champion hero all around badass. See, I don't admire Michael Jordan.
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.920]  Very entertaining to watch. Amazing athlete. Put you this way. I admire Michael Jordan,
[40:05.920 --> 40:11.520]  but on a scale of one to 10, Michael Jordan's like a two. Project Veritas is like a nine.
[40:12.640 --> 40:18.480]  Trump's like a nine. Fire fighter that goes in a house, he knows his collapse to get kids out.
[40:18.480 --> 40:25.760]  It's burned to death. That guy's a 10. Somebody in a hostage situation goes in to take out his
[40:25.760 --> 40:31.520]  jihadi, takes him out. He detonates the suicide vest, kills him. That's a 10. No, I'm sorry.
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.680]  Roger Stalback said two. Roger Stalback would tell you that too, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:41.200 --> 40:44.880]  I mean, it's just that simple. I literally get butterflies.
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.120]  When somebody like Matt Rudd shows up in our offices, or I got a Project Veritas,
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.840]  James O'Keefe on, because you know what? That's the person saving my children's future.
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.000]  That's somebody they tried to indict six or seven times. Hell, they didn't indict him once.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.520]  That's somebody they're trying to put in prison. Somebody they're trying to kill.
[41:05.520 --> 41:09.200]  And I know for a fact he's going through the same stuff I go through behind the scenes.
[41:09.200 --> 41:16.880]  Those are real men. And everybody else gets threatened with being taken off the air or
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.040]  blacklisted when they come on our show. And all these other good time pals that always
[41:21.040 --> 41:26.160]  wanted on the show. As soon as we got blacklisted, they won't even talk to us. It doesn't hurt my
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.800]  feelings. They won't talk to me. It hurts my feelings to know they're not men. They're not
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.720]  even little boys. They're fakes that want to play both sides. When you try to play both sides of
[41:36.720 --> 41:45.040]  something like this, you lose the whole civilization. So we come back. I'm going to
[41:49.760 --> 41:55.520]  get to the boil down of the 25 minute video. Then O'Keefe's going to be on. And then I'm going to air
[41:56.160 --> 42:00.320]  the entire investigative report after that. And then Gerald Salente, another great patriot that
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.680]  I admire. It's going to be taken over the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen. I admire people like David
[42:05.680 --> 42:11.280]  Knight. He had a huge heart attack, almost died. And a week after he had surgery,
[42:12.880 --> 42:15.520]  he came down here and tried to do a show until he almost passed out.
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.440]  Countermanding my orders, they take off two months because he was upset about what's happened in
[42:21.440 --> 42:28.560]  the country. That's what made this country great. Not a bunch of damn one to be on TV,
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.720]  just to be on TV or walk some red carpet. You couldn't pay me to walk a red carpet.
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.160]  You know, in Hollywood, walking on red carpet is a joke. They all hate it.
[42:36.960 --> 42:40.400]  They all know it's all about food on the general public that somehow they're on some
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.880]  higher level than you. They are on a higher level, a higher level of bathing and crap.
[42:49.120 --> 42:55.680]  All these Google slaves are going down. They're not going to beat us. So keep running your arrogant,
[42:55.680 --> 42:58.160]  fat mouths. We're going to play it when we come back.
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.920]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square. The other
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.120]  thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed
[43:09.120 --> 43:13.520]  by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not
[43:13.520 --> 43:18.080]  being funded by secret foreign government. It is completely independent of all that. It is an old
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.520]  school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.520]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[43:27.520 --> 43:31.840]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[43:31.840 --> 43:35.760]  the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.920]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[43:39.920 --> 43:45.280]  manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the Info Wars
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.400]  audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.720]  ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of
[43:54.720 --> 44:00.640]  the platforming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth. Well, we're very very clear with
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.520]  everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from
[44:05.520 --> 44:09.440]  shutting down the final mega counts we have, do their criminal activity and their and their digital
[44:09.440 --> 44:14.800]  fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to in here. We
[44:14.800 --> 44:19.280]  need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.920]  against the enemy. Fairly I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their
[44:23.920 --> 44:28.880]  skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.040]  attack back with lies. That just brings more people here. So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are
[44:33.040 --> 44:39.200]  you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now. But literally if you flood us with
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.800]  money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth,
[44:42.800 --> 44:46.320]  you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together. I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I
[44:46.320 --> 44:50.160]  want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are
[44:50.160 --> 44:54.480]  failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down to have my commitment. This
[44:54.480 --> 44:58.480]  only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about
[44:58.480 --> 45:06.000]  this. Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[45:06.000 --> 45:13.200]  the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane and I keep trying
[45:13.200 --> 45:19.280]  to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this
[45:19.280 --> 45:24.800]  operation and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us
[45:24.800 --> 45:29.360]  afloat. But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and
[45:29.360 --> 45:34.720]  keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled. And so we've reached that point.
[45:35.280 --> 45:39.360]  It'll make the enemy happy. But you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks.
[45:39.360 --> 45:44.320]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have you have been there. But let me tell you
[45:44.320 --> 45:49.040]  they are pissed. They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault. So we need
[45:49.040 --> 45:54.720]  your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at infowarscore.com. It's your
[45:54.720 --> 46:20.800]  fight. Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down. All
[46:20.800 --> 46:50.720]  stars. The greatest comedy show on earth two nights only 20 candidates
[46:50.720 --> 47:00.000]  and tons of laughs. June 26 and 27 covered starts at 7pm at info wars.com forward slash show.
[47:00.000 --> 47:19.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.360 --> 47:35.680]  Good old Jen Jen I and others at Google are in a detailed project veritas.com report.
[47:36.560 --> 47:42.640]  We've got served up for you at news wars.com. Please get it and send everybody you know,
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.640]  watch Google admits they're going to steal the election from Trump in 2020. They are arrogant
[47:48.640 --> 47:54.640]  about it. Just like college professors. But they say there is no free speech on this campus.
[47:54.640 --> 47:58.800]  There will be no pro Trump speakers. There will be no Republican speakers. This is their just
[47:58.800 --> 48:06.960]  conceitedness. Their arrogance will be their undoing unless we aren't active. So we're very
[48:06.960 --> 48:12.000]  close to the antitrust suits that are about to be filed. We need injunctions. We need the FB out
[48:12.000 --> 48:21.280]  of raid Google. And by the way that's being talked about. Just for their espionage. What about
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.040]  their line to Congress? All their executives. There's more than one way to skin a cat. But the
[48:25.040 --> 48:30.400]  heritage foundation and the Koch brothers funding the Republican party establishment go oh private
[48:30.400 --> 48:38.480]  companies do anything they want. Oh sure. Right. Yeah Google could have 93% of the searches in the
[48:38.480 --> 48:46.320]  U.S. and put up searches saying that the official party affiliation of Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.400]  And the Republicans are in the Nazi party when you just go to vote or look stuff up and say oh
[48:50.400 --> 48:59.520]  they're affiliations Nazis. Just like they said last Monday hundreds of newspapers everywhere.
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.360]  National news Alex Jones sent child born to the San Diego parents. The FBI sent us a letter
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.240]  saying it's not true where the victim somebody sent it to us after we got sued was unopened.
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.720]  But they subpoenaed those emails. They got them 57,000. Well you should have read everyone read
[49:14.720 --> 49:24.560]  everyone. It was hidden leaks. They had to scan it. Look at these blast points. It never seemed
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.280]  sand people hit something this big. That's because they didn't. We were made to think they did.
[49:29.280 --> 49:35.520]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise. All right. I'm going to quit doing the Godfather
[49:35.520 --> 49:42.800]  in Star Wars quotes today. FBI confirms the victim of child porn attack. Read the FBI
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.440]  letter. Confirming they already told Pat us that last week. Confirming their new conversation.
[49:47.440 --> 49:51.840]  They called him again Friday. We're very cordial and said yes you guys are the victims. Please
[49:51.840 --> 49:58.800]  destroy it all. And boy if we ever get subpoenaed again by a judge asking for tens of thousands
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.720]  of emails we're going to explain. Your honor it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to send
[50:02.720 --> 50:09.120]  these to firms to scan them for hidden links. And we're going to make the opposition pay.
[50:10.560 --> 50:15.360]  And then you can scan, kill, the cows come home. But let's get to the video I mentioned.
[50:15.360 --> 50:23.120]  Insider blows whistle as execs reveal Google plan to prevent Trump situation in 2020 on hidden
[50:23.120 --> 50:33.760]  camera. And this is machine learning fairness and Google practices head. The former fair
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.080]  and equitable program is now called machine learning fairness. Now a machine calls it fair
[50:38.080 --> 50:43.600]  when Trump loses and when they game the system like Google's brag. But because they call it fair
[50:46.800 --> 50:52.240]  when you call a man a woman that happening all over the world they're filing suits and winning
[50:52.240 --> 51:04.160]  men come in to have gynecological exams, pap smears and they tell them sir or ma'am it's ma'am
[51:04.160 --> 51:10.720]  you don't have a vagina or a cervix and they go they tell female nurses you will check my cervix
[51:11.440 --> 51:18.560]  and many go okay. And then usually the bizarre drugged out method says stick your fingers and
[51:18.560 --> 51:23.920]  you know where the women do it they submit to being raped because it's a God in front of them.
[51:23.920 --> 51:27.680]  And mothers bring their little kids to sit on the laps of convicted pedophiles all over the
[51:27.680 --> 51:31.920]  country it's all confirmed we've named the name shown you the convictions of rapist and the mothers
[51:31.920 --> 51:36.080]  bring them like to bail like a human sacrifice and set them on the laps.
[51:39.520 --> 51:46.640]  It's all about your submission to evil because if you'll put up with that if nurses are made to
[51:46.640 --> 51:57.200]  give men cervical exams and now they want taxpayers to pay for dogs sex changes and cats sex changes
[51:58.480 --> 52:05.120]  they're coming to take me away ha ha except it's the globalists they're making us submit
[52:05.120 --> 52:10.960]  to madness we're the ones that are crazy well not me so here's just some of the project Veritas
[52:10.960 --> 52:18.160]  boil down then James don't keep coming up the third hour here it is. The reason why I decided to come to Project Veritas is because
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.880]  people need to know what's actually going on with Google there's this facade about what they're doing
[52:24.880 --> 52:29.520]  but what they're actually doing what the employees are actually seeing inside the company is different.
[52:29.520 --> 52:44.480]  Let's go start again she's the head of responsible innovation we're innovating things
[52:44.480 --> 52:49.120]  what did the head of Apple say they asked him why did you ban Alex Jones completely off everything
[52:49.120 --> 52:53.760]  and even ban his top apps it was number one the people voted number one news app by downloading
[52:53.760 --> 52:58.560]  it number one ahead of the Wall Street Journal Fox News they were number one.
[53:01.760 --> 53:07.280]  And he said oh how do we do he's a horrible person I told you well like a curator in a museum
[53:08.240 --> 53:14.240]  and because I'm gay it's okay all right yes I run death camps in China the worst factories
[53:14.240 --> 53:22.320]  with suicide nets but I'm I'm gay I'm like dude I don't care what you do with your dingaling
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.240]  Tim Cook so I've been told the folks to know him he is major pissed at me talking about that
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.920]  I'm just saying running death camps you don't get a pass because you're gay
[53:32.480 --> 53:36.960]  by the way what the hell are you on bro there's all these video interviews with him under bright
[53:36.960 --> 53:43.440]  lights with 90 people I mean I've taken three hits of acid my eyes didn't get that big you know
[53:43.440 --> 53:50.240]  I'm joking never did that I took mushrooms with the acid with I'm joking the point is I have never
[53:50.240 --> 53:57.280]  seen anybody's eyeballs that big they're pupils so whatever he's on doesn't look too healthy does he
[53:57.280 --> 54:03.600]  that it's okay I have a trillion dollar company and it costs $20 to make the phone even the communist
[54:03.600 --> 54:08.000]  party said if you'd pay people a dollar day more they wouldn't have to live on the street working
[54:08.000 --> 54:16.560]  for you and he just said oh my gosh did you know I'm gay it's like it's okay it's okay he went to
[54:16.560 --> 54:21.360]  China 10 years ago and he said I want to censor everybody I support government's doing it that
[54:21.360 --> 54:31.360]  was a major headline but again he's gay as long as a gay person does it's liberal oh my gosh that's
[54:31.360 --> 54:41.520]  sweet okay let's go ahead and go back to the report sorry this is the head lady just cold
[54:41.520 --> 54:51.120]  bloodedly and notice she says it doesn't matter what congress tries we're not gonna stop you'll
[54:51.120 --> 55:00.240]  never stop me superman here it is the reason why I decided to come to project Veritas is because
[55:00.240 --> 55:05.920]  um people need to know what's actually going on with google versus the fraud about what they're
[55:05.920 --> 55:10.720]  doing but what they're actually doing what the employees are actually seeing inside the company
[55:10.720 --> 55:30.080]  is different they're not objective piece they're not objective source of information
[55:30.080 --> 55:45.280]  but then there are things we're gonna come back with more of this but algorithmic unfairness
[55:46.400 --> 55:52.480]  their ideas are dominating they have scientists gone saying there's only men and women and that's
[55:52.480 --> 56:01.920]  not fair so they're bad meanwhile they've totally sold out the chai comms that execute you if you're
[56:01.920 --> 56:07.280]  homosexual but it's okay because Tim Cook's gay we're gonna come back with all of that and we have
[56:07.280 --> 56:14.640]  congressman Josh Hawley former attorney general Missouri awesome guy he has introduced the bills
[56:14.640 --> 56:20.560]  that will strip him of section 230 if they don't stop what they're doing right now so more power
[56:20.560 --> 56:28.080]  to you full steam ahead that's coming up next segment you understand there's 25 minutes of

[56:48.560 --> 56:57.680]  unfairness means unjust or pre-judicial treatment of people that is related to sensitive characteristics
[56:58.560 --> 57:04.000]  and they can apply that to anything they want anytime bellowed line you will submit you will

[57:40.160 --> 57:46.240]  not eels behind the scenes it's pure hardcore satanism torture and death
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  i just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.200]  this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50 off but we make only
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.600]  like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste
[58:03.600 --> 58:08.160]  at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars
[58:08.160 --> 58:11.680]  or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the
[58:11.680 --> 58:15.120]  bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of
[58:15.120 --> 58:20.080]  dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for six months we've not just been a standstill
[58:20.080 --> 58:24.960]  the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored and labored and labored on this i like
[58:24.960 --> 58:28.480]  to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's
[58:28.480 --> 58:33.200]  why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we
[58:33.200 --> 58:37.680]  never have time to get into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence
[58:37.680 --> 58:42.320]  us then they're really going to plant child porn on us then they're going to kill me or you or
[58:42.320 --> 58:46.240]  anybody else i mean the democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign
[58:46.240 --> 58:52.720]  banks in the chicom so go to info war store dot com in the 40 years that i've been in american
[58:52.720 --> 58:58.560]  politics i've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and
[58:58.560 --> 59:06.080]  evidence no longer matters the false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the sandy hook
[59:06.080 --> 59:12.320]  plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's a smear somebody sends you something that's
[59:12.320 --> 59:18.000]  encrypted you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and
[59:18.000 --> 59:24.480]  then it's blamed on you this is Kafka esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream media rushes
[59:24.480 --> 59:30.880]  out to say jones set kitty porn is really outrageous i have a lot of respect for those media outlets
[59:30.880 --> 59:35.840]  and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified but i went to where the big boys
[59:35.840 --> 59:40.720]  where's the wall street journal where's associated press when are they going to report that they
[59:40.720 --> 59:46.320]  made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your help and i urge
[59:46.320 --> 59:55.360]  folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:55.360 --> 01:00:07.360]  you have the power humanity has the power we have the power do you want to fight you better
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:17.840]  believe you got one rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:25.760]  so if you're a radio listener and listening on am you can make this out uh but some of the audio
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.800]  goes up and down as it's hidden audio i'd give it an a plus though for effort but when you get into
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.240]  the raw footage and it's not the intro of the video and it didn't have the music over it it's
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.440]  even more powerful so i'll try to shut up and air the intro to this and then come back and get more
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.800]  into the other news and james oakief joins us next hour but it's a maximum action alert the
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.520]  articles on info wars dot com news wars dot com project veritas dot com stuff on drives report dot
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:56.560]  com this should be the top story in the world google caught ran handed google execs admit they're
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:02.480]  stealing the election from 2020 from from google exec admits election meddling to prevent front
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:11.120]  winning 2020 paul joseph watson brags congress can pressure us but we're not changing again they hate
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:18.560]  this country so much they would give ai give it to them by darpa to the chai comms under obama's
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:24.720]  orders it's high treason folks and that's why they had no respect for us and we finally get a president
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.760]  trying to do a little something and they're crapping bricks they can build a giant brick
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:36.160]  building with the amount of it so they're doubling down their fear more leaks are coming ladies and
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.920]  gentlemen but if they steal 2020 it's it's it's it's just going to be unbelievable i haven't even
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.640]  gotten to half of it they're harassing tucker carlson in his house i've got inside baseball on that
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.440]  and it's just outrageous what they're doing to tucker's family
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.000]  you know i get sent child porn they come to tucker carlson's house and again we're not victims
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.120]  we're victorious it's why they're doing this to us but let me tell you if there's a center of the
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.680]  universe it's evil it's called the democratic party so let's go ahead and go back to this project
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.880]  veritas patient um the reason why i decided to come to project veritas is because um people need to
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.920]  know what's actually going on with google there's this facade about what they're doing but what
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.160]  they're actually doing what the employees are actually seeing inside the company is different
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.480]  but the reason we launched our AI principle is because people were not putting a line in the
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.120]  sign but they were not saying it's fair exactly so we're like well we are a big company we're
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.000]  going to pay it it's called the slogan for the current president do not agree with our
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.720]  they're not objective peace they're not a objective source of information but then there are teams
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.520]  it's a problem of fairness and of fairness the team's fairness like you know you need to be
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:03:06.480]  involved they're highly biased political machine um that is bent on never letting somebody like
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.880]  donald trump come to power again 2020 is certainly on top of my old organization just as a team
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.920]  top of mind they've been working on it since 2016 to make sure we're ready for 2020 this is a
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:31.280]  goliathine but of david trying to say that the emperor has no clothes being a small ants
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:36.720]  i can be crushed and i'm aware of that but this is something that is bigger than me this is something
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:46.960]  that needs to be said to the american public i like i love her but she's very misguided like
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.720]  that will not make it better it'll make it worse because now all these smaller companies we don't
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.440]  have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next sort of situation it's
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:02.640]  like a small country and it's like ladies and gentlemen this is the face of authoritarianism
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:10.400]  little chicken necks little control freaks giggling and laughing lying to congress stealing
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.760]  all your data the company has making hundreds of billions working with authoritarians
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:22.080]  rounding up political opposition all over the world but then manned by a bunch of recently

[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:46.480]  calling it fairness to make sure trump loses in 2020 and saying we don't care what congress
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.000]  does we're gonna keep doing it well guess what you little criminals you were founded in this country
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.920]  with us government money and your election meddling and your distraction with the russians

[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.640]  and by the way if you work at google if you work at facebook or twitter you don't have to be project
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:27.200]  veritas all you got to do is go out with these executives and record them bragging about it
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.560]  and send it to veritas send it to us veritas loves us i tell folks a lot of times send it to veritas
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.680]  they can take them out too send it to us we'll put it out as well and just blur it all out
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:44.560]  but who cares get fired get in there over the next few months and then go public
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.840]  they're engaged in criminal activity you're not going to get in trouble
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:55.760]  blow their operations politically peacefully lovingly wide open senators josh paulie
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.280]  has introduced a bill to strip google and others of section 230 that's their immunity
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.080]  where they claim oh we don't censor we don't judge anything unless it's illegal
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.680]  so they are given liability protection something i don't have something something uh the wall
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:19.920]  street journal doesn't have as publishers but that they have that they have and then they engage
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.240]  in all this activity we have all the years they've been caught all the election meddling all the
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:34.320]  admissions all the perjury to congress sundar pachi here's the senator so you said a second ago
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.320]  that that these companies are discriminated against conservatives and libertarians and and of course
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:43.280]  it's true libertarians however would argue against what you're trying to do and i think
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.440]  they're arguing be well if you don't like it start your own google right and the problem with that is
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.680]  is that when you have a monopoly as google really does i mean good luck with that i mean companies
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.320]  have tried to start up google buys them google suppresses them engages in anti-competitive
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.920]  conduct you know some people say oh this is this is for speech my approach is forcing the companies
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.880]  to engage in that's just nonsense this isn't for speech at all it is stopping discrimination
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.320]  against speech by these companies i don't i don't want the companies to speak in any particular way
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:18.720]  my point is just this stop discriminating against conservatives stop suppressing other viewpoints
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.440]  that you don't agree with i mean it's just as simple as that but i'm unless i'm missing something
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.960]  what your bill would do would just remove the special protections that they have that for
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.160]  example i do not enjoy as a broadcaster fox news as a news company we don't enjoy we can be sued
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.800]  if we defame somebody we commit fraud we can be sued we don't have this immunity and all your bill
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.360]  would do is just put them into my category that's exactly right i mean that's exactly right i mean
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.080]  to be clear these big tech companies facebook and google and youtube and twitter they have a deal
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.760]  that nobody else has no media company has this deal no other publisher has this deal they have this
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:59.360]  special carve out this special handout from government and if they want to keep it my view
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.800]  is they should quit discriminating on the other hand if they want to discriminate against
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.960]  conservatives if they want to push a liberal agenda that's fine but you shouldn't get they
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:12.800]  shouldn't get these special deals that nobody else gets and they can live like the rest of us
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:17.520]  senator god bless you for doing this i'm so glad that you are and i really look forward
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.560]  to finding out who opposes this because it will tell us everything i think senator great see you
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:27.360]  tonight thanks for having me that's right and so here's what's happening the globalists and
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.960]  their allies the chai comms that's really what we're talking about here hollywood the globalist
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:38.240]  the chai comms the eu parasites they know that the comeuppance is here they know judgment days here
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.880]  they know the world's waking up so they're just racing to try to keep their people in office
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.160]  to politically block it and bring in classical authoritarianism instead of getting caught lying
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.440]  stopping instead of being caught being bullies backing off they've gone hey let's just quadruple
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:13:02.480]  everything let's quintuple everything it's worse than that and so they're going for broke so we're
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:10.720]  in a fight and the good news is they've been so arrogant that we've got all the proof and again
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:19.360]  google doesn't list congress people running for office republican videos when they pay to air
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.840]  them on tv and they end up on youtube they delist them they shadow bad them that's all admitted
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.600]  that's election meddling they don't let people see a republican that cuts an ad pays forward on tv
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.680]  has a youtube channel puts it up there in some cases they refused to even run the ads very
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:42.320]  milk toast ads well there's hundreds of court cases on newspapers and tv stations refusing to

[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:54.480]  or you'd have a monopoly of ideas this is the opposite of government regulation these are
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:00.080]  prohibitive regulations on regulations on discrimination because google and facebook

[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.080]  anti-free speech and by extension because congress has an act
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.280]  to protect american citizens and to protect the internet that we built you know it'd be one thing
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.240]  if we hadn't built the damn thing and hadn't launched the thing and if our government didn't
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:46.880]  want dominance over the world with it as this big system and then now it's been handed away to the
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:53.040]  globalist and then now it's going to be used to screw us when we built it and paid for the stinker
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:03.120]  no let's see we started using it for good they thought we wouldn't use it for good they thought
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.800]  we would adapt by submitting to being slaves and go away they thought we just live our short
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.680]  little lives out and the post human era would be here of the silicon gods the ai gods that that
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.600]  everybody warns about now that i first told you about 20 years ago that the globalists are in a

[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.840]  and see remember the executive telling me the head of the big bank you'll just adapt to being

[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:06.400]  wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.960]  structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.640]  one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.640]  this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.600]  self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.360]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.280]  it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.840]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.120]  time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.120]  and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.200]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:12.880]  google would love to have me arrested and killed guaranteed
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.840]  i am here because there is a concerted effort by the democratic party and multinational corporations
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:27.520]  in big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices info wars founder alex jones
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:33.120]  is calling out alleged collusion between google and democrats sundar you know google is helping
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.840]  china with dragon why and you know that they're helping censor and you know you know that you've
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.920]  sold this country out and you won't even help the pedagogical help the chikoms you bet on the
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.080]  wrong country sundar we're aware of his lying to congress we're aware of him and the dragonfly
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.920]  project that's already been operational for years inside the chinese government now it's just being
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.120]  rolled out the general public sundar you're engaged in treason you've had google executives lie to
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.520]  congress you're not sensory conservative the big tech companies and the head of apple admit that
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:05.120]  they met with senator warner who's running this whole thing to begin shutting down conservatives
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:09.920]  or the democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to him i know
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.920]  we had alex jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories alex jones obviously is
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:21.120]  one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying you didn't call me to testify in america
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.880]  i have a right to fix my accusers and you congressman doge are a liar and a fraud google is evil
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:34.000]  google is evil google is evil twitter is planning to permanently suspend alex jones's personal
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.760]  account at info wars this comes after twitter ceo jack dorsey was on capital hill yesterday
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:45.200]  speaking with lawmakers twitter gives alex jones the boot to the social networking site permanently
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:54.000]  banning he and his media company info wars but i have a right to face my accusers jack they're
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.400]  lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me 26 companies working in concert violating
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.120]  the germany trust act and now senator warner and senator widen have said quote there's thousands
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.600]  of sites worse than alex jones so we're becoming like cuba we're becoming like vietnam we're coming
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.960]  like china so regardless what we'll think about me or the straw man should i have a first amendment
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.040]  or should these companies be able to to violate the whole safe arbor hack and all that and then
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:24.320]  ban conservatives in mass i don't know anything about your site and we're also standing up to social
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:30.720]  media censorship that's the new thing our interview was cut short because he was confronted
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:35.440]  by alex jones of info wars right here in the hallway it's weird man oh yes really where there's no
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:39.840]  purge of conservatives i don't know we shadow banning you are concerned about bias in social
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.240]  media yeah who's this guy we de-played concerned about bias in social media well i think the
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.480]  bigger bias is against freedom of expression everybody should be there's a there's a look i
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.720]  i support going after here but you said i don't exist is that a heckler i depressed the gaggle
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.120]  look at this guy he's saying that i don't exist and they're i just don't know who you are man i don't
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:02.080]  read your website sure and they demonize me and these very hearings and then he plays dumb here's
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.320]  the question info wars dot com you know it does google does facebook does that's why you think it
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:14.880]  elected to be regulated like like do they need to be like all right yeah who are you yeah sure
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.400]  i swear to god i don't know who are they're hoping to be platforming tens of millions of views
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.640]  info wars bigger than russia lembaugh he knows who info wars is playing this joke over here
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.000]  that's why the de-platforming didn't work the most prominent casualty of the crusade against
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.880]  free expression has been the radio show host alex jones for many on the left the view seems to have
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:36.880]  become that if you can't beat them prevent them from speaking on twitter the top tweet links to
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:44.640]  an info wars story this is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.120]  the system self-corrected that's not that shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore it should be a
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.520]  usa article the last time i checked um but you saw this you at usa today at lunch i did yeah and this
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:00.000]  and i also saw the system system corrected even the new york times calls it a crackdown
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.960]  on conservatives and applying to deep platform conservatives from from the internet and communicating
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.640]  with each other today just like communist china we need you to act now and move against big tech
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.080]  censorship president trump cnn and the democrats you know are destroying the first amendment and
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.440]  needs to be stood up against these are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:25.040]  tells you they are extremists and that's why facebook uh decided to get rid of them look at this right
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:30.400]  there's a guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that trump's wrong
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.040]  there's no censorship with conservatives or patriots you are incredibly shameful how are you
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.960]  doing alex you're just a look at you look what you are literally an anti-american anti-free speech
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.840]  coward shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment but instead
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:55.280]  a tap dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.880]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.680]  have you heard the news baby
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:15.360]  hey google admits it they say trouble never get reelected
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.960]  they say they're gonna shut him down
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.000]  call liberalism and leftist propaganda
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.400]  huh guess what they're gonna fail
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.360]  that's why they work around the clock to shut down info wars dot common news wars dot common
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.200]  you know we were one of the few organizations when matt rudge came here i talk about this all
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:50.960]  the time is it so seminal so pivotal so critical so important so providential
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:58.640]  is the word i was looking for they're all applicable came here he said listen
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.760]  you're one of the few people that's built an infrastructure outside their system and he said
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:15.520]  obviously i've got one even bigger and he sat on air and he said off air hillary they believe
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  is going to be installed and they're going to come out of the free speech with the euro
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:28.320]  so targeting the u.s. exactly what he said he didn't get that from under a cabbage leaf
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:38.880]  in the farmer's garden he didn't get it from mr. mcgregor he got it from a supreme court
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.120]  justice and they go to these conferences and they get briefed on the globalist program
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:51.840]  and they had inducted them all into the globalist compact back in the 50s after world war two
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.680]  for world peace and they got all the big brains on board both parties well now people are realizing
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.000]  globalism isn't good globalism is authoritarian it isn't meant to bring peace it's mean it's
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.160]  meant to bring total control and so there's a rebellion within the system
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:18.480]  but there isn't an opposition without to organize and codify and to be a focal point
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.240]  of what's happening and that's why info wars is so important i go back to that

[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:14.320]  meddling in the project veritas report it's just too unbelievable that they would pull
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:19.680]  something like this off and that trump sits there doing nothing this is so criminal telling congress
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:24.480]  you can pressure us but we're not changing get paul watson's report out ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:32.000]  we can override the big tech because the truth moves slow but once it moves it overpowers lies

[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.000]  incredible but why do they want to silence you know the great part about the internet was the
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.400]  algorithm is just your voting they want to act like it's something fancy when you vote for an
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.000]  article when when when you promote an article when when you click on an article when you share an
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.840]  article it drives up the algorithm in the old system that's all it is the execs want to act
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:05.040]  like oh they've got some magic it's popularity it's it's it's it's the people saying hey this
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.160]  restaurant's better or this airline's better or this doctor's better or this this this vitamin i
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:15.840]  took was better or this drug was better or these jeans fit better or these shoes lasted longer or
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:21.680]  or this national park was better and everybody knows you're pulling a small town you're on a road
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:27.120]  trip i don't ever look at google maps or google restaurants some i see well that restaurant's
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:33.760]  got cars all the way around the block and i might just get my name on the list and do some reading
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.120]  because i want to see why these restaurants have almost nobody had them five six cars at that one
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:43.760]  two or three at that one i bet you get food poisoning at that one but that one with a big
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.800]  line out the door mm i bet that's some good mexican food or some good italian food or some
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.520]  good southern cooking or some good soul food i'm and you know what you're going to like good lord
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:59.120]  this is good but the time the line's too big and you go i'll go over to that place it doesn't
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:06.160]  have anybody in it you get food poisoning i was in waco going to funeral five years ago with my kids
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:16.320]  and i went instead of the place we normally go i went to another place with i'm not going to
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:22.480]  say the name of it i don't want to be mean to him god almighty there were cockroaches big ones
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.320]  running around while we were eating under the table and over the side
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.240]  and this is a place it's been there since the 20s it's it's it's that big roundabout
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.880]  old-fashioned european roundabout like el chico's right here right here's the other place
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  and i mean biggest cockroach i ever saw at least four inches long came out on the table
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.440]  and i killed the bastard and we left and we didn't get any food because we were late for the funeral
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.560]  and that was because el chico's okay it's not even that good but it's decent
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:03.360]  but eating their size little kid to really old change in texas el chico had a line
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.720]  el chico had a line it was an afternoon funeral for my great uncle with the army out there you
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.640]  know shooting the rifles and all the rest of it for his officer's burial they were going to bury
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.880]  him about four and we pulled in there about noon and there was a line we had another three hours
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:25.680]  ago so we ate the other place you know i'm digressing here i'm going into a long story the point is
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:32.080]  is that the old algorithm was what was popular what people like it's not that now it's what they
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:39.920]  make you eat it's what they send you to it's what they make you observe and so that's why
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:48.480]  they're so upset that's why they don't know what to do and in the old days you could say
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.680]  this drug hurt me or this dental office was bad or this place was great
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.720]  but no ladies and gentlemen they're saying with vaccines that are government protected
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:04.960]  liability protected have a secret damage fund and if a mother says her son got brain damage from it
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:10.960]  whether she's right or wrong that mother's got to shut her mouth on facebook in america
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:20.080]  because big pharma doesn't like it lady you're not going to tell us at the elite cafe or wherever
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.640]  you're at that you like it or you hate it that was the place you wake up you're going to shut your
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:32.080]  mouth because it's one thing to have a cockroach run across your table it's another thing to have
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:36.800]  your son have a convulsion and blood come out of his nose and he never talk again and wear diapers
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:45.200]  the rest of his life you know they had the 223 round 556 to wound people in vietnam so they get
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:49.600]  hurt and take more people to take care of them not kill them see that's the same thing with autism
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:56.960]  make you take care of them for 50 years suck all your money out make you buy 100 000 diapers a year
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:06.960]  show that in your face we won't have time to play this whole report because i went off the reservation
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.920]  but uh here's the first part of it with
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.280]  greg rees you know we'll just play it after the break we're gonna break i'm gonna play
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.760]  as we come back from break our phone system is broken today i said i'd take calls that we've got a
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.840]  problem with it that happens sometimes they're rebooting it something put the piece of equipment in
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.200]  sometimes pieces of equipment just aren't there they come up broken or whatever and you just can't
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:43.760]  do it we're working on put the backup system in fast as we can um you know i i i i talk about this
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:49.280]  on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.720]  supplements again that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:58.560]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.640]  they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.680]  good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.560]  down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.920]  are and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere uh you know jones
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:23.040]  shells unapproved supplements uh that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:31.280]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:37.040]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them if you don't have
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.240]  vitamin c you die if you don't have iron on your body you end up dying if you don't have water you
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.120]  end up dying if you don't have sunshine if you don't have oxygen you die it may take 10 years
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.840]  with no sunshine but you die it may take four days with no water but you die it may take three weeks
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:59.840]  or four weeks with no food but you die and if you don't have a whole bunch of minerals and a whole
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:06.160]  bunch of vitamins and in the organic system where you can upload them you will end up getting degenerative
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.920]  diseases quicker than you would have and you will die and all drugs are is the system trying to
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.640]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.600]  they have side effects not with mother nature i mean there are some things in mother nature
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.080]  you take too much of it you'll have a side effect but nothing like big pharma but big pharma doesn't
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:32.880]  want you knowing about god's medicine chest and so they sit there and they demonize us all day long
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:38.000]  when we sell things like ultimate bone broth that's chaga mushroom incredibly concentrated high
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:45.120]  quality turmeric just raw turmeric organic and a bunch of other bee pollen mixed with organic

[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.760]  scoop of what's in ours you can make broth with this you can put it in brownies well i mix it with
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.960]  whey and put some fruit in it and then it tastes great the point is is it's concentrated it's

[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:12.720]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.960]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:22.480]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.400]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.800]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.720]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.600]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.880]  what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.760]  broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.000]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:03.200]  black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth info wars the most banned network in the
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:08.720]  world yours and listeners i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.520]  evil attacks as you've seen but i wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.840]  to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us the last week the
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.600]  worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars you went and looked it up and
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.480]  found out the truth and so i feel very strong and i feel god's hand on my shoulder and i feel your
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.560]  love in my heart and i want you to know that love is right back at you and i want to thank you for
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.480]  all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because i'm
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:40.000]  committed to fight to the end but i want to win and without you i'm going to be destroyed and it's
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.120]  not going to be fun but that's not what's important the enemy could win we're a key chess piece in
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.920]  this fight we're being used by god you're being used by god this is providence so i salute you
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:56.640]  and i thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:07.760]  the world you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.680]  i want to be clear they want to tell mothers and fathers whose children get damaged by vaccines
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:28.880]  who get sick from them that you can't make a consumer report you got to go to a secret court
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:35.280]  sign papers not to talk about it and maybe they'll give you some money so it's an act of defiance
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:40.480]  to sit here and tell the truth that they're putting things in vaccines that they're damaging people
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.840]  and we're not bitching and complaining when people don't care about freedom or care about
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:52.480]  quality or care about corruption you become guatemala or the dominican republic where some
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.480]  estimates are hundreds of thousands of people die a year from poisoned liquor because it's not
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:06.080]  even normal grain alcohol it's industrial wood alcohol and now the numbers are hundreds dead
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:13.200]  they've just been covering it up for years in the dominican republic dying from synthetic crappy
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:18.720]  wood alcohol put in the mini bars where they can charge you five ten dollars for each drink
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:28.320]  and it's got 10 cents of ethanol in it you say why would people do that because the society gives up
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:33.120]  it's like oh let them keep babies alive and sell their organs oh let drag queen story time convicted
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:37.520]  pedophiles come and talk to your kids oh let them give kids the vaccines don't you know don't look
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:44.160]  at the damages of it they want us to give up so here's a powerful report that we really need to
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.880]  get to from greg reese that i hope everybody shares big pharma forced vaccinations and population
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:58.880]  control it's here folks and it's real tyranny the mainstream pop culture narrative tells us to
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:07.440]  trust vaccines and labels individuals who do not as anti-vaxxers but when you look at the history
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:15.760]  of the vaccine industry there are many good reasons to question them in 1986 the national vaccine
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:23.280]  injury compensation program was established to protect the vaccine manufacturers from any liabilities
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:31.360]  this program ensured that the taxpayer would pay for all injuries the public suffered from vaccines
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:39.760]  once this protection was in place government purchasing of vaccines increased by over 300
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:48.880]  percent in 1994 an unelected board of pediatricians was put in charge of determining which vaccines
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:55.360]  would be given to your children all funded by pharmaceutical companies and us taxpayers
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:03.200]  before presidents bush and clinton incentivized the vaccine industry it was about a hundred million
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:09.760]  dollar a year business bill clinton proposed buying up all the vaccines and distributing them
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:17.920]  from a warehouse in new jersey which congress rejected but still thanks to clinton's efforts
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:24.960]  the government now controls every aspect of the vaccine industry an industry that has grown
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:33.520]  accordingly ever since over 600 percent it is expected to be a 60 billion dollar a year business
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:44.000]  by 2020 their profits have grown immensely but what else have they accomplished since 1993
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:52.880]  there have been four measles related deaths now compare this with 483 claims of injury or death
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:51:01.200]  from the measles vaccine the government has settled 4.1 billion dollars in vaccine death
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:09.440]  and injury claims according to a new york times article the tax on each vaccine is determined
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:16.800]  by the predicated rate of serious side effects in other words not only is the consumer a test
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:23.120]  subject for the vaccines but they also pay for any damages sustained from their use
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:31.280]  murk sharp and dome has been fined billions for multiple crimes over the years including fraud
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:38.080]  bribing health care professionals withholding safety information and exaggerated efficacy rates
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:44.400]  and yet thanks to the federal government and taxpayer dollars they continue to thrive
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:54.960]  is it all about money or is there something else to it during a 2010 ted talk bill gape suggested
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:52:04.800]  that vaccines help reduce the population a year later one of his vaccine campaigns caused 47 500
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:12.960]  cases of paralysis and death the india supreme court claim that the drug trials being run by
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:20.480]  the bill and melinda gape's foundation were illegal reducing the population has been suggested
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:30.000]  and supported for years ted turner told autobahn magazine that a total population of 250 to 300
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:38.160]  million people a 95 percent decline from present levels would be ideal this is what the mysterious
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:45.760]  georgia guide stones call for when ut professor eric pianca came under fire for suggesting
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:51.120]  that 90 of us should be killed in order to sustain the earth his students defended him
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:53:00.160]  saying he was being conservative and that everyone should die in 2009 baxter pharmaceuticals was
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:07.040]  caught shipping millions of contaminated swine flu vaccinations to 18 countries the entire
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:16.160]  shipment was contaminated with the live h5 and one avian flu virus if one wanted to create a
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:25.120]  pandemic virus this is one of the easiest ways to do so today mandatory vaccines are being forced
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:32.320]  on children in new york government bills are being proposed to remove religious and philosophical
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:39.520]  exemptions and to exclude unvaccinated children from schools but if you question any of this
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:52.240]  then you are a crazy anti-vaxxer for news wars dot com this is greg rees that is a very powerful
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:58.800]  report that he produced a week ago that fell by the wayside that we never aired but we just did
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:03.920]  i'm going to ask that to be reposted to news wars dot com and why did i say news wars dot com
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:09.760]  because it doesn't get blocked on twitter and facebook and youtube as much as info wars dot com
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.080]  info wars is a great way in public to get people awake but online it's very hard to spread unless
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:20.640]  it's on your email or on your own personal text that's how we win the information war
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:26.000]  that the leftists the globalists are working around the clock try to block us in but sites like
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.960]  news wars dot com sites like prison planet dot com or backup site are excellent ways to get the
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.760]  stuff now i asked paul to post more of our stuff i think i'm the one that encouraged him to start
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:38.560]  his own website he started summit dot news
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.920]  he's like but now i like it my own stuff alex so i'm like yeah but you get around the censors
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.920]  more but they're coming after him but he's got a lot of good articles that are on our sites that
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.320]  get out there as well but now if i kick paul out of the nest and then i'm like come back to the
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.320]  nest sometimes and see papa uh but uh you know that's that's that's happening some
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.360]  so it's all up there u.s holocaust museum denounces aoc's comments on concentration camps and uh
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:13.920]  ilhan incest omar married to her brother said she had three children with him to get into the
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:19.280]  country so she could bitch about it all day like a Somali pirate boarding her ship uh this little pee
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:27.360]  brain uh is really pissed in fact let's play some of that audio uh walnut brain um she's probably
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.040]  even stupider than um somebody like nancy pelosi maybe nancy pelosi stupider i'm not sure she's
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:38.320]  probably a bigger walnut brain she has you'll come out and said what's wrong with the concentration
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:45.920]  camp they're concentrated together concentration camps were invented by the british in most modern
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:52.880]  uh history books in the bore war right at the turn of the 19th century that's not the case
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:56:01.680]  the first concentration camps were deployed by the british in 1775 in virginia
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:06.240]  and they would just take people whole families when their fathers were fighting
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.120]  and they would starve the children and the women and their families to death
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:18.240]  until the men came and gave up and trump's favorite president andrew jackson
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.760]  read the real history books about him it's beyond conan the barbarian but he was super
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:31.040]  skinny that's why they called him old hickory old hickory um his mother and brother died in
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:36.560]  a british concentration camp it was called that he was a runner from the age of 11 to 15
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:42.720]  revolutionary war had his law degree after the war at 19 was a judge by 20 something and of course
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:49.040]  it was a leader in the indian wars after that shot more than 10 times stabbed swords more than 10
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:55.440]  times uh you know five or six duels would bleed to bleed for up to a week with bullet holes
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:02.080]  any wooden die refuses to see doctors yeah old hickory don't make them like that even in the
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:09.840]  scott model anymore so anyways trump a fellow scott and the doichi really likes andrew jackson
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:17.600]  but now you know the rest of the story but here let's go out to break with ilhan arrogantly stomping
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:22.720]  around bitching at the country that brought her here all the welfare she got going oh yeah people
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.360]  come in here that we've got to check who they're with let's show photos of obama era and say they're
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:31.680]  in a concentration camp here it is hi could i get a moment of your time could you tell me do you do
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:40.400]  agree with aoc that ice is running uh concentration camps on the border there are camps and people
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.120]  are being concentrated this is very simple i don't even know why this is a contour this american
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:52.560]  Haiti slug info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:58.720]  the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:05.120]  and i keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:10.720]  captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.040]  thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:20.720]  and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just cripple and so we've
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:25.200]  reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever we have with stood so many of
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:30.000]  their attacks we've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there but
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.720]  let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:40.960]  so we need your prayers your financial support and your word of mouth now at info wars.com it's
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:46.240]  your fight decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:50.880]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:55.520]  hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:00.320]  out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.880]  i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:09.200]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:13.440]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:16.960]  way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:20.800]  friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut

[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:25.760]  talking about algorithmic unfairness that's a term you probably haven't heard before the confidential
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.560]  documents which i have a copy of here and appear in the video and i'm going to read from the document
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:36.720]  it says quote in some cases it may be appropriate to take no action if the system that's google
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:41.120]  accurately affects reality while in other cases it may be desirable to consider how he might help
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:48.320]  society reach a more fair and equitable state via product intervention so these documents show
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:55.680]  algorithmic unfairness the executive named jenai on the secret recording obtained by project veritas
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:03.920]  shows how they want to affect the 2020 election outcome so all these things corroborate each other
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:11.440]  it is a huge story alex an insider whistleblower secret recordings of the executives inside of google
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:19.520]  and the documents and it shows google's efforts to basically uh augment reality and and to quote
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:26.720]  the google documents basically have an impact on the masses to get the agenda they want james when
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.600]  i got up this morning and saw this i nothing gives me butterflies nothing gives me short of breath i
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:36.880]  almost had an anxiety attack on how in the hell am i going to make a big enough deal about this
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:41.120]  and then a text message came in from the producer oh we've got james o' keith i was like i mean because
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.720]  i want to beat these people and we know they've been doing it you've caught them a bunch yourself
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:50.960]  we've caught them they brag about it and now you've got like the holy grail the rosetta stone the
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:56.240]  skeleton key i mean she's on there others are on there just admitting it and this term product
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.360]  intervention sundar is up before congress eight months ago saying we don't intervene in anything
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:08.800]  i mean the perjury alone yeah and one of the things that this jenai jenai who's the head of
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:13.440]  google innovation says you just showed the quote she said that we're not changing congress can
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.160]  pressure us but we're not we don't want to show up we're not changing so the quote i think one of
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.040]  the one of things the insider told me was how amazing there he is they can congress can pressure us
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:29.680]  but we're not changing and she specifically says that liz waran she's i like liz waran but you know
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:37.280]  liz waran has some problems because if they break google up says this jen jenai then small companies
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.160]  won't be able to stop trump but we can we can prevent the neg a big company can prevent trump
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:47.520]  situation where smaller companies cannot so that the issue is alex that the google is classified
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:54.640]  as a uh public platform i understand section 230 back in 60 james o keith the legend
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:01.040]  in the 40 years that i've been in american politics i've never seen a situation with the
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:07.760]  mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters the false claim that
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:15.760]  you purposely sent kitty porn to the sandy hawk plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's a
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:21.680]  smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:28.080]  discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on you this is kafka-esque this is bizarre
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:34.480]  but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say jones sent kitty porn it is really outrageous
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:39.200]  i have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:43.200]  and clarified but i went to where the big boys where's the wall street journal where's
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:48.320]  associated press when are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:54.800]  you was inaccurate so we both need your help and i urge folks to continue to support info wars with
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:13.920]  your dollars from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones now you're
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:20.800]  okay i've been interviewing james okay for 10 years since he blew open acorn
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:28.480]  and i've seen all the devastating victories and then tried to indict him and their failures but
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:34.560]  to sit here and have him have the head of google censorship with this weird or welly
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:39.120]  in name of the office caught in undercover video you realize how hard it is to get this
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:47.840]  to penetrate to infiltrate this is like the allies in 1941 getting the enigma code from the
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:52.880]  nazis okay if congress and the president don't act and then they must be complicit which and we
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:58.400]  know trump isn't but his underlings are bought off by google and keep you know he's not lobbying
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:02.880]  and taking lobbying money but they are this is gone to the president he needs to go mega viral
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:09.280]  it's at drugs report dot com info wars dot com project veritas dot com get it out 25 minute report
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:16.160]  total evidence of google election meddling in 2020 trump must act now reddit blocks project
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:21.680]  veritas group exposes google election meddling insider blows whistle on exec reveals google plan
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:29.200]  to prevent trump situation 2020 they are scared of this this is kryptonite to their fraud so we've
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:33.600]  got we've got eight and a half minutes till we break you got to go you've got the floor
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:38.240]  am i right in saying this is probably the most important thing you've ever broken this is the
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:42.480]  total price far this is by far the biggest thing we ever broke i mean a lot of people are thinking
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:46.560]  what's going to happen well first of all the story just came out i think congress is going to hold
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:51.040]  hearings the lawmakers are telling me sort of here they're texting me we're going to have hearings
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:55.440]  in july but i mean the video is 25 minutes long so i i mean i've only got about eight minutes so
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.520]  let me just try to get through some of the facts here and maybe talk about it i'm i'm not one to
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:03.280]  characterize people i'm just going to quote them okay alex i'm not going to characterize them
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:09.680]  the that man in the shadow you see the insider is a current google employee and one of the things
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:14.160]  he said to me was i was interviewing him he said james people would think this is a conspiracy theory
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:18.720]  if it weren't for the documents and one of the documents he gave me says i'm going to quote them
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:25.360]  this is google not me not you it says it says quote training data are collected and classified
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:30.720]  algorithms are programmed media are filtered ranked aggregated and generated people like us are
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:37.440]  programmed that's a direct quote people like us are programmed and one of the things that this
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:44.160]  executive says is that people who believe with and agree with president trump will not like our
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:48.480]  definition of quote fairness that's gen geni the woman you're looking at right there people who
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:52.080]  voted for the current president do not agree with our definition of fairness so what's interesting
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:59.120]  alex is that google is saying here that they're able to define fairness and this algorithmic
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:04.320]  unfairness and they have product intervention so what the google insider has sat down with me
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:09.760]  and he googled uh hillary clinton's emails that that's just a phrase and you can do it right now
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.640]  at your home computer and it doesn't autocomplete even though millions of people search for that
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.920]  but then he typed in donald trump's emails and it did autocomplete even though very few people
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:26.240]  search for that so google is actually meddling in an election by virtue of defining what is
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.040]  fair and what is not fair and they would never admit this publicly and right now they're in a
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:34.720]  huge world of trouble because that is not a low-level ranking employee that is the head of their
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:40.400]  entire innovation department and she as well as gaurav gite corroborated the google algorithmic
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.880]  unfairness document now alex one thing i must tell you and that's the censorship that's the
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.600]  censorship blueprint she's the head of innovation which is ending the old algorithm what's popular
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.640]  going to censorship i mean you couldn't get better descriptors for the names of the departments if you
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:10:00.160]  went to orwell or the protagonist winston in 1984 who edits out that remember that movie where he
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:04.320]  edits out all the newspaper ministry of truth there's a ministry of life ministry of truth
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:10.480]  i mean did out this is this document's called definition of algorithmic unfairness it's labeled
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.400]  privileged and confidential now many of you are wondering wow these people are real heroes for
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:19.200]  blowing the whistle hell yeah they're heroes they're they make a lot of money and they don't
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:23.760]  care and one of the things he said the man in the in the silhouette there who works for google
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:29.600]  is that i'm nothing but an ant he says i'm just i'm going after goliath here and i said are you
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:33.760]  scared are you frightened he said you know what i hope i get away with it but there are some things
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:37.760]  bigger than me he said this to me beautiful he said there are some things bigger than me and you
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:43.120]  know what's happened in the last few hours i've already had a dozen more people email me and i
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:48.880]  think you're seeing a watershed moment right now right here today as i said you're people
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.920]  are going to come forward alex because they want the people to know what's going on you said it
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:00.720]  james it's not high we're we you can feel the history this is watershed and all the whistleblowers
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:05.360]  it's now just cascading and you look at the arrogance of their head of censorship under
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.560]  this orwellian term and she goes it doesn't matter what congress does well you notice sundar wouldn't
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.680]  even go to congress a year ago and testify and then they gave all the secrets that the pentagon
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:20.480]  had given them to the chinese with their dragonfly operation their censorship office and their ai
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:25.120]  project and then now suddenly they're having to grobble a bit at the executive level but
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:30.560]  still their employees like you said are programmed cult members still carrying this out this is
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:36.000]  incredible their their words not their words not yours they say that they're trying to quote
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.680]  program the people and one of the things that jenai says is the reasons we launched the artificial
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:44.560]  intelligence principles there it is ml fairness is because people were not putting that line in the
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:50.240]  sand that they were not saying what's fair and what's equitable so we're like we're a big company
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:54.480]  we're going to say it so what jenai is saying is don't bust us up elizabeth warren by the way
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:58.160]  i'm actually see what elizabeth warren has to say about this because she's being attacked by this
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:04.480]  google uh executive what they're saying is don't break us up don't get involved antitrust because
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:11.360]  we need to stay the leviathan we need to be large such that we can continue to define what is we
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:15.680]  saying we need to be the big global monopoly to bully these evil conservatives that don't want
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.920]  to sexualize their five-year-olds or open the borders yes she's saying keep us large so that we
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:27.840]  can change the outcome if 2016 happened again would the outcome be i love you guys producer your
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.880]  producers are so fast you pull it up as soon as i'm bringing it up if the algorithms happened again
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:38.240]  would we have a different outcome than 2016 that's the quote and alex i think there's going to be
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:43.120]  hearings as a result of this i think there's going to be whistleblowers i think and i'm really
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:49.680]  since i've known you i don't think you think the dam has broken we sorry go ahead i i really think
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:54.960]  this is the moment that that we have been that we've been waiting for where the heroes amongst us
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:01.360]  because it's one thing alex if i infiltrate or i go undercover this is them this is them giving us
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:06.560]  the information so i'm i'm just really excited and i i know there's going to be more news to break
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.440]  no i remember two years ago you you you brought it out later come out in the news google is more
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.480]  afraid of whistleblowers than anybody and is running in sa level spying on their own people
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.840]  i think what we really yes i think what we really need though is we need people to contact google
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:27.120]  your listeners are what can i do what can i do well other than blow the whistle inside a company
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:33.280]  i think and you can do that by sending us an encrypted email veritas tips at proton mail dot
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.520]  com beautiful but what i think what we need to do is i i think if you just press i think it's uh i
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:43.360]  don't have the email just in front of you but the press office at google we've got to email
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:46.800]  them and get a comment we got to get a statement from google about this we got to get a reaction
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.800]  well they're going to try to cover this up but internally this is going to run through all
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:55.040]  their employees and they know they're in a cult they know it's getting more out of control let's
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.160]  shift the minutes we have left and please come back soon oh you're working very hard james
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:02.960]  will keep it project veritas dot com the audience here can override the ai and that's why you're here
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:07.600]  the audience has to email this facebook at call talk radio call c span call the white house
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:12.640]  trump has to act now on this i mean this like you said congressional hearings coming in july
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:17.440]  you've got congress people calling you obviously senators calling you you have given them the mother
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:23.120]  load this is like al capone being caught you know with his with dead bodies but most people are on
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:27.760]  the take i mean right that that's the whole the new york times is supposed to be no fear or favor
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.880]  the bottom line is most people in this country are either afraid or they are on the take that google
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:38.160]  is such a powerful company i mean most people are afraid that the publisher story about a company that
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:43.360]  can censor and define their income because most distribution happens through the social media
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:48.880]  companies so project veritas does not have any advertisers i can't be boycott i can't be bought
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.240]  or sold i refuse to compromise on my principles i refuse to settle lawsuits alex i've won five
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:59.680]  lawsuits i'll go all the way to a jury verdict which i did and i won and i think that people are

[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:19.120]  listening to the alex jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:27.280]  to you live from the front lines of the info war the reason why i decided to come to project baritas
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:33.440]  is because um people need to know what's actually going on with google there's this decide
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:38.240]  about what they're doing but what they're actually doing what the employees are actually seeing
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:42.960]  inside the company is different the reason we launched our AI principles is because people
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:48.080]  are not putting a line in the sand and they were not saying it's fair exactly so we're like well we
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:53.600]  are a big company we're going to say it it's called soven for the current president do not agree with
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:59.760]  our government they're not objective peace they're not a objective source of information but then
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:07.280]  there are teams uh it's about ML fairness ML fairness it seems like you know you need to be
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:22.240]  solved they are highly biased political machine um that is bent on never letting somebody like
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:28.720]  donald trump come to power again 2020 is certainly on top of my old organization trust the safety
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:33.680]  top of mind they've been working on it since 2016 to make sure we're ready for 2020 this is a
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:38.800]  goliathine but of david trying to say that the emperor has no clothes
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:51.760]  being a small ant i can be crushed and i'm aware of that but this is something that is bigger than
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:57.600]  me this is something that needs to be said to the american public well at least they weren't
[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:03.280]  saying that we should break up google and like i love her but she's very misguided like that will not
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.720]  make it better it'll make it worse because now all these smaller companies who don't have the
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:11.760]  same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next situation it's like a small
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:28.000]  company and it's like
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:36.560]  i like it hey by the way in space no one can hear you scream you can't hear explosions either
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:43.280]  let me tell you something congress at the pentagon that arrogant president of censorship
[02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:49.280]  running her mouth is the final freaking nail because there's things bigger than money in congress
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:52.240]  and little chicken necks running their mouths about steam elections
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:23:00.000]  you're not putting it back together humpy dumpty that's death star destruction level
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.720]  well that doesn't mean we've won the war but we just blew the living snot out of them they've
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:12.880]  tried to indict okieff they've sued him he hasn't backed down and there's all other folks in the
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:18.320]  same boat as us okieff sit and so i admire what he's done and i hope you financially support him
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:22.720]  because he's gone through hell but he loves it he's gotten so much stronger over the years
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:28.800]  he's gotten so much more eloquent and focused just like we have that which does not kill you
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.560]  only makes you stronger if you want to use the analogy of your radio listener you can't see this
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:38.240]  but golem wants the ring he goes after the power he falls into the crack of doom where the ring
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:46.240]  was forged let's show that part back it up and uh boy finally that big old eye blows up
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:58.240]  it is a very very exciting time to be alive and it doesn't mean that there's a lot of evil
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:03.200]  running around it doesn't mean things aren't really bad but the tide is starting to turn
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:11.360]  and the globalist know it and they don't know what to do so that eye when hillary lost said
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:18.400]  oh it's jones but james okieff it's drudge it's it's trump it's his sons it's just no it's people
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:28.240]  not wanting to live under you and you're not going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:36.000]  sweetheart because there's one thing about leftist they are trained at universities that they are the
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.640]  ruling clash and they're going to rule and the minute they try to go out and rule people
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:51.040]  that are auto mechanics and police officers and people that own pool companies or restaurants
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:58.880]  or uh machine factories or farmers or ranchers or the minute they try to go out and rule all
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:04.000]  these people that don't want to rule anybody you're going to find out who knows how to work hard
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.880]  who knows how to overpower you who knows how to infiltrate you we will destroy you politically
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:17.440]  so you better sit there and you better double down let me tell you something all your lies
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:23.840]  at the end of the day have only made us stronger i might like you where i believe in fantasy land
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:29.120]  so if you say the most worst things about me all over every tv station everywhere i walk with my head
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:39.600]  high and i was in downtown austin to see my middle daughter doing a music uh show and i've never
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.320]  shook so many hands or had so many liberals or leftist come up to me and they said i used to hate
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.560]  you but i looked at what you said and found it was truer i saw that latest thing and i was kind of on
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:54.320]  the fence but that's a lie i said it's okay it's all right they have attacked us and lied about us
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:26:03.280]  so much that it just made us stronger and that's this incredible real alchemy they want to lie and
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:09.280]  cheat and steal and do all this stuff to us and they thought we were bullied by them but we were
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:19.200]  asleep and now we're away so it's an incredible time to be alive ladies and gentlemen and you're
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:24.640]  going to see amazing things happen oh antifa says on this big july fourth parade they're going to
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.680]  attack the july fourth parade they're calling for attacking it attacking anyone with american flags
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:36.320]  trumps having a salute to america event outside the white house it's five dollars for each person
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:40.640]  they vowed to attack that and keep anybody from getting into it
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:46.480]  but the media will show the event before it opens and say no one was there just like 2016
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.200]  that wasn't the trump cared about the crowd size which was record he cared about that the whole
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:58.400]  media would lie and show a photo before the gates opened to the to the commons to the monument
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:05.920]  the mall and he was just like they're that bad and it's a process for all of us to go through
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:13.200]  just how bad they are and just how much they'll lie and for them they're on the air saying
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:19.520]  trumps and nazi concentration camps trumps election was like jfk and rfk and mlk being
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:25.600]  killed and and then the lies just get crazier and more ridiculous and more stupid and more insane
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:33.920]  because they don't have any truth they're just the globalists that got put in to sell us out
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:38.720]  the foreign powers but the minute we woke up to that we started putting our own people back in
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:42.800]  doesn't mean they're angels doesn't mean they're perfect you know what they weren't born in bread
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.440]  to piss on the country they weren't born in bread to hate capitalism they weren't born in
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:52.560]  bread to hate somebody else because they had something they were born in bread to end slavery
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.920]  and try to end racism they were born in bread to empower women like nobody else did so the time
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:04.560]  of hating ourselves and being told we're pieces of crap is coming to an end i want to hear some
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.920]  special reports when we come back to the general salutes taken over but yeah we'll play this ill
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:13.280]  hot omar that i've gotten to just the arrogance because she makes up for the fact that she comes
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:17.200]  from a country of slavery where her own people enslave women and she came here illegally and
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:22.400]  married her brother importantly had three children with him and all she's got is her arrogance telling
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:29.600]  you how much you suck all day and how you owe her something i want to break we're coming back with
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.880]  it and then so special reports we've not aired that are so good we gotta air them mean well i
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:41.040]  even get to paul watchers later support on him full wars dot com the pentagon now recognizes
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:48.640]  in cells as 99 of school shooters we broke that years ago and profiled them devil worshiping

[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:08.400]  right now with the save info wars 50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:11.840]  up and stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving

[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:27.200]  this is very simple i don't even know why this is a controversial thing for her to say we have to
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.440]  really truthfully speak about what's taking place and this is why it's really important for us to
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:38.800]  abolish ice and make sure that we have an agency that is accountable to the people that is dealing
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:47.440]  with the situation in a humane way there's no there's no way that we can allow um for kids to
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.080]  be caged uh in in this country this will be caged separated from their families uh and people
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:59.920]  being terrorized in their communities um is it fair to we have to make sure that we are calling
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:06.640]  it out and i am 100 without what a demon what an arrogant inbred demon but inbreeding causes that
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:12.640]  now she's sitting there she has no freedom in her country she's a she's a slave you're kidnapped in
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:19.840]  five minutes women have no rights but she's here telling us that collapsing borders like you fly
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.080]  on an airplane they check your ID she's saying just let everybody in don't even check them but again
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:28.560]  the senate report washington poset meant a third of the kids aren't even with their parents many
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:35.280]  sex slaves but she just says let them all in what a monstrous pig what a monstrous creature
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:42.080]  but there's biden he says it's time for that physical revolution or let's start a real physical
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:47.040]  revolution if you're talking about it because we have to be able to change what we're doing
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:51.440]  within our system and then you've got the city council woman a few weeks ago just kind of elected
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:58.480]  denver another aoc prototype saying by any means necessary which means violence now here it is
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:05.200]  i i don't believe that our current economic system actually works um hit pause again oh i get it
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:09.600]  a crony capitalist system is bad enough you want communism where a bunch of elites run everything
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:15.920]  and everybody starves to death like venezuela or cuba i think our system sucks we need to do good
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:20.560]  here to go here let's go back to her i don't believe that our current economic system actually
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:26.960]  works um capitalism by design is extractive and in order to generate pause start over again
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:38.160]  then capitalism is extractive any political or economic system is extractive
[02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:40.560]  think about that
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:45.520]  like communist countries have the worst environmental standards or anybody
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:50.640]  but notice the communist protesters the green protesters they don't want coal plants shut down
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:57.920]  in china they want them shut down in germany or here because it's cheap fuel but bernie sanders says
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:08.240]  white people do not know what it's like to be poor even never had a job in his life
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:14.800]  except swindling universities and multimillion dollar homes and hundred thousand dollar sports cars
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:24.800]  so let's go back to to um to the lady the new city council lady in demba i don't believe that
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:31.360]  our current economic system actually works um capitalism by design is extractive and in order
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:37.920]  to generate profit in a capitalist system something has to be exploited that's land labor or resources
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.880]  and pause again just listen to her spewing when our universities teaches the big banks want failure
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:49.040]  the big mega corporations want you to be an idiot so she is like oh the exploit is bad i mean just
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:54.000]  listen to this as if communism and things don't make someone's being exploited
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:02.480]  and she just rattles this crap off like oh yes ma'am look teach us teach us how it works because
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:07.520]  in communist systems they don't elect people dumbass they have pollut bureaus the ruling party puts
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:17.600]  their lackeys in forever that's exploitive chacovara called hispanics in mexico cockroaches
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:22.960]  because they wouldn't be communist and communalize and leave their pieces of property he goes oh these
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.440]  horrible things read his quotes about mexicans oh these stupid mexicans these little dumb cockroaches
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:32.400]  they won't give up their land either they're like 50 acres and and communalize and let us take over
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:37.760]  yeah they wouldn't let you sit over them and execute them and do whatever they want and you got pissed off
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:43.040]  because you're shea guvara we're supposed oh my god shea guvara you're so cool looking
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:50.640]  so let's hear from this dumb as a box of bricks lady here she is we're in late phase capitalism
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:55.520]  and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move into something new oh yeah i believe in community
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:02.000]  ownership of land labor resources and distribution of those resources and so whatever that morphs
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:08.720]  into i think is what will serve community the best and i'm excited to usher it in it by any means
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:20.880]  necessary that little she's thinking about me me me me enemies of certain i know you have the
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:31.600]  bloodlust my darling and uh you can't talk to her you can't talk to her can't talk to her
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:42.160]  you have to accept the state as your lord and savior very very sad this is with the lefts running
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:48.320]  plenty of young smart hispanic women who are conservative or christian or at least
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:53.840]  nationalist but oh no no no no we've got to find people brainwash to all make it racial
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:42:01.040]  and then run these individuals who are so pissed that they thought to get here so they can overturn
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:07.680]  it as big mega banks like google google has a bank set off shore and prepare our downfall

[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:06.160]  model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:10.560]  by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:16.320]  only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:22.000]  here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.320]  that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:30.720]  audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.120]  audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:39.120]  that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.400]  ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.800]  choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:53.760]  democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free

[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:29.920]  civilization what do they know that we don't know well we actually do know normal cell phone radiation
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:36.720]  from the towers and the phones causes massive brain tumors massive breakage of dna we've been
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:42.720]  spending years covering all that it's a fact here's wire magazine 5g smartphones cause cancer big
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.600]  wireless doesn't want you to know mind control by cell phone scientific american and then they
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:51.200]  can put over different wavelengths to actually control your brain with the carrier whether it's

[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:04.240]  of 5g 5g danger hundreds of respected scientists sound the alarm about health effects of 5g networks

[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:19.840]  one one millionth of the knowledge i'm seriously but but imagine it's a lot of knowledge isn't it
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:27.520]  so how would they release a bio weapon and be safe from it how would they have 5g that gives you
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:32.720]  cancer or resonates with certain viruses to actually make them replicate and turn off your
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.720]  immune system that's in major studies and under nick megachon and others about the hundreds of
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:43.360]  patents from an article that was originally in a russian journal called orientier military journal
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.400]  and what it talked about and and was later absolutely supported in mainstream reports
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:55.520]  within the united states and academic studies was the idea that any electromagnetic carrier any system
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:03.040]  that can carry a signal can carry a sub signal a signal on it that allows you to manipulate the
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:09.840]  behavior of people within contact of that signal now what can be used is the internet telephone
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:17.120]  radio networks power grids any of the things that that essentially carry a part of the
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:22.240]  electromagnetic spectrum that you can manipulate you're doing an emergency operation to save the
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:26.800]  earth from humans and so they've got to all get rich and powerful and dumb us down and turn us
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:31.440]  against each other and destroy new technologies and clean technologies no no the truth is they're
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:38.480]  just sabotaging things and taking over i later learned that the silicon valley crowd is running
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:47.040]  to hawaii hawaii where the most secretive pentagon nsa super weapons space-based weapons are
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:52.080]  directed from again they're building fortresses there and that's come out the news and i mean
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:57.840]  underground bases i mean rocks that pop up and have you know huge double 50 caliber guns at them
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:03.760]  i'm talking about drone attack helicopters i've talked to folks in kawaii that have worked on them
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:10.400]  i got told by a high-level government individual and then i got told by a major hollywood
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:18.720]  producer within a month of each other i ought to move to west virginia 14 000 square miles
[02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:24.880]  no technology allowed but nasa bases and it turns out they've got a couple of these in canada
[02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:30.480]  in northern canada right before the arctic circle they're building air bases helicopter
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:36.560]  bases all of it and you read and you study that all these ultra rich people are moving
[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:42.160]  into the area and they have been for decades it's all these breakaway scientific projects
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:48.480]  that are overlapping that are buildings towards some larger in game and they're going from beta
[02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:56.160]  test now to operational and all of it kills people but kills you slowly or you never know
[02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:19.520]  what hit you there's a big plan and we ain't it it's a woman's body and she should not be forced
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:24.960]  to carry anything inside of it you wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm that had a heartbeat so you're
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:40.480]  comparing a baby to a tapeworm a fetus is a parasite what are you guys out here for um i'm
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:47.600]  out here to get rights for everybody who needs them so who do you think needs the rights the most
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:54.800]  anybody with the uterus anyone with the uterus okay so what about the unborn babies in the
[02:52:54.800 --> 02:53:04.400]  womb they have uteruses believe it or not like female babies in the womb have uteruses so you
[02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:09.440]  said anyone that has a uterus should have rights yes but they are not breathing living human beings
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:19.040]  yet so well they're hearts beating doesn't that count for living it's not a heartbeat it's cells
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:24.880]  vibrating at what point is it not just cells vibrating i don't know i'm not a medical doctor but
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:31.120]  it's not at six weeks okay so do you think that babies should be allowed to be aborted up until
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:35.920]  whenever they believe their fetuses and it's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry
[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:40.960]  anything inside of it you wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm that has a heartbeat so you're
[02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:47.680]  comparing a baby to a tapeworm a fetus is a parasite sweetie wow don't you think that's kind of cold
[02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:52.320]  and callous to think that one callous is to shove your fingers inside somebody she's with any
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:54:02.480]  organization so let's stop talking to them okay animals get killed yeah they're living and breathing
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:09.120]  okay so what about the rights of human beings though should human rights should you know human
[02:54:09.120 --> 02:54:15.520]  rights matter they they can't even they're so small they can't even think do you do you remember
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:20.480]  back to when you were that young well some women are saying we should have abortion like she just
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:26.960]  said at any time in the pregnancy even up until the day before i don't agree with that whatever's
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:33.600]  best for that woman should be that woman's choice it should not be no government's choice it should
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:39.360]  be up to that woman so that baby can survive on its own outside the womb in the third trimester
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:44.800]  we're having a hard time hearing yet it's okay to kill it she's gonna have to you know give birth
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:50.160]  to it anyway why give birth to a dead baby when you can let it live can you go over that way oh
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:56.160]  don't touch me ma'am don't touch me this is a public area i'm allowed to be here this is where
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:04.080]  we're here okay okay all right i'm being pushed right now you don't have a right to touch me it's
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:11.440]  my body my choice this is my body the baby in the womb is not your body we are fighting for
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:17.040]  except work we're concerned about the baby's body that isn't your dna it's not your body
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:26.480]  it's not their body no it's not it's not their body it's their body that is your body this is
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:32.560]  my body i'm talking about the baby in the belly is not their body that is not their it's not their
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.160]  dna it's a fetus okay so i have a question don't pay no attention to her so why do women that have
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:43.360]  rh negative blood have to get shots so that they don't reject the baby because they have different
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:48.160]  blood types that's their choice because it's a different dna it's a different body it's still
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:54.000]  their choice still their body it's a different we're talking out here and people are you know
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:01.600]  you're actually kind of interrupting this okay so go away well you guys are talking about interrupting
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:07.360]  the lives of unborn babies no ma'am i was raped and i am not going to be forced to have my rapist
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:13.280]  child i would have killed myself many women would have killed themselves you want death rape is the
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:18.000]  small majority no it doesn't matter and you know what it's a very small fraction even you think
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  it's largely they think you need to go you need to go you need to go no one's judging people
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.240]  that were raped we're having dialogue about what limitations there should be
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:39.520]  people are getting really upset right now i'm just trying to ask people questions on what the
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:44.320]  limitations are you know if you're gonna hold a belief people should be allowed to ask you
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:53.200]  questions about the the you know the ideas you're holding yeah people are just kind of coming up
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:57.280]  pushing me putting their hands on me i'm just trying to do interviews and ask questions and people
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:03.760]  are uh not happy with uh i guess you get in the way of us having i'm not i'm not interrupting them
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:09.120]  i'm literally not you don't mind if you're here it's fine but like we could we couldn't hear the
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:14.400]  speakers and so if like if you could go to that side of the crowd we don't we don't mind that
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:18.960]  you're here we just don't want you to interrupt the program is that okay yeah i'm listening to the
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:23.840]  program and i'm participating in the program out here with you guys so i'm just asking people
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:29.440]  questions as to why you believe what you believe because if you guys want to have your message
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:33.280]  out there to people you're gonna have to make convincing arguments to convince people to
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:39.120]  support the beliefs that you want i'm not trying to get into it with you i'm just asking if you
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:47.200]  could move to that side of the podium let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:51.840]  thanks for holding hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.400]  of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.880]  with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:05.280]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:10.000]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.600]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:17.280]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying
[02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:22.240]  to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:26.080]  you're 80 years old i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:31.840]  shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:36.720]  like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even

[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:31.840]  great and need your support so what's going on well you know i've been on saying this for years
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:42.080]  i've been buying gold since 1978 it was a youth not quite but pretty young and here's the deal
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:56.640]  as we're speaking now gold is over 1400 an ounce on june 6th this year a couple of weeks ago what
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:13.040]  happened well we sent out a trend alert the gold bull run and gold is running it's gone up over 25
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:27.040]  percent since we sent out that trend alert that trend alert it's big and here's what's going on all
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:38.240]  around the world what they're doing is giving us more monetary methadone to shoot into the
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:46.480]  systems of the central banks is a global slowdown
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:57.680]  the global slowdown is real you look at the numbers coming out of germany
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:07.680]  you're looking at an economy growing about 0.6 percent oh you just came out with some business
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:14.960]  confidence levels they weigh down look what's going on over there in india
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:23.200]  you just came out with a study they're fabricating how much the government is growing over there the
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:32.320]  gdp it's way below what they say it is what else oh everybody australia oh yeah they lower
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:41.600]  interest rates too to keep propping up the economy it's a global slowdown it has nothing
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:48.880]  to do with trade wars and tariffs that's a lot of baloney the trade wars and tariffs has
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:03:00.080]  equaled almost nothing so what's slowing it down economic fundamentals it was cheap money to boost
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:07.040]  at it following a great recession in 2009 when they started pumping their dough in
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:15.840]  and they just mean more cheap money so that's what's driving gold prices up because the lower
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:22.960]  the value where the currencies go the higher the value of gold and you read the reports coming out
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:30.480]  you know last year the central banks bought more gold than they did in 50 years that's right
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:38.000]  and now china the world's number two economy they're buying up more gold too and of course russia
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:46.240]  and kazakhstan and his stand and adstand and stand around the block he's buying it too because people
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:54.320]  are looking for a safe haven asset and then there's what's going on in the middle east and that's real
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:04:03.760]  too the oil prices i've been saying this go to a hundred dollars a barrel kiss the global economy
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:15.360]  goodbye and also his those equity markets goodbye so gold i said and been saying this for nearly
[03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:27.280]  six years in a mon record gold had a break over $1385 an ounce to gain strength and it's broken
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:42.640]  past that now the next breakout point is $1450 and it's not far from that there's a lot more to
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:49.680]  know about this and when i come back we're going to talk more about it and meanwhile don't forget to
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:58.880]  buy those products info info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:04.560]  attack the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's biblical it's it's authoritarian it's
[03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:11.680]  insane and i keep trying to judge engage when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as
[03:05:11.680 --> 03:05:17.440]  the captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:21.760]  thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products
[03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:27.360]  and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just cripple and so we've
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:31.840]  reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever we have with stood so many of
[03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:36.720]  their attacks we've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there but
[03:05:36.720 --> 03:05:41.360]  let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault

[03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:53.200]  of shots right now because get a little tired i need some energy
[03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:06.320]  anyway so really the mainstream media is worthless worthless look at the tragedy going
[03:07:06.320 --> 03:07:12.320]  over there in yemen he asked most american people what do you think about what's going on in yemen
[03:07:13.120 --> 03:07:21.440]  they'll say what's a yemen it's a country the worst humanitarian crisis on earth
[03:07:24.640 --> 03:07:32.720]  launched by saudi arabia our ally oh they're great the democracy of saudi arabia wonderful
[03:07:32.720 --> 03:07:38.480]  how many people that they'd be head yesterday you know oh the women there they have all the
[03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:48.080]  rights in the world it was the me too movement over there what hypocrisy media doesn't cover any of
[03:07:48.080 --> 03:07:58.640]  it nothing so support info wars and of course the transjournal transjournal dot com going back to
[03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:08.640]  gold this is important it's very important gold is the signal of what the future is going to look
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:20.640]  like the higher gold goes the lower the future of the economy and equity markets look the higher
[03:08:20.640 --> 03:08:33.200]  gold prices the lowest stock prices the higher gold prices the lower gdp growth and gdp growth as i
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:39.600]  was mentioning earlier is slowing down around the world matter of fact the world bank just degraded
[03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:47.520]  gdp growth again and again and again and again and again and again imf look what's going on there
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:56.560]  in austria in uh argentina oh they got wonderful time going over on there they only have a 23
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:09:04.880]  percent unemployment rate and they brought in that guy macree and the chicago cats would have
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:11.760]  economic geniuses i tells you yeah from that milton freedman school of bs
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:19.280]  bs yeah they only have about 60 percent inflation rate
[03:09:21.360 --> 03:09:27.120]  and then you look what's going on in venezuela brazil heading back into recession
[03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:38.240]  south africa want to go to the congo how about sudan take a trip to algeria
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:51.920]  one country after another going down the lower they go the higher gold goes i do not give financial
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:58.400]  advice i'm a trend forecaster i'm not telling you to do anything think for yourself i just put the
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:06.400]  facts out there so this is important because i've been negative on gold now for six years
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:15.760]  and we are the only magazine in the world you could look it up june 6 to trend alert to all
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:24.320]  our subscribers and even our x subscribers telling them this is the beginning of the gold bull run
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:31.200]  the downside risk of gold as we see it is only around
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:42.640]  $1,270 that's not a big downside in the futures markets so again think for yourself
[03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:51.920]  what do we got here today well here's the financial times us steps up to ron warnings
[03:10:51.920 --> 03:11:00.800]  as it prepares to unveil fresh sanctions as you know it's not who i like who i dislike it's what
[03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:12.080]  it is i support trump 100 on the border issues as i say i want to referendum on borders put it
[03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:19.440]  on the ballot yes i want to bring in more illegal immigrants and i am willing to pay this amount
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:27.200]  of money for each one coming in you can take it out of my paycheck no i do not want more immigrants
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:35.360]  coming in i will pay this amount of money in taxes to secure the borders so let the people vote
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:44.000]  number two i support trump on the trade war issue but i have a different outlook i don't want tariffs
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:49.280]  i say put back in place the laws that used to exist before bill clinton sold us out
[03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:52.960]  with naftan bringing china into the world trade organization
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:58.480]  i'm totally against what's going on in venezuela
[03:11:58.480 --> 03:12:06.560]  the only thing that i liked that obama did was the nuclear deal with venezuela
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:17.600]  that's about it the rest of obama folks was that he kept fokin us with his bs did a lovely job in
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:25.120]  libya over there destroying the most prosperous nation in the middle east i gotta tell you that
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:31.920]  a sod over there in syria he has to go to and we'll take those geodist islamic fundamentalists
[03:12:31.920 --> 03:12:40.480]  that we use to overthrow libya and then we'll send him to syria but we'll call them freedom fighters
[03:12:42.080 --> 03:12:49.600]  everything that's got bailed out the banks one lot you know folks first day when he went into
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:59.680]  office we're gonna close guantanamo within a year folks so anyway folks folks folks folks folks
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:10.080]  folk folk folk it's all he did was focus so i agreed with obama what he did with iran i
[03:13:10.080 --> 03:13:16.640]  disagree with trump is doing with iran because i wrote about this in the trends journal was
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:23.600]  the top trend for 2018 market shock mass murder united states israel and saudi arabia going after
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:30.640]  iran if they attack iran if this war breaks out you're gonna see oil prices spiked to above
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:35.920]  a hundred dollars a barrel as i said and it'll bring back down the global economy and iran's not
[03:13:35.920 --> 03:13:42.480]  fighting syria it's not fighting libya it's not fighting iraq you saw how they took out that
[03:13:42.480 --> 03:13:47.280]  depending on whose numbers you look at that drone that cost about 200 million dollars
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:53.200]  and i think it was way up there the straits of horror moves aren't that wide
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:14:01.760]  missiles going in bababoon these are the persians they've been around a long time
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:08.720]  and they're not going anywhere like them or not but i gerald salenti believe in the founding father
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:17.600]  it and the founding fathers say no foreign entanglements beginning with a man that really
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:23.760]  knew how to fight not these little boys called el presidente of los estados and needles who
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:31.760]  couldn't fight the way they have a paper bag is george washington yeah yeah washington you know
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:42.960]  you know yeah that washington of course in the delaware fighting no foreign entanglement
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:50.880]  so the sanctions that are going on to iran and what they're doing in venezuela this is economic
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:15:04.160]  warfare and i'm against it mind your own business stay at home 200 million bucks and the drone shot
[03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:13.440]  down and you still can't drink the water in flint michigan oh and on friday over here in new york
[03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:21.840]  to penn station shut down for a while penn station yeah without a third world rail
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:30.800]  so i want the money to stay in america so this story about what they're doing
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:35.440]  more sanctions very serious
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:39.440]  back in a little bit

[03:17:56.240 --> 03:18:00.720]  rolling hey alec yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:05.360]  people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:10.080]  these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:14.880]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:19.360]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i
[03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:23.280]  think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree
[03:18:23.280 --> 03:18:27.280]  entirely and the last thing i just want to say alec is i know they're trying to shut you down but
[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:32.240]  the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love
[03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:36.640]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into
[03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:42.160]  this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who
[03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:46.480]  are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the input war and even if something does happen
[03:18:46.480 --> 03:18:51.760]  to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank
[03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:58.960]  you sir for calling info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented
[03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:04.640]  attack the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's biblical it's it's authoritarian it's
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:11.760]  insane and i keep trying to judge engage when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:17.520]  the captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and
[03:19:17.520 --> 03:19:21.840]  thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products

[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:32.000]  reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever we have with stood so many of
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:36.800]  their attacks we've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there but
[03:19:36.800 --> 03:19:41.520]  let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault
[03:19:41.520 --> 03:19:47.600]  so we need your prayers your financial support and your word of mouth now at info wars core.com
[03:19:47.600 --> 03:19:53.040]  it's your fight decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down
[03:19:53.040 --> 03:20:08.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:13.680 --> 03:20:21.760]  waging war on corruption it's gerald salente you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:21.760 --> 03:20:28.320]  it's getting it's on hey great being here on the alex jones show and listen to what alex just said
[03:20:29.360 --> 03:20:35.520]  if you don't buy the products bye bye you need money to keep these things going
[03:20:36.640 --> 03:20:41.600]  just like we needed to transjournal here we need more subscribers we get the more we can do
[03:20:42.320 --> 03:20:47.360]  the more you buy from info wars the more they can do and they have great products that i believe
[03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:53.920]  in or else i wouldn't say what i'm saying matter of fact when you get the transjournal
[03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:59.280]  there's no advertising in it i don't support anybody so when i talk about gold for example
[03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:04.560]  i don't have gold companies you know paying the freight here we have subscription things
[03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:12.080]  so going back to what i was talking about with war you know there's a saying that generals are
[03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:21.840]  always fighting the last war back in 2000 was brought over to virginia military vmi
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:28.720]  junior military institute to talk about new millennium warfare come out with my book trans 2000
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:40.960]  these f-35s these aircraft carriers aircraft carriers yesterday's battleships
[03:21:42.800 --> 03:21:48.720]  well this laser technology it's a whole new world cyber warfare
[03:21:51.040 --> 03:21:52.480]  it's a whole different gang
[03:21:52.480 --> 03:22:06.080]  not only that poison the systems terrorism like we haven't seen before
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:17.280]  the only way to a safe future for me is peace and prosperity the more we spend here the more we
[03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:25.760]  make so going back to what i was saying about with trump with the trade wars it's very important
[03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:33.840]  so 96 percent of all the clothing that we're wearing comes from overseas there's a little
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:40.640]  story here today in z financial times this is what i do every day and i go through the stories and i
[03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:49.120]  outline the salient points of them there's one over here well first before we get there let's
[03:22:49.120 --> 03:22:57.920]  start over here ethiopia hit by regional coup attempt oh before i mentioned sudan and then we go to
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:23:04.480]  the congo wonderful times going over there in algeria molly hey how about going there for
[03:23:04.480 --> 03:23:11.280]  vacation maybe niger is the place for you it's one destabilized area after another
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:20.720]  let's put it all together ah jihadi threats spreading across west africa togo leader warns
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:30.080]  all right you got a refugee crisis over there in um migrant crisis in europe
[03:23:30.080 --> 03:23:40.800]  where are they coming from ethiopia erotria where else oh congo south africa
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:43.760]  sudan
[03:23:46.240 --> 03:23:57.120]  iraq yemen afghanistan one war after another but you know when the really refugee crisis
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:05.760]  is the migrant crisis started to change the face of europe 2011 nobody talks about this of
[03:24:05.760 --> 03:24:13.520]  course we do because we wrote about it as it happened in our transjournal mohmer kadafi the leader
[03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:25.600]  of libya warned as the united states france uk the arab league back by nato
[03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:34.800]  you know well overthrowing him he warned the europeans that when he goes migrants and refugees
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:41.840]  come over to europe and that's when it all happened and you remember hillary clinton can't
[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:46.640]  understand why she lost that election must have been the russians not because people couldn't stand
[03:24:46.640 --> 03:24:55.600]  her it had nothing to do with it now she's on with cbs and they ask her how did you feel when you
[03:24:55.600 --> 03:25:07.600]  found out omar kadafi was murdered we came we saw he died he can't figure out why hitlery lost
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:17.520]  the russians did it going back i was talking about trade and what's going on
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:25.840]  in the hypocrisy of war when i was a young man the vietnam war was going on
[03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:34.160]  we gotta stop them commies they says we let those commies go into vietnam dominoes are
[03:25:34.160 --> 03:25:39.920]  gonna keep falling and all across asia before you know they're gonna have to show us a california
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:43.200]  i'm not making that up that was the crap they were telling us
[03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:54.480]  now still a communist country but it's okay to do business with them
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:26:02.960]  vietnam reaps awards of us tariffs on china big story
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:12.800]  us imports in vietnam surged nearly 40 percent in the first four months of this year compared
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:21.280]  to the same period last year overall during the same period us imports from china felt
[03:26:21.280 --> 03:26:28.480]  13 percent the second largest contraction since 2009 uh 2009 why did it contract
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:37.280]  a great recession why is it contracting now not trade wars and tariffs it's cheaper labor
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:42.000]  you got companies going from china
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:53.040]  uh getting their stuff made of vietnam because the labor is cheaper but the hypocrisy of these

[03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:10.480]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government
[03:32:10.480 --> 03:32:16.320]  it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the
[03:32:16.320 --> 03:32:20.960]  expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned
[03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:25.600]  with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just
[03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:29.680]  like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era
[03:32:29.680 --> 03:32:33.680]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've
[03:32:33.680 --> 03:32:39.040]  been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or
[03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:43.760]  hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the

[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:47.840]  if you want to read history before it happens i was talking before about gold and why gold prices
[03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:55.360]  are going up they're going up because all around the world the economies are going down and they're
[03:34:55.360 --> 03:35:05.120]  making their money more cheaper here's a story again in the financial times feeble lift the
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:13.600]  eurozone raises prospects of future stimulus economic conditions the business in the eurozone
[03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:22.480]  showed only modest signs of improvement in june manufacturing hard hit by global economic uncertainty
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:37.920]  continued to repeat a fall in activity levels today you got it this is important the ihs
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:53.040]  market purchasing managers index it's only at 51.8 may anything below 50 is called contraction
[03:35:54.880 --> 03:36:03.600]  the eurozone economy remains stuck in low gear said eduardo campanella an economist with
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:14.720]  unicredit why am i making a point of this stimulus stimulus as i say they didn't teach you this in
[03:36:14.720 --> 03:36:25.040]  economics 101 a graduate school quantitative easing negative interest rates the german bond
[03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:39.440]  the french french bond are all 10 year bonds are now in negative yields that means you buy it and
[03:36:39.440 --> 03:36:45.440]  in 10 years you get less than what you bought it for can't make this stuff up and you know what
[03:36:45.440 --> 03:36:53.680]  they're doing same in japan what they're doing is they're buying up their own bonds corporate
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:37:07.280]  government and the japanese head of the central bank also announced more stimulus going back to
[03:37:07.280 --> 03:37:15.520]  gold they're devaluing the currency so here's a story also in the financial times dollar set to
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:24.480]  lose its luster as feds dovish stance conspires with g20 talks against the greenback here it is
[03:37:25.920 --> 03:37:30.160]  oh so the lowering interest rates the dollar is going to get cheaper right and it is
[03:37:31.280 --> 03:37:39.280]  but what are you going to buy a euro with more stimulus they dumped in nearly three trillion
[03:37:39.280 --> 03:37:46.320]  dollars a quantitative easing did nothing oh by the way it only announced they're going to have a
[03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:50.720]  bigger budget deficit they don't care about what brussel says because they've got to pump their
[03:37:50.720 --> 03:37:57.280]  economy up so the more these countries devalue their currency and i want to keep going over this
[03:37:58.400 --> 03:38:02.560]  the higher gold prices are going to go i mentioned
[03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:11.360]  in argentina before suppose you live in argentina you're seeing inflation skyrocket by the way you
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:17.280]  know what the interest rate is about 60 percent so who's borrowing money nobody
[03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:23.920]  and they're doing that high interest rate because this stop inflation so if you have
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:35.840]  argentinian peso and you bought gold a while ago when it was way down and now your peso is
[03:38:35.840 --> 03:38:41.840]  way down and gold is way up gold is that a six-year high now that's why i'm talking about it the way
[03:38:41.840 --> 03:38:49.680]  it is it's spiked to a six-year high like that what would you rather have your peso a gold
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:55.600]  if you live in venezuela where they got an inflation rate of a couple of million percent
[03:38:56.800 --> 03:39:00.320]  and i'm not making that up will you rather have bolivars
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:11.280]  or gold look what's going on over there in turkey they just had another election over there
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:16.320]  they have to earn a win call for another election in istanbul
[03:39:16.320 --> 03:39:24.000]  and the guy that they said who really lost he won bigger and you know why
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:31.920]  because turkish economy is going down you want to hold that turkish leader or do you want to buy
[03:39:31.920 --> 03:39:39.440]  gold that's why gold is going up it's all over the world the economies are going down
[03:39:40.560 --> 03:39:42.640]  and they're going to do anything they can to pump them up
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:48.720]  he's stabilization everywhere name the country
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:58.560]  huge prog protests turn up heat on babis to quit as the check prime minister
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:07.920]  hundreds of thousands of checks rallied in prog yesterday to call for the resignation of prime
[03:40:07.920 --> 03:40:20.240]  minister babis in the largest protests in central european country since the collapse of communism
[03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:27.920]  in 1989 look what's going on over there in hong kong
[03:40:30.080 --> 03:40:36.320]  two million people taken to the streets in a place where they got what about seven and a half million
[03:40:36.320 --> 03:40:45.280]  people the united states didn't get anybody protesting they had a big you know that pink hat
[03:40:45.280 --> 03:40:52.000]  thing remember a couple of years ago million people turned out all over the country with 320
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:57.840]  million people they go out for one day go down to washington mall they take the bus back and that's
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:07.040]  the end of it 1989 you know what happened in 1989 the berlin wall fell you know why because the
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:12.480]  people went out and protested and then more came and they stayed and more came and they stayed
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:16.640]  and more came and they stayed in america you just stay at home
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:26.960]  where you go on social media now no fight in this country that's why we got freaks and
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:36.640]  fools in charge in a city state and government near you who's your favorite freak diane not so
[03:41:36.640 --> 03:41:44.160]  feinstein or little lindsay graham now i know you like chuckie schumer and nitch mcconnell's
[03:41:44.160 --> 03:41:51.920]  your kind of guy look at the freaks and fools running and ruining our lives no protests
[03:41:51.920 --> 03:42:02.400]  steal our dough give it to the bigs the one percent that get to the 0.1 percent as they
[03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:09.520]  keep getting more and more dough as all we become are workers on the global multinational
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:14.560]  plantation of slave landia so it's up to the people to change this around
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:23.760]  and you're in charge so are you gonna sit back and do nothing
[03:42:26.080 --> 03:42:30.320]  don't forget to vote don't wait are you gonna vote i'm not gonna vote for these freaks
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:46.720]  we need a new party in a new way and you can make it happen but remember support info here
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:57.680]  in the 40 years that i've been in american politics i've never seen a situation with the
[03:42:57.680 --> 03:43:04.400]  mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters the false claim that
[03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:12.400]  you purposely sent kitty porn to the sandy hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's a
[03:43:12.400 --> 03:43:18.320]  smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the
[03:43:18.320 --> 03:43:24.720]  discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on you this is kafka-esque this is bizarre
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:31.120]  but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous
[03:43:31.120 --> 03:43:35.840]  i have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:40.640]  and clarified but i wonder where the big boys where's the wall street journal where's associated
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:45.920]  press when are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was
[03:43:45.920 --> 03:43:51.680]  inaccurate so we both need your help and i urge folks to continue to support info wars with your
[03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:57.520]  dollars only very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the season of war
[03:43:57.520 --> 03:44:02.160]  and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have do their criminal activity
[03:44:02.160 --> 03:44:07.360]  in their and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year
[03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:11.840]  we need to in here we need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that i am
[03:44:11.840 --> 03:44:16.640]  going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm loving every minute of this because i know
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:21.520]  i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically i'm banging heads with them
[03:44:21.520 --> 03:44:25.840]  and they can't help but attack back with lies that just brings more people here so i'm in one hell
[03:44:25.840 --> 03:44:32.000]  of a fight so are you and i need war bonds i need gas i need ammo politically now but literally if
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:35.760]  you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:39.680]  word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong message to the
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:43.600]  enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks
[03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:48.080]  are failing and that you will stand with us and i will never back down you have my commitment this
[03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:52.320]  only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this
[03:44:54.480 --> 03:44:59.600]  info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:05.760]  the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane
[03:45:05.760 --> 03:45:12.080]  and i keep trying to judge engage when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[03:45:12.080 --> 03:45:17.760]  captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and
[03:45:17.760 --> 03:45:22.080]  thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products

[03:49:04.720 --> 03:49:08.400]  and of course the trends journal the trends journal if you want to know history before it
[03:49:08.400 --> 03:49:15.120]  happens we're talking before about what happened when the refugee crisis and how it's worsening
[03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:25.120]  and it's only going to get much worse number of refugees is soaring to records that's right
[03:49:27.440 --> 03:49:34.960]  the number of people fleeing violence is the highest recorded since world war two
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:44.080]  and this is according to the united nations the global population of people displaced by conflict
[03:49:44.080 --> 03:49:54.720]  reached 70.8 million people last year you ready for this you're ready up
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:50:08.000]  from a little over 43 million a decade ago around 80 percent of the world's refugees
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:20.320]  have been living in exile for five years wars they didn't have this problem before 9 11
[03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:28.880]  and then they gave us the afghan war you don't like that one how about the iraq war i got a
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:39.840]  libyan war that you'll just love you like that one i got a syrian war for you over 10 million syrians
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:48.320]  have been displaced about five million of them left the country was a very prosperous place at one
[03:50:48.320 --> 03:50:59.040]  time and a great tourist destination gone but nobody talks about the wars that were causing
[03:50:59.040 --> 03:51:08.720]  the migrant immigration problem you know before i was talking about the wars and how we were taught
[03:51:08.720 --> 03:51:18.480]  to hate the commies i want to make this clear how we're listening to stupid ignorant people
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:27.040]  most of our life i told you when i was a kid the guffatine kin incident we didn't know it was a lie
[03:51:28.320 --> 03:51:35.440]  the reason they had protests back then was because they had to draft now they don't have the draft
[03:51:35.440 --> 03:51:44.240]  so no protest now remember i'm a little kid in grammar school and we got to hate them russians
[03:51:44.880 --> 03:51:51.920]  all right so they had air raid drills they had us hiding on the desks
[03:51:54.800 --> 03:52:03.600]  frightened out of your mind siren all right go under your desk you had adults these are called
[03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:10.240]  teachers you want to know why the new the the education in this country stinks because if it
[03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:17.520]  was worth anything you'd think we'd be in these problems if we had educated people these are the
[03:52:17.520 --> 03:52:26.560]  morons that got kids going under the desk because they were stupid enough to believe the bs
[03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:36.080]  bs and then they tell you if you see a flare don't look at it i'm not making this up
[03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:45.920]  you see a flare don't look at it your dust oh no i was saved because i was hiding under the desk

[03:54:00.480 --> 03:54:06.080]  direct democracy and we could do it we could do it with blockchain democracy
[03:54:06.080 --> 03:54:14.160]  and blockchain democracy means if you could send banks could send trillions of dollars around the
[03:54:14.160 --> 03:54:21.520]  world to pop up pop up pop up and once the transaction is made it's blocked we could have
[03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:27.200]  blockchain voting you could vote on your computer you can vote off your phone oh they'll hack it oh
[03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:33.520]  yeah like the system we have now is so great they still got them hanging chads down there in Florida

[03:58:51.760 --> 03:58:56.480]  york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that
[03:58:56.480 --> 03:59:01.360]  the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[03:59:01.360 --> 03:59:06.320]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean
[03:59:06.320 --> 03:59:10.000]  if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[03:59:10.000 --> 03:59:14.000]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the
