[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:44.960]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for
[00:44.960 --> 00:52.640]  joining us it of course is Wednesday the 27th day of July 2011 we have an
[00:52.640 --> 00:58.480]  absolutely power-packed transmission for you today unfortunately everything
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.640]  that we've been predicting for more than 16 years is now coming to fruition open
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.800]  world government run by the private banking cartel that has taken over
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.760]  every major sovereign nation on earth but a few third-world countries and
[01:14.760 --> 01:18.840]  old-world nations that they're busy mopping up those are known as rogue
[01:18.840 --> 01:22.640]  nations doesn't even mean those are good countries either people tend to think
[01:22.640 --> 01:27.600]  either the West is good or the East is bad or Gaddafi's good and we're bad or
[01:27.600 --> 01:33.840]  we're good he's bad no there there are no more countries they're ceremonial now
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.360]  we have to be honest about globalism and how much sovereignty we've lost if
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.640]  we're ever going to set about getting it you know people talk about oh my gosh
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.480]  Russia today was founded with Russian government money of course it was of
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.840]  course it's got an agenda but the issue is then people say well our media is
[01:54.840 --> 02:00.720]  American our media is pro-america no it's not our media is predominantly
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.440]  European banker owned and run and it has an anti-family anti-gun anti-freedom
[02:06.440 --> 02:13.160]  anti-sovereignty agenda but they wrap that agenda in the American flag but
[02:13.160 --> 02:18.880]  they are globalist so the issue is you can look at all these different news
[02:18.880 --> 02:23.640]  channels all these different competing English news channels globally that's
[02:23.640 --> 02:28.320]  being done because more and more of the 21st century war is done through
[02:28.320 --> 02:34.720]  information I am someone who simply wants freedom I am someone who simply
[02:34.720 --> 02:42.680]  wants my constitutional republic back I am an American I am a constitutionalist
[02:42.680 --> 02:49.200]  and the people running our country are diametrically opposed to that and our
[02:49.200 --> 02:57.320]  enemies of our republic so just like when you watch Al Jazeera you know that
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.480]  that's got a Middle Eastern bent or when you watch BBC it's the British Royal
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.880]  House and those big banking interests it's that's their perspective but when
[03:06.880 --> 03:13.320]  you watch MSNBC it is the policies of the private Federal Reserve it's hijacked
[03:13.320 --> 03:20.080]  this country it is alien it is anti-america and it's that realization
[03:20.080 --> 03:26.280]  that needs to get out there to people okay it's very simple you know at the
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.480]  end of the day if you research this information there are very few interest
[03:30.480 --> 03:35.960]  out there in media that actually stand for the republic who actually stand for
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.600]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution they'll discuss any issue in the world
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.880]  but the fact that the government is out of control and illegitimate they'll
[03:44.880 --> 03:47.920]  bring you a left-wing perspective a right-wing perspective they'll bring you
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.960]  even libertarian perspectives but if you don't admit how fraudulent the entire
[03:52.960 --> 03:59.440]  system is you have no hope of assessing the true magnitude and then making
[03:59.440 --> 04:06.280]  preparations to face it but when people really wake up to the off-the-charts
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.760]  corruption we do have a chance of reversing things but it takes a full
[04:10.760 --> 04:20.480]  wake up it takes a total across the board deep deep deep wake up that's what
[04:20.480 --> 04:24.160]  we're talking about here on this broadcast now Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.920]  former head of the Treasury is really an expert on this whole debt limit
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.880]  situation and he's called it as we've called it this is all a maneuver to
[04:32.880 --> 04:36.400]  train the public to have the power of the purse taken from Congress and given
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.720]  to the president and from the Congress of this new super Congress we're gonna
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.800]  be discussing that also the big developments on the fast and furious
[04:45.800 --> 04:52.880]  perjury by the Attorney General this is big a lot of key news on a human slash
[04:52.880 --> 04:58.720]  animal a hybrid clones the economy it's all coming up
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.720]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:05.720 --> 05:11.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.800]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[05:14.800 --> 05:19.280]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.560]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[05:24.560 --> 05:29.120]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.800]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.840]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.480]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.560]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[05:46.560 --> 05:53.000]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars

[08:19.760 --> 08:28.880]  it is Wednesday the 27th day of July 2011 we're gonna be here live for the
[08:28.880 --> 08:33.160]  next three hours dr. Paul Crick Roberts former head of policy at the
[08:33.160 --> 08:37.960]  Department of Treasury will be joining us to talk about the open moves to
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.400]  transfer the power of the purse from the Congress to the president and how
[08:43.400 --> 08:47.480]  we're basically being trained through this whole debt-sealing debate that our
[08:47.480 --> 08:52.800]  fortunes rise and fall according to the private central banks that have
[08:52.800 --> 08:59.120]  maneuvered this country into total economic bondage and servitude to the
[08:59.120 --> 09:05.960]  fraud that have initiated the derivatives global meltdown black hole bubble so
[09:05.960 --> 09:08.760]  we're gonna be going over that with dr. Paul Crick Roberts coming up about an
[09:08.760 --> 09:14.960]  hour and a half from now I want to open the phones up because again I rarely can
[09:14.960 --> 09:19.520]  control myself and actually go to calls early in the broadcast but I'm going to
[09:19.520 --> 09:23.720]  do it today I'm going to do it I'm not going to try and fail I'm going to do
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.200]  it but first before I give the number out I'm gonna spend this segment just
[09:28.200 --> 09:33.040]  going over the top news today with brief analysis and comment and then
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.560]  throughout the broadcast going back into each section of this news in greater
[09:37.560 --> 09:45.000]  detail first off we've got a big report coming out later in the day that I'm
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.840]  going to premiere here in the third hour for radio listeners will also posted
[09:50.840 --> 09:56.960]  after the show at info wars dot com a detailed report dealing with just how
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.960]  far along the system is with not just human clones yes they admit yes the
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.320]  government's been secretly cloning humans most major governments the
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.720]  Chinese the Australians the British the US and that's been going on for 20
[10:11.720 --> 10:16.680]  years in fact I thought it was 20 Aaron found Time Life books admitting with
[10:16.680 --> 10:24.960]  incredible photos of human embryos in artificial wombs in Time Life books in
[10:24.960 --> 10:31.160]  the 70s so our research for this piece has completely and totally blown me away
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.600]  a lot of people hear this show and they think oh man this guy is exaggerating
[10:35.600 --> 10:41.280]  this guy is you know saying things are worse than it is I'm gonna be honest
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.240]  with you I don't consciously lie to people here on air but I have really
[10:47.240 --> 10:53.640]  analyzed myself and to be honest with you I I subconsciously water things down
[10:53.640 --> 11:01.080]  because I know that people aren't going to be able to handle the full magnitude
[11:01.080 --> 11:05.560]  and so I'm here to tell you that nine times out of ten
[11:05.560 --> 11:11.400]  conservatively when it all comes out in the wash things are much worse than I
[11:11.400 --> 11:17.760]  even say okay let's get that clear and I didn't know that the clone business and
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.640]  the human embryos being grown up to very large size in these Time Life photos
[11:22.640 --> 11:26.320]  they're very proud of it they admit it's eugenics they say they're going to end
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.680]  human reproductive activity that the medical system is going to take control
[11:30.680 --> 11:33.920]  of it they're already doing that with cesarean section and other things that
[11:33.920 --> 11:37.160]  we're now half women in the US are having children with cesarean they're
[11:37.160 --> 11:40.960]  taking the normal birth process away women not breastfeeding you know going
[11:40.960 --> 11:44.720]  to the formula that's half corn syrup they're already removing us from our
[11:44.720 --> 11:50.280]  normal state the brain cc size is reducing because of the lack of
[11:50.280 --> 11:56.240]  nutrition fertility across the world is plunging this has been designed but to
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.800]  see it in Time Life books in the 70s here's a pig embryo that we're keeping
[12:01.800 --> 12:07.320]  alive with an artificial placenta feeding it and here's a human and it's a
[12:07.320 --> 12:13.000]  pretty good size baby in the artificial womb now I've been told about this by
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.920]  scientists but it was classified so they wouldn't come on the air and they said
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.920]  it's pretty freaky to watch the babies trying to nurse and I mean they're
[12:21.920 --> 12:24.800]  slaves they have no rights they're they're being tested on till they die
[12:24.800 --> 12:32.520]  and and these are crimes that are beyond Joseph Mingola and it's just going on
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.040]  and that's the way it is and now they think we're so psychologically bankrupt
[12:38.040 --> 12:43.480]  and so psychologically blind spiritually blind that we can now just be
[12:43.480 --> 12:48.120]  told about it oh in one lab the British government authorized it secretly
[12:48.120 --> 12:55.200]  to have a 150 plus part human part animal part reptile part insect creatures
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.200]  and we're implanting the creatures and cow uteruses and growing them up and
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.720]  harvesting their organs it's no big deal and folks are like oh it's so trendy
[13:03.720 --> 13:08.920]  but you take a monkey and and slice its brain open and put microchips in it oh
[13:08.920 --> 13:14.640]  when people firebomb your facility if you do that but it's like oh you're
[13:14.640 --> 13:21.120]  doing it to humans yeah humans are trash humans are scum I mean that's why for
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.720]  decades they've been caught radiating children to death in government
[13:24.720 --> 13:27.960]  experiments that's why they've been caught well see I'm already getting into
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.000]  it I said third hour I'm getting into this in the third hour today the toll
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.960]  free number well let me give you the news first and then I'll get the number
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.160]  out you can call in about whatever you want or ask if I you know work for the
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.800]  Easter Bunny or whatever it is just that I really want to try to focus in on
[13:42.800 --> 13:48.800]  issues here and actually talk about the real world and not just obsess over
[13:48.800 --> 13:53.080]  Alex Jones that's my one pet peeve because I'm desperately trying to get
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.400]  all these new listeners on these AM and FM stations that are tuning in to
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.880]  realize what's really happening in the world and you know I also don't want a
[13:59.880 --> 14:03.080]  bunch of calls today and we don't screen your calls but I'm not gonna
[14:03.080 --> 14:07.840]  entertain these issues about info wars.com having problems I believe me I
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.400]  know about it every time we do updates to different word press plug-ins and
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.920]  things because we're on multiple CDNs and caching servers and things because the
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.720]  sites are big it causes problems and I've spent a lot of money and a lot of
[14:23.720 --> 14:28.320]  consultants and a lot of time and I believe me I know about the problems
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.840]  with info wars.com that's why we have prison planet.com and that's why we
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.320]  have prison planet.tv and other auxiliary sites is because over the years you
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.080]  know sometimes we have problems we've got to have other platforms when one is
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.080]  having problems to get information out so yes I do know about it we've been
[14:46.080 --> 14:49.840]  flooded with phone calls and emails and I'm glad you're concerned believe me I'm
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.480]  concerned I was up late last night working on it I was up at 6 a.m. the
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.880]  day working on it a lot of my IT people have not slept and we it's up right now
[14:57.880 --> 15:02.720]  but it said it's having all sorts of weird problems and believe me we're
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.320]  trying to fix it at info wars.com but we right now prison planet.com cross our
[15:07.320 --> 15:15.720]  fingers is going off without a hitch right now okay okay I've already digressed
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.520]  off into GM human animal hybrids emerging market for organs babies and big
[15:20.520 --> 15:26.240]  farm up and Aaron Dykes has a prelude report out on info wars.com and
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.080]  prison planet.com that deals with that right now but again the big report
[15:31.080 --> 15:37.160]  coming up in the third hour and this affects so many issues of human rights
[15:37.160 --> 15:44.160]  and super viruses that this is giving rise to and just so many issues I want
[15:44.160 --> 15:48.480]  to get into and the fact that this isn't an issue with most people that most
[15:48.480 --> 15:52.560]  people think oh that's the Raylian cult they lied five years ago about making
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.440]  human clones and the media gave that attention knowing that governments and
[15:56.440 --> 16:02.760]  corporations were creating clones poor humans with no rights it just shows how
[16:02.760 --> 16:06.680]  we're all seen as animals all seen as body parts and we need to start standing
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.560]  up for ourselves standing up for dignity I'm not a number I'm not an animal
[16:10.560 --> 16:14.840]  don't treat me like one don't forcibly drug me with cancer causing sodium
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.640]  fluoride don't GMO design the crops to reduce fertility and increase cancer I
[16:19.640 --> 16:23.960]  mean there is a holocaust going on of soft kill the Nazis would take you to a
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.640]  slave camp and work you to death and put fluoride in the water to make you
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.400]  docile and the Soviets would do that as well now they just brainwash you through
[16:33.400 --> 16:38.320]  the TV and the culture poison to the water and the food then when you get
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.920]  sick they come in and suck all the money out of you with their deadly toxic
[16:41.920 --> 16:46.280]  drugs this is cold-blooded and the average doctor is compartmentalized it
[16:46.280 --> 16:49.960]  doesn't understand this but we have reverse engineered it we have their
[16:49.960 --> 16:53.840]  documents we have their statements we have their plans and don't think you
[16:53.840 --> 16:59.000]  ever know it all because I shot two days ago this video that's gonna premiere
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.560]  today here on the TV radio show and I thought the cloning was admitted 20
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.360]  years ago 15 years ago they admitted that five years before they were
[17:08.360 --> 17:12.760]  creating human clones but that it was highly classified and they wouldn't give
[17:12.760 --> 17:18.040]  details a decade ago I learned about human clones brought to term that are
[17:18.040 --> 17:24.120]  part chimpanzee okay this is in the mainline scientific literature but now
[17:24.120 --> 17:28.160]  I learned this was going on in the 70s this gets more and more insane by the
[17:28.160 --> 17:34.040]  minute so I don't know everything you know people all the time call me on air
[17:34.040 --> 17:37.800]  and they say why aren't you covering this why aren't you covering that well a
[17:37.800 --> 17:45.440]  lot of times either a you didn't hear me cover it or b I'm not aware of it I'm
[17:45.440 --> 17:51.320]  not omnipresent I have far from it I need your help okay just because you
[17:51.320 --> 17:54.480]  know about this stuff doesn't mean your neighbor does people don't learn about
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.640]  this stuff through osmosis and we've got to reach the public and show them how
[17:59.640 --> 18:04.880]  important all of this is and how serious all of this information is please it's
[18:04.880 --> 18:12.120]  it's incredible now a smattering of some of the other news this is so big this is
[18:12.120 --> 18:17.080]  out of cyber news service it's also in Reuters White House Stafford knew about
[18:17.080 --> 18:21.520]  gun running operation last fall now we've already confirmed the head of the
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.360]  ATF's confirmed that the Attorney General has perjured himself to Congress
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.080]  three separate times saying that they do nothing about the program ladies and
[18:30.080 --> 18:34.160]  gentlemen it wasn't just the ATF it was the FBI and DEA involved and it wasn't
[18:34.160 --> 18:37.400]  just guns to Mexico by the tens of thousands that have killed three board
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.280]  of patrol agents and five cops now confirmed and a lot of citizens on
[18:41.280 --> 18:46.680]  both sides more people die a year in Mexico and on the US border then died a
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.360]  year in Vietnam at the height of it that's confirmed 30 plus thousand the last
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.920]  three years thousands of them cops in Mexico it is unbelievable and this is
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.560]  about the big banks that have been caught laundering the hundreds of
[19:00.560 --> 19:05.600]  billions of dollars will Covia Wells Fargo and others I remember six years
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.360]  ago when they gave billions of dollars the US government did to the Mexican
[19:09.360 --> 19:12.400]  government to quote fight the drug cartels and they trained Los Zetas at
[19:12.400 --> 19:15.920]  US bases like Fort Benning Georgia and sent them down there and we told you
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.560]  this what happened now they've caught the Justice Department shipping guns
[19:19.560 --> 19:25.400]  into Miami and shipping guns into Illinois and shipping guns into LA to
[19:25.400 --> 19:29.840]  gangs that work for the government that go then wipe out the rival gangs that
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.680]  aren't laundering their money with the US banks and then they've got the caveat
[19:34.680 --> 19:42.360]  of staging this this this crime wave of terror and fear and then saying we've
[19:42.360 --> 19:47.960]  got to have gun control and even though they got caught staging all this you
[19:47.960 --> 19:51.000]  know they got caught staging it they're still going ahead with the gun
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.040]  control because of it and now another top ATF agent William Newell has gone
[19:55.040 --> 19:59.240]  public saying no the Justice Department gave us orders directly Obama needs to

[24:37.080 --> 24:44.760]  service White House staffer knew about gun running operation last fall at least
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.880]  one person in the White House knew about the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.880]  firearms and explosives gun running operation three months before weapons
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.400]  from the botch sting was not botched it was that they tell you it was to track
[24:57.400 --> 25:03.360]  guns they're arming all the major gangs that are paying them their cut and it's
[25:03.360 --> 25:07.840]  to blame the Second Amendment that's what a high-ranking ATF official told
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.720]  Congress on Tuesday William Newell the former ATF agent in charge of the
[25:13.720 --> 25:16.840]  Phoenix Field Office told the House oversight and government reform
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.360]  committee that he communicated with Kevin O'Reilly a staffer on President
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.160]  Obama's National Security Council about Operation Fast and Furious in September
[25:26.160 --> 25:33.800]  of 2010 more than six months before the news broke oh they didn't know folks the
[25:33.800 --> 25:38.600]  Congress is whitewashing this they're not going after the confirmed reports
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.600]  that are out there in Miami and other areas where they're shipping guns to
[25:43.600 --> 25:47.120]  gangs there and the shipping amount of the country this is like Iran Contra
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.520]  where the CIA was shipping drugs in and then shipping guns out to control the
[25:51.520 --> 25:58.960]  the the drug supply on the ground in Nicaragua in Colombia in other areas of
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.920]  Central and South America that all came out in Congress in the Iran Contra
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.920]  hearings by that time at least 1,000 guns straw purchases in the US have been
[26:08.920 --> 26:13.320]  transferred to Mexican criminals well yeah now they found mayors in New Mexico
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.640]  cities and other areas involved with the police this is all a big business under
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.080]  the nose of ATF officials who intended but failed to track them to see where
[26:22.080 --> 26:25.360]  they ended up yeah sure first ATF said that you're nothing about it and said
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.520]  our agents are lying you don't want to go along with this when cops started
[26:28.520 --> 26:31.440]  getting killed then it turned out they ordered the gun shops to do it had
[26:31.440 --> 26:35.200]  cameras surveilling it and then helped get them across the border of course they
[26:35.200 --> 26:40.160]  did this is only the tip of the iceberg here and it shows you how criminal they
[26:40.160 --> 26:45.840]  are the Attorney General the President they all clearly ordered this you've
[26:45.840 --> 26:52.000]  got three agencies ATF FBI DEA all involved inside the United States as
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.480]  well it's total criminality out in the open just like Henry Paulson three and
[26:59.480 --> 27:05.040]  a half years ago back in October of 2008 testifying in Congress and the
[27:05.040 --> 27:10.160]  House member were bringing up they said who gave you the waiver to give
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.640]  yourself 200 plus million dollars of the bailout money you gave hundreds of
[27:14.640 --> 27:17.920]  billions to Goldman Sachs and then you gave yourself the former director of
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.400]  Goldman Sachs you gave yourself 200 plus million dollars who gave you the
[27:22.400 --> 27:26.000]  waiver and he started coughing and turned red and couldn't hardly talk
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.240]  couldn't believe they dare call out his real criminal activity he was like
[27:30.240 --> 27:34.280]  you're not allowed to do this to me and he said I gave myself a waiver and they
[27:34.280 --> 27:41.760]  said really so again they're open criminals it's illegal for the head of
[27:41.760 --> 27:44.680]  the Treasury to give themselves 200 million dollars of bailout money
[27:44.680 --> 27:50.000]  directly to his own bank account and if people can't figure that out then I can't
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.040]  help you and they're just out in the open yeah we ship the guns into Mexico to
[27:54.040 --> 27:57.360]  then blame the Second Amendment we're gonna go ahead and do it and outside of
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.960]  law the ATF is now ordering gun shops all over the Southwest from Texas to
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.840]  California to report rifles they sell people well they already know it's
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.000]  being reported they just say you've got to call us yourself even though it's
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.640]  going to the FBI Nick system and people say well that doesn't sound too bad well
[28:13.640 --> 28:19.480]  why do they want it reported because it's outside of law there's no law they're
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.760]  just saying you call us when you sell somebody a rifle and then they use that
[28:24.760 --> 28:28.240]  report and I've talked people in my office and I've talked to friends who
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.680]  get ATF and FBI visits I'm talking about retired veterans and people with no
[28:32.680 --> 28:36.440]  criminal record they go why did you buy two AR-15s they go I'm a gun
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.920]  enthusiast and they were on sale and I'm a gun collector well why are you here at
[28:40.920 --> 28:43.960]  my house and they're now going to people's houses that buy more than a
[28:43.960 --> 28:47.560]  thousand rounds of ammo people like well why do you buy that well that's how
[28:47.560 --> 28:52.360]  you get half off and if you go out and shoot a lot it's easy to shoot a thousand

[34:04.920 --> 34:09.920]  ship the cocaine into the United States and that came out in 86 it came out
[34:09.920 --> 34:15.080]  again in 96 when they had other congressional hearings on it well this
[34:15.080 --> 34:20.680]  is going on but now in the US they're given guns to the drug gangs that's
[34:20.680 --> 34:29.240]  come out in Florida and Illinois and they are lying about it to Congress I
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.280]  mean this makes Richard Nixon look like a choir boy compared to what Barack
[34:34.280 --> 34:39.040]  Obama's done it shows I'll never forget that letter that went public where his
[34:39.040 --> 34:45.760]  cousin Odinga had lost the Prime Minister ship run he's a Muslim the
[34:45.760 --> 34:51.400]  minority there in Kenya and Obama sent him a letter this is public on Senate
[34:51.400 --> 34:56.480]  letterhead saying instigate riots and demand that since you didn't win the
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.520]  presidency they create a Prime Minister ship for you and they did I mean this
[35:01.520 --> 35:06.840]  is a hardcore criminal and you know I talk about Obama being a puppet he is a
[35:06.840 --> 35:11.040]  puppet who reads off a teleprompter and does what he's told but he himself is
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.600]  just is just ruthless and very cunning and very willing to break the law and
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.880]  it you know it's scary to get up here and call for their indictment because
[35:21.880 --> 35:26.520]  these are gangsters I mean these are Al Capone's I mean look at the Chicago mob
[35:26.520 --> 35:30.920]  look at the mob boss a manual I mean his dad was the head of the Israeli
[35:30.920 --> 35:37.280]  air gun blowing up hotels and killing civilians these are terrorist these are
[35:37.280 --> 35:41.680]  terrorist criminal mafia people and we're in a lot of trouble man that they
[35:41.680 --> 35:45.280]  run the country they run the purse strings they've stolen working with the
[35:45.280 --> 35:52.080]  Republican leadership with Bush in total synergy since Bush left office 27
[35:52.080 --> 35:55.400]  trillion and growing we haven't gotten a new number in a year and they've
[35:55.400 --> 35:58.640]  committed so many crimes that they're not gonna stop you know when they get
[35:58.640 --> 36:01.960]  caught shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment they don't
[36:01.960 --> 36:06.040]  care if they got caught they don't care that they've been caught perjuring
[36:06.040 --> 36:11.600]  themselves but they can't stop us all standing up and admitting who they are
[36:11.600 --> 36:15.880]  now the truth is the government's been corrupt for a long time we just now are
[36:15.880 --> 36:20.400]  learning how corrupted is and so they're saying yeah we don't care came out a
[36:20.400 --> 36:24.280]  year ago that they take all the death benefits of troops from World War II
[36:24.280 --> 36:28.160]  through current you you take money out of your check put it in life insurance
[36:28.160 --> 36:34.080]  deal through the military with the big insurance companies when you die they
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.280]  use some paperwork manipulations and steal your money and the US government
[36:39.280 --> 36:46.600]  agreed 12 years ago secretly to allow that these are hard core criminals and
[36:46.600 --> 36:50.360]  again they might as well go for broke they've already committed so many
[36:50.360 --> 36:54.040]  felonies it's like if you've already are on the run for robbing a bank and
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.840]  killing a cop why not rob 20 other banks that's why police say once somebody's
[36:59.840 --> 37:06.200]  fleeing for capital murder they're the most dangerous type of fugitive because
[37:06.200 --> 37:11.800]  they don't care they've already killed one cop well the Obama administration's
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.800]  killed five cops and three border patrol with these guns they don't care they've
[37:16.800 --> 37:21.160]  already committed so many crimes they don't care they don't care they're
[37:21.160 --> 37:25.480]  armed and dangerous with our nuclear weapons they've got control of the
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.560]  Treasury they've already stolen all the death benefits of the troops you down a
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.520]  car correct I cancer dive a brain tumor whatever it is you're 55 years old you're
[37:34.520 --> 37:39.480]  a veteran your wife doesn't get jack squad and they don't care and by the way
[37:39.480 --> 37:42.560]  they hope you get mad and go attack a government building because they've
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.360]  already told all the feds that retired military is gonna attack you and they've
[37:46.360 --> 37:50.160]  done things that they know we're gonna cause you to go postal and when you go
[37:50.160 --> 37:53.840]  postal they're gonna target all the veterans Bill Clinton signed a deal it
[37:53.840 --> 37:59.560]  never got implemented to not let vets own guns remember that these people are
[37:59.560 --> 38:07.280]  gangster criminals all right I said I go to your calls gold strikes new high new
[38:07.280 --> 38:12.240]  record high on us default fears and the United States is now dictated to by
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.560]  ratings agencies US credit rating rides on s&p London view of politics on
[38:17.560 --> 38:21.880]  Capitol Hill they it's the same banks that have that put their people into
[38:21.880 --> 38:28.800]  the head of Moody's and s&p and others the big three rating agencies who then
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.880]  have maneuvered us and they say go deeper into debt to the private bankers go
[38:32.880 --> 38:38.720]  deeper into debt and we will not say that you're bankrupt well the Chinese
[38:38.720 --> 38:41.760]  already aren't buying our debt the Arabs aren't everybody already knows we've
[38:41.760 --> 38:47.480]  already defaulted through through inflation through devaluation of currencies
[38:47.480 --> 38:51.640]  they already know and so the only people that haven't gotten the message is
[38:51.640 --> 38:55.480]  the American people it's why gold and oil is going up it's why food prices are
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.320]  going up it's why they're telling police departments and fire departments and
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.760]  unions okay give us half your pension and then maybe you'll get the other half I
[39:03.760 --> 39:08.680]  told you this is a program they're carrying out
[39:08.680 --> 39:14.520]  I'll continuing here US credit rating rides on s&p London view of politics on
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.880]  Capitol Hill Obama strikes fear into Americans while reassuring big banks he
[39:19.880 --> 39:23.640]  says hey don't worry you you know and again they're just getting us ready for
[39:23.640 --> 39:29.200]  debt default and they're implying that oh we defaulted it went bankrupt because
[39:29.200 --> 39:32.480]  we didn't give the bankers enough money not because the bankers created this
[39:32.480 --> 39:38.480]  fractional reserve banking fraudulent system so we've got that also another
[39:38.480 --> 39:42.160]  chilling sign I meant to get to yesterday you notice George Soros is
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.920]  getting out of holding people's money he's returned people's money and the
[39:47.920 --> 39:52.480]  head of Tyco's done that and and the heads of a bunch of these big brokerage
[39:52.480 --> 39:57.520]  firms have been returning people's money in the last six months saying we're
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.000]  getting out we're still privately gonna do some stuff individually but we're not
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.240]  managing your money anymore another big sign Soros to close quantum funds to
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.080]  outsiders well yeah because they're the insiders the Soros gets direct banker
[40:12.080 --> 40:19.680]  bailout money so does MSNBC so I'm going to your calls I wanted to just right

[43:01.240 --> 43:06.320]  Libya situation also that they wanted to come on at the time but I hadn't
[43:06.320 --> 43:14.680]  researched enough a few months ago to have them on they're both famous rock
[43:14.680 --> 43:18.840]  stars who became Christians and world that they at least got the article it's
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.680]  up at rudge report dot com right now Rachel Maddow MSNBC sued for defamation
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.000]  and they called me at the time and said we did not say execute homosexuals and
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.200]  that's not true and we've asked for them to retract and I said look I I haven't
[43:32.200 --> 43:36.240]  looked into this so I need to and then I meant to look into it and then forgot
[43:36.240 --> 43:41.520]  and never looked into it well now I've looked into it and MSNBC refused to
[43:41.520 --> 43:46.560]  issue a retraction and they filed a $50 million lawsuit against MSNBC and
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.280]  Rachel Maddow and so we're gonna get them to pop in on the show today or
[43:50.280 --> 43:55.800]  tomorrow this is big national news they are Genesis radio talk show host and
[43:55.800 --> 43:59.440]  reportedly they gave a prayer at the opening of the Minnesota Legislature and
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.760]  so that freaked out MSNBC so they made stuff up and it wouldn't be the last
[44:04.760 --> 44:10.400]  time or the first time I've had MSNBC edit what I've said to make it sound
[44:10.400 --> 44:14.640]  like on their rise of the right special that I was calling for violence and they
[44:14.640 --> 44:20.200]  said Ron Paul was too but I don't have time for lawsuits I'm not saying it's
[44:20.200 --> 44:24.480]  bad that they're suing them I just don't like lawsuits I just really don't like
[44:24.480 --> 44:29.280]  lawsuits but at a certain point what are you gonna do when Vanity Fair for the
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.240]  White House comes out and says that WorldNet Daily has pulled their book
[44:33.240 --> 44:37.520]  off the shelf where's the birth certificate and it destroyed sales as it
[44:37.520 --> 44:41.280]  was meant to do and that Joseph Fair had come out and renounced the book and
[44:41.280 --> 44:45.640]  said money back guarantee for the published price that means you know they
[44:45.640 --> 44:50.800]  sell the book for six dollars to a big big bookstore they sell it for 20 that's
[44:50.800 --> 44:53.200]  about how it works in the publishing business and they're saying oh we'll
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.560]  give you 20 back I mean that is designed to ruin WorldNet Daily and you and
[44:58.560 --> 45:01.640]  just like I'm against Rupert Murdoch and his dirty tricks in England well what
[45:01.640 --> 45:06.240]  about media matter saying in memos get hired at conservative and libertarian
[45:06.240 --> 45:10.120]  outfits like Fox News and they didn't mention the others that we know we're
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.960]  it get it get in their offices sabotage them destroy them I mean that's
[45:14.960 --> 45:20.040]  criminal that's hardcore felonies and so I guess this is what you got to do to
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.160]  MSNBC but they don't care I mean they're funded by hundreds of millions in
[45:24.160 --> 45:27.840]  bank or bailout money they'll just pay you with their own tax dollars back
[45:27.840 --> 45:31.960]  that's why they're so ruthless okay let's go to calls Frank in Indiana then
[45:31.960 --> 45:35.760]  Jonathan Steve Ezekiel Dan and others you're on the air I've covered some of
[45:35.760 --> 45:40.520]  the news what did you call in about today I wanted to call in and talk about the

[47:26.480 --> 47:30.600]  officers saw cops being killed so blew the whistle then the White House lied
[47:30.600 --> 47:34.320]  and said you weren't ordered to do this and now they've been caught lying but
[47:34.320 --> 47:39.400]  but but going back to fast and furious here it isn't that Americans are zombies

[51:02.480 --> 51:07.240]  GCN self-reliance update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for
[51:07.240 --> 51:10.640]  garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective
[51:10.640 --> 51:14.000]  at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.840]  like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best
[51:17.840 --> 51:21.400]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance proto grows unique blend
[51:21.400 --> 51:24.800]  of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[51:24.800 --> 51:28.640]  bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by
[51:28.640 --> 51:31.920]  providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic
[51:31.920 --> 51:35.000]  code for nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.880]  fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to ten
[51:37.880 --> 51:41.240]  times the nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of
[51:41.240 --> 51:44.920]  herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with
[51:44.920 --> 51:48.800]  non-hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods

[52:00.520 --> 52:03.880]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[52:03.880 --> 52:07.840]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[52:07.840 --> 52:12.080]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[52:12.080 --> 52:16.360]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[52:16.360 --> 52:20.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[52:20.720 --> 52:24.800]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[52:24.800 --> 52:29.360]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[52:29.360 --> 52:33.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[52:33.480 --> 52:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[52:37.440 --> 52:41.280]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[52:41.280 --> 52:44.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[52:47.440 --> 52:52.680]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the

[54:38.020 --> 54:44.920]  Jonathan in Kansas you're on the air welcome hey Alex I have three things to
[54:44.920 --> 54:53.240]  speak to you about one is this new video on YouTube and it's called billions of
[54:53.240 --> 54:59.320]  taxpayer dollars going to Taliban it is put up a day ago it's essentially it's
[54:59.320 --> 55:05.360]  a wolf blitzer CNN clip explaining how billions of dollars still somehow makes
[55:05.360 --> 55:11.960]  it to the Taliban and corruption within private contractors and that it I think
[55:11.960 --> 55:15.640]  it's a good clip you may want to look up yes I've seen the clip we posted it on
[55:15.640 --> 55:21.600]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com a couple days ago but but again they
[55:21.600 --> 55:26.080]  always report on themselves like it's an accident oops we ship guns into Mexico
[55:26.080 --> 55:32.560]  and Honduras and the drug gangs in Miami and in Chicago oops the you know
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.280]  Wells Fargo got caught with 300 plus billion dollars in drug money oops you
[55:37.280 --> 55:42.560]  don't get in trouble oopsie oopsie I mean this is all done on purpose they
[55:42.560 --> 55:48.280]  created the Taliban in 79 they gave them the weapons then when they invaded
[55:48.280 --> 55:53.000]  Afghanistan it was totally staged the Taliban that was CIA would conscript
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.800]  10, 11, 12, 13, 14 year olds this is confirmed and admitted stick them in
[55:57.800 --> 56:01.960]  frontline trenches the United States would then who was compartmentalized the
[56:01.960 --> 56:07.560]  troops didn't know had gunships and artillery kill the young people then the
[56:07.560 --> 56:12.240]  Taliban showed up at airfields with chest of gold this is Times of London
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.680]  Newsweek magazine even tell the slaves gave them the chest of gold and flew
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.840]  them to Pakistan it's all completely staged Al Qaeda CIA it's all staged
[56:22.840 --> 56:27.240]  underwear bomber was a drug doubt idiot that you know the dad didn't like because
[56:27.240 --> 56:30.760]  he was basically mentally retarded and so that you know they just handed him
[56:30.760 --> 56:33.960]  over you know to have that done and they just take a mentally retarded person
[56:33.960 --> 56:36.840]  on the plane and that's the end of it I mean this is and then everybody has to
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.400]  be body scanned by the way the body scanners I was reading are now going to
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.120]  be made in China so you know this is how they operate I mean you've got a
[56:45.120 --> 56:49.360]  gullible population that'll put up with anything of course the US military
[56:49.360 --> 56:55.360]  helps grow the opium so it went from 10% of world opium production pre 2001 to
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.840]  93% now and they have the Marines go yeah we help grow the opium and we
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.360]  interdict it once it gets to America they throw it in our face and people are
[57:03.360 --> 57:07.640]  like we got to keep the drug war going you know because Al Qaeda will get us

[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.080]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.360]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.800]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.360]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:29.720]  Alex Jones you know people who don't believe in God I feel sorry for them
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.360]  they haven't had the experiences that some of us had look at the universe all
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:40.440]  around us we're on a planet hurtling through space around a big sun our eyes
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.920]  our senses only see a very narrow band of the spectrum that mathematics and
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:52.120]  quantum physics have proven and I talked to so many people like Dr. Dr. Paul
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:58.800]  Craig Roberts is coming up Colonel Craig Roberts who died for 10 minutes died
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.960]  repeatedly and was completely dead for 10 minutes and they most people can't
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.640]  survive six minutes or even four minutes most people have brain death in
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.160]  four and a half minutes and you know his guardian angel there with his hand on
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.760]  him the decision to send him back and then they go into other cultures even
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.120]  with native tribes and New Guinea in places and major studies that were
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:25.520]  conducted by atheist groups and and secular scientists and a lot of them
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:33.120]  then get spiritual because they they've done these experiences with near death
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.520]  or death experiences and every culture has the same thing the portal of light
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.960]  the guardian angel that's there with their hand on your shoulder that you
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.040]  know has been there your whole life the imaginary friend when you're a kid it's
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.880]  recorded everything you've done and then the decision to be sent back or
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.040]  people that have been going the other direction and then get sent back boy let
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.480]  me tell you and the reason I raised that you may have not heard the last caller
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.480]  Steve as a veteran who was shot in combat and died and was resuscitated and
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:14.160]  he was saying he doesn't fear death now because of it I had a story you know a
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.120]  story I've told and I'm not gonna get into it today I mean the point is is
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.000]  that there are certain events in your life that change you forever and then
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.560]  really give you a window into things and I guess a lot of folks aren't awake to
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.440]  that they're not attuned to that they just don't know okay I said I'm taking
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.160]  your calls there is just so much incredible news there is just a huge
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.040]  fight in DC over the raising the debt limit we're gonna be breaking it down
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.120]  with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up here in about 25 minutes we now have new
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.960]  dictators in this country it's the private rating agencies that have
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.040]  already been lying for a long time and telling us that we're not defunct and
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.240]  that we haven't really lost our triple-a rating but the fact is they've
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.080]  already defaulted on the quality of the dollar they've already defaulted on
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.600]  treasury bonds that are denominated in dollars and they're transferring that
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.200]  default on to the American people with purchasing power being destroyed and
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.120]  it's already wreaking havoc and as the economy shuts down as people have less
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.040]  money because it's all going to gas and fuel and food it will kill every other
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.040]  sector of the economy and this has all been planned that's what's so frustrating
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.600]  is that we told you exactly what they would do when they got rid of Glass
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.760]  Stegel they've done the same thing in third-world countries these banks take
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:35.120]  over and it's they are waging war against wealth against the free market
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.160]  they are monopoly men and the Republicans are debating oh we want to make
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.760]  some cuts and the cuts they want to make are two entitlements now I'm against
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.120]  entitlements because it makes you dependent and it gets you on the
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.960]  government largesse and now the government owned by foreign banks run by
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:57.640]  foreign banks hijacked by foreign banks is the proper way to put it puppeteered
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.360]  by the foreign banks probably even more specific they know exactly what they're
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.480]  doing and now Obama can get up to say 80 million of you depend on checks every
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.320]  two weeks and if you don't raise the debt ceiling and if you don't go deeper
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.080]  into debt we're gonna lose our AAA rating and go bankrupt and that's true but
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.840]  if you do continue to spend more we'll go even more bankrupt when we go
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.160]  completely bankrupt so they're just getting us deeper and deeper into it
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.680]  like a crack dealer with an addict and we're being brought into bondage we've
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.880]  been signed on to the thousands of trillions over a thousand five hundred
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:37.960]  trillion that we don't owe remember too big to fail that's the debt and so the
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.560]  Republicans are saying cut social security cut welfare cut all the you know
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.840]  ensure great get rid of the Department of Education get rid of all this still
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.200]  you could cut it all if we don't say no to the derivatives nothing you could cut
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.760]  everything it won't fix anything but they're gonna get the public by well
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.760]  just give us half your pension fund and if you don't give us half the pension
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:07.900]  fund then you'll get nothing same thing's been done in Argentina and Costa
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.960]  Rica and Nigeria and Greece and Ireland and I told you it was coming cuz six
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.960]  years ago I wasn't 2005 they changed the rules so they could take private pension
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.640]  funds public pension funds and then they sell everybody that well you don't you
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.680]  don't deserve your your government pension fund well sure it may be a form
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.400]  of government largesse and has helped bankrupt things but the point is if you
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.960]  set the precedent where you can start taking people's pension funds they're
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.240]  gonna take private too and now they're talking about that oh the government
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.600]  will take over pension funds they say to protect them and then the more they
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.960]  protect us with banker bailouts the further we get down this rat hole the
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.800]  worst things get and the Republicans are not telling you that unless it's Ron
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:54.960]  Paul or Rand Paul they're not telling you that they're going with the banker
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.920]  plan of austerity cutting all the services and letting the taxes be kept
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.400]  the same or raised and then the lion's share of the money goes to the bankers
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.640]  who created the fraudulent debt and are the criminals now I know the listeners
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.360]  know this but we've got to get this out to everybody and so we're being held
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:21.880]  hostage by the ratings agencies saying you raise the debt ceiling or we will
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.200]  lower your credit rating and the and these rating agencies are openly run
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.160]  by the big six banks that we did we're in a lot of trouble here and it just
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.920]  absolutely boggles my mind that this is happening and we'll be talking to Dr.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:44.640]  Roberts about the fact that they're now saying hey don't worry the president
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.000]  will just do this on his own just like he launched the wars on his own and
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.360]  that's now in the news today the president just doing and saying Congress
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:58.200]  doesn't matter all right let's go ahead and talk to Ezekiel in Kentucky Dan
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:04.120]  Otter Brent and Sarah go ahead Ezekiel to talk to you on Marine Corps veteran
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.280]  I've been listening to you since 9-11 and I'm glad to finally get to talk to you
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.120]  good to have you on sir welcome you really I've got my glasses on Alex we
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:16.600]  sleep they live there's a something I want to talk to two things I want to
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.520]  bring up one was my experience in the Marine Corps with vaccinations and the
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.840]  others the Norway shooting but the with the vaccinations there were I was
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.120]  looking at my medical record and I've got a series of vaccinations that I
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:31.200]  cannot figure out what they are there's no name on it's just a string of numbers
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.800]  I've been trying to figure out I can't get any answers and I remember one
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:41.040]  particular incident where right after I was vaccinated the night of woke up in
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.720]  the middle of the night in the back of my eyes were and just to open open on
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.040]  them and they were secreting some weird green crap and I had to have help me to
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.560]  the head my head and I had a metastase in my mouth for weeks after that there
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:02.960]  was other people who experienced the same thing I had Perry in 2007 Rick Perry's
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:10.200]  chief of media came to end game and he goes Alex Rick Perry's a good man and he
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.560]  was a clean-cut nice guy didn't get a bad vibe off of him but almost got like a
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:20.720]  mind control vibe he goes but I want you to know I know this film's real and you
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.680]  know Rick's not a bad guy the governor wants you to know he's a good guy and I
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.240]  wouldn't look the guy up later he gave me his card he really was that we said he
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.960]  was and I'd sent scene him on TV at press conferences with Perry and he said
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:38.160]  I was a medic at Fort Sam Houston and they they brought troops in from Fort
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.760]  Bragg we were ordered to inject them and they all died Alex and then we had to
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:48.640]  disinfect the entire medical area he said so I know so I go why don't you get
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.920]  the governor talk about that meanwhile the governor came out six months later
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.240]  and announced forced inoculations for Texas schoolgirls and it turned out he
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.120]  didn't have the power to do it and had to back off but I mean creepy I mean you
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.440]  know creepy this guy tells me works for Rick Perry that he was a medic a decade
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:09.520]  before and watch the government kill troops that they sent from Fort Bragg
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:15.800]  down to be murdered at Fort Sam Houston Medical Division there's admitted
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.240]  thousands of tests radiating nerve-gassing our troops projects shad
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.040]  injecting little kids with cephalus you know Hillary just had to apologize for
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:28.200]  that a few months ago the UN's caught every year giving kids live polio just
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:33.840]  search UN polio shots kill kids and still we trust the government we still
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:38.320]  join the military and yes sir I don't mean to scare you but and there's ways
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.080]  to try to detox it and things but what they do is they inject you with all
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.280]  sorts of soft kill and my god it's just hellish when you look at what they do to
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.000]  the troops see they know you're gonna wake up later and so they test all sorts
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.280]  of crud on you and of course that's come out but I'm sorry I'm ranting what
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.400]  did the other Marines think about this or are they concerned there's two types
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.920]  of veterans when you come home you either continue to go to sleep or you
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.760]  start to wake up and then the ones who wake up are the ones that they believe
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.200]  are they want to be the terrorists because we we've caught them we we know
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.240]  what they've done to us but I've had it for our other veteran friends who
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:19.240]  developed schizophrenia from from the military well you know heavy metals are
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.880]  the number one cause of schizophrenia that's why they had the term is it most
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.800]  schizophrenia is a chemical reaction a chemical allergy to mercury and and lead
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.240]  as well and that's why they have this saying Matt is a hatter you know because
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.320]  the guys that did the weaving of the hats that they were doing it with mercury
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.280]  and yes that's the one big issue with the mental illness exploding and instead
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.840]  of telling you to detox they put you on toxic drugs sure they want to treat you
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:50.480]  with more poison there's no doubt that I uh the other point I wanted to talk
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.960]  about was Norway really fast here I do I come from a military family and my dad
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.320]  and grandfather Marines and nations and I was a D-malay and I went through the
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.520]  Blue Lodge in the Scottish Rite and the AMORC and I'm no longer active and I
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.160]  believe these orders are generally corrupt but I think there's another way
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.480]  to look at the Norway attack I'm not trying to send the Masons or the
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.360]  temp order anything because these these groups are they're so big and they're
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.800]  so shadowy and they've been infiltrated by so many different people who know no
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.080]  one that I don't know what they're what's it for on the top I don't know
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:28.000]  what the 33rds are doing but I think they are somebody who was behind this
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.480]  war was trying to demonize the Masons and tempers for some for some reason
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.200]  whoever was behind it because it just doesn't make sense so they're the
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:43.280]  rhetoric of the fake documentary and the fake manifest it doesn't match Masonic
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.800]  doctrine too much it just doesn't make sense the whole thing just doesn't make
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.240]  sense now I hear you I mean Masonry is a very diverse complex situation and
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.760]  mainly it's the secrecy in it is used for other cults to be set up we'll be

[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:28.680]  you go downtown coming up on Friday we've got Al Jorgensen of ministry
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:38.640]  joining us on the show so I certainly look forward to that interview I remember
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.080]  listened to ministry in like nineteen nineteen eighty nine nineteen ninety and
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.880]  they had all their songs about the new world order and global government and
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.960]  genetic engineering and warfare I mean this guy I can't wait to talk to him and
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.800]  you know they've also put out music videos exposing government sponsored
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:03.240]  terror recently government drug dealing so he's the founder of ministry and I
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:07.960]  can't wait to interview him coming up on Friday let's go back to your calls I
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.640]  had a doctor Paul Craig Roberts to really give us the skinny on what's
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:16.640]  happening with the debt ceiling situation and talk of making Obama
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:22.840]  supreme ruler let's go ahead and talk to otter because otter was holding estuary
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.040]  I never got to him then Dan Brent Sarah and others otter in mass you're on the
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:33.200]  air hey how are you good so I'm here in vacation land I'm one Martha's vineyard
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.040]  off of Cape Cod and the reason your buddy in the military that just called
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:43.160]  mentioned the drones because this turns into a military camp during that ten
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.120]  twelve day period I've seen it three years running you've got the stealth
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.520]  helicopters coming in right now we're being infiltrated by the SS
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.760]  goons that are coming in we've noticed the last couple months of chem trails
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.640]  have stopped but they might have blown that one because our beaches the waters
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.920]  are polluted and they're more and more being shut down I think you know
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.400]  combination of Fukushima what they're not telling us about that the fact that
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.640]  the meteorological evidence is different than what historically has been
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:22.720]  presented I've got asthma sorry we've got the jet stream running different than
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.520]  what they would project so you've got stuff coming directly across and right
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.320]  on the same parallel with us hey but don't worry the EPA two months ago raised
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:38.120]  the level of isotopes in some cases 100,000 times higher radiation they
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.760]  say is good for you and government doesn't lie I mean like they tell the
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.200]  troops do use good for them I mean they know in their own manuals it's a death
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.280]  sentence but now they even use DU at military shooting ranges near big
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:54.280]  cities and it's getting into the water but you know everybody's being poisoned
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.040]  by it but so what the government loves us sir they're good people I mean it looks
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.680]  like they're trying to curb it because you know they want him to come here it's
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.400]  an interesting thing when it comes down because we basically turn into a
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:10.560]  military base when Clinton came years ago he was right out there in the open
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.640]  with his suburbans now they run around dressed up like their tourists with
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:19.400]  cameras and your standard jeeps etc I want to get to something that's more
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.400]  important which I haven't heard you touch on I've listened a long long time
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:28.120]  and that's metals and there are tons of fake metals out there the frauds are
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  just rampant we've got to go back to what we learned in high school and get
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:39.600]  with some specific gravity testing because there's countless from the
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:46.800]  pandas to the roos the American Silver Eagles and Gold Eagles just on and on
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.160]  yeah but when the Midas Resources goes through the biggest grading companies
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.160]  and I'll assure you you hold a gold coin in your hand or a silver coin I mean
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.840]  yeah you can weigh it too it's good but I mean it's a hundred percent real
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.120]  gold and silver but yeah there are a lot of fly-by-night startup companies out
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.080]  there and I have seen those reports of that going on that's why I go with
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.000]  Midas Resources because number one they're patriots big Ron Paul supporters
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.920]  number two I know Ted Anderson number three I've bought almost all my gold and
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.840]  silver from them and I haven't been able to find better deals from anybody
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.360]  than Midas Resources. Both of the two largest companies which are the two
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.880]  that are really historically said to be you know the best of graders and the
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:37.760]  best as far as legitimacy have been found to put out countless since 2005
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.960]  I've never seen that that would be quite a big scandal why don't you send me
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:47.160]  something to Showtipsatinfowars.com let's jam in one more call here let's
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:55.520]  talk to Ezekiel in Kentucky you're on the ear be dropped Dan in Pennsylvania go

[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.040]  open talk about having the president bypass congress and transfer the power
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.960]  of the purse we saw senator mitch mcconnell call for that a week ago

[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:43.080]  dictator and we have this executive order
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.360]  blocking property of transnational criminal organizations

[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.320]  that has language in it a caller mentioned this and they are correct
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.080]  has language in it and the constitutional scholars are looking at it
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:04.440]  basically saying we're in an emergency financially
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.880]  and that he can do this to block criminal activity

[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:13.720]  and many other great sites the political theater and the debt
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:17.880]  ceiling crisis we are we are being had that's the latest
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.360]  also an economy destroyed the enemy is washington
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:26.360]  and he's been really breaking down what's happening here and weeks ago
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:29.560]  said this is a bunch of theater to transfer power of the purse from
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.720]  congress to the executive and that's in the news today
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.760]  democrats in fact you can go to drudge and read the articles
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.240]  are saying hey president just do this on your own
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.760]  obama talking to la raza the group of the race
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.200]  uh two days ago said he'd like to do things on his own
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.480]  house democratic leader urges obama to raise debt ceiling without
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.960]  uh congress uh we've got all of this happening and here to make sense of it
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.520]  is dr paul craig roberts thank you for joining us today sir
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.880]  uh doctor we've lost your audio we're going to get you faded up try to get
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.080]  you on air right now uh go ahead again sir you've lost my audio
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:12.440]  okay you're back now start over thank you for joining us
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.320]  okay i'm pleased to be with you alex uh let me just run through it briefly
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:23.080]  i'm a a debt ceiling increase is just a routine thing normally
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:27.960]  um it's an opportunity for a few republicans and maybe one or two
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.640]  democrats to give a speech to an empty chamber
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.120]  about the burdens we're we're piling on our grandchildren but other than that
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.240]  they vote the increase and they don't really have any
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.560]  alternative because they they've spent the money
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:51.000]  this time there is uh a very ill considered uh effort by republicans
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.880]  to make a serious issue out of it it's the wrong time
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.960]  for a number of reasons one of course is that the rest of the world is
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.240]  already disturbed about um american financial credibility as
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.600]  result of the financial crisis and everything else
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.040]  and so this is the wrong time to show more
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:17.800]  uncertainty and irresponsible behavior it's also the wrong time
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:22.920]  because we're at war we've got troops in the field
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:30.760]  the the the debt funds 43 percent of the current operating budget
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:35.240]  of the united states government so it's not like it's a small amount that they
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:41.880]  can cancel or put on leave non-essential government
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:46.520]  yeah you can't leave troops in the field without supplies
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.960]  and uh and that sort of thing and so they are what they are risking
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:40:00.920]  is a continuation of the power grabs that that were serious under the bush
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:06.600]  chaining regime in which they simply ignored congress on a range of issues
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.440]  and grabbed power on the basis of the unitary
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:15.880]  uh doctrine of presidential powers and they are now set up for this to happen
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:22.200]  again because um obama or no president could
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:27.640]  possibly allow the uh the kind of disruption
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:33.480]  that a uh default or an inability to finance the operations of the government
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.120]  at this time would cause and they are already
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:41.640]  presidential directives national security directives
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:48.200]  executive orders on the books put there by bush that obama can
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.440]  invoke to give him the legitimate authority
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.960]  to declare a national emergency or even a catastrophic emergency
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.480]  and set aside the debt receiving limit and
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.880]  proceed to issue debt and as you said uh what we would see is that the power of
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:12.280]  the purse would pass from congress to the executive
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:19.400]  just as the power to go to war has passed from congress to the executive
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.040]  and so we would have another john step
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.920]  in the process of the american president becoming a caesar
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.600]  and we've talked about that before so this is a huge risk
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:40.200]  why would the republicans uh bring this risk to the table at this time
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:45.160]  maybe it's an attention but why would congress want to give up more of its
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:49.080]  power i mean it's already becoming superfluous
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:54.920]  so we could say well it's just uh unclear thinking or that
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:00.120]  they're so committed to getting entitlements under control that they're
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:06.040]  willing to take this risk um what will obama do
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.640]  well we don't really know because we don't know whether he's part of the
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.880]  political theater it may well be that obama is
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:20.680]  is very aligned with financial interests and would like to see
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:26.440]  reductions in the scope of medicare and social security in order that elements
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:29.000]  could be privatized and turned over to wall street
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.520]  to his buddies there who who did so much of the
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:38.680]  funding of his presidential campaign so it could simply be a theater
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.760]  and so obama can say i'm forced to the wall
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:49.560]  i've either got to leave the troops unsupplied in afghanistan and in iraq
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:54.440]  or i've got to give in to republicans and cut social security and medicare
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:58.200]  and so i've taken the least bad of the two choices
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:02.040]  that the republicans gave me so he could he could do that so this could
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:07.320]  simply be a way to get rid of entitlements
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.160]  that otherwise are politically impossible
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.480]  to get rid of and we don't know or it may just all be
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.160]  hype and confusion and at the last minute they make
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:26.840]  the deal so that that remains to be seen but the real point is there is no
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:33.240]  reason for this debt ceiling crisis routinely they just happen
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.880]  routinely there have been many of them doing my professional life
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.800]  and i believe it was only newt gingrich back
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.320]  during the 1990s who made an issue of one of them
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.760]  and they shut down the government for a few days
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.440]  it had no real consequence because they simply
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.400]  closed things like national parks and
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:01.960]  and federal workers who were not absolutely necessary and that sort of
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.760]  thing but of course this time the the amount of
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.760]  funding is a much greater share of the budget
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.960]  and so they can't get by with just cutting
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.160]  non-essential services okay i'd like to bring up a few issues here
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.480]  um and i meant to get to it yesterday but it was posted on info wars.com and
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:30.120]  prismpana.com news stories cbs news rt you name it from 2008
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.200]  where they admitted brigade homeland 20 000 troops
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:38.440]  deployed to the streets of america for economic collapse
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:43.800]  army times reported on it by 2011 so they had this long-term strategic plan
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:47.400]  bush put presidential decision director 51 in place
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:52.200]  uh the also an accompanying executive order that said for any emergency
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.440]  including economic or any other emergency the president could set aside
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.200]  congress for six months obama reissued that
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:03.240]  as one of the first executive orders and we wrote about that
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:06.440]  here's our article from january 18 2010
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.560]  pdd 51 and the new executive order give obama
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.560]  dictator power and they basically cite this now
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.040]  whenever he launches libya wars uh and all of this and we had
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:23.080]  congressman uh defazio you know going to bush at the time and saying i want the
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:27.160]  full text of pdd 51 the you know the the cover sheet
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.920]  says you can take over for any reason well i want to see the full plan and
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.840]  they would never give even the homeland security committee director
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.960]  of the house that information so right there
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.840]  is the presidency really uh flexing its dictatorial muscles
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:48.920]  and now we see uh politico today in fact let me just read that headline uh to
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.560]  listeners a politico has come out with a top democrat
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:57.160]  in the house obama urged to invoke 14th amendment
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.120]  as debt ceiling deadline and that was a 14th amendment
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:04.360]  interpretation by ulysses s grant during reconstruction
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:07.880]  uh against the states they're threatening this against the congress
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.400]  uh and we saw foreshadowing of this where they were talking about
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.960]  alex we we you and i talked about this at great length back when bush issued
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:19.320]  these directives and of course they don't need to
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.320]  invoke the 14th amendment because of the directives that you point out
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.320]  and then we pointed out at the time that bush is already on the books
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.000]  so there's no doubt that if the republicans push
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.320]  their intransigence right into the deadline
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:41.720]  that obama has to decide if he's not going to cave in to them
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:47.160]  he has to decide does he let uh the uh default take place does he let the
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:49.720]  dollar go does he let the credit rating of the united
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.800]  states government go does he let the power of the country evaporate
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.920]  or does he evoke the the bush uh presidential and national security
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.000]  directives and set aside congress i suspect
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.880]  that the pressure from within the administration from within the military
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.880]  security complex would force him even if he didn't want to
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:17.480]  to invoke the uh the bush presidential directive and set aside congress
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.080]  so i think it's for certain that that will happen
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:27.400]  if the republicans continue and demanding no tax increase cuts in
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:32.680]  entitlements and the democrats say well we just can't do that we can't betray
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:37.720]  our constituencies to that extent we control the senate and the white house
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:42.440]  why do you think we're going to submit to the house republicans demands
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.480]  so if it comes to that yes we will see more powers
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.400]  leave the congress and i think they will be permanent
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.760]  they're not going to go they're not going to go back
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:00.840]  and so it's a serious situation and the question we have to
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.000]  wonder about is are the republicans unaware of this
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.640]  are they in on it do they want it to happen well sir let me stop you
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.240]  mitch mcconnell came out a week ago we we did news reports on this
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.200]  and they spun it like oh great obama will get the blame
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.160]  and he said uh well we'll just have congress like they did with the world
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.760]  trade organization on trade we'll have congress
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:28.520]  sign its authority over to the president on
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.280]  debt increases so now they're talking about a super congress where the rest
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:35.960]  of the house and senate don't vote but the leaders get together
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.480]  and there's another video out today breaking it down congressional members
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.800]  net worth has gone up 3669 percent just in the last few years the
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.720]  big mega banks are all filing record profits
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.640]  yeah they're crazy like a fox i mean this is clearly been engineered and it's
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:57.480]  all a bunch of theater a bush helps you clinton gets rid of last eagle
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.400]  bush continues it obama continues it same special interests are financing
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.960]  both sides i think the answer is there they know
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.680]  exactly what they're doing well i'm not as sure as you are
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.840]  about that um i think the outcome may be the same
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:22.440]  but um you have to uh if i was the wall street interest
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.560]  or or military security complex interest to all companies
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:34.520]  i would be at this point very uncertain about further increases in the power of
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:39.640]  the president yes because right now the oligarchies
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:45.160]  control the government but as power accumulates in the
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:50.360]  presidency that control deserts the oligarchies the
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  executive branch has it and brings them under their thumb
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.720]  you know this is kind of the way rome transitioned
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:04.280]  for a while the the seizures the rise of the seizures and it was a gradual
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.320]  process the accumulation of power uh work to the advantage of
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:13.160]  the more powerful interest but then they all found that
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:19.800]  they were all under the thumb and so i i don't know that accumulating more
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:24.200]  power in the presidency is to the advantage of the oligarchy
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:29.400]  i think he then rises not merely as a countervailing power
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.120]  but eventually as the overwhelming power but they
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:37.240]  have vetted people that they have dirt on
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:41.160]  who they believe they can control and you've got the israeli special interest
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:45.160]  in others uh there and so uh this could be
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:50.200]  a multinational even foreign coup through the presidency
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.480]  with rama manual and the rest of them and i i i really do see that
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.600]  we're in grave danger dr paul craig roberts is our guest i want to talk
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.880]  about the true state of the economy when we come back
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:03.560]  is there already really a technical default question can functional magnetic

[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:23.480]  person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:27.720]  known as fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:32.360]  and there is proof that it exists america's new slavery explores this
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:36.760]  technology and its many possible applications in national security

[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:43.080]  does america's salvation rest in this technology
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.960]  these and many other questions are answered in america's new slavery the

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:07.240]  power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.480]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:13.720]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:17.320]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:20.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:24.440]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:31.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.680]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.440]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:12.440]  integration between the special interests that run the republicans and the
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:16.040]  democrats but as dr roberts former head of
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:19.480]  policy the treasury former wall street journal editor has broken down
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.760]  and he's been listed by Forbes under publications one of the top 10 economist
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.840]  out there it doesn't matter the outcome is the same thing and
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:30.440]  all of this they started training the military to take over the u.s right when
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.320]  they got rid of glass steagle we got imf world bank plans back in 2002
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:39.000]  where they talked about imploding the western world
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.640]  and it's here but dr roberts my issue is do you agree
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:48.360]  with dr ron paul congressman ron paul but also the chinese government last six
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:51.560]  month they've said look you're already starting to default by
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.160]  monetizing your treasuries you're already moving towards hyper
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:58.680]  inflation and we're not going to buy your treasury
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:01.480]  bonds anymore we're going to cut back on what we're buying
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:06.680]  and so i mean that's why many people have said go ahead and let them up the
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.760]  debt because it will just kind of back this off we will implode if you don't
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:13.640]  up it but then we'll implode if we don't because you've
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:17.320]  pointed out we've been deindustrialized by globalism
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:20.280]  which is the opposite of what they call free or fair trade i mean i've got
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:23.640]  articles here where general electorates using government bailout money
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:28.360]  to move their x-ray factories to china right
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:33.400]  yeah well um we can talk about the economy because
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.240]  it's the real problem and not the debt ceiling crisis
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.080]  and i think you're right to move us to that topic first i'm going to very
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.400]  briefly make the point that if the united states
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.560]  the government does default and it has any
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:54.680]  of the uh terrible consequences that have been predicted
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:59.720]  uh who are the gainers iran russia and china
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:06.760]  those those are the ones who will come out ahead and so it's really not
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:14.040]  in any american interests of of of the uh power groups to default
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:18.200]  so i think for that reason it will be awarded
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:24.120]  now as for the economy is we have discussed many times alex the the
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.280]  crisis of the american economy is that the middle class jobs have been moved
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:34.040]  offshore and given to the chinese indians indonesians and others
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:37.880]  and the american middle class is left without these jobs
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.840]  and without the income growth that supported the growth in consumer demand
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:48.520]  the housing market and the economy and which was tax base
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:51.800]  so one of the reasons we have such huge deficits
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.560]  is that we have today roughly what 10 million
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:02.120]  fewer people employed than a decade ago despite the growth in the population of
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:08.040]  10 percent so when you give away your gdp your
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:11.640]  tax base the jobs for the middle class both
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.640]  manufacturing jobs and professional service jobs like
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.480]  many fields of engineering and research design
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:24.600]  you are destroying your own economy and that's what has been going on with
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:31.160]  offshoring for about 20 years and there is no discussion of this
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:36.680]  yet today i've been going on about it for years and years
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:42.120]  and i have been joined by ralph comery the distinguished mathematician and
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:47.160]  economist and recently as we i think discussed on your program
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:50.680]  we had a nobel laureate economist come out
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:55.640]  and and reproduce my arguments and now the chamber of commerce says move
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:58.840]  everything we've got left to south korea
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:05.480]  right and and that's right so even though a few knowledgeable
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:10.520]  and distinguished people have picked up my argument
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:14.280]  it's still ignored by the policymakers and by the vested interest
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.240]  because they all know they can increase their short-term profits
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:24.360]  they can increase their quarterly bonuses by continuing to move american
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:28.760]  jobs offshore because it lowers the labor cost increases the profits
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:33.720]  and therefore for they qualify for their bonus payments dr roberts i know you've
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.440]  got to go but one minute break i want to come back and have you finish that
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:42.440]  point we're going to ship gears and other subjects stay with us

[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:35.000]  news i want to get into the cloning air and finish the special report this
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.080]  morning but it's in high def so it's not encoding quickly you
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:42.920]  know so little we will be able to air it before the show ends today if not it'll
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:48.280]  be premiered tomorrow but going back to Dr. Paul Craig
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.360]  roberts uh it's admitted that the
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.520]  multinationals use the u.s for their muscle what are they planning to do
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:01.000]  once they fully sucked the united states dry and totally bankrupted us
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.040]  what are they i mean i guess is ron paul said they're going to lean on nuclear
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.480]  weapons i mean at a certain point uh they are
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.520]  destroying their own command base dr roberts with this
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:15.800]  deindustrialization you talked about that's right it's uh it's short run
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:21.080]  they're thinking short run you know most ceo is only there a few years
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.400]  it's not a lifetime job they're there a few years
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:30.440]  uh generally just before retirement age and they use the opportunity to
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:36.280]  maximize their short-run incomes their short-term incomes and and then they
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:41.080]  retire with multi millions and comfortable and that way of
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:45.400]  running a country is not the way the chinese and japanese run their country
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:51.400]  and so we're losing out and there's nothing that can be done about it given
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:56.440]  the structure of the incentives but to get back to where we were before your
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:01.640]  break let me say something that's unequivocal
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:06.280]  the debt ceiling crisis is of no real consequence
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:09.720]  compared to the offshoring of the american jobs
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:15.320]  and to the financial deregulation unless the financial deregulation is largely
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.080]  reversed and unless something can be done not
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:23.080]  just to stop the offshoring of jobs but to bring back
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:27.800]  the millions that have been all short there's no possibility of the united
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.480]  states being able to continue the kinds of
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:36.280]  expenditures that it's used to it can't have wars at all
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.520]  it can't have a military security complex at all
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:44.200]  it may not be able to have any old age
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.120]  retirement pensions or medicare or medicaid
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:53.640]  or or or just about anything else because it's destroying the
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.320]  tax base of the country and so unless they pay attention
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:04.840]  and re-regulate and they need to put back in place everything they took out
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.240]  and unless they find some way to bring those jobs back and to stop the
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:13.320]  hemorrhaging of jobs which as you pointed out they are continuing now
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.560]  with the korean free trade agreement this
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:24.280]  is insanity unless they stop this the whole game is up
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.760]  that's simply a fact this is not a partisan statement it's not a hysterical
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:32.760]  statement it's not an opinion it's a simple fact
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.360]  doctor what's the time frame and closing i know you don't want to put exact times
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:40.920]  on it but you said three years ago during the 2008 you said no
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.640]  two three four years out is when i'd have to guesstimate the real collapse
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:49.320]  alex these things take take longer and i think you've been proven
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:52.920]  right but here we are three years later are we a lot closer to two minutes to
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.120]  midnight yes we are look the other day this the
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:01.240]  us dollar hit yet another new low against the swiss frame
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:06.440]  one us super dollar is equal to 80 swiss
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:12.200]  cents when i was a young man a dollar was worth
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:19.480]  420 swiss cents today 80 this collapse and this collapse has been
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.560]  accelerating during this year look at the price of
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:29.560]  gold and silver look at the increased criticism of the united states from
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:33.080]  foreign governments as you pointed out china itself
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:38.760]  so i think the the acceleration of the collapse is underway we've only got 20
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.800]  seconds so what's the time frame to where because they're now admitting we're
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:45.400]  really in a depression more and more are you talking about another year how long
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:48.360]  until it's really evident i think by the end of the year
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:52.680]  we'll realize we're in a deeper recession i don't know what
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.000]  hysterical responses at all all right dr roberts thank you so much for
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:02.120]  spending time with us we'll be right back stay with us ladies and gentlemen
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:06.120]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.320]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:13.320]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:16.520]  americans at home i have a tremendous influence
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:20.520]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:25.800]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:29.720]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:33.400]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.720]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:43.080]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:46.600]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:51.800]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on

[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:07.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:12.040]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:19.960]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:23.240]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:27.160]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:31.080]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:34.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:38.120]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:41.560]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really
[02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:44.840]  believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one

[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:14.040]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:23.320]  grant sarah carl thomas preston we're going to get to all your calls and more
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:28.840]  also coming up i have the genesis talk show host
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:34.280]  coming on that are suing rachel madow for claiming that they were saying kill
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:37.160]  gay people which they never said and they
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:41.240]  told msnbc this and showed them proof and they didn't stop
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:44.600]  and uh you know that's the kind of stuff that's going to happen to msnbc when
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:50.040]  they willfully and knowingly try to hurt people just for fun
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:52.920]  one thing if you say something and you're proven wrong but it wasn't on
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:56.600]  purpose but when you do it with malice of forethought
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:02.200]  with intent to do harm you will be found liable in the courts
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.920]  and um we're going to be having those guys pop
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:11.320]  in uh towards the end of the broadcast uh and by the way
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:14.920]  i'm going to have to go into overdrive today for the radio audience
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:18.440]  you'll be able to go to mfallwars.com or prismplanet.com
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.440]  at four or five o'clock today and see this big special report
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.600]  and i'll be able to give you the name of the report soon
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.720]  but i don't want to give it out until the article's up but we're going to
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.000]  premiere it for prismplanet.tv viewers we're just going to keep
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.640]  the radio show going for another 30 minutes into the next hour but it won't
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:42.120]  be on your local am and fmda will just be prismplanet.tv only
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:47.400]  in the audio streams because uh we've been we've taken the last two three days
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:50.440]  to put this together and it's really a big issue
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:53.800]  and uh it needs to get out there and so we're going to premiere it
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:57.960]  to the prismplanet.tv folks when we go into overdrive
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:01.000]  now by the end of the show if it isn't done in coding
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.440]  these computers drive me insane sometimes a 15 minute presentation
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.800]  might take 30 minutes to encode because it's high def so sometimes it might take
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:10.840]  three hours and it's been doing that today it's been encoding since
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.280]  about 10 o'clock this morning so i thought we'd be able to premiere it in
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:17.320]  this hour but for radio listeners you'll be able to
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:21.480]  after the show later today we'll put it up on the youtube channel first
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.600]  but we're going to put it on prismplanet.tv first
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:28.760]  coming up and this deals with human clones and the governments have kept
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:32.200]  secret now they admit they've been splicing them with animals
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:35.240]  for at least 15 years that i know about well they admitted 15 years ago they
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.400]  were doing it five years before so 20 and Aaron
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:42.440]  because you know he knows i'll rant information out and then in these
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:46.120]  research pieces he then has to take keywords that i say
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:49.000]  because a lot of times when i do a special presentation i'll sit down for
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  20 minutes search keywords of articles i know i've read over the years
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  i'll find five or six of hundreds i've seen i'll walk off
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  shoot the presentation hand it to Aaron
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.200]  and then it's always worse than when i say on the video and he's like we might
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.560]  have to re-shoot this alex that they're admitting cloned humans in
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.440]  artificial wombs in the 70s and there's photos of them in
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:13.880]  time-life books and they admit eugenics and they admit that the government's
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:16.840]  going to take control of the entire reproductive cycle and basically
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:19.560]  sterilize everybody with chemicals and then you'll have to go to the
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:23.240]  government to be able to get reproductive stuff done you'll pay to
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:26.200]  have your genetics taken and splice with your wife
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:29.640]  that's how they'll have they have like embryos now being made in england out of
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:32.360]  three different people two men one woman
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.000]  you know and it's all otrendy and transhuman so they destroy our capability
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.240]  to have children with chemicals and they come in
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:44.040]  with their genetic engineering system and then we buy into it
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:47.160]  they're masters of this because it's a total
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:51.480]  ruthless scorched earth policy and i really can't even do justice to this
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.520]  erin did a eight and a half minute analysis of the piece that's coming out
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:00.040]  later today at info wars dot com it's gm human
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:06.680]  animal hybrids emerging market for organs babies and big
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.400]  pharma and his report shows a lot of the
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.120]  research that's going to go into this big report
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:16.360]  coming out later in the day and sometimes when it encodes for four or five
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:20.120]  hours it just shuts down and says didn't encode so
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.320]  we think it'll be airing next hour i can't even guarantee that
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:27.640]  uh but but i've been building this up for the last few days because
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:31.480]  we need to like say this is important out of all the other crazy things happening
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:34.120]  this is what's important like dr roberts just agreed with the
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:38.200]  communist chinese and ron paul and with nobel prize-winning economist
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:42.600]  the debt ceiling is a debate about debt chairs on the titanic
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.280]  the ship is on its side about to go under we've been maneuvered into this
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:49.160]  position they've got north com and the military ready
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.520]  and executive orders for financial martial law
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.720]  they've already stolen the pension funds public and private they've already
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.000]  stolen the military's pension funds that's why you're
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.880]  they're now telling you you're not going to get anything
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:05.560]  and right now they're just training us to raise taxes cut benefits
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.280]  gut things further pay everything to the bankers
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.720]  so they can buy up all the commodities and all the real estate and all the
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:14.600]  defense companies and they don't need us anymore they
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.960]  don't need an economy uh the globalists constantly talk about
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.400]  while they have five kids and private jets and you know billion dollar
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:25.160]  states about how we're scum and how they want to kill us
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:29.320]  and the psychopaths have created this eugenics cosmology
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.680]  to really incorporate and give structure
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:37.160]  just to their psychopathic power-tripping ways and we are in a red
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:43.720]  level emergency a red level emergency i wish i was wrong but everything the
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:45.880]  globalists said they would do in white papers
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.880]  written 100 years ago 70 years ago 25 years ago
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:52.920]  five years ago everything they say they do
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:56.440]  from poison in the water supply to gmo that sterilizes you
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.440]  to vaccines laced with cancer viruses they've done it
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:04.200]  and we just muddle through doubling in cancer the last decade doubling of
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:08.840]  diabetes i mean they're murdering us hardcore and they're running around
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.120]  with with with our blood all over their hands
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:16.040]  uh they're shifting the terror apparatus from muslims to the
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:20.680]  other populations as i told you they do and they're getting ready to start
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:23.080]  blowing things up and shooting up shopping malls
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.120]  and then you'll know why the telescreens are up saying watch your neighbor
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:30.120]  i mean they are about to hammer us hard you think they'd carry out all these
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:33.720]  crimes without a plan you think they would ship guns to
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:36.840]  mexico and to gangs in miami to control the drug
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.200]  i mean the big banks laundered drug money publicly and don't get in trouble
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:43.720]  they are going for broke they're coming on
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:47.880]  down they are overrunning us they are
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.320]  they are bum rushing us they're dropping the hammer
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:56.440]  and you can't get in a fetal position and think they're gonna walk over you
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.360]  just like the people at that island with the with the globalist killer
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:03.800]  you know cowering and and and hoping he wouldn't kill him
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:07.320]  it had done better to you know hide behind a rock and you know run up behind
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:10.680]  him and you know at least if he's gonna shoot you get your adrenaline going
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.000]  believe me you turn your adrenaline on and you know you're gonna take some
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.960]  hits but unless they're absolutely placed perfectly
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:20.840]  you're gonna get even more fired up when those bullets start hitting you
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:25.000]  you're gonna find that real ape power all of us has got to actually tear arms
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.880]  out of people's sockets and you know that's that that's what happened in the
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.320]  old days when you had a shooter and people would just gut up charge them
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.520]  take them out and but we've been taught just lay down
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.800]  helplessly and wait for the police ladies and gentlemen the government is
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.480]  run by criminals your average low-level government person is just a
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.720]  dumb ignoramus like everybody else who in a way and it's time for people to get
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:52.120]  awake and realize what's happening now you know on the economic front
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.360]  there is no silver bullet but i have tried to encourage people
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:01.800]  to understand the laws of economics and that when they go into qe1
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.160]  two and now three that it's going to increase the price of stocks because
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.640]  they're a commodity at the end of the day
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:11.960]  financial instrument uh you know a store of quote wealth
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:17.160]  another fiat currency they're gonna go up so you're gonna think your stocks are
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:20.360]  going up they're not really every other commodity gold silver
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:24.360]  oil all going up but you look at the swiss frank it's flat
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:27.480]  with gold because the frank is sovereign and isn't being devalued their
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:30.520]  country isn't run by complete criminals who could care less about the nation's
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:34.440]  future these globalists are in there one upping each other on who can be the
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:37.160]  most ruthless oh you think you're slick stealing all the death
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.600]  benefits of troops we'll ship guns directly to drug dealers and get caught
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.840]  not getting trouble you know this is the attitude
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:47.320]  that we're seeing and i wanted to briefly as we got a break and come back with
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.640]  your calls go to ted aanderson i drug him in here today i don't even know
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:55.640]  what he what the offers are i know the prices are steadily going up because
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.520]  you know you were buying gold and silver he bought two months ago and it was
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:00.680]  really low and then you were buying stuff he bought a
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:03.960]  month ago and that's running out and so it'll just keep going up and up and up
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.440]  i would take advantage of it now because if the gold and silver are exploding in
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:11.400]  the middle of the summer this has never happened in my experience
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:15.960]  imagine the fall you think it's high at 1622 right now
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:19.320]  and silver at you know 41 or whatever you ain't seen nothing yet
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:23.800]  so ted briefly give folks the latest news and today's silver and gold offer
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:29.720]  well bloomberg is quoting right now that gold's futures hit a high of 1631 20
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:33.800]  today delivery gold hit a peak of 1629 80 that just
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:36.840]  means the contracts that are coming due at this moment
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:39.880]  currently right now i'm holding the prices i had on monday even though the
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:44.600]  prices have gone up like crazy francs are at 354 gold
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.160]  british sovereigns are at 444 one of the things that you can pick up and i'm
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.520]  just i can't say this one enough get two silver dollars
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:56.360]  and the american dream video for 85 dollars delivered
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:00.120]  i mean you're not going to buy the videos i mean the videos are hardly that
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.640]  the silver dollars are way over that now i mean silver hit a peak today
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:08.040]  of 41 55 that's the delivered price obviously the futures are higher
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:11.480]  uh you're right about that alex we haven't seen the fall yet
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:14.680]  here we are sitting in july which is usually the lowest point in golden
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:17.640]  silver and we have this budget impasse going on
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.680]  and the question is is are we going to kill the country by raising
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:24.040]  the debt ceiling or are we going to kill the country by defaulting on debt
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.400]  i mean what does what differences it make you're better off having physical
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:31.480]  gold and silver than you are having this funny fiat money that they have
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:34.120]  that they're giving to us and expecting it to be good
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:37.000]  i would really suggest that people take advantage of that book
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.440]  and that and and take the american dream but
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:44.600]  while you're in call call about you know ask about the silver eagles or
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:48.840]  or the gold eagles or you know there's a whole long line of different things i
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:51.960]  mean the british sovereigns and franks are smaller pieces of gold
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:56.280]  you got to realize how important that's going to be when everything falls apart
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.080]  to have a small piece of gold that's divisible
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.440]  and portable and something that you can carry with you i mean they used to sew
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:07.720]  these in the collars of of the uh uh air force uh you know the people who fly
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:10.360]  the airplanes in world war two because if they got shot down
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:13.640]  they'd have a piece of gold in their collar they could use to negotiate their
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.560]  way to freedom uh you know it's just it makes sense
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.320]  i mean the the central banks of the world use gold and silver
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:25.080]  as a reserve currency for themselves absolutely
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:28.360]  tab we're out of time but people on the deal with the silver dollars in the
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:30.840]  free book and video you can't beat that anywhere
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:33.640]  uh the francs the sovereigns the other gold coins you got a whole list of
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.240]  radio specials people when they call need to say what's the alexios radio
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:40.440]  specials the regular deals are smoking hot and great
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:43.480]  but these are lost leaders you cannot beat these prices
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:49.720]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six

[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:32.600]  I mean it's just completely out of control and like they're like relaying like all the questions
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:37.720]  to local state police barracks and like nothing's being emitted about right now or nothing well
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:42.760]  no they've conditioned people that even when incredible danger is emitted people just take
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.480]  it like jellyfish I mean they now admit they've been splicing humans with animals and then
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.360]  torturing these poor creatures for decades and it's not even an issue you tell adults about it
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:58.440]  they go yeah but the NFL I mean do people have any idea hey they stole the trips pension funds

[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:14.200]  zombies and don't care we have a giant core of people worldwide and here in the U.S. that are
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:19.240]  awake and do know what time it is so let's just ignore the brain dead sheep move forward
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.080]  the globalists don't have a right to be doing these things to us we're going to stand up and
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:28.760]  call them out for the scumbags they are see it's a mind game it's a confidence game Sarah in Kentucky
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:35.400]  thanks for holding welcome hey how are you good thanks for holding welcome and I was calling
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.440]  because I live in Kentucky and my husband works for a small business here they're a contracting
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:45.960]  business and they did some business out of town a couple months ago and when he came home he said
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:53.160]  that one of the one of the workers for Hewlett Packard had told them about some government
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:27:01.160]  contract through FEMA and they made a lot of money selling some laptops to FEMA and they were for
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:09.160]  relocation camps in the southeastern United States and so like since he had the you know the passcode
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:14.040]  to get onto the website or whatever we went ahead and looked at all the other bids you know that
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:21.400]  were out there and people who don't believe that those relocation centers are real they're wrong
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:28.440]  they are real there's a bunch of them and they're staffing them right now and they've been there
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:33.960]  for a long time some of them have been there and operational for a lot of years and you know we
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.280]  were looking at it and we were like why didn't they use those in Hurricane Katrina you know if
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:44.120]  that's what they're really for is for disasters some of them were already open and operational
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:50.120]  I know what they do is they have little semantical lawyer manipulations where Obama says this isn't
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:56.040]  a war it's a kinetic action and the Houston Chronicle the Wall Street Journal have all
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:04.360]  reported on them three one million man camps funded in 95 excuse me 2005 they admit they've
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:10.120]  built these emergency centers but they say they're not concentration camps their emergency
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:15.640]  relocation but yes I've been to the urban warfare drills where they break up the families and give
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:22.120]  you shots and do interrogate you and and you know do have to beat some people and it's all for when
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:26.360]  things collapse and they've just been getting ready getting us in debt getting us ready for the
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:31.400]  collapse and now more and more they're introducing us to the idea and they'll say to the hundred plus
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:37.160]  million on different forms of assistance you're not going to get your checks unless you support us
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:41.640]  rounding up all these right wingers and they're going to say take their guns the government's
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:47.480]  going to go that's right and would you welfare folks and others would you like to be given automatic

[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.320]  told Kurt to post it a few days ago I never saw it on the side he may have but we were sent internal
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:04.520]  DPS documents in their hiring and it's like do not let anyone know this we're only trying to hire
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:10.840]  military you know ahead of issues and and and yes they're just massively building up and the police
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.160]  are going to follow orders from the bankers that did all this this is a criminal takeover and the
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:19.800]  police will sit there lovingly watching the bankers that destroyed America give them orders on the news
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:26.520]  and when you watch FEMA drills on TV it's all military people that are there and they'll like
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:31.080]  New Orleans they'll tell them go get the guns the US military will march in you give them a problem
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:36.600]  they'll just cut you in half high five I'd say you defend America and they're ready to roll but

[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:41.560]  and all the femacamp relocation center contracts those are public i mean she said she saw others
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:46.920]  that weren't public but um i'd like to be sent those send them to show tips at info wars dot
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:53.240]  com uh with your tips uh but i remember and we've written articles about where they came out just
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:57.880]  last year went to hire a hundred thousand relocation specialists for here in the united states
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:05.080]  and then the government pulled it once it got attention and they had the other document of
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:14.680]  course uh that came out uh where they were funding three one million person uh camps
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:20.520]  and then of course they had the emergency centers act that was a law they tried to pass last year
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:27.400]  that just funded further and made public and put into law that the foreign military bases have been
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:32.120]  retrofitted to hold people during emergencies including terror attacks including political
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:36.280]  dissonance and we want to be able to round them up and put them in them and we need more funding
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:41.080]  to do it and there'll also be emergency centers during collapse and then you say well you're
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:45.960]  building these and they say yeah but those are for emergencies these aren't concentration camps
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:50.040]  though we have the rex 84 documents so that's exactly what they are so we'll be talking more
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:54.040]  about that and then i will get into the big cloning special it'll be for prison planet
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:58.680]  dot tv viewers only and audio stream listeners i'll just continue the show into the fourth hour
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:02.520]  i've got to quit doing this someday because starting september first i start the weeknight tv
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:08.760]  show uh that's why i cut the fourth hour a year ago or so so i could get around to do all this but
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:14.840]  then once i once i'm hot on the trail of something uh like a beagle chasing a fox or something i
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:21.160]  think you know there's no stopping us uh here now i got contacted a month or two ago when this
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:25.400]  first happened and i was aware of their show here on the genesis uh network syndicated by
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:30.920]  genesis on amon FM stations around the country and i meant to get them on but i said well not today
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:35.800]  ted the owner of genesis i want to look at the case first and then time passed and i forgot to
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:41.640]  look at the case but since then i have uh and uh headline world net daily it's also up at the
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:49.560]  drudge report today rachel madow msnbc sued for defamation left-wing television commentators
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:56.840]  must be made to respect the law and i remember hearing about a supposed speech uh a prayer at
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:01.400]  the minnesota legislature and that they'd said in the news they said kill gay people
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:04.920]  and then i went and found the text of it and they didn't say anything like that it was really weird
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:11.160]  and then they ran around knitting all over tv uh about it freaking out about the tea parties
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:15.560]  want to kill us and all this stuff uh and it just shows the division hey you don't want government
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:19.800]  health care you want to kill black people you know you don't like black people they they just throw
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:25.960]  this nonsensical stuff in there and you know uh in the rise of the right uh rise the new right
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:29.640]  that they aired last year and again this year that they've aired more than 10 times on msnbc
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:34.920]  it ends saying that ron paul and i want violence they took out of context what we said about the
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:40.440]  founders and you know edited the clips together and i guess i could sue them for that but and i'm
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:45.240]  not blaming these guys for suing i understand why they are i don't blame world net daily for suing
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:49.880]  vanity fair uh you know for lying and saying their book had been recalled i mean that's
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:53.960]  economic devastation but but where are the lawsuits against media matters saying they're
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.280]  going to infiltrate fox news news core and other quote libertarian and conservative
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.240]  news sites you know what that means glenn beck alex jones were the folks they attack every day on
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:09.640]  that george soros funded outfit and uh i mean they're saying and the memo came out in uh
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:14.760]  politico from now four months ago and politico was very supportive of it they love it it was
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.880]  basically we're we're going to infiltrate get involved in companies and destroy them from within
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:26.680]  i mean that is that is felony time so where is the charges well where are the charges on obama's
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:30.520]  people for shipping guns to mexico and lying about it and that's now been testified in congress
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:35.880]  that yes the white house was informed and was in command of it well of course they were the fbi
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:41.000]  and dea were involved not just atf and that we have that clip later we have time we'll play that
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.240]  from the actual situation but joining us from new york they're normally in minneapolis st
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:52.760]  paul but they're there right now for their lawsuit against uh uh miss madal are the folks involved
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:58.520]  in this suit but bradley dean and jake mcmillan other listeners of the show they've sent me their
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:04.840]  books and music before it's a really interesting information uh and the bible is the rock upon
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:13.720]  which our republic rest sons of liberty radio show and uh they uh join us uh here today uh so you
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:19.800]  guys are suing msnbc rachel madal tell us tell us you know the real story of what happened and you
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.920]  tried to get retractions and she just laughed at you well about a year ago alex thanks for having
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:31.800]  us by the way you bet we were actually making a comment on the radio and the comment was basically
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:38.440]  and how what i said i once made a reference to how even muslims oppose homosexuality under shari
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:43.240]  law but at no point did i suggest that i condone the methods that radical muslims used to enforce
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:49.320]  shari law and what happened is they took what i said and what i said is the muslims are calling
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:54.840]  for the execution of homosexuals in america from washington dc the homosexual communities picked
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:39:01.240]  it up and turned it that bradley dean was advocating the execution of homosexuals yeah that's funny
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:06.040]  they won't criticize the radical muslims for that because that's taboo and political correctness
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:11.960]  they'll only criticize christians if you say don't teach my five-year-old how to uh you know
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:17.960]  have any type of sex leave our kids alone and then they twist that and knowingly convoluted
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:22.600]  with malice of forethought with attempts to do harm that's exactly right and and really what
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:27.320]  this is not about i want to say this right up front is this isn't about attacking any particular
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:33.000]  people it's about protecting a particular people that are being attacked namely be young in public
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  high schools and that's what this is really about and what they want to do is they want to keep me
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.560]  on the defense so they can stay on the offense and they want to create a monster so they can
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:47.160]  continuously play the victim all over the country it is a fact and i wouldn't want heterosexuals uh
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:52.120]  you know recruiting seven-year-olds they target children and i don't i can't even say on the radio
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:58.200]  what's been for 20 years taught but they they teach people sexual acts that can kill you i mean
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:02.120]  we're talking about well fisting ladies and gentlemen things like that are taught to seven
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:07.240]  year olds please continue okay and basically what happened is i put a disclaimer out once the
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:12.760]  accusation came out through a george soros outlet and once that came out we put the disclaimer out
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.640]  it was out there the next day before we knew it we were up on rachel maddow's pay uh you know her
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:23.320]  outlet and what she had did is basically pulled up my disclaimer denouncing what they were saying
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:29.240]  that i was advocating well a year later you know just most recently a couple months back she comes
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:34.120]  back out on the radio again or on her television program and then she says that i'm advocating
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:40.840]  the execution of homosexual and what she said this time around was that we were blood thirsty and
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:46.680]  we were calling for the upping of the bloodshed of america's culture wars by omitting my disclaimer
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:52.280]  this time around helix she says since christians weren't doing enough to kill dave and lesbians
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:58.920]  yeah she said that as if you had said it completely it wasn't anywhere near what you'd said and
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:03.800]  correct me if i'm wrong that was a few months ago when you had a prayer at the minnesota legislature
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:10.600]  so she spun that you were giving prayers saying kill kill people uh at the state house i mean just
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:18.040]  total and complete scyops directly funded with banker bailout money by barack hussein obama
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:25.080]  over 2000 outlets from the east coast to the west coast to texas to minnesota over 2000 outlets
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:30.040]  reported on my prayer and not one person asked me one question and it had nothing to do with
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:34.280]  homosexual it was on the news that you gave a prayer at the legislature saying murder murder
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:39.640]  gay people now now now now expanding on this uh from what i've read in the press releases and
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:44.360]  things you guys contacted them you made it clear over and over again and they just demonically
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:49.320]  snickered they did in every sense of the word they ignored it and they kept maintaining that i
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:53.480]  was advocating execution of homeless and alex i think that's part of the point of this suit
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:58.120]  when is enough and we're sick of people saying you know it's so evil it's so bad what they do
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:02.760]  and taking no action and that is the poor importance of this case because number one it's protecting
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:08.360]  our future posterity our next generation we're putting our walk where our talk is and we're saying
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:12.920]  this is enough you need to be held accountable nobody should get away with this no matter what
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:18.760]  we don't care if it's mbc msnbc fox news any of those sources media cannot be covered like this
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:23.000]  because if they didn't have a why they would have nothing to prop up we need to have upright coverage
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.600]  we believe in people's first amendment right that's why you're on the radio alex that's why
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:32.120]  we're on the radio at sundelibertyradio.com this is to set a precedent to bring media to
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:36.280]  accountability to the first amendment you can't just say what you want to do and cloak it under
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:40.840]  i have freedom of speech well i think you need to absolutely absolutely you know i've had to
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:45.400]  sue somebody once because just out of the blue they said i was a drug dealer i mean i've never
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:50.120]  even i mean i barely even experimented with drugs in high school i was a jock i mean you know i
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:54.360]  smoked marijuana here and there tried this or that never liked it and and you know here and i'm
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:59.000]  very honest about that and here's somebody just because they're jealous or whatever makes up that
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.560]  i'm a you know and i was forced to do something there i had a stalker messing with my sister the
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:07.640]  police wouldn't do anything i had to sue them so i can't be a hypocrite and tell you that i don't like
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:13.160]  you know lawsuits i still don't like them but i understand when somebody really drags your name
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:17.000]  to the mud and you guys have talked about this has really hurt you i mean folks think that you're
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:22.600]  calling for for the murder of people when you never did anything like that and uh so so so tell us
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:27.320]  about the lawsuit where is this going yeah basically what it has been and you're right alex i mean
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:31.880]  just your name info wars is important it's an information war and when one side is just telling
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:36.200]  lies constantly and they're not held accountable for it gee i wonder who's going to come up with
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:42.680]  the most creative uh disaster about information it has to be truth and has to be upright this suit
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:47.480]  its purpose nobody wants to do lawsuits we're not looking forward to this this isn't fun to us we
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:53.720]  get to sue msnbc that's not what this is about we need actually we're an unprofile organization so
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:57.400]  we need folks help to even carry this out but we have to cut that a precedent that is the
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:02.440]  importance of this issue the suit started right now we filed a complaint this morning in washington
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:07.400]  dc our attorney is larry claimant uh who is the founder of judicial watch and freedom watch
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.720]  and uh he's a heavy hitter and he's somebody that believes in our faith our morals and our values
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:16.600]  and believes in the first amendment right as well the suit now will continue obviously these things
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:20.840]  generally get long time and drug out but it's important for folks like you and we appreciate
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:25.320]  you have us on the show alex to be able to get the exposure out to people out there so they know
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:31.720]  what's really going on sure well look i mean when they i mean i've seen matthews play clips of a woman
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:38.440]  complaining about the jet fleet of congress because i saw the full clip in texas then she
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:42.440]  cut to talking about how they've increased spending at the white house they're telling us tie our
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:47.480]  belts and they said well that woman said that because she doesn't like michelle obama because
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:52.440]  she's black i mean that right there is saying you're a racist that can really hurt you in life
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:58.440]  and business you got it when i mean they throw this stuff around saying you want to murder people
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:03.800]  you're calling for bloody wars they're saying other people are racist out of a clear blue sky
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:08.840]  and they and they do it with this demonic race pimping giggle they know full well they're just
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:14.360]  cold bloodedly uh you know playing people off against each other and whether you win lose or
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:20.920]  draw this will definitely make uh rachel madow think twice about the type of stuff she does
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:25.160]  you got it you got it and you know what that's that's exactly the signal they are accountable for
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:29.240]  and justice is going to send that the best way alex so all of your listeners listening right now
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:33.160]  maybe they're in situations like this too look just because we're right and just because we have
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:38.760]  the truth does not mean that you fall down and play victim to or allow them to play the victim
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:42.040]  to what you're doing there's a time where you have to stand up and do something again
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:47.240]  Bradley and our mission was son to liberty radio dot com is to reach this next generation
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:51.720]  we don't want them to look at us as you know conservatives as people of faith as people
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:55.400]  that have morals and values of belief in the constitution as a bunch of weaklings that weren't
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:59.720]  willing to stand up for the next generation rally's done a great job of doing that you saw
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:04.040]  through the capital prayer you can see all the footage of that at sons of liberty radio dot com
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:09.000]  but we need to stand up for those things as you are alex and and your radio show and all of your
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:14.920]  new ventures that you're into we applaud you as well well all i know is that they want to keep the
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:21.320]  debate off into these distractions and diversions and playing us off against each other and i you've
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:26.520]  got a sewer i guess because you know you guys didn't say this you were quoting somebody else
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:32.840]  uh and and and you know making a point and why doesn't rachel matt out talk about what the radical
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:39.000]  muslims said instead of lying and saying that christians did it and ms you there's one issue i
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.120]  think you should make front and center and all of this that i would use as a platform to also
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:50.120]  point out that they got banker bailout money and say and we want this money to come from rachel matt
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:56.840]  out herself and the executives not from just more american taxpayer money that's another way to point
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:01.480]  out they're arrogant and because i mean media wouldn't allow this in the past because they've
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:07.400]  got white house backing and george soros backing and that's admitted they're in a war i mean vanity
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:12.200]  fair five years ago wouldn't print an article saying that the where's the birth certificate had been
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:16.840]  recalled when it hadn't been and when they knew it hadn't been unless they were desperate i mean
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:23.480]  they're really trying to play their mafia tactics against us uh and as this uh you know i i hope she
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:29.160]  enjoys the depositions i hope she enjoys it all i i hope the executives over there enjoy it because
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:32.920]  even if they beat the rap they're not going to beat the ride gentlemen thank you so much for
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:36.520]  joining us we look forward to speaking to you again very very soon thanks for having us fellas
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:42.520]  you bet and we'll watch this thank you we'll watch as it unfolds yeah saying that someone
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:46.840]  is calling for killing people is their favorite tactic i've played the clips here where they take
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:52.440]  out of context uh what i said about the founding fathers and the second amendment what ron paul
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:57.560]  said and then they said that we were calling for violence anyone who knows the show knows
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:02.360]  that we're calling for the opposite of that we're trying to fix things peacefully and we're against
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.880]  the violence of the state trying to force us to you know to take part in in in all of their
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:12.840]  corruption now i want to go back to sarah in kentucky sarah specifically because i'm always
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:17.320]  ranting and raving and interrupting you know and everybody mentions the subject go back into this
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.680]  so you guys got we're doing a contract for hewlett packer with fema you got into their purchase
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:27.320]  orders for emergency relocation centers i pointed out that that stuff's actually come out in the
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:34.040]  news separately with their internment specialist and new camps uh they just don't call them
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:38.680]  concentration camps they go there are no camps kooks there's emergency relocation centers and we
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:44.120]  have the emergency relocation act and they play these games but they've been maneuvering us
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:50.760]  towards economic collapse so the crisis of dependent non-self-sufficient people is so bad
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:56.360]  they can really break our back and bring us into total communitarianism in agenda 21 so so recap
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:03.320]  exactly what these documents said and what you saw now i i didn't read a whole lot of it he was on
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:09.640]  there and you know it's kind of confusing because it's tiny but it it basically goes through each
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:15.720]  individual bid it's just a whole long list of bids and they were for different locations
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:23.640]  all of them in southeastern in the southeastern part of the united states and we counted up
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:29.560]  as many as we could and there were about 35 different centers you know it wasn't like
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:35.560]  you know here's a link for this or a link for that it was just basically a straight line
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.560]  bid you know there's a bid out for this there's a bid out for that
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:47.800]  and uh it was scary to look at because he didn't even want to tell me about it he knows i listened
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:54.360]  to you uh he knows i've watched in game he watched camp female with me and so he didn't even want to
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:50:03.240]  tell me about it and and what is his view of this i mean i guess i mean if they come to pick
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:08.680]  up us on our families do we i guess the american people have american flags out and spit on uh
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:12.920]  patriots maybe ron paul being changed and you know though i mean i mean is that well i guess
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:20.760]  america will go along with that or i don't know what his view on it is to be honest he uh i know
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:28.200]  that he's waking up he's not really all the way there he's not as enthusiastic and as sure about
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:37.720]  it as i am uh i've kind of been breaking him in and uh now again you're in an internal bid system
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:42.360]  as contractors and we're able to see there's quite a few of those have leaked out we need more folks to
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:48.280]  publish those and go public you had something else dad well i was gonna also add that i work for
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:55.880]  public health in kentucky and we've got a major uh immigration program going on where we're bringing

[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:54.760]  this is you know that's what's frustrating and why i got mad at glenbeck because i want to
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:59.880]  believe in glenbeck i mean i promote lewdobbs he's not perfect judge napolitano because they're
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:06.520]  they're the same year to year like ron paul i mean that's what they're real i don't even have to
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:11.240]  totally agree with somebody on every issue i do with ron paul as long as you're real and are a good
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:16.440]  person and i want to get off into glenbeck it's just that we sent him emails we sent him packages
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:21.880]  the purchase orders for the camps the admissions the rex 84 congressional hearings i know folks in
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:27.080]  his organization did see it i was told i sent a letter to beck and i was told by another fox
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:32.360]  news host he got mad it was that public letter but an open letter to glenbeck where i was really
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:37.960]  heartfelt and said don't be a traitor maybe you're ignorant supposedly he got really angry by it
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:42.200]  and he came out and said fema camps aren't real after building it up for a month saying it wasn't
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:48.280]  i mean saying it was real uh and and then i've got the houston chronicle on it i've got the
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:53.800]  wall street journal i've got the purchase orders and i mean it's not funny i've been to urban warfare
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:56:00.920]  drills 12 years ago where they practice to take our guns in america this isn't a game and it's
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:05.320]  public the troops are trying to take guns two years ago the army times had a quote saying
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:10.440]  north com is preparing to pull treggers on americans read the john warren defense authorization act
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:16.760]  look at what's happening this isn't a game we're all in danger our children our future every time
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:22.360]  i look at my children my blood boils because they're innocent they're good they're sweet they're loving
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:26.920]  and the whole world wants to wreck their innocence and wreck their future and wreck your children's
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:33.320]  future and it's the naive atta it's not even the evil that's destroying our world as thomas
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:40.680]  jefferson said it's not the evil it's that good men do nothing and you've got to start respecting
[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:46.680]  yourself i am not even that smart i am not the best there is but i'm somebody who's ready to
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:51.320]  fight ready to get involved i don't care what people think about me i don't care what people
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:56.120]  say about me or make fun of me or attack me or lie about me at the end of the day because i know
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:02.920]  i'm right and i'm on a mission to expose these criminals and if you don't have chills running
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:07.960]  up and down the back of your spine out there at the things that are happening you don't have
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:13.080]  any type of common sense or any type of survival instinct and no discernment
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:21.640]  and if you think of fighting tyranny as as a hassle it's not a hassle it's it's an absolute
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:29.160]  compulsion to not want to be a slave and to see tyranny as a threat and to instinctively be threatened
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:35.560]  by it you know tyranny as i've said a hundred times doesn't just sit at one spot it either gets
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:40.280]  worse or it gets reversed it either is on its heels or it's coming down like a hurricane
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:46.440]  and government is a dangerous servant a fearful master like fire as george washington said
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:56.040]  god love him and we are repeating history right now we are repeating history right now
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:01.480]  oh you think it's corny to love george washington you don't know about george washington and
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:06.040]  andrew jackson who weren't perfect men but they were real folks and they did love freedom and
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:10.600]  they did care about it the idea of liberty george washington was offered to be king and he said i
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:17.000]  don't want that i want to go to my farm that's the kind of leaders we need people that take the
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.400]  responsibility of leadership because they care about people not because they're a bunch of preening

[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:55.560]  my friends i am here to warn you i am here to alert you to the greatest threat to our species
[03:08:55.560 --> 03:09:04.040]  and our civilization on this planet humanity in just the last hundred years has increased its
[03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:11.400]  technological and scientific knowledge thousands and thousands of times what it was but we are
[03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:20.760]  still the same species that we were capable of magnificent heights but also of horrifying lows
[03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:29.000]  i want to talk to you about the greatest threat to human civilization and society today already
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:38.840]  irrevocably changing the genetic code of the biospheres on this planet and that is genetic
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:53.800]  engineering now i love science and technology i know that it's a neutral thing and that man
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:10:01.640]  can use it for good or bad but that said the controllers and engineers of our society
[03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:09.800]  are more than a hundred years have believed that if they can discover the secrets of life dna
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:17.080]  that they will have the keys to immortality and now you see all the different news articles
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:21.880]  where they openly brag about this and the elite says we don't need a giant population anymore
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:30.120]  to run our technological systems we're now phasing into robotics where the military's
[03:10:30.120 --> 03:10:37.320]  aircraft will be drone where combat robots will do the fighting or manufacturing will be carried on
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:45.320]  and executed by non biological systems so there is a arms race going on and a technological
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:54.280]  race going on right now dealing with genetic engineering and recently the fda has put into
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:11:02.920]  effect new policies that allow genetic engineering companies a predominantly big agra to put on the
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:13.480]  market any gmo organism they wish without even consulting the public now when you look at this
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:20.840]  it's not just gmo grass that takes less water it's not just gmo tomatoes that last longer on the shelf
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:27.640]  every genetic engineer i've talked to who worked at these large companies said that in the different
[03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:35.480]  studies of gmo potatoes rice you name it that there would be the side effect of reducing fertility
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:42.520]  in the rodents the rats the mice the guinea pigs that they tested it on those that ate the genetically
[03:11:42.520 --> 03:11:47.720]  engineered toy they didn't actually show the problems in the first generation the second
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:52.840]  generation was slower growth slower onset for maturity but by the third generation that's when
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:12:00.200]  nearly all of the adults had lost the ability to have babies and then later in primate studies
[03:12:00.200 --> 03:12:08.040]  with monkeys and apes the same thing happened and that along with the public trait that these
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:15.240]  organisms are being engineered for there are other traits quietly being built in as a trojan horse
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:21.160]  that cause biological changes in the body that increase cancer that reduce fertility
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:27.880]  and these developments are a lot further along than the public has even been told the information
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:35.320]  is available but it's not an issue that gets a lot of media play and even when i have the news
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:41.080]  articles and cover them on air i get emails and phone calls saying i'm a liar i'll never forget
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:48.280]  years ago covering news articles about spider goats part spider part goat to produce body armor
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:56.040]  in their udders in their mammary glands that can then be used as an industrial product a special
[03:12:56.040 --> 03:13:03.320]  component this is the very life force of the planet the very building blocks of the planet
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:10.600]  being scrambled together and people would call me and couldn't believe it even today
[03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:16.200]  i see news articles about spider goats and salmon that are been mixed with other insects and fish
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:23.400]  that will within 40 generations extinct the natural salmon that are in the ocean according
[03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:30.120]  to university studies and people just seem to not care we are being fed this stuff
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:37.000]  GMO crops have been infecting other crops but also other plants that are growing naturally
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:43.160]  and haven't been developed through hybridization when there's a nuclear disaster and increases
[03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:49.800]  cancer it causes a lot of illnesses but it tends to dissipate over time but with genetically
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:58.600]  engineered and altered organisms it doesn't go away it it mixes with other species and
[03:13:58.600 --> 03:14:05.160]  that's what i'm here to talk to you about what is the greatest threat to our species it is unchecked
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:12.920]  out of control genetic engineering being carried out by thousands of companies in tens of thousands
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:19.400]  of laboratories across the world i remember seven or eight years ago seeing in the washington post
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:26.200]  just a footnote in an article in their science section where they admitted that in Costa Rica
[03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:33.720]  there is widespread human animal clones being made and yes my friends you heard me right
[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:39.960]  in fact if you go back to the BBC news articles for more than a decade ago they admitted that
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:47.400]  they weren't just cloning humans that they were splicing them in one case with cow genetics bovine
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:54.840]  genetics show that the cow would not reject the human fetus growing inside of its uterus
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:15:01.960]  now why are they doing this they are growing the fetuses up to close to term
[03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:09.080]  uh reportedly and this is what we know about so that their organs can be harvested you have your
[03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:18.520]  clone produced with cow genetics in it so that uh your clone can be grown in a cow nearing the
[03:15:18.520 --> 03:15:24.520]  time that you need the liver transplant or kidney transplant or blood transfusions whatever the case
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:31.160]  is and then your clone is harvested from the womb of the cow or the artificial wombs that
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:38.840]  they've been developing and harvested um so that you can have an extended life and the issue here
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:43.720]  is we need to have a debate about this people see this as science fiction because in movies
[03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:49.800]  back in the 50s and 60s and 70s or in the island of dr maru uh this was written about
[03:15:50.600 --> 03:15:57.240]  many decades before that and so people have been preconditioned that this is fantasy and that this
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:04.680]  doesn't exist this is very real and i thought that i would uh raise this issue again because over
[03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:13.240]  the weekend i saw in the news of australia human animal hybrids created amid frankenstein warnings
[03:16:13.240 --> 03:16:19.800]  scientists in the uk have reportedly created more than 150 human animal hybrid embryos in
[03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:27.960]  controversial secretive lab experiments that spread over three years and there's another report here
[03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:36.520]  out of the daily mail uh who also reported on this issue a lot of things concern me and hopefully
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:42.520]  concern you with all of this but one issue is the media every time i've seen this reported
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:48.520]  in the last 15 years it's always the first time it's being reported and they always say it's been
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:54.760]  going on for three to five years well the first time i saw this confirmed that human clones
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:17:03.240]  had been created but terminated before term before they were born was in the bbc 95 96 you can pull
[03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:11.720]  it up i saw it again in 97 98 99 i've seen it in scientific publications and in china they have
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:18.040]  totally embraced this system they're not only creating human animal clones that resemble humans
[03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:24.600]  they've also created cows that are parts human and create human breast milk in their udders
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:31.640]  in the last hundred years governments began working on bio weapons the imperial japanese the
[03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:37.640]  germans angle in the united states trance many other governments and they always centered in
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:44.600]  and around race specific bio weapons that would wipe out a certain uh quote race of people whether
[03:17:44.600 --> 03:17:50.920]  it was blacks arabs jews governments have worked on them all the problem in this research is they
[03:17:50.920 --> 03:17:58.680]  find that humans are so interconnected and share our genetics across the board that this is unfeasible
[03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:04.600]  until now now the number one danger here is that governments when they began to work on
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:11.960]  bio weapons first tried to take zoological bio weapons like abola that affected apes and monkeys
[03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:17.080]  and cross it over to humans and there's evidence that that's what's happened with abola now governments
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:22.440]  in the name of defense are working on airborne abola that will kill 99 percent of us that it
[03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:28.200]  comes in contact with then you discover that the ruling elite are obsessed with world government
[03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:34.040]  being a mechanism to carry out the orderly extermination of the global population we
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:40.280]  covered that in my seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement free here on the web at
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:44.440]  youtube at least for now we're being censored more and more please get that film get out to
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:51.240]  everyone you know so you've got insects animal genes reptile genes being engineered into fish
[03:18:51.240 --> 03:18:58.520]  and being released open water you've got human cross species clones growing inside of cows so
[03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:04.120]  they can harvest the organs ladies and gentlemen they talk about animal rights what about human
[03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:11.880]  rights they're mixing plant and animal with human and this will allow cross species diseases
[03:19:12.920 --> 03:19:21.080]  to spread easier into populations it will give rise to mutant viruses and other mutagenic
[03:19:21.720 --> 03:19:27.880]  microorganisms that could create plagues the likes of which this earth has never seen and there
[03:19:27.880 --> 03:19:33.640]  are thousands of different laboratories across the world working on these systems we're already
[03:19:33.640 --> 03:19:38.440]  seeing clear evidence that genetically engineered crops are what's causing all of these incredible
[03:19:38.440 --> 03:19:43.880]  allergies it's what's destroying our immune systems more and more governments are moving to
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:50.520]  not even let the public know when they're eating gmo food all right we'll be back with a conclusion
[03:19:50.520 --> 03:19:57.960]  of genetic armageddon humanity's greatest threat on the other side please spread this video to

[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:24.680]  filed a grievance against the united states concerning human rights violations if we accept
[03:20:24.680 --> 03:20:32.840]  the united nations norm for human rights we'll lose our national sovereignty they hate arizona

[03:22:58.760 --> 03:23:04.920]  there's a man named dr walloch who is anything but your typical doctor both a veterinary and a
[03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:11.080]  naturopathic physician doc asks why does the united states spend more money on health care by far
[03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:16.280]  and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide he believes that people should empower
[03:23:16.280 --> 03:23:21.800]  themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition taking charge of their life and attain optimal
[03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:27.400]  health and longevity through nutrition not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects
[03:23:27.400 --> 03:23:32.360]  this is clearly a deadly recipe the good news is doc walloch's message is resonating with an
[03:23:32.360 --> 03:23:37.560]  increasing number of americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation
[03:23:37.560 --> 03:23:41.960]  of our health care system i like what doc walloch is saying and doing to enlighten people
[03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:46.760]  about health care and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message
[03:23:46.760 --> 03:23:52.360]  visit info wars team dot com and listen to dr walloch's deadly recipes lecture it makes a lot
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:23:59.080]  of sense and i want you to join our info wars team go to info wars team dot com that's info wars
[03:23:59.080 --> 03:24:06.360]  team dot com that genetically engineered crops are what's causing all of these incredible allergies
[03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:11.320]  it's what's destroying our immune systems more and more governments are moving to not even let
[03:24:11.320 --> 03:24:17.320]  the public know when they're eating gmo food they're coming out with cloned beef cloned chicken
[03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:24.120]  cloned fish but not just cloned cross species when you read the industry publications of these
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:31.400]  biotech companies bragging about the part human part animal creatures they're creating they say
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:37.880]  that it was essential from the beginning that they do this so that the clones not have rights
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:46.280]  when they mix chimpanzee with a human embryo and play god they then claim that these
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:53.480]  poor creatures they've created have no rights and listen to me carefully here if this has been
[03:24:53.480 --> 03:24:59.800]  going on for 15 years and is now only being introduced to the public can you imagine what's
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:06.680]  been going on in secret and government laboratories and private corporate laboratories across the
[03:25:06.680 --> 03:25:12.600]  planet that's why the global engineers are so arrogant they have been playing god for a long
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:18.040]  time they are taking the successes from their research and shelving it under national security
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:25.560]  for themselves if humanity survives with the history of this time is written our progeny will
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:33.240]  marvel that we ever survived and they will marvel at the unmitigated recklessness of the ruling class
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:39.720]  and what they're doing the rates of cancers and diabetes have doubled in the last decade we are
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:46.040]  being tested upon this is such a nightmare by the psychopathic technocrats the same government
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:51.480]  and corporate institutions that are caught worldwide giving children live polio and syphilis shots
[03:25:52.120 --> 03:25:57.640]  the same people caught funding forced abortions in china they are engaged in this mad testing
[03:25:57.640 --> 03:26:03.160]  in a race for the fount of youth while they endanger the entire species and the planet
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:09.800]  in the process this is the threat not fake terrorism not mass shootings not all of these
[03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:15.000]  diversions that they use to sell us on having government take over our lives the threat is
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:21.400]  this globalist banking cartel in control of the scientific method and almost all research funds
[03:26:21.400 --> 03:26:29.400]  on the planet playing god this makes nuclear weapons look like child's play and the psychopathic
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:37.320]  ruling class is selling all of this as inevitable you will be assimilated by the borg basically
[03:26:37.320 --> 03:26:43.560]  that transhumanism set up by the eugenicist all this huxley is the way to go and that they're
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:48.440]  just going to do this and it doesn't matter they have thrown it in our face and we're not even
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:54.440]  having a debate or a discussion about it we are being poisoned and manipulated to the food and the
[03:26:54.440 --> 03:27:00.680]  water it is admitted we are under attack there is a revolution against free humanity through
[03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:06.920]  the eugenicist mindset of the globalist i'm alex jones reporting from the front lines of the info
[03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:16.520]  war you have been warned now please warn others ask yourselves what are you doing in this time
[03:27:16.520 --> 03:27:25.000]  a great challenge what are you doing to unlock mine go to info wars dot com and person planet dot tv
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:32.680]  for the latest headlines and cutting-edge information all right ladies and gentlemen we
[03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:40.280]  are back live and we're going to post an article titled genetic armageddon humanity's greatest threat
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:47.400]  and i hope that you will get that youtube video out and make it go super viral to everyone
[03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:57.800]  we sleep they live we are unconscious worried about this false habitat false reality created by
[03:27:57.800 --> 03:28:11.000]  the image makers of britney spears and winehouse and oj simpson lebron james bill clinton these are
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:21.880]  just front people the scientific elite are in a race to test on us to develop systems for their
[03:28:21.880 --> 03:28:28.520]  families not ours so they're testing systems to dumb us down to poison us but in the process
[03:28:28.520 --> 03:28:34.120]  developing life extension systems for themselves i mean a that's what the documentation and the
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:43.960]  history and the facts show 100 but b that's also common sense what would unlimitedly wealthy
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:49.960]  powerful people be into life extension and what is ray Kurzweil and the whole transcendent man
[03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:55.720]  thing doing he says he doesn't believe in god yet he's going to be a god the elite are going to be
[03:28:55.720 --> 03:29:02.040]  gods well whether that's anywhere feasible or not even living quote you know thousands of years
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:07.960]  like he says they will the issue is they believe it and they're selling us the junk end of what
