[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:32.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.920 --> 00:38.480]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for joining us it's September 15th
[00:38.480 --> 00:47.240]  on this Wednesday 2010 transmission I got a call last night Joe Rogan host of ultimate
[00:47.240 --> 00:55.920]  fighting is in town and he was inviting me tonight to see the UFC and I said hey why
[00:55.920 --> 01:03.760]  don't you come into studio and get his view on politics and quote conspiracies and Eddie
[01:03.760 --> 01:15.400]  Bravo who is a jujitsu master he's also going to be in studio with Joe today so that's coming
[01:15.400 --> 01:20.720]  up in the third hour because they're here in Austin Texas so we look forward to talking
[01:20.720 --> 01:27.360]  to both of those guys I've known Joe for 12 years now time certainly flies a news radio
[01:27.360 --> 01:34.200]  fear factor movies many other television shows he had of course his own television show on
[01:34.200 --> 01:40.720]  comedy central the man show and you know Joe does a lot of research on the whole global
[01:40.720 --> 01:47.960]  government system but I want to get his take on the fact that humanity has got such advanced
[01:47.960 --> 01:56.600]  technologies and they're just accelerating at a light speed rate and that our civilization
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.960]  is in a lot of danger so we'll have a discussion about that with Joe and some other things
[02:01.960 --> 02:08.280]  as well and I'll ask him what he thinks of the UFC as being a modern gladiatorial event
[02:08.280 --> 02:12.600]  and what 20 years from now 10 years from now the way things are getting more extreme well
[02:12.600 --> 02:18.640]  they have battle axes in there hacking each other up so we'll be discussing that and also
[02:18.640 --> 02:25.120]  I agree with Joe on his views about total desensitization in fact last night I was talking to my mom
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.440]  and she was discussing her grandmother back in the 60s was over at their house and she
[02:30.440 --> 02:38.960]  saw I dream of Jeannie and she was just shocked by the fact that the woman's navel was visible
[02:38.960 --> 02:45.680]  and now you can make fun of people who who were shocked by things like that but civilizations
[02:45.680 --> 02:49.360]  have been wild and decadent and crazy before and people figure out hey we better control
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.400]  this to some level or it causes society to collapse because it's a slippery slope now
[02:54.400 --> 03:02.920]  look at media now look at the culture people see millions and millions over their lifetimes
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.360]  of simulated murders and deaths and torture and every time I go to a movie to analyze
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.960]  it I'm not really a fan of really violent films just because I realize how serious it
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.800]  is unless it's in a serious context I would have liked to been in the theater when the
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.200]  road came out a few years ago I saw it on DVD and was profoundly affected by it because
[03:23.200 --> 03:29.640]  I've studied so much history I know how accurate it was dealing with cannibalism and deprivation
[03:29.640 --> 03:34.360]  I would wonder if people would laugh and giggle at inappropriate things while watching that
[03:34.360 --> 03:39.240]  movie because when I do watch other violent films and children are being kidnapped and
[03:39.240 --> 03:43.600]  killed people laugh in the audience it's not an uncomfortable laugh they think it's trendy
[03:43.600 --> 03:49.440]  and cool to think all of this is cute and it's because they have disassociated themselves
[03:49.440 --> 03:55.680]  from reality somebody who's shocked by images of violence and death someone you know setting
[03:55.680 --> 04:00.280]  themselves on fire or blowing their brains out you know there's real footage of that
[04:00.280 --> 04:06.920]  out there on the web back in Vietnam people were shocked by the image of children who'd
[04:06.920 --> 04:13.320]  been napalm with their skin burned off people were shocked by the image of Vietnamese police
[04:13.320 --> 04:19.800]  you know blowing a man's head off in the street but now people are like big deal they laugh
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.200]  about it and they think it's cute and it's because A they don't know history B they
[04:26.200 --> 04:35.920]  don't have common sense and C they haven't experienced trauma and this has all been done
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.640]  by design so that when your neighbors are being abused by the jackbooted thugs or when
[04:40.640 --> 04:46.520]  the CPS is taking your kids you're you're you're even your own family isn't going to
[04:46.520 --> 04:51.360]  be shocked by it and just accept that bad things happen because the mind sees all this
[04:51.360 --> 04:59.760]  simulated violence on television as as real and so it can't differentiate between fact
[04:59.760 --> 05:05.200]  this is Alex Jones with key information the mainstream media is now admitting that we're

[11:35.400 --> 11:40.200]  like every day is the twilight zone with all of this it's the twilight zone to have the
[11:40.200 --> 11:46.800]  private federal reserve in the last two years in the bush and now obama administration the
[11:46.800 --> 11:53.520]  new york head of the fed the chairman of the fed the treasury secretaries they get up before
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.720]  congress they all say i'm not going to tell you where the money is and the senators and
[11:57.720 --> 12:04.200]  house members say where's the money to senate paul stern they all ask the question where's
[12:04.200 --> 12:08.200]  the money issa where's the money where's this trillion where's that eight hundred billion
[12:08.200 --> 12:12.800]  where's this three trillion and they just say i'm not going to tell you just like six years
[12:12.800 --> 12:18.800]  ago rumsfeld is before the arm services house committee and they say okay two trillion was
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.160]  missing when you came into office now it's four plus trillion where's the money and he
[12:24.160 --> 12:31.040]  goes well let me consult the at the time head of the pentagon office of budget dr chew we
[12:31.040 --> 12:35.440]  played this clip many times dr chew and dr chew says we're not going to tell you where
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.200]  the money is and then it's like watching gangsters up there and they just say we're not going
[12:40.200 --> 12:47.280]  to tell you we're going to do what we want how we want i mean we're so far down the road
[12:47.280 --> 12:57.880]  of just bonkers insanity it's like dinecore was caught in 99 and caught in 2000 2001 2002
[12:57.880 --> 13:05.520]  through the last year dbc chicago tribune major news articles that when i was reading
[13:05.520 --> 13:09.600]  them i couldn't even believe it that dinecore has been caught in eastern europe and wherever
[13:09.600 --> 13:17.000]  they have military bases running giant slave rings white slavery that's sexual slavery
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.640]  every time i say white slavery i get emails going don't you care about black slavery
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.060]  white slavery is sexual slavery nothing to do with being white and but these are predominantly
[13:26.060 --> 13:36.280]  white women and then i find out you know i know how much i don't know and then about
[13:36.280 --> 13:42.120]  six months ago i get a phone call in an email because she was listening to the show from
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.640]  a researcher and she says alex you didn't know that in most states the biggest private
[13:47.640 --> 13:56.040]  contractor for cps is dinecore catherine austin fits called me and sent me the info and and
[13:56.040 --> 14:02.000]  then i just searched dinecore cps contracts and they're the biggest contractor in texas
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.160]  and they're running the child kidnapping here but through just the cover of oh we're protecting
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.680]  hurt children but then every day i see articles from texas to new york to florida california
[14:13.680 --> 14:19.160]  michigan every day sometimes not every day but then i'll see three in one day i mean
[14:19.160 --> 14:27.260]  on average it's every time i look at news scanning through it where there's a crackhead
[14:27.260 --> 14:32.960]  woman that the cps knows isn't feeding her four-year-old who weighs 15 pounds and the
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.600]  girl dies or there's some white trash person pulling their child's teeth out with pliers
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.400]  and they know and don't stop them well they don't want a crackhead baby they don't want
[14:43.400 --> 14:53.360]  some white trash baby they want middle-class healthy blonde-haired blue-eyed babies that's
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.800]  why if you are a good-looking wife and you're a good-looking man and they know your kids
[14:57.800 --> 15:02.920]  or what the adoption agencies get in some cases half a million dollars for and they
[15:02.920 --> 15:10.360]  get a cut of it your child could have a crooked toenail they're gone and dinecore is a coming
[15:10.360 --> 15:17.320]  i mean again all you police out there and an fb i and the rest of you who are compartmentalized
[15:17.320 --> 15:21.200]  i've got the news here today where they're getting ready to start taking federal employees
[15:21.200 --> 15:28.360]  pensions state employees pensions i mean do you think if dinecore can publicly kidnap
[15:28.360 --> 15:34.040]  kids nationwide through color of law fraud and then openly pure kidnapping overseas
[15:34.040 --> 15:42.040]  not even the pretense of color of law do you think if they killed a million plus iraqis
[15:42.040 --> 15:46.560]  in the last seven and a half years that they care anymore about you if they'll take the
[15:46.560 --> 15:54.520]  death benefits and have a agreement a secret agreement with the va to to to to tell people
[15:54.520 --> 16:02.160]  to sign up for these and not tell them what the fine prince says and steal their money
[16:02.160 --> 16:10.800]  i mean what's next see we have to understand i have to understand the psychology we're
[16:10.800 --> 16:16.960]  all under because i tend to say we're in iraq we're in afghanistan no we are not the corporate
[16:16.960 --> 16:25.560]  borg that's taken over our government is in control of our military it's dismantling
[16:25.560 --> 16:31.760]  our bill of rights and constitution that protects us from tyranny and now the sky's the limit
[16:31.760 --> 16:38.600]  the bottom is falling out of this thing and we all of us need to get it through our heads
[16:38.600 --> 16:47.200]  this is not our government the world government is real it is oppressive it is murderous it's
[16:47.200 --> 16:51.700]  in game is set up a high tech police state grid bankrupt everybody to get us into the
[16:51.700 --> 17:00.680]  system and then start carrying out even more obvious sterilization and euthanasia i mean
[17:00.680 --> 17:08.000]  do you think we just got up on air all these years and just made up death panels i mean
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.720]  now bill gates is out saying death panels are good and there's after they get everybody
[17:12.720 --> 17:16.800]  into a government health care system now we've all got a quote share instead of expanding
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.120]  the pie they say hey we could hire 10 teachers or fire 10 teachers but we got to kill one
[17:22.120 --> 17:27.880]  gram on to do it and they put that image out and that message out to all the government
[17:27.880 --> 17:34.200]  workers telling them hey big cuts are coming if you want to keep your pension fund if you
[17:34.200 --> 17:38.640]  want to keep your health care if you want to keep your job you better get on the bandwagon
[17:38.640 --> 17:45.280]  to not give people over 60 insurance paid lasix procedures to fix their eyes you better
[17:45.280 --> 17:50.160]  get behind dehydrating people who can talk they strap them down and kill them that's
[17:50.160 --> 17:55.460]  the wall street journal Wesley smith he's a top lawyer works with Ralph nader he's a
[17:55.460 --> 18:02.200]  liberal Kurt Nemo's got a big story on this coming out in the next 30 minutes where they
[18:02.200 --> 18:07.000]  name the names of people who are paralyzed chest down who the family signs them over
[18:07.000 --> 18:15.760]  to government custody and they come in and start shooting them up with morphine and
[18:15.760 --> 18:21.200]  tie them down to their bed and dehydrate them over 14 days the media use terry shy though
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.280]  because she looked like she was brain dead so that she could be the poster child to have
[18:26.280 --> 18:32.880]  the debate about so oh well they just killed that lady who looks like a vegetable when
[18:32.880 --> 18:39.120]  meanwhile the news won't give major attention to the fact that they've got death panels
[18:39.120 --> 18:46.360]  where people actually in the netherlands and in some of those other Scandinavian countries
[18:46.360 --> 18:54.080]  north of there actually have bracelets and tattoos saying do not kill me I mean they
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.320]  kill people ladies and gentlemen they kill you they deny you care and that's what these
[18:59.320 --> 19:04.920]  bioethesis boards are all about and everybody's so shocked I'm getting all these emails Alex
[19:04.920 --> 19:08.640]  you were telling the truth you know now they admit death panels and it's all over the news
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.920]  and they're saying how great it is well of course it's in there that's what these bioethesis
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.760]  boards are they play the part of God and if you know the first people to be killed in

[25:42.360 --> 25:47.720]  scores of these well pennsylvania homeland security puts anti-tax protesters on list
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.100]  of terrorist threats who they believe may attack the infrastructure and they say that
[25:53.100 --> 26:01.240]  by trying to cut taxes that threatens the infrastructure threatens the government i thought we the people
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.600]  are the government and so they're listed as terrorists the pittsburgh tribune review reports
[26:05.600 --> 26:12.720]  pennsylvania democrat governor ed renell is deeply embarrassed by the disclosure that
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.680]  senate homeland security officials have designated anti-tax protesters and other folks exercising
[26:18.680 --> 26:22.760]  their first amendment rights to petition the government as a threat to the state's infrastructure
[26:22.760 --> 26:29.080]  i'm appalled by the information that was disseminated he said let me make this clear as i can make
[26:29.080 --> 26:37.520]  it protesting is not a threat against infrastructure protesting is god-given american right pennsylvania
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.880]  paid a philadelphia based non-profit a hundred twenty five thousand dollars so all they do
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.960]  is go get a southern property law center a dl list they take the police intelligence
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.000]  files and then they integrate it together and get a hundred twenty five thousand dollars
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.880]  this goes on they've got these little watchdog groups in every major city even in small towns
[26:54.880 --> 27:01.080]  and they get big cash big state and federal and private foundation ford foundation money
[27:01.080 --> 27:07.160]  to run around and brainwash the police that patriots are bad pennsylvania paid a philadelphia
[27:07.160 --> 27:10.760]  based non-profit a hundred twenty five thou to compile the list as part of a state homeland
[27:10.760 --> 27:15.400]  security federally mandated mission to protect public infrastructure and it just goes on
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.920]  from there this is a big story at info wars dot com by curtain m o pennsylvania homeland
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.440]  security puts anti-tax protesters on list of terror threats and we got the same reports
[27:24.440 --> 27:31.160]  out of texas six years ago listing gun owners veterans as as the number one threat but because
[27:31.160 --> 27:36.240]  it was bush's administration doing it conservative media wouldn't pick up on it now that it's
[27:36.240 --> 27:43.180]  obama meet the new boss same as the old boss like the who song says it's like oh my gosh
[27:43.180 --> 27:50.240]  obama wants to go after conservatives folks you've always been the enemy again i would
[27:50.240 --> 27:56.000]  watch conservative pundits on fox and listen to them on the radio read from reports that
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.240]  i had they didn't tell you they're reading a report but i'd read the reports we covered
[28:00.240 --> 28:06.240]  it here i knew they were reading federal demonization scripts whoever's loading their teleprompter
[28:06.240 --> 28:12.240]  is a globalist i mean that they're getting a direct government propaganda feed we know
[28:12.240 --> 28:19.720]  they're bad it's open and shut and all these years we put these reports out over and over
[28:19.720 --> 28:26.280]  again as they were leaked to us and it would never get attention because it was george
[28:26.280 --> 28:30.880]  double you bush and why he couldn't do that why he's taken all our rights to fight men
[28:30.880 --> 28:39.680]  in caves so that's two articles out of probably a hundred here or more gold prices touch another

[33:26.880 --> 33:35.600]  situation here is the new york times today g o p leaders say delaware upset hurts senate
[33:35.600 --> 33:42.200]  hopefuls now they basically said the same thing about rand paul they sent in cheney
[33:42.200 --> 33:47.360]  to campaign against him they put all their money behind the republican establishment
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.640]  pro bailout candidate they demonized him just like the democrats are now doing and he's
[33:53.640 --> 34:01.120]  widened his lead against the democrat in the last few months since he won the primary against
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.480]  the republican but they said the same thing all people extreme like him and they lied
[34:06.480 --> 34:11.200]  about what he really stood for he can't win and so they create this self-fulfilling prophecy
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.800]  of all you can't vote for that candidate because they can't win and now the republicans are
[34:16.800 --> 34:23.440]  creating the hoax with the democrats that all these different real tea party candidates
[34:23.440 --> 34:29.440]  who actually are against the out of control spending the banker bailouts and the rest
[34:29.440 --> 34:35.400]  of it that that that they're bad and that they can't win and you need to go for establishment
[34:35.400 --> 34:41.120]  republicans the same republicans that are for more banker bailouts the same republicans
[34:41.120 --> 34:46.720]  that under bush four separate times tried to pass amnesty the same republicans like
[34:46.720 --> 34:53.800]  newt genrich who want global carbon taxes and they're want world government and the
[34:53.800 --> 34:58.600]  hoax intensifies i have the transcript here we're not going to play the entire clip but
[34:58.600 --> 35:05.520]  it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com in an article that paul watson's written
[35:05.520 --> 35:11.080]  anti-establishment fervor a hammer blow to the washington elite but here's a transcript
[35:11.080 --> 35:19.240]  from fox news from last night carl rove questions christine o donald's serious character problems
[35:19.240 --> 35:24.240]  and then i have the quotes here they're saying because it took 20 years for her to pay off
[35:24.240 --> 35:30.360]  her student loans that that is deceptive again the serious questions about how does she make
[35:30.360 --> 35:35.680]  her living why did she mislead voters about her college education how come it took nearly
[35:35.680 --> 35:41.120]  two decades to pay her college bills i've seen numbers of upwards of half of many college
[35:41.120 --> 35:45.880]  students now not paying their loans because they can't she paid them off how come it took
[35:45.880 --> 35:50.240]  nearly two decades to pay her college bills so she could get her college degree how does
[35:50.240 --> 35:55.920]  she make a living why did she sue a well-known well-thought-of conservative think tank rove
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.160]  but we also can't make progress if we have candidates who've got serious character problems
[36:00.160 --> 36:06.160]  who cause ordinary voters who are not philosophically aligned with us to not vote for our candidates
[36:06.160 --> 36:13.240]  out of concern of what they said and what they will do i mean you've got republican and democratic
[36:13.240 --> 36:17.960]  house members that go to congress worth a few hundred thousand dollars and they leave
[36:17.960 --> 36:21.920]  a decade later sometimes worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes
[36:21.920 --> 36:27.400]  billions of dollars in some cases in every case they're they're net worth of skyrockets
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.480]  because they're they're paid off they're given business deals and business offers and one
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.560]  of the most classic payoffs is they will buy a piece of property dirt cheap and then someone
[36:37.560 --> 36:43.080]  will buy it for three four five or even more times what it's worth and then they've got
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.120]  all these other little inside sweetheart deals that make hillary clinton's cattle future
[36:47.120 --> 36:53.640]  scam look like you know child's play so they're going after this lady saying she didn't pay
[36:53.640 --> 36:59.600]  off her college loan for twenty years but did pay it off and she had an eleven thousand
[36:59.600 --> 37:05.120]  dollar unpaid tax bill because she didn't have it in two thousand and five and the IRS
[37:05.120 --> 37:11.480]  put a lien on her no judge no jury no proof the IRS just sent her a letter this has happened
[37:11.480 --> 37:17.040]  to us saying you miscalculated by five thousand dollars on your taxes this was three years
[37:17.040 --> 37:23.720]  ago so now penalties in interest we want fifteen thousand dollars that's happened to yours truly
[37:23.720 --> 37:27.040]  pay it or we're going to seize your bank account and if you don't pay quick they put a lien
[37:27.040 --> 37:30.960]  on you then they seize your bank account this happened to this poor lady and then she ended
[37:30.960 --> 37:37.000]  up paying it later meanwhile you've got Geithner not paying taxes for five years completely
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.760]  you've got large portions of the Congress not even paying a period you've got record
[37:41.760 --> 37:46.920]  numbers of White House staffers and White House officials in czars not paying taxes
[37:46.920 --> 37:51.960]  involved in all forms of corruption but none of that's an issue no the issue is this lady
[37:51.960 --> 37:57.280]  had a lien thrown on her by the IRS because the IRS said she owed some money I pulled
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.080]  up the numbers it was a couple thousand dollars but for penalties in interest they wanted eleven
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.720]  thousand from her and slapped a lien on her slapped a lien on her to get it and now oh
[38:06.720 --> 38:11.720]  my gosh you know because this lady had a lien on her this is what's the quote that he uses
[38:11.720 --> 38:17.600]  over and over again trying to hammer into your brain so you serious character problems
[38:17.600 --> 38:25.000]  now I don't know this lady from the side of a barn but the fact that the system is attacking
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.280]  her the fact that the system is demonizing her the fact that they have the Republicans
[38:33.280 --> 38:38.040]  and Democrats coming out against her I mean that tells you all you need to know and Sarah
[38:38.040 --> 38:42.320]  Palin endorsed her she's she's endorsed Rand Paul I mean that you've got a commender on
[38:42.320 --> 38:48.560]  that I think she's far better than Glenn Beck I mean I I I know what Glenn Beck is I'm not
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.000]  really even sure about Sarah Palin I know she's been hooked in with Kissinger and that's
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.280]  not good but you know these people run in those circles but the fact that she endorsed
[38:56.280 --> 39:04.760]  McCain see that balances it out that she's bad point is time will tell on this but you've
[39:04.760 --> 39:11.960]  got really the establishment Republicans doing everything they can to make sure that real
[39:11.960 --> 39:18.400]  patriotic candidates who were anti private fellow reserve who were anti globalist who
[39:18.400 --> 39:24.560]  were anti banker bailouts do not get into political office and she's got a good chance
[39:24.560 --> 39:30.920]  of winning if people realize and the polls show they do that when someone's being attacked
[39:30.920 --> 39:36.760]  by both sides of the fake political spectrum that is a certification that they are at least
[39:36.760 --> 39:42.240]  better than what the establishment is trying to push and now that she's won the primary
[39:42.240 --> 39:46.200]  and they've had a bunch of other upsets as well against establishment Republicans in
[39:46.200 --> 39:49.360]  the primary and establishment Democrats are losing in the primary every time they have
[39:49.360 --> 39:52.960]  primaries and it's just scores of races every time they have these primaries the last three
[39:52.960 --> 39:59.400]  four months showing that that voters are really starting to get sophisticated and they're
[39:59.400 --> 40:02.880]  not going to just get conned by the Republicans they're not just going to get conned by the
[40:02.880 --> 40:08.280]  Democrats that's why there's record numbers of people not donating to the Republican
[40:08.280 --> 40:13.000]  party the RNC itself who then disperses it to who they want they're donating directly
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.920]  to candidates and that's what Scott Carl Rowe so upset he wants that money he wants to be
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.320]  able to control that and put his people into power and so we can have a you know somebody
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.460]  like George W Bush who's for amnesty and you know all this police state stuff and issuing
[40:28.460 --> 40:32.480]  all these intelligence reports and police training demonizing people that want to get
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.600]  rid of the Federal Reserve or real conservatives that want to get us out of wars like Ron Paul
[40:37.600 --> 40:45.600]  because we're going bankrupt and they're immoral so that's what's going on here and you're
[40:45.600 --> 40:50.120]  going to hear from tea party candidates about getting medical care for the 911 responders
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.840]  you're going to hear from tea party candidates criticism of veterans affairs signing secret
[40:55.840 --> 41:00.720]  deals with insurance companies to steal their death benefits you're going to hear about
[41:00.720 --> 41:06.920]  the private Federal Reserve in the new world order you are not going to ever hear that
[41:06.920 --> 41:13.160]  out of Carl Rowe and people like him they've been there all along trying to co-opt the
[41:13.160 --> 41:20.200]  libertarian constitutional Christian movements you name it they've done everything they can
[41:20.200 --> 41:26.120]  and so let's go ahead and play a short clip of Carl Rowe you know really demonizing this
[41:26.120 --> 41:32.320]  poor lady and just repeating that talking point over and over again that she has serious
[41:32.320 --> 41:35.880]  character problems and when you actually go find out what those character problems are
[41:35.880 --> 41:41.440]  he just uses that term when you actually find out what they are it took her 20 years to
[41:41.440 --> 41:46.920]  pay off her student loans and she had an $11,000 lien on her from the IRS no due process they
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.800]  just slapped it on her here it is you know what if you vote for cap and tax and you have
[41:51.800 --> 41:56.400]  an opponent that says they wouldn't then they have a choice they have an option so I think
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.640]  it was it was very substantive very based on issues very based on the road voting record
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.240]  of one and the promised voting record of another you know again you're making my case this was
[42:05.240 --> 42:10.840]  about my castle's bad votes it does conservatives little good to support candidates who at the
[42:10.840 --> 42:16.200]  end of the day while they may be conservative in their public statements do not events the
[42:16.200 --> 42:22.160]  characteristics of rectitude and truthfulness and its sincerity and character that the voters
[42:22.160 --> 42:28.440]  are looking for but I think that's awesome and we'll we'll she doesn't show rectitude
[42:28.440 --> 42:34.120]  this is a guy up there high and mighty saying I tell you who has rectitude I tell you who
[42:34.120 --> 42:39.560]  is morally good I tell you you know who you could vote for and who you can't I'm the
[42:39.560 --> 42:44.120]  grand poobah I'm the high priest I'm going to tell you Republicans what you can and
[42:44.120 --> 42:50.160]  can't do your need to stay on the Carl Rove reservation because I am morally of high rectitude
[42:50.160 --> 42:57.160]  this is the guy lying about WMD's this is the guy caught red handed framing a democratic
[42:57.160 --> 43:02.720]  governor in Alabama on record that just framed him send him to prison he was released this
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.840]  is a guy involved in every dirty trick you can imagine and and and all these sycophantic
[43:07.840 --> 43:13.280]  rhino Republican supporters like going to these events because they paid $5,000 to go
[43:13.280 --> 43:16.000]  to a dinner with George Bush and Carl Rove and they feel like they're part of the power
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.360]  structure and they go pose like a bunch of parents in a tree you know in this whole
[43:20.360 --> 43:26.080]  pecking order and and and Carl Rove's their friend and their smart Republicans and they've
[43:26.080 --> 43:30.600]  been co-opted and scammed for decades and they want to be suckered again and they're
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.340]  going to listen to him because he's got so much moral rectitude this is the White House
[43:34.340 --> 43:39.240]  writing torture memos saying they could even torture people's children with pliers in front
[43:39.240 --> 43:45.200]  of their parents and even if you think that's moral and good which obviously it's not is
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.680]  it moral to then send the private contractors and military people in Afghanistan and Iraq
[43:50.680 --> 43:55.320]  who followed the orders to torture when it finally came out that the White House had
[43:55.320 --> 44:01.000]  ordered it and we had the memos the Gonzalez and and other memos and Roe was involved defending
[44:01.000 --> 44:10.480]  it the Gonzalez and John you memos they then sent a bunch of these people to prison and
[44:10.480 --> 44:17.880]  then Bush comes out two months ago and gives a speech saying I don't order torture again
[44:17.880 --> 44:23.440]  and all these guys on Fox I've seen them all say that tortures good and and and that Jack
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.240]  Bowers a great patriot and we have real Jack Bowers that are keeping us safe so so they're
[44:28.240 --> 44:33.080]  up there defending it saying you're a hero if you torture but by golly we're going to
[44:33.080 --> 44:36.880]  order you to torture and then send you to prison when you do it I mean is that moral
[44:36.880 --> 44:41.040]  even those of you that have a torture fetish and think that's tough think that's what the
[44:41.040 --> 44:45.640]  good guys do but you also have double think it's bad when the North Vietnamese or the
[44:45.640 --> 44:52.080]  North Koreans or the Chinese or the Russians or anybody else tortures but it's good when
[44:52.080 --> 44:58.520]  we do because we're the good guys yeah we're the good guys we're not running anything get
[44:58.520 --> 45:03.440]  that straight see these yuppies think they're part of the power structure we invented Iraq
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.800]  to bring democracy and get the WMD's we are the big tough Americans we are the idiots
[45:08.800 --> 45:13.120]  that pay for all this for these offshore corporations that run our country we're the idiots being
[45:13.120 --> 45:22.400]  taxed into oblivion we are the fools just like those troops and contractors a lot of
[45:22.400 --> 45:26.680]  them sadists a lot of them are hired out of the federal prison system as prison guards
[45:26.680 --> 45:34.200]  who had records of torture and abuse and they like it but the point is this is the oxymoron
[45:34.200 --> 45:49.760]  contradiction of hypocrisy to the 10th power okay I've gone over that now here's another
[45:49.760 --> 45:55.760]  article today veterans to CIA Army for experiments at Dietrich and Edgewood and it goes into
[45:55.760 --> 45:58.800]  what they think of you the troops and what they think of you the police and what they
[45:58.800 --> 46:05.640]  think of you the bureaucrats they hate you you understand that they fear you they give
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.880]  you all this illegal unconstitutional power to abuse the American people and brainwash
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.320]  you that it's for good reasons and then they've got to keep you in check though and they prey
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.040]  on you statistically more than anybody else because they need to police their own attack
[46:20.040 --> 46:26.000]  dogs you're out there in the doghouse they're getting ready to put you on half rations
[46:26.000 --> 46:32.240]  financially and a lot of you just love it a lot of you though are starting to wake up
[46:32.240 --> 46:35.960]  now I want to shift gears into another subject before I go back into the economy and I'm
[46:35.960 --> 46:43.040]  going to take phone calls next hour the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231 I want

[47:02.200 --> 47:06.760]  stack of news first if the guys will give me a document cam shot I'll show the prison
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.840]  planet dot TV viewers this article you can also go to info wars dot com prison planet
[47:10.840 --> 47:15.760]  dot com and read this article by Paul Joseph Watson yesterday Curt Nemo's got an expanded
[47:15.760 --> 47:22.200]  detailed report that just went up seconds ago in info wars dot com it's titled bill
[47:22.200 --> 47:27.600]  gates death panel tip of the iceberg that's the newest report by Paul Joseph Watson Curt
[47:27.600 --> 47:32.560]  Nemo and Alex Jones we've all worked together in the last three days to write this research
[47:32.560 --> 47:39.720]  piece and it gets into a whole spectrum of information how they're taking over our original
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.840]  health care system how they're about to get rid of charity care which all citizens are
[47:45.840 --> 47:51.640]  entitled to enter paid into by regular people that are purchasing health care at the full
[47:51.640 --> 47:58.000]  price and all these giant Rockefeller tax free foundations that for decades actually
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.920]  more than a hundred years have been operating as a profit center and not giving people the
[48:03.920 --> 48:08.240]  charity care they're supposed to it gets into how doctors were trained until just about
[48:08.240 --> 48:11.920]  a decade ago to have the Hippocratic oath that's now not given doctors were trained
[48:11.920 --> 48:16.080]  at twenty five percent to thirty three percent depending on the state of the work they did
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.280]  was to be free for charity care Ron Paul's talked about that as a medical doctor he worked
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.920]  for depending on where he worked he did this because it was what he's supposed to do two
[48:25.920 --> 48:31.680]  to five dollars an hour on top of his practice but he would go a few days and we can do that
[48:31.680 --> 48:39.440]  just like my father does and they're getting rid of that where you've got to go on Medicare
[48:39.440 --> 48:45.320]  and Medicaid and now that's the death panel where they get everybody's wealth socialized
[48:45.320 --> 48:48.200]  and then they say look you're having to pay for all these old people these sick people
[48:48.200 --> 48:54.040]  these mentally retarded people we want to go ahead and euthanize them and that's what
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.880]  Bill Gates is saying he's saying you know we call this death panels but they play us
[48:58.880 --> 49:10.920]  off against each other are you for laying off ten teachers or are you for killing granny
[49:10.920 --> 49:15.400]  and that's what all this deals with so there's two reports Bill Gates death panel tip of
[49:15.400 --> 49:21.420]  the iceberg that's the big report and there's the report yesterday by Paul the real story
[49:21.420 --> 49:26.080]  behind Bill Gates and death panels two separate articles we can save a lot of lives educate
[49:26.080 --> 49:32.440]  a lot of people most folks don't know that you're working you know and you're making
[49:32.440 --> 49:36.080]  thirty five thousand dollars a year or so you can't get insurance because you've got
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.240]  a preexisting condition like Crohn's caused by vaccines or epilepsy caused by vaccines
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.160]  so many of these issues or thyroid problem caused by sodium fluoride off the charts
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.760]  or diabetes from the corn syrup they're now renaming it to corn sugar to be deceptive
[49:52.760 --> 49:57.640]  on the labels because they know you're wise to them conclusively just giving you cancer
[49:57.640 --> 50:05.640]  growing cancer giving you diabetes you go in you get early on set of brain disorders
[50:05.640 --> 50:09.920]  that are now have people are getting Alzheimer's at thirty thirty five you suddenly get denied
[50:09.920 --> 50:16.720]  your insurance you try to go in and get care and they say well we'll put you on medicaid
[50:16.720 --> 50:24.400]  then they start denying that or medicare for older folks and now you're not going to have
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.000]  a choice to go get charity care because they're phasing that out of this system you're saying
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.720]  that's what this government takeover of health care is the hospitals don't want to provide
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.480]  charity care see the illegal aliens know about this that's why they have ads in the newspapers
[50:38.480 --> 50:42.720]  in Mexico from the US hospitals because they want the federal funds come here have your
[50:42.720 --> 50:47.600]  baby get on free welfare it's all free now a citizen shows up and you want free health

[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.440]  go ahead and take a call trevor in tennessee you're on the year hey alec how's it going good sir
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.440]  i'm a huge fan of listening to you for years i just wanted to thank you for what you do
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.720]  you're my hero uh first of all i just want to say that i'm really nervous i apologize um
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:36.320]  i have a two month old son uh he's our our first child and he's about to get his shock
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.720]  uh he's scheduled to get him this week uh for the vaccines and stuff like that um and i really
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.480]  that's kind of like the jews were scheduled to get on trains and go to doc howell and uh
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.960]  owshwitz and they're just like oh it's your scheduling it's your time to ride the carousel
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:59.760]  and logan's run um i mean just because they say it's scheduled i mean did they take his blood
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.600]  at birth for the pentagon database i i think so i'm not real sure no i mean if he was born in a
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.760]  hospital they did but but so i'm sorry go ahead and make your point we were he was born in a
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.640]  we're trying to get him born in a birthing center we had to move this hospital because it was a
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.720]  d-section so i guess they did but i just don't know what else to do i mean if i don't get his
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.840]  vaccine what do i do i mean is there any other alternative i can i can i can do i mean i i just
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.720]  kind of confused about it well there's a lot of lies out there dr dina dell and others get up on
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.920]  the radio and say people that don't vaccinate should be arrested other parents should soup other
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.480]  parents that don't vaccinate because your child will then endanger them well if they've had the
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.880]  vaccine then how is your son not having it going to make them sick look i've got three children
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.640]  they've never had a needle stuck in their body now does that mean that the science of vaccines
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:58.000]  doesn't have some validity and that i you know if we could trust them maybe maybe vaccines might be
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.800]  okay the issue is sir they have the marisol mercury in them the issue is that causes auto immune
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:11.040]  diseases it causes all sorts of problems and if you and they're always adding new shots it's over
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.840]  50 plus shots they want to give a child in the first 18 months now just a few decades ago it was
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:22.880]  less than 15 these these vaccine makers make a new vaccine they come in and lobby state and federal
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.000]  government to quote make it mandatory but that's another lie it's not mandatory it's a state health
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.880]  department policy then they try to threaten you and intimidate you into taking it why would you
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.720]  trust anybody that's trying to threaten and intimidate you into taking something that's not
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.440]  the law okay and stay there i want to come back and let you finish up you've got any other questions

[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.720]  stealing it and bill gates saying yes their death panels kill granny and hire 10 teachers with the
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.920]  money it's all routine and world government being announced as all routine the issue is vaccines
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.560]  most evident shows are bad for you overall yeah there's some deadly disease killing a bunch of
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:04.560]  people and it's a stopgap measure it's shown that it can help but they're coming out with hundreds
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.520]  and hundreds of vaccines and these mega companies these multi-million dollar companies are lobbying
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.280]  to make you take everything they produce and then they get caught lying and saying it's the law you've
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.800]  got to take it they try to pass laws to make it the law while they lie and say it's the law
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.760]  me do you trust a liar i got something really good here for you and then in all their real
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:31.040]  studies and admissions 10 times increase in seizures and epilepsy get permanent epilepsy
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:37.360]  from these shots that's london telegraph ap reuters i mean that's the actual data massive
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:45.280]  increases in cancer read the read the vaccine inserts read it i mean don't believe me please
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.360]  but yes could your son get the measles and maybe be you know one out of tens of thousands that get
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:57.520]  really sick or even die from it yeah it could happen could your son uh get whooping cough and
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.480]  statistically uh you know die from it yeah but you've got a many times i mean just go to the numbers
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.240]  of being struck by lightning or dying in a car wreck or drowning
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.040]  if you look at the numbers like on firearms many more people drowned
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.720]  than they do die from guns but they demonize guns in the name of public safety uh car wrecks
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.600]  number one cause of death until you're about 55 that it's cancer and heart attacks those two
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.520]  dual for the number one slot every year some year it's heart attacks some years it's cancer but
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:40.880]  generally it's one of the other so that's like people who call me and they say should i buy gold
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.560]  because the government could just come and confiscate it well yeah the government could try to come
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.680]  and put you in a slave camp and make you build widgets for them in fact through color of law
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.120]  they create all these nonviolent crimes as an excuse to put you in a slave factory for 25 cents an hour
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.920]  and then all these people outside the prison losing their jobs they can't get six dollar an hour seven
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.080]  dollar an hour jobs they wonder why that's happening it's because they're competing with prisoners
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.720]  for 25 cents an hour so you got to think all of this through but going back to vaccines
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.280]  it's a decision you have to make uh the japanese it's got to be more than a decade ago made it
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:23.040]  a rule no vaccination until age two because they found completely that this stuff causes
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.960]  neurological problems autoimmune problems but it's much worse when a little bitty baby has all
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.240]  these shots going in them by the time they grow up and get bigger and get some cognitive development
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.000]  it won't stunt them as much here's my final point i'm gonna go back to you
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.440]  they have put out two federally funded studies in the last six years that i've seen
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.560]  sure there's more saying mercury is now good for your brain now now that's asasinine as saying
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.320]  shooting yourself in the head with a 357 magnum at point blank range in the temple is good for
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.080]  your brain if being dead is good for you but you see these these eugenicists love their own little
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.520]  language their own little scientist slash lawyer speak when you actually read they say cognitive
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:21.360]  enhancement is being brain dead having a lower IQ cognitive enhancement is being dumbed down and
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:28.160]  servile that's an enhancement for their goals and if you're a new listener i'm not gonna play it
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.840]  again i probably played it 200 plus times i can play a newscast right now where they say mercury
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:40.000]  has been found in the journal in pediatrics to improve children's cognitive in fact they won't
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.320]  believe it pull it up again we'll just play it i mean it'll probably be the 210th timer something
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:52.480]  i haven't counted i mean i'm because this stuff is i've got msnbc saying led is good for babies i mean
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:13:00.880]  i mean you can search that term you uh they are training you to accept the absurd yes we're growing
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.480]  the opium in afghanistan and if we catch you with it in the u.s you'll go to prison for a decade
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.920]  you know we've got to make it illegal that's how we keep the price up now we're gonna ship it in
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.200]  you're gonna pay us and then we're gonna let local cops bust you and put you in a slave factory i mean
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.920]  it's all very elementary and so how can you trust this group it's been caught lying been caught
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.480]  sterilizing people through the vaccines the u.n's been caught over and over again and we have their
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:32.800]  own documents here's the clip and i'm going back to the call here it is mercury containing vaccines
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.160]  may have on kids a life-saving device wins over the counter approval by the FDA and think of your
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.600]  glasses and contact lenses a new corrective eye surgery is approved today here's tonight's medical
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:50.960]  headlines with medical watch reporters in the matter mercury containing vaccines may help not
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.560]  harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been lots by concerns
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.760]  at mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.480]  these new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually be associated with
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.920]  improved behavior and mental performance okay improved behavior and mental performance now
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.520]  notice they mixed it in with oh a new corrective eye surgeries available we're going to tell you
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:25.680]  about some great stuff mercury makes your brain work better it's the most deadly heavy metal
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.400]  in all the major university studies they've known this for over a hundred years you can search
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:37.680]  electron microscope mercury brain tissue and regular heavy metals just go in and kill the cells
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.720]  they touch then plaques form and the body kind of encapsulates it but it causes some brain damage
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:51.600]  not mercury you ever seen the 1978 film alien when they're trying to cut the alien off the
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:56.080]  guy's face and the one drop of acid drips and burns through three levels of the spaceship
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:02.880]  up when you watch electron microscope footage in fact guys just search it right now uh mercury
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:09.520]  in brain tissue electron microscope we can put it up on screens on youtube it it causes an
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.280]  electrochemical explosion it goes up against the neurons it explodes because they're electrochemical
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:20.000]  and then it moves on it just keeps eating through your brain with pleasure just keeps savaging and
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.600]  savaging and savaging and savaging and then i'm up here going mercury's not good for you and i'm
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.760]  the conspiracy theorist and by the way when you eat mercury and fish most of it is past and it's
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:40.080]  biologically bound when they inject industrial with these nano particles of it into the blood it
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.800]  goes right through the blood brain barrier the body's designed to block heavy metals we're
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.600]  beautifully designed not when you shoot your baby up with okay i'm gonna stop ranting because i
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.240]  wanted to get to a lot of calls uh but trevor you brought up a very important question so i tried
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.600]  to spend you know 10 minutes on it does that answer your question yeah i really really appreciate that
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:05.600]  i appreciate your time uh i guess i'm just not gonna do it i mean i mean um but when he comes
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.520]  old enough to go to school i mean would that would that be a problem yes they yes they are
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.680]  criminals they are hardcore criminals again they lie to you and say it's the law he must take the
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.720]  shots they lied to you and said there wasn't mercury until we forced it out in the open
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.800]  and now they say okay mercury's there it's good for you then they're gonna lie when he goes in
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:27.520]  school and say it's the law your child can't be in the school without shots and you say i know you've
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.080]  got the waiver it's not even a law but it's a waiver to a non-law i know you've got a waiver
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.280]  that i'm supposed to fill out so they make a list of you but you courts have even shown you can not
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.040]  even do that and then they'll lie to you again because they're getting money when they hit your
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.240]  kid with a weapon from the feds that that's tied to the federal money they're given uh they have
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.480]  quotas they've got to get 97 percent or more vaccinated they don't get their money then then
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.120]  the school nurse or the principal's gonna lie and say there's no such thing and then you can already
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.440]  have googled your state uh you're calling from tennessee tennessee vaccine waiver conscientious
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.960]  objector religious objector and you can go really principal or assistant principal here's the waiver
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:16.000]  for tennessee you lied to me and see you'll know you're there with a hardcore liar again lying trash
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.760]  an entire government and corporate system trained to lie and these teachers take their kids and
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.240]  inject them with the mercury too and they love the fact that in many schools a third of the
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.880]  schools now special ed and there's just giant warehouses of children and wearing football
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.960]  helmets literally because they bump their heads in the walls and in wheelchairs and in diapers
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.240]  and they put taser taser uh belts around them in the public schools now when they don't mind they
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:45.360]  zap them and they love it they just love all of it and soon the whole school will be in the corner
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.880]  drooling and by that point they can just start euthanizing everyone they are just savagely
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.560]  chemically hurting us as bad as they can so they could make us submit and then just come in and
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.040]  have the helicopters fly over and spray the nerve gas and kill everybody they're just getting everybody
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.160]  ready for that okay that's hardcore truth buddy listen those are criminals when they lie to you
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.760]  and and and try to force those vaccines you understand that i do okay i appreciate your call
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.040]  i mean this isn't a game ladies and gentlemen even if you think vaccines are good is it okay the
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:24.800]  government lies about all this to get you to take them i'm in a bad mood now boy sam and mass
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:31.360]  you're on the air hey alex can you hear me yes sir well before i get into what i want to talk
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:35.040]  about i just wanted to quickly point off two things about vaccines since you're talking
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:40.800]  about that one thing that people need to understand is if you look at the amish community the vaccine
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:49.280]  is a zero autism in groups of more than 300 000 studied in illinois alone zero zero zero zero zero
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:56.320]  the article i read said one in a hundred thousand and that one person who had it got a vaccine so
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:01.760]  yes there must have been another study i've seen the illinois study we look at the uh vaccine rates
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.800]  uh the autism rates in america one in uh 75 now it's that there it is that's all that and it was
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:19.440]  it was one in 25 000 in 1985 people those numbers up crazy oh no no no listen their goal is it is
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:25.200]  just pretty soon if you can tie your shoelaces and focus you're going to be bowed down to is like

[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:38.400]  they control the resources going back to sam and mass what was your point sam uh just i've been
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:43.360]  studying revelations now for 16 years as often as a human breeze and i know you're just the same
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:50.560]  way alex you got that same bug in you to study truth and when i lay in bed at night my brain
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.520]  just it goes it's so complicated and so horrific over the things that i've learned over the years
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:01.360]  i just want the everyone listening to understand that the things you cover alex are so kindergarten
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:09.440]  so basic so fundamental it's not conspiracy theory it's absolutely fact well that's the
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:16.880]  issue is you say i think it's wrong that they're stealing the death benefits uh and this this includes
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:22.480]  six million troops or veterans and that's bloomberg and they just say oh that's a conspiracy theory
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:29.040]  even when it's admitted it's a way to not make a moral decision about it and to just procrastinate
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.640]  and rationalize and live in denial but we can't do that any longer i appreciate your call sam
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:41.520]  carl in texas you're on the air hello hey buddy thanks for holding welcome hey thanks man i just
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.600]  tried to type out my uh questions here because i want to be quick uh first question i i just
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:52.640]  had three questions and one small point uh did you ever watch uh the jfk the men who killed jfk
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.760]  from the history channel uh i did some now wasn't there like eight parts or something yeah there
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.560]  was like nine parts they took out the last three but you can youtube them guy that all the people
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.560]  that you talked about they interviewed they interviewed these people and some of them are dead
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.920]  now because the documentary was done back in 98 i think no 2003 sorry but some of them passed away
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:17.440]  whatever but incredible deep deep you should watch it it's revealing even some of the attorneys
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:23.520]  that were defending um uh what the the guy who took over jfk's position now i can't remember his name
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.720]  uh when he when they assassinated him who was uh who was the next person the vice president who
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:36.240]  took over i can't remember his name uh well it was uh it was robert kennedy yeah and well of course
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:42.080]  they know he was the attorney general um it was who was jfk's vice president um boy i'm having a
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.000]  moment here i should know that um don't worry about it don't worry about it no i'm gonna well
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.960]  no we know it was lbj he became president yes that's what it was that's who it was no no no
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.600]  but no but who was the vice president for lbj that that that's the thing i don't know well
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.000]  you got to watch it there's so much involved with it they show you even the guy in the grassy
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.200]  knoll they show you pictures an outline picture of the dude who shot the guy uh it's you just got
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.000]  to watch it it's insanely accurate incredible incredible i was shocked that even the history
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.560]  channel put out something like that but they took out certain chapters because amazon dot com
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.240]  when you're reading the reviews when you can order the dvd set said what happened to seven eight
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.160]  nine but you can watch them on youtube or some bithorn you can find it out some way
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.600]  but i just wanted to find out if you watch it if you haven't please watch it anyone else can watch
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:32.720]  it the second question is um you i wanted to find out what happened with jason bermas i haven't
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.040]  heard anything about him uh so i don't know you know well let me go back and answer your first
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:42.400]  question it was hubert humphrey uh and i knew that i don't know who the interim was because
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:49.840]  that was who they had uh for the 1964 election was minnesota uh senator uh hubert humphrey
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.760]  but as for bermas i mean he made the announcement we made the announcement here
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.520]  he was down here for six months when he made fabled enemies with with erin and rob
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:05.120]  and uh he came down here and was intending when he finished the film to go back to new york
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.280]  and so that's where he is and i think i've answered that question like 50 times on air so you must
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.680]  have must have missed it but we are planning to have him back as a guest uh in the near future
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.600]  i also want to have him fill in sometimes but i don't think he's hooked up the proper internet
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.200]  to be able to uh fill in because you've got to have a really good scott connection to be able
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.080]  to do that so i hope that answers your question uh let's go ahead now and take another call here

[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:01.680]  hospitals uh currently not serving uh because i've basically become become absolutely disgusted
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:08.400]  my training is as a christian medical ethicist and what they are teaching the doctors and nurses
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:15.440]  they don't call them death panels but basically that is the entire move in the medical arena
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.520]  is to move to the area where uh human life uh particularly at the end of life really is
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.280]  meaningless i'll tell you what stay there uh jim we're gonna come back to you after this quick

[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.920]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.800]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:25.440]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.880]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.360]  a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.880]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.560]  folks i really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from science

[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:24.160]  okay i'm going back to jim jay and many others that are patiently holding here in just a few
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:30.240]  minutes but i want to try to succinctly explain in just a minute or two
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:41.600]  to the phasing out of classical real medical care and the introduction of eugenics death care
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.680]  but one big issue here is remember a year ago when they were trying to pass the health care plan
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:54.640]  into this year when they did pass it 2010 they would lie and say there's no boards that
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.440]  are going to cut your care sure a few tests you don't need we're not going to do that but
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.760]  that's a conspiracy theory people are like well here's the bill here's tom daschle's book here's
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:10.560]  all these bioethicists they'd say conspiracy liars now they're all over tv going of course if police
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.040]  don't want to lose their job and if firemen don't and if medical workers don't we're gonna
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.560]  we're gonna have to kill people we're gonna have to deny them care
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.920]  this started a few decades ago but in the last decade no major medical school in the western
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:31.200]  world even gives the Hippocratic oath of Hippocrates do no harm i mean that's all you need to know
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.440]  they didn't need bioethics boards they created these out of the eugenics movement after hitler
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:43.120]  made them look bad that's their words and it's all in this liberal loving oh you deserve the care
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:49.680]  and you're going to get the care you need in the last hundred years the Rockefeller foundation the
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:56.080]  carnagies and others went tax-free they took over almost all the major research hospitals and regular
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:03.600]  hospitals they made them a tax exempt and then they don't pay any taxes they pay their doctors
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.680]  and nurses a low amount of money and then they keep the money then they lobby for medicare and
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:15.520]  Medicaid then they lower the standard now they're going purely to eugenics where oh you had a
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:21.920]  heart attack here's an aspirin like they do in Cuba that's the system oh you're going blind here's a
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.080]  cane i mean that's literally what they do this is what's being proposed but remember they lied to
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:33.920]  you and said this is crazy we're not that's not going on well come on what are you that we wouldn't
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.240]  do something like that to you oh we're putting stuff in the vaccines we're like well here's all
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:45.440]  your own documents well it is needed for the earth so that's what's going on here and you
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:52.240]  have these bioethics boards or medical ethics boards in these hospitals some are good some are bad but
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:59.600]  the feds are now fully taking control of those policies and making them pure eugenics and this
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.560]  is here in all these yuppies all these trendies that go there are too many people and we should get
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.280]  rid of people well you can just see a big crosshair right on them see they think they're members of the
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:16.800]  elite look at the record numbers of yuppies that just warehouse mama or papa mama has a stroke
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:26.000]  when she's 77 75 sometimes even 50 you just stick mama in a nursing home in another state
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.160]  and then right after insurance runs out a few years later mama dies mama because they recommended
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.040]  she go to hospice mama was i don't know what happened mama was going down every day with her
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.560]  friends and playing dominoes and watching tv and mama was happy but mama then they recommended
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.680]  the bioethicist that she need to go to hospice because she might have cancer and then they put
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:54.160]  mama on drugs and then mama mama died then they falsified the death certificate they dehydrate them
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:00.240]  this is going on this is admitted even in major news reports by wesley j smith and others who've
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:07.680]  gone out and detailed these cases and people just warehouse their parents and oh well they're old

[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.800]  that is up on info wars.com with the headline bill gates death panels is only the tip of the
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:30.560]  iceberg so please search that term gates death panels three words okay uh thanks for holding
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:36.480]  jim in kansas you're a medical bioethicist or ethics person explain how the boards work the
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.320]  changes that are happening and why you couldn't sit there on i i guess you didn't like being outvoted
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:47.680]  every time to basically uh cut people's food and water off or or to not give people the medical
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:55.120]  care that was due to them uh basically yes alex um as i said i'm a christian medical ethicist i've
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:00.880]  been trained at a christian divinity school i'm a minister as well in of my master's is in medical
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.720]  ethics and i sitting on the boards uh basically you have a bunch of uh you have some doctors you
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:14.560]  have some nurses you have i actually uh the boards that i've sat are are mostly filled with uh the
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:22.640]  management of the hospital and so what they tend to do is they tend to vote for what is going to
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.280]  benefit the hospital financially the most so if somebody's got the best insurance in the world
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.080]  and you only need two heart stints they're going to put 14 in and basically kill you a lot of cases
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.560]  of that but if you don't have insurance or on medicare and medicaid they'll just give you the
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:41.680]  minimum care whatever makes them the biggest profits but cut off anything that the government
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.240]  is telling them to cut off to keep getting their funding and if you're a charity care case they'll
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:53.120]  lie to you and not tell you there's charity care i absolutely i they um one the thing that kind of
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:43:01.840]  broke my back was i sat and tried to educate this board about the proper way to deal with our elderly
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.680]  who are indigent and uh basically i was told well that will never happen here at our hospital
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.120]  and a month later one of my parishioners because i was a pat i'm a pastor as well
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:21.120]  it actually occurred to that person in that hospital and i i i just i couldn't deal with it
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.120]  anymore well you're not telling us the name of the hospital or the person's name so you
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:31.760]  can give us some specifics what they do to them uh well basically this person uh it was an elderly
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:39.280]  person needed some specialized care uh they were in the hospital uh for um some serious things uh
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:46.400]  this person was in her um mid 90s she needed specialized care at home or in a nursing home
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:52.000]  that would really take care of her and basically they uh didn't even inform the family as to what
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.400]  was necessary uh released her to home to be by herself and to go and die because they weren't
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.960]  didn't want to be on the hook yeah let's be clear they knew that she needed care or she was gonna
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.440]  die just like somebody's been hit by a car they're bleeding a doctor comes up they know they can be
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.920]  fixed but it might cost money so go ahead and let the guy die plus we can harvest his organs
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.440]  but in her case they just released her to home uh to die and of course they have spies in the
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.640]  hospitals hooked into the health department we've confirmed this that when a wealthy person is old
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.880]  and sick they'll actually send cps in and claim the family's abusing them to make to have the state
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:36.160]  make them a war just like they steal kids and then they suck that money out it's just amazing um
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:43.120]  like i said i sat there i i went to this woman's home i'm very familiar with the case uh this
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.280]  was a hospital in texas i was in texas before i came to kansas uh you know in one of the larger
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.800]  cities uh just outside one of the largest cities in texas and they didn't even tell the family
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.560]  take your mama somewhere else we're refusing her care they just said send her home bye bye
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:06.320]  bluebird and and and and these yuppies are like good kill that old lady well they're gonna be old
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.800]  soon or they're gonna be in a car wreck soon and they're gonna be too stupid even though they got
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:18.080]  soft killed well and that's exactly um exactly it and and why when i moved and made a transfer
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.680]  of churches uh i haven't even looked into getting on one of the medical ethics boards here look i
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.240]  know it's painful that's why i stay away from the cps stuff i used to go out in person to these
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:34.160]  and it would make me break down crying after i would watch i mean i opened the hospital door
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.560]  with mike hanson and they were the cop was choking the woman saying sign the paper and it totally
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:44.400]  flipped me out and i was like at this point of about you know you know about to do something but
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.680]  then i knew i had to continue my work so then just the pain of being in my car i saw like a baby and
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.680]  i i haven't i might sob like that once every 10 years i didn't sob like that when my grandmother
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:46:01.840]  died watching the demonic entities enjoy themselves hell being created on earth and then the woman was
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:07.680]  innocent had done nothing it was so incredible it tore my guts out but you can't give up i would say
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.960]  become a crusader like wesley j smith and other bioethicists and others i would say beyond all
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:16.960]  the boards you can be but the main thing is this conflict of interest you've got these private
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.440]  hospitals charity hospitals government funded you know all of them are somewhere another government
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.040]  regulated and no one really knows the big truth you just put out that's publicly available that
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:32.240]  there's a conflict of interest you'll have what say 10 people on a board but what you can convene
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.120]  with six depending on how it's set up because some will be out of the town or whatever and three of
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:43.680]  them or four of the six are hospital administrators and they want the money whether it's give you
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.920]  more care than you need because they're going to get money because you got good insurance or
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.680]  whether just get this person out of here to die we don't want to take care of them when they've
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.320]  got a big fat charity care account and now they're not even teaching the doctors that they're supposed
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:01.920]  to donate 20 to 33 percent of their time 25 to 33 percent of their time to free health care you
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.240]  know that's that's what how america took care of poor people is doctors are supposed to to provide
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:11.840]  free care and then the infrastructure equipment and material that's paid for with the charity money
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:17.200]  and with the increased prices for people that are wealthy again you're a bioethicist is that not
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:24.480]  correct yes that's correct alex so that old beautiful system is being dismantled only the
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:28.160]  illegal aliens now are told about the charity care they know they walk in i'm having my baby
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.240]  give me everything i'm the boss if you don't give it to me i'm going to call you know uh you know my
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.920]  group over which is whatever that's fine health care but then citizens aren't even told and there
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.760]  you were as a bioethicist in texas on the board and they said we're not going to take care of this
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.080]  whole lady we're not even going to tell her family she's going to die send her home i mean that is
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:53.280]  murder basically yes it is it absolutely is doctors are no longer trained to be caregivers
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.000]  uh and even uh you know the nurses were caregivers for a while
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.880]  but in my wife's a nurse she's been a nurse for 30 years she's been in management has managed
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.520]  an entire hospital and they're training them to not be caregivers and the Hippocratic oath
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:12.800]  and and and the honor of being a caregiver you know a hospital that's where that term comes from
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:19.600]  helping the sick you know giving your time i mean my dad enjoys doing the charity care he does
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.320]  he likes it because he's a human being and and that's what he's meant to do but now
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.520]  they never tell the public that doctors are supposed to do to to do part of their care for free
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.720]  so they're phasing that out so you're going to get government death care instead run by private
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:42.720]  bureaucrats and big mega hmo's and it's it's even in some cases worse than that alex with respect to
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:49.840]  the doctors my wife currently works out in the town that we're in in the local county jail as a nurse
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.960]  and one of the things that's blown me away is the indigent people the people that just do not
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:01.120]  have the money to pay who have now been arrested and she is one she screams these people as they
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:05.840]  come in so she finds out what they've been arrested for the numbers that have been arrested because
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:12.080]  they haven't been able to pay their medical bills oh yeah that was in the news lately the
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.200]  debtor prisons are back and they're arresting people for medical bills under federal law
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:23.280]  they're not even allowed to give you a ding on your credit for medical bills but they're now doing
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.840]  that uh and absolutely they are arresting people i've seen cases of a woman arrested for not paying
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:35.440]  a five dollar bill that she wasn't even aware of in fact guys google that uh the poor houses are now
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.880]  in the us people being arrested for unpaid bills we'll put a news article on screen for folks so
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:48.080]  they're now please continue oh they um we've been the last uh two months my wife's been there for
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:56.080]  the last year uh working she has brought home um and told me of she works night shift of about um
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:02.720]  six to eight cases and she's told me of people and we're talking bills of thirty dollars forty
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:08.160]  dollars fifty dollars and they have arrested them and basically it's not because they've
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:13.280]  not paid the bill but because they haven't paid the bill the judge judge ordered them to pay so
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:18.320]  it's the order that of the judge that they're being arrested for because they haven't done it
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  but top constitutional lawyers have been in the news saying this is really illegal
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:29.600]  oh and kansas kansas the state that we're in in our constitution it says there shall be no
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:38.080]  debtor prisons in the state constitution and i am just floored i have uh stars sir it's pure evil

[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.000]  with us we're going to talk about well the nature of reality we're going to talk about the way the
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.360]  public's being desensitized we're going to discuss uh i went and watched joe's routine last night he
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.120]  was talking about a lot of points i've i've made and i was like joe i feel like i'm almost stealing
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.160]  your material though i never heard it he goes no that's just what everybody's thinking at a
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:42.000]  subconscious level that they knew that when they tested the atomic bomb in 1944 secretly
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.360]  uh they knew there was a chance it could ignite the atmosphere in fact the majority of physicist
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.080]  and meteorologist on the manhattan project thought that it was going to ignite the entire earth's
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.760]  atmosphere but they went ahead and hit the red button so i want to get joe to talk about that
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.160]  and discuss that and understand with genetic engineering and all of this that's what the
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.480]  globalists are doing today they're just at cern and everywhere else the superconducting super
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:09.440]  colliding cyclotrons they're just pressing buttons pulling levers and going this might make a black hole
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.000]  let's do it let's make an artificial sun let's do it i mean they are instead of just hitting one red
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.640]  button they're like monkeys as fast as they can just flipping every switch so we'll be discussing
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:25.120]  that but this hardcore issue with jim and kansas who's a medical bioethesis and he just can't be
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:31.440]  part of it as he watches them basically killing people and uh this is going on and and they mean
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.080]  to do this to basically everyone alive today in the future even if you have good insurance you're
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.280]  going to be denied care and the federal government's going to tell you what that new care is uh but
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:45.200]  you had some other points jim you wanted to make as the break cuts you off you were talking about
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:49.920]  debtor prisons did you guys ever find the articles about debtor prisons or back in the us our people
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.400]  are arrested for not paying bills let's put that on screen because folks won't believe that but go
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.480]  ahead we've got about three minutes left four minutes left finish your points sir i just want
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:06.240]  to make two two real points one um i ended up facing an id theft uh and so we had ended up with a
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:11.920]  bunch of stuff and i learned how to deal with these people when they're coming at you uh and i would
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.360]  encourage um uh you know other people to really look into how to deal with them because if you
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.280]  don't answer some complaint that the judges send out or that they send out there are coming after
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:29.840]  people uh and in this economy it's just absolutely incredible and we've seen it uh and all of this
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:38.000]  is being done uh based upon uh beachman children's uh medical theory of the principle of justice
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:46.560]  and it's really interesting how justice has been perverted it is no longer justice for each individual
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:54.560]  but it is a collective justice that uh is really uh you know perverted really just as for the folks
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:01.040]  at the top and i see it again and again i want to encourage and i encourage my parish nurse and i
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:06.480]  want to encourage everybody that is involved in any sort of medical care and we all are to be
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:14.240]  heavily involved in your medicare do not just trust what the doctors say ask question after
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:22.240]  question after question because if you do not you will be railroaded well all i can say is
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:27.600]  great job jim and i know it's painful to see them killing people uh and and doing it through this
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:32.640]  legalese just like the nazis did that's how they started out in the 30s and it's it's up to you to
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.040]  go to the newspapers to go public uh i mean we've got to warn people that this is going on and they're
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:45.200]  now trying to standardize it and trying to accelerate the culture of death and the death panel
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:51.360]  conversion uh within the hospitals and they're counting on people not standing up to this i mean
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:56.240]  in a year they've gone from denying it to saying you know bill gates the clip we played yesterday
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:01.120]  saying yeah kill the old lady it's like the cover of news week the case for killing granny and higher
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:07.360]  10 teachers and so they're creating the illusion that it's a sum game and by cutting services
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:14.400]  you get a better society and in the 50s they developed algorithms on this in closing when
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:20.720]  mcdonald's said we'll put out thank you trash cans and people will throw their own trash away
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:25.360]  and we'll keep that as profit and it actually lowers the culture of service and people think
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.120]  they're getting a better deal it's like self checkouts and everything but really you're only
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:34.320]  destroying the economy and jobs that people are going to have so it's all scientifically designed
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:38.240]  so it's the same thing with health care you know we're going from the rich carlton to mcdonald's
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:48.320]  health care we'll be right back this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:14.880]  working for the ufc in 1997 i was the post fight interviewer so 13 years yeah it's been a long time
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.720]  in fact i remember like in 99 talking to you and you're like man this ufc is going to be huge and
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.960]  i never even heard of it it's going to be bigger than nfl yeah everybody was like what are you
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:30.880]  talking about you're crazy yeah it's now looking it's giant and it's in austin texas off shones
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:37.520]  it's right here you know when i was with ventura last week one of the guys from the company that
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.600]  does stuff for ufc was there and he was going to interview brock lesnar right after that when he
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.480]  he was on the shoot with us and so all brocks back bigger than ever huh yeah yeah well he had uh you
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:50.800]  know diverticulitis you know what that is that's when your intestines get uh basically inflamed
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:56.480]  well it's yeah for meeting just he all he's so psycho he only eats meat he didn't eat vegetables
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.120]  so he would like have like protein would get that's what john wane had supposedly 40 pounds of
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:07.360]  undigested meat in him yeah isn't that i want to get like no he had really bad diverticulitis
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:11.840]  and and and yeah and you've got how many hundreds of feet of intestine yeah and it just basically
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:19.440]  yeah well that's a nice way to start the interview brocks back that's the the point what but but
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:24.160]  but is he now eating uh his his his vegetables yes he's now eating fiber and broccoli and all
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:28.480]  the things you need to make sure that your digestive tract is clean it's very important
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:32.640]  but you realize that as you get older as i go at older i get excited about like when i eat salads
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:36.960]  i'm gonna i'm gonna have a good poop now because i had a good sound okay joe family show that's
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.120]  that's all say that you can't say poop you can't say anything really i'm just joking okay getting
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:46.160]  serious here now that we've talked now that we've talked about rock lezner's digestive tract uh
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:52.080]  last night you were really making a lot of points that i thought were right on uh let's let's get into
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.720]  the red button the red button you were talking about how if there's a red button they're gonna hit it
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:02.560]  well you know what i was saying is that i believe that all human behavior is natural just like i
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:07.680]  believe that all animal behavior is natural bees make beehives and ants make ant hills these are
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:14.160]  all natural things humans are far more complex but we don't think of ourselves as as being natural
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:19.280]  that we're moving in a natural direction and i think that human beings and human society especially
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:25.120]  with technology i think we create we create technology and innovation that's what we're here
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:31.200]  for and it's very possible that what human beings are here for is to make some new reality make some
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:37.280]  new technological innovation that's going to change the world and it could be a big bang machine it
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:45.360]  could be a time machine it could be just some incredible discovery something that they're going
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:49.040]  to invent eventually i mean if they keep going with things like the large hadron collider they're
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:52.720]  not going to stop there they're going to use whatever findings that they get from the large
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.880]  hadron collider if it doesn't blow up the world and they're going to try the next thing well what
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.720]  happens now we found the goal is blow up the world well i don't know what the goal is i mean that's
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.040]  just the joke the joke is that we're here to make the big bang machine and that there's a reset button
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.360]  that gets pressed every 15 billion years and that these intelligent monkeys get to a point where they
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.080]  break down matter and try to figure out what what is at the the center of the universe and they press
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:20.160]  that button and it restarts all over again i mean who knows just speculation but you also made
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:23.680]  another really good point we come back from this quick break you were talking about a case on fair
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:28.640]  factor of where you had these hundreds of thousands of bees out and and what happened
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:33.840]  while this was going on correct yeah it was kind of cool because we we uh we'll stay there we got
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:37.520]  to go to break okay we come back tell that story we'll talk okay we'll get uh eddie bravo's view
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:41.360]  on the world give out his website and stuff i'm really glad to have both you guys here i'm glad
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:45.840]  great to be here as well all right and uh we're gonna make joe stand on the corner for saying
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:54.240]  boop i'm just joking around folks um really good really good seeing you guys you know we were

[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.320]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.240]  going to see a huge war down there there's four cartels that aren't paying their money to the cia
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.080]  and launderer their money like tony montana he was good he went to the local bank and launderer
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:01.200]  and they left him alone and of course that's fiction but uh the screenwriter on that oliver
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:06.160]  stone went and actually studied real cases so it's a composite of true stories so i was told years
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.760]  before the 28 000 have now been killed that you're going to see a war down there as globalist backed
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:18.720]  los zetas go in and start killing local police mayors anybody that doesn't basically submit to
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:24.800]  them so it's a war over who gets the drug money not a war on drugs so in afghanistan real taliban
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:30.320]  got in you know they were nuts but they were real open production went down over 90 percent now it's
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:36.160]  up 12 times its previous record it's flowing out and the us troops protect the opium and they put
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:41.120]  this on the news because if they don't al qaeda will get the money and and no no no i'm serious i
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:46.880]  mean i played a clip of fox news are all listening how patriotic it is to grow opium but then you
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.600]  think i'm joking come on guys cue it up oh let's see this well you're only here for an hour because
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.480]  you've got to go see it i want to uh at the way ends at 230 yes but i have to see that well we'll
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.720]  go into overdrive then yesterday today is i just have to do some interviews and then the fight started
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:08.400]  for them is that espn stuff or spike it's uh spike tv and some stuff for ufc.com okay alex but how does
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:13.120]  how do the americans get paid for the opium is what i'm saying how does that work uh it gets
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:19.040]  the okay 1999 rovera yep can we hear him uh you guys would have to have headphones on
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:24.080]  oh look i just played it yesterday during the break i'll play it for you how's that sound sounds
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:30.320]  okay well sirs have seen it and exactly word for word uh well herald rovera is a shell is your
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.840]  shell i don't know he was the guy who introduced the um he was the one who had the uh zapruder
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:40.480]  film first on television the word is he knows all about this stuff but yeah at fox news he didn't
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:44.080]  really get into it what are you saying what are you saying he goes i'm out here with the colonel
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.080]  and they're out here helping them grow the opium and the colonel's like that's right we give them
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:55.680]  the seeds and the fertilizer what yeah well what do they say how do they explain to the public that
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:59.520]  it's legit i mean what are they what are they saying we're giving them the seeds we're planning it and
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:06.160]  we're protecting it why because if we don't al qaeda will grow it and get the money that's really
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.240]  the excuse they use that's during the break you can walk out there and listen to it because you
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:13.440]  don't have headphones and we weren't going to take calls this clip yeah another word it's on
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:18.720]  thing put it on fox what what's fox is like we grow the opium it's it's it's of the lord
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:24.720]  herald rovera opium afghanistan what do we punch him what are the key words look at him he's showing
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:30.400]  them uh what's the name of that clip so i can just give him this is huge yes it's it's it's we
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:39.920]  tolerate we farmers hostage there's lieutenant colonel brian christmas second line company third
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:46.800]  battalion six marines what's incredible is that no one even questions it there is literally more
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.560]  than 90 of the world's opium supply comes from afghanistan and essentially the u.s government
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:58.560]  is in control of it now and no one even brings it up and it's well known that the cia has been
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:03.200]  involved in the drug trade if you just look into it look into the berry seals case look into you
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.640]  know what what happened in minna arkansas looking at all these different guys that have
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:13.680]  talked about the is the uh guys will you bring my compromise book in here uh it's it a terry
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:20.560]  reid clinton bush compromise clinton bush in the cia it's just sitting right there um i mean he was
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:26.240]  there with with all these people bill clinton was coming george bush senior it's just so strange
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:30.560]  that this is a signed one but that's kooky talk though if you bring that up if you start saying
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:34.480]  that you know you believe that the government is involved in drug dealing and that the government
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:40.240]  has been involved in uh bringing uh crack into inner city neighborhoods and using the profits to
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:44.880]  pay for uh black ops missions i mean that sounds like kooky talk even though they had the 1996
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:49.760]  hearings on c-span where they admitted yeah i mean it is real i mean it really is real the
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:53.840]  government has been involved in selling drugs well they're involved in creating monopolies
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:00.160]  and so what they do is the corrupt kernels and generals they get a big cut i mean most of these
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:03.280]  people that retire out of the military you see these generals are living in three million dollar
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:08.480]  houses on their you know hundred thousand dollar a year pension wow and you know they got a mistress
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:12.640]  down the street in another mansion i mean you know where's the money coming from well it's coming from
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:18.720]  arm sales on the side narcotics trafficking i mean our government is one giant murdering mafia
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:23.760]  it is it is fascinating to me that like so few people even know about like the gulf of tonkin
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:28.800]  incident and know that there was there was really uh there was like a fake incident that goddess
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:32.640]  involved in the vietnam war and people have just accepted that well they've accepted that the
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:38.720]  government is willing to lie in order to get you into war but so if they're willing to kill people
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:44.080]  and for for whatever their own reasons are and and and have a fake event in order to kill people
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.000]  you don't think they would sell drugs like you don't you think they would kill they would have
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.720]  american soldiers killed they basically put american soldiers to death over a lot no the v a signed a
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:59.200]  secret deal that came out in bloomberg yesterday with six million vets to when they die steal
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:05.360]  their insurance money and the government says it's legal we have authorized it i've got it right here
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:09.200]  in bloomberg but isn't it fascinating that all this stuff is legal i mean isn't it fascinating
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.080]  rather that all this stuff is public knowledge that all this stuff is anyone can go online and
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:18.880]  find out about operation northwoods anyone can go online find out about the gulf of tonkin or
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:23.360]  read about barry seals or read about michael rupert and all the different things that he uncovered
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:29.120]  when he was working for the la pd but no one knows it's just it's such and talking about it you
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:33.920]  sound like a kook totally speaking of sounding like a kook a lot of people think i'm a kook for
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:39.920]  questioning what the hell's going on with chemtrails give what's your take on well i've
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:43.520]  actually been working on a chemtrail film for two years it's going to come out next year
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:46.800]  because i'll sell no wine before it's time i've got to get it you know right with all the evidence
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.760]  we have the patent where they add it to the jet fuel so it's compartment and then yes yes so it's
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:59.600]  dispersed and that's just one of the programs and it's all declassified it's all in plain view
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:05.360]  white house has press conferences that they're studying this massive program is just the studying
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:11.120]  yeah and that it's been going on since the early 1990s and the guy won a nobel prize for it and
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:16.560]  then most the people that cover it they just go off down the kooky road and never and i can give
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:21.920]  them the pure evidence and they won't look at that you know the craziest thing is the the chemtrail
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:26.400]  show on discovery channel have you seen this no they do it they're gonna find out once and for
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:32.320]  all is this a hoax or is this real so they they hired a group of scientists like these top scientists
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:37.680]  are gonna study and you know what they did they took random fuel from a local airport from a
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:42.000]  commercial airline fuel and studied it to see if there was high levels of barium and aluminum
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.440]  when no one is saying like southwest and united is sprain it's military jets that are doing this
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:50.800]  well there's a bunch of different programs how weird is that that they put that on tv and then
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:56.320]  the final analysis was the scientists came out and said well based on our analysis there is no excess
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:00.960]  of barium or aluminum these guys are are you don't believe whatever they want these conspiracy
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:06.160]  theories but we have the evidence we have the test and had and they studied commercial airline fuel
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:10.880]  is that crazy i mean who put together the show well that's called a straw man you know it's like
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:18.560]  we're looking for a bingo tiger and so we went to the outback of australia and didn't find one

[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:18.800]  their rollovera piece watching the soldiers and the well i don't know what rank he was but talking
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:24.400]  about how they are protecting and helping these guys grow opium because it's a part of their culture
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:28.800]  because if they don't they would they would they would turn on the uh the u.s soldiers so they're
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:33.200]  helping them grow opium i mean it was amazing but the taliban was actually shutting it down
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.040]  the taliban was shutting before remember that's that's why well why were they doing it because
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:43.360]  they wanted the money like what it was no no they were saying it was against islam so they were
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.200]  eradicating it poppy production went down to almost nothing right before 9 11 that after the
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:52.480]  invasion record production went up and they help them ship it out everything so the taliban are good
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:59.600]  guys no there were two talibans there was the original uh mujahideen i've had general hami
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:04.240]  ghul the former head of pakistani intelligence who ran it when they fought the russians that was
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:09.200]  the real taliban then they created al qaeda within it which is the cia group that they used to go out
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:13.600]  and do bad things and then blame on the taliban must have a taliban or good guys overall i don't
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:17.520]  agree with their religious beliefs or how they treat women the point is the real taliban how
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:22.640]  long there's the real ira and the fake ira the real taliban was eradicating all the pompis
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:26.480]  so that was another reason for the invasion well that is a fascinating piece of video footage
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:31.040]  with herald the reverie you know in the poppy field with the soldiers talking about the poppy
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.320]  fields and how they're protecting them and providing them fertilizer and helping them grow it yeah
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:42.720]  i mean that's incredible at that it is incredible where is that money going who's getting it how
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:47.440]  does it how does it well they estimate it's 500 billion street value out of afghanistan alone
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:53.600]  every year oh joe don't take the lord's name in vain god god damn okay i don't ever say okay good
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:26:00.480]  you're a spiritual god you actually believe in god i well not necessarily what i don't i don't
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:06.160]  think that it is i don't believe in religion i don't i believe that all religions are the work
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:12.560]  of man but i am not opposed to the idea of a higher power you know i i think there's no way you
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:17.760]  could know and there's no way i know whether there's a god or whether there's a grand plan or a grand
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:21.520]  designer of the universe i don't think it's out of the question some of the things that i've
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:27.360]  experienced in my life i mean especially i don't want to talk about psychedelic drugs but um they
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.840]  are uh i believe portals to other states of consciousness and other ways of looking at the
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:38.320]  world and i think uh if you've experienced some of those things a lot more things uh become possible
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:43.440]  like oh you you think that a lot more things are aren't out of the question and uh that's how i look
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:48.320]  at the idea of god i don't necessarily i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't i don't think it's i have a
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:54.400]  feeling that it's not as simple as like there's a one dude who knows everything that's at the
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:59.760]  at the top of the heap i think it's more like god is everything it's all connected and there's like
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:05.920]  sort of like a grand design to the universe the force yeah maybe the force we'll go with some
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.680]  jedi night type stuff yoda floating around up there on the cloud you mean but you know like i
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:15.520]  don't say i mean when you say you believe in god well there and when it talks about the god of the
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:21.280]  bible and you know that's that's well i didn't mean to get us off into that but uh eddie had a
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.080]  question and i don't actually don't want to be interviewed here but he's like don't finish up
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:28.400]  with the chemtrails you interviewing us about he's fascinated by chemtrails you interviewing us
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:34.080]  is like me interviewing the pope about child molestation you know what i'm saying i don't want to
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:39.680]  ask you questions like like what's up what is your final take on chemtrails one minute
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:45.280]  there is a wide spectrum of different operations they're they're doing biological and chemical
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:49.760]  releases on the population to manipulate the environment it's most the programs are weather
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:56.000]  modification related there are harp antenna array programs with over the horizon radar systems
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.240]  and i've had the head of harp on bizarrely enough about four years ago they contacted me and said
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:05.840]  the director of the harp program directed radar system would like to be on your show so what and
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.720]  i got him on a harp well listen he started saying we even ignite the atmosphere on fire it's wonderful
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:14.880]  is like this brainiac and suddenly a colonel comes on and cuts him off as we go to break and the
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:18.560]  colonel's like that's classified we're going to end the interview right now if you bring up that
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:22.320]  and and so the military is really running things but this scientist is the head of it
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:26.160]  and people can pull that interview up alex jones interviews the head of harp so explain harp
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:30.480]  though because i'm i'm a little ignorant about it i know that there's this that's just one big array
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:35.040]  up in alaska but they got a bunch of them and they can manipulate the weather uh with these not just
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:40.560]  the old-fashioned spraying barium salts or other nuclei i or aluminum dioxide but they can charge
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:44.400]  the atmosphere but then by spraying these what are they doing how they're charging it what are they
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:51.040]  doing they've got giant antenna arrays and they can even ignite the sky they can even create
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:56.240]  artificial aurora borealis they can they can antenna doing though there's a bunch of it's basically
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:02.800]  giant microwaves okay and they're just and they're manipulating shooting microwaves up at the ionosphere
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.080]  yes yes it's but it's weather modification and it's over the horizon radar what do you think
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:15.040]  about the the conspiracy theories about a katrina being a controlled hurricane how the the way it
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:19.760]  uh multiple top meteorologists said it had two eyes for a while it just sat there it didn't act
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:24.640]  like a normal hurricane and i've had the father of weather weapons on it was flying into cyclones
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:29.040]  that are over 200 miles an hour in the 40s ben livingston and it's all declassified this is like
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:35.520]  ap and well well we're going to break but to make a long story short we're going to break already
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:42.240]  yeah in 1967 that's it's a regular radio clock there's like a long segment short segments in 1967

[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:33.040]  el machete so you believe that the movie machete with danie trejo is uh by the government designed
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:43.040]  to fuel a race war he's a super hero mexican home depot guy just beat that i'm sorry dude i totally
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:48.960]  okay but just just just just okay we took care of that are we good did we take it yeah we did sure
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:54.400]  okay i feel like it got out no it didn't feel like that one might okay okay stop guys come on
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:34:01.280]  sorry guys come on is this guy anyway so this movie uh is really a plot to explain that what
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:05.440]  what this movie's really all about okay a month and a half ago when the whole moss thing started
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:10.080]  i said it's cia funded i went and looked rockefeller foundation funding it the co-owner of fox news
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:14.560]  funding the mosque then fox news counters the whole moss thing is a way to create division so
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:19.760]  that now i think rodriguez is being get upset about it yes and it turns out uh fox studios is
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:26.880]  funding machete okay fox studios is funding machete uh and it's getting state funds to be made
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:30.720]  and i got the script hispanic members of the crew were upsetting this is gonna really create
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:35.200]  division it's a race war film and i got the script and then they came out and said you
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:39.600]  don't have a script that's not in the movie and and then it came out as word for word the script
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:46.080]  and it starts with robert deniro uh being a racist white senator uh killing a hispanic lady who's
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:50.880]  pregnant making fun of her dead baby and the whole movie is if you want any border control as mexico's
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:55.360]  collapsing into bedlam if you want any control i mean there's six and a half billion people they
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:59.360]  all want to come here it's over if that happens i mean especially when the government gives welfare
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:04.160]  that's going to bankrupt the country so the point is if you are against totally open borders you are
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:09.360]  a murdering kukluks clan demon but this is definitely have to be a conspiracy isn't it possible that
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:13.040]  it's just a work of fiction that there was a writer who thought it would be an interesting
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:18.000]  subject to cover and then people would get into it and that would be a popular film because there's
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.240]  so much controversy when it comes to the borders and then maybe they just created it and thought
[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:27.600]  that it would be economically viable no no it was a fake it was a fake movie trailer and the previous
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:32.880]  movie you wear this yes and then they just people started it was one of those movies with grindhouse
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:36.400]  yes it was a little movie trailer and they decided to make a movie and then he put a
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:41.120]  trailer out calling it the arizona trailer four months ago and he said oh that's fake
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:46.080]  none of that's in the movie it's all in the movie the arizona trailer being because of the border
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:51.440]  problems and they says this is a message to arizona how hilarious is that dumb lady that's
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:56.320]  running arizona that jan whatever the hell her name is who's it the who's the governor of arizona
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:04.080]  well yeah brewer is that like jan brewer yeah that lady is so dumb have you ever seen her on tv
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:08.880]  oh my god when she was on the debate and she just paused she didn't know what to say she paused for
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:14.320]  like 10 solid seconds said nothing she makes up stuff about people getting their heads cut off over
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:18.560]  in arizona that mexicans are coming over here and cutting people's heads off and then they're like
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.080]  where are these bodies like what are you talking about like they started investigating the corners
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:27.200]  reports joe that's the media spin right there so it's true she's telling the truth a lot of people
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:31.360]  do get their heads cut off what about when she said that her father died in world war two because
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:36.080]  fighting the nazis meanwhile her dad like lived to be like an old man and wasn't the army in the
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:40.160]  fifties he wasn't even in the army i wasn't aware of that it's a liar listen listen we're running out
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:45.280]  of time here let me let me just say something i'm not a big fan and joe knows this i hate super
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:52.640]  super movie oh adi bravo come on man we're on the radio i'm sorry i can't bring him with me anymore

[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:06.720]  el machete wasn't the greatest plot ever but wait a minute what are you saying it wasn't the greatest
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:12.160]  plot ever but you know for as a mexican you can't relate to spider man that's a white nerd who you
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:18.160]  know and then and then uh um batman a white billionaire we as a mexican people we have nothing

[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:29.760]  you know for me i've felt like why couldn't it be a mexican scientist who you know who becomes
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:35.440]  an incredible hulk or something yes no no the mexican superhero hacks up gringos he pulled up

[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:44.640]  let me tell you something the mexicans i know that warned me about this film that were on the
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:50.240]  production they didn't like the stereotype of mexicans as working at home depot and wanting
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:58.720]  to kill gringos i like that oh well this has been an insane interview adi bravo you you just really

[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.880]  back to fear factor and the bees that's a really interesting story interesting we had an episode
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:23.040]  of fear factor where we covered people in bees there's part of the stunt they would stand we had
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:26.880]  them like i believe they were handcuffed to a pole and then we covered them with bees and they had
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.560]  to keep the bees on them for a certain amount of time then take them off so we had a beekeeper
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:35.440]  that had you know literally hundreds of thousands of bees you had a giant truck filled with bees
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:41.280]  well while we were doing this stunt we were out in this this this field area that was like near
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:46.640]  these mountains and there was a local bee population so we have these hundreds of thousands of bees
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:52.720]  flying in the air all around these people well an invading group came in so it was a local bee
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:57.840]  population came in a giant swarm and they started communicating with the bees that we had and it was
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:03.760]  a trip and we had to stop production in the middle of this stunt we had to stop and the beekeeper
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:09.040]  said everybody's got to back off they have to work this out so these the bees that were local came
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:13.840]  and were communicating with the other bees and there was a giant swarm in the sky where these
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:19.520]  two bees these two bee populations were interacting with each other it was fascinating took about 20
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:24.240]  minutes they worked it out and then the local bees you know were like well what are you guys doing
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:27.760]  over here and like we're just filming a movie like okay you're not coming here to eat our flowers
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:31.440]  and take our pollen like no no no no we're just working for this guy and he has his coming here
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:35.600]  we're working on a tv show like literally talked it out and then the local bees took off and left
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.360]  them alone and then we continued filming but it was fascinating like they had to communicate they had
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.800]  to figure it out it's little aliens you know i've even tried this with birds around my house and
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:50.240]  things if i come out and even put in my mind the intent like i'm gonna kill that bird without even
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.000]  having a weapon the bird flies off but if you're just being out nice and friendly you know the
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  birds just sit there almost land on your hand they're all i've got all these tame swallows around my
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.240]  house so it's almost like there's something telepathic they pick up on the intent someone is
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:09.040]  going to take this clip and use it and say alex jones uses mind control on birds they probably
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:15.040]  will no no no what i'm saying is i'm gonna kill you bird no no no have you ever exactly i don't
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:21.680]  care have you ever been uh you know in a building you think you're alone and you feel somebody looking
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:25.280]  at you and you turn around they're looking at you i mean i can't tell you how many have said that
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:32.880]  that is what i mean look there i think there are some enhanced states of telepathic you know
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:37.680]  communication that we all have there's there's something that connects us like when you're
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.600]  thinking about someone and they call you like you're thinking about them and then right when
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:45.920]  you're thinking about them they call you i think there's something to that but the one provable
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:51.280]  one is that people can tell it's been proven in studies that they can tell when someone's looking
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:55.760]  at them and they've had studies where they've had people and they've had people stand facing one
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:00.880]  direction and had someone look behind them and people can sense you know more often than we have
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:05.680]  a family ranch and there's not supposed to be people you know out there poaching or whatever
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:09.920]  but two separate times i've been out by myself once when i was a teenager and another time a few
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:14.640]  years ago and i'm out in the middle of nowhere i mean this is a lot of acreage and i feel somebody
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:19.040]  looking at me and i walk 200 yards through the woods right up to somebody poaching in a deer
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.280]  stand out of season i mean i couldn't see the deer stand couldn't see the guy i could feel them
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:27.120]  looking and then went through the woods he was up high so he could see me and he was like yeah i was
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.760]  looking at you i mean it was like automatic on somebody black helicopter somebody is looking at
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:35.520]  me you don't worry about a dude like that shooting you like they're shooting dears illegally you're
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:39.600]  like hey buddy what are you doing up there with a gun and a tree wearing camo you don't worry
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:44.320]  about it's gonna shoot you uh no because i mean most good hunters i mean they're gonna need to see
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:49.280]  and they're not hunters on poach they're exactly they're not gonna shoot our cows that are out there
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.280]  too i mean there are idiots that get drunk and drive up and think that cows every year
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:58.480]  or deer and they shoot them really yeah oh that happens a lot or they have those fake robot deer
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:02.400]  that the cops put up the game wardens and idiots just pull up and start blasting off the side of
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.040]  the highway film them right is it the real year have cameras on them yeah nice here's where your
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:13.920]  money's going robot deer are we going somewhere with the b story no he's just we're probably going
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:19.200]  down profanity lane eddy bravo eddy bravo i'm sorry about that that's okay just do it next turn
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:23.360]  i'm sorry about that let me do it as soon as possible again the guys delayed it so how many
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:29.920]  guys from the roswell incident how many guys on their deathbed on their deathbed confessed
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:35.440]  there's a couple ramy right yeah philip corso right yeah that kernel how many was there two or three
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:41.120]  are you are you on top of roswell i'll say this uh there is a i mean it just came out and like the
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:46.240]  bbc two weeks ago that church ill thought aliens were invading they had these flying saucers flying
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:52.480]  all over london tracking their planes uh and there's a lot of stuff going on in china remember
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:59.120]  airport closed down maybe three months ago yeah no no i mean they've had giant craft over dallas
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:03.520]  a few years ago remember like giant blimps i mean they look like blimps because they were blimps and
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:07.840]  abc news aimed cameras and salt lake and said look it's aliens and it was just a giant homeland
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:12.560]  security blimp but here's the issue i'm sure out of all the trillions of galaxies that are out there
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.560]  there's some stuff going on my issue is the distances and everything and of course in their
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:21.440]  spacetime continuum uh you know dimensional travel things like that that that have been
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:26.560]  theoretically developed like the mind of max plank 110 years ago with equations created atomic theory
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:31.280]  and the plans for atomic weapons and that was a guy on a chalkboard envisioning this so i have no
[02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:38.240]  doubt whatever we can envision it seems to either come true or uh we're then able to lever to to
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:43.040]  later build it but i just don't get into ufo's and things eddie because i can't prove it one way or
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:47.520]  the other i mean i can prove they're putting mercury in shots and that it's a plan to brain
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:52.240]  damage people i can prove that they created tetanus vaccines to sterilize women i have the
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:58.000]  absolute admissions and i can't get people to care they're like good well you know i love it uh i love
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:03.520]  my kid being autistic i want more shots so i mean i just try to cover what i can cover i
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.560]  thought you were all over ufo's uh excuse me i'm sorry no no we'll go back no no no we are no no
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:13.840]  no nomination fascinating why ufo's no no we do cover ufo's i'm not saying you're bad for talking
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:18.560]  about it and wl let's go back no but here's the bigger issue with ufo's we do have partially
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:24.480]  declassified things like project blue beam where they plan to project giant holograms you know the
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:31.200]  size of a star destroyer to freak people out or project jesus buddha muhammad as a psych warfare
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:36.720]  weapon and that the government has looked at plans to have fake alien landings to unify the
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:41.040]  planet around world government well didn't they look into the possibility of creating a gay bomb
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:45.200]  to use the iraqi soldiers yes a bomb that would make them sexually attracted to each other and
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:51.520]  kill morale that's real genius isn't that true that is real right yes and they created tsunami
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:57.200]  bombs uh secretary us and i'm seriously it's it uh it's it's a no bombs are funny but not as funny
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:02.800]  as gay bombs gay bombs are the funniest can you imagine if that was real what if it is real
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:07.520]  is it possible has it you would know is it possible to create a bomb that makes everybody gay is
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:15.440]  that possible probably not what about um the latest in emotional control and like radio waves
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:20.640]  to control so poppers freak birth control pills that's what that is uh yes frequency pollution
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:24.240]  but now they're coming out with a new class of vaccines they call them vaccines eddie but
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:30.960]  they're not even vaccines you hear oh new vaccine to cure drug use or cigarette use or coffee but
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.200]  it but but live viruses go in and attack your brain and actually destroy the receptors so you
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.720]  can't even absorb the drugs anymore that mimic your normal uh endorphins and so their behavior
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:47.360]  modification vaccines where they shoot you up and then you don't have the will to even get angry
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:52.960]  they're calling him anti stress vaccines he doesn't believe it search the term anti no no no but
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:57.680]  anti stress vaccines and it says don't worry joe don't worry joe you take this shot you're never
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:01.680]  going to get mad again i'll take it i'm tired of getting mad do you ever get tired of getting mad
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:05.600]  do you ever get tired of all this doom and gloom and they're coming to get you ladies and gentlemen
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:10.480]  black helicopters no that's part of the struggle of being a human this is the struggle of being a
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:16.000]  human though searching for searching to sustain the species to bring us to the next level and
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:22.080]  to not let these degenerate control freaks ruin uh our our chance to colonize space when charlie

[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:57.600]  went out to the comedy club we went out to dinner afterwards we had a great time we hung out had a
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:02.000]  lot of laughs there was no doom and gloom and you know i was like man hanging out with alex jones
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.240]  must be a bummer you know the dude's always talking about the end of the world and vaccines robbing
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:11.600]  your soul and well no you're you're a but but i mean i'm warning people about all these things
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:15.840]  because life is good right i want to protect what's good so do you private property rights the
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:21.440]  family do you think by being ultra paranoid and ultra aware and and and being an alarmist and
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.800]  coming out against all these things that you are helping because you're making it more difficult
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:31.760]  for people to do evil things you're making it because of all the information that you're releasing
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:37.200]  you're making it harder for these people to work though well to be clear when nightline was here a
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:41.440]  while back they said are you exaggerating things because you think it's good for your cause and
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:45.360]  you know it's the noble lie and texas monthly asked me that too and i'm not saying that's
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:49.040]  what you're saying but i'm just going to the extreme of that and i'm like no this is really
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:53.360]  going on the good in the world is so much better than i could even describe the bad in the world
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:58.000]  is worse than i can describe these globalists really are greedy creatures they really do have
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:02.480]  death panels they really do want to start killing people now bill gates has come out and admitted
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:07.120]  it and said how great it is they really do bill gates has said that we have an overpopulation
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.120]  problem yeah and he has said that we he thinks that the species should be limited to a certain
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:14.640]  number of people but he hasn't said you know there should be death panels and all that kind of
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:20.080]  actually no no he just recently did he said there should be death panels yes really yes okay i don't
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:27.840]  know what he said why why are you why aren't you dead that's a good question like you should have like
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:32.880]  security you worry about that all the time well you what you need to worry about is more nutty
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:38.320]  ultra patriot dudes than you do the actual sea or schizophrenics it doesn't it's we've had a lot
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:44.720]  of schizophrenics go i know you put the chip in my head oh man and it's like uh are they still doing
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:48.640]  the chips are they still into the chips so they realize you know it's oh yeah they have nano they
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:53.200]  have nano tech chips we're probably all got a minute's really yeah i'm feeling pretty good with
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:58.000]  this chip i think i got a good chip i gotta ask you they're mainly tracker chips alex i got a
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  question about the y2k you were saying i was listening to old tapes and you were saying no no no i
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:10.480]  no no i did nine hours of radio okay on y2k on the genesis network and my girlfriend runs in on my
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.280]  wife and she says they're on abc news saying a missile was launched from russia so i run back out
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:20.080]  there and abc news is saying a missile's been fired for russia so i said i don't know what it means
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:24.160]  but a missile's been fired for russia then they come back and say oh it's just a scud and we have
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:28.960]  to have the russians here at norad and it's like some kind of drill or something and then i went on
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:34.320]  a guy named michael trudeau show that day and made jokes about it so people took nine hours and edited
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.800]  nine hours part of it me joking around like joe was saying earlier like nuclear plants were blowing
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:44.240]  yeah no it's not true no what they did is they just took pieces and like i'd have an ap article
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:48.480]  saying well six plants are going offline and then an hour later they'd say it wasn't true
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:52.720]  they were doing that to create fear yes like like i didn't believe in y2k at first then the
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:56.320]  then the pentagon said it was going to be real then i started believing it and then right before
[02:50:56.320 --> 02:51:01.280]  they said oh we never said that it was a psyop you worry but only because you're paying attention
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:06.080]  what's happening in the Gulf of mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature a similar audacity called
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:10.960]  gmo or genetically modified organisms means that the quality of commercially grown food may be
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.520]  compromised with our health in the balance now that summer's here what better time to learn about
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:21.120]  the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food let author lynda runyon show you the best
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:25.920]  kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look this summer for the cost of a good meal
[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:29.920]  or two out you can literally starvation proof yourself and your loved ones against any future
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:35.120]  craziness and put up tons of free food too whatever experiment is being run on us you can rest assured

[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:27.280]  eddie you want kim trail info here here's our research for a film we've been working on for
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:31.360]  two years well this is something that your your staff just handed me that's hilarious the texas
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.120]  department of licensing and regulation there's a complaint form and one of the things in the
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:44.080]  complaint form is an investigation of weather modification complaints and it says and this is
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:49.360]  the options the identity of the county affected by the seeding the location where the seeds took
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:54.480]  place the seeding took place they're talking about cloud seeding if different from the effect of
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:55:01.280]  county specific dates and the time of the seeding and then in the online complaint process please
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:07.280]  choose the statute you are reporting a violation on one of the options is weather modification
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:12.720]  services like yeah now now there's thousands of those companies globally but that's not even like
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:18.960]  publicly no one even knows yeah well do you see this ability this is all the patterns
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:24.000]  all the admissions the programs this is what they admit right here and this is full of them is a
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:31.680]  patent on cloud seeding to reduce global warming with barium salt aluminum dioxide 15 years ago
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:36.320]  the researcher said we've tested it it's aluminum dioxide barium salt they say shut up cooks these
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.120]  patents there's patents to add to the jet fuel aluminum is very poisonous it poisons the soil
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:46.800]  the soil it poisons the brain it poisons it rain is that what it does what is it doing no no this
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:53.760]  is this is higher atmosphere spraying creating artificial clouds with the aluminum dioxide barium
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:56:00.720]  salt a nuclei but the issue is they've got the patents and then the programs where it is added
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:05.520]  to some commercial jet fuel but they don't know and that disperses the nuclei out of the jet engines
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:10.560]  i mean i have the patents really good at making the weather changing the weather and then like
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:16.080]  say like this colorado wildfire they just had what if they could just fly over and seed the clouds
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:20.000]  and make it rain and put out the fire wouldn't that be good the truth is they're already doing that
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.720]  covertly they've been doing that since vietnam war they were creating uh yeah that was ben
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:30.160]  livingston i mean i flew him to austin i interviewed ben livingston who it was all classified they
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.760]  just declassified it in 2005 and that's the guy they were creating and steering and controlling
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:41.040]  hurricanes then and that's why he came on the show he said i don't get why they didn't stop katrina
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:45.920]  yeah i mean we we were doing this in 67 he said with seven aircraft i'd have knocked it down
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:51.760]  really yeah well so we just fly above it and spray something on the hurricane yeah
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:56.880]  they call it the generation cells have you seen them like if you pay attention you see that they're
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:00.640]  creating like beautiful cloud patterns they're they're getting they're like artists they're
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:05.200]  making dashes and then turn well isn't that not possible that that is flight paths and what they're
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.240]  dealing with is just the moisture in the atmosphere yeah but here's the deal documents pertain to
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:16.080]  experiment until it doesn't mean no no no no no no they call whole wars at the pentagon iraq and
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:22.080]  afghanistan are now called laboratories what why does a doctor call the person that they're working
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:28.240]  on a patient because it was all about experimentation the last 200 years you were practicing on the
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:33.520]  patient you were practicing so they're practicing on us well what else would you call someone that's
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:37.440]  going to a doctor if they weren't a patient what would be the other option but the point is
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:44.080]  it's not the patient let's say listen it's not the patient issue it's the word that they're calling
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:50.000]  it a practice so all this is practicing okay practicing practicing art form you practice but
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.760]  you practice medicine i mean it is like you know when you practice jujitsu you do it to somebody
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:59.200]  exactly you know but they're calling all of these tests that are giant operations they're calling
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:04.880]  them practices yes and you're making a movie a documentary on chemtrails yes wow and there's
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:09.120]  another one that next year but there's another one coming out that i've seen it's a pretty good
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:13.680]  and we're going to be selling that as well aerosols that one that's out on google video
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:18.560]  aerosols aerosol crimes yeah aerosol crime very good stuff everything in that film has now been
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:23.520]  proven real they went from denying all this two years ago they suddenly just admitted it all
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:29.680]  but they do it real dryly and go yes we're saving you from children's textbooks in like six grade
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:34.960]  say they're chemtrailing as they don't call it chemtrails joe eddie bravo ufc here in austin
