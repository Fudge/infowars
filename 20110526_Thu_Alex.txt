[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.360 --> 00:18.920]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.920 --> 00:31.240]  Texas Alex Jones it is Thursday the 26th day of May 2011 we're gonna be live
[00:31.240 --> 00:37.280]  here for the next three hours so start your engines my engine is running a
[00:37.280 --> 00:45.640]  little rough but I'm here I screamed for over an hour off and on at the Texas
[00:45.640 --> 00:53.640]  Capitol yesterday in the cacophonous halls I absolutely want to salute the
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.120]  hundred or so people that were there when I got there at about 245 then I came
[00:58.120 --> 01:02.800]  back outside and everywhere I went I saw new people that were arriving and more
[01:02.800 --> 01:07.840]  crowds even showed up over the evening the San Antonio paper estimates over
[01:07.840 --> 01:15.160]  300 over the day I saw a hundred at one time and more than a hundred milling
[01:15.160 --> 01:20.840]  around other areas so unknown numbers I would say conservatively probably 500
[01:20.840 --> 01:26.120]  people showed up from all over Texas spontaneously because they were putting
[01:26.120 --> 01:30.400]  the phones off the hook or they were busy or they were going to voicemail at
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.440]  the Texas State Capitol the whole world's watching with this TSA takeover
[01:37.440 --> 01:42.120]  operation and now suddenly we first had the report out yesterday I'm just so
[01:42.120 --> 01:49.240]  proud of our writers and researchers they got Senator Simonson our house
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.720]  member Simonson Senator Patrick's letters talking about the feds threatening
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.720]  blockades releasing the letter from the feds threatening the no-fly zone over
[01:58.720 --> 02:03.600]  Texas and that's what it is and we put it in an article and today I tuned through
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.000]  a whole bunch of talk stations hundreds of news articles including national news
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.240]  articles I scanned over in Dallas Morning News San Antonio Express News
[02:13.240 --> 02:22.040]  Houston Chronicle Boston Globe Politico Forbes I mean just everywhere pretty
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.120]  much unanimously against what the feds have done people really see this
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.640]  tyranny we're making the tyrants act like tyrants and pointing out that my
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.440]  goodness the TSA says it's our way or the highway we're gonna stick our hands
[02:36.440 --> 02:39.040]  down your children's pants we're gonna grab you on the outside we're gonna
[02:39.040 --> 02:44.240]  fondle the genitals of Miss America we're gonna leave the borders wide open
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.080]  and if you don't like it we'll just have a blockade on you like your Libya or
[02:48.080 --> 02:54.280]  like your Iran well those are just sanctions with Iran but there is a
[02:54.280 --> 03:04.840]  blockade of Libya an act of war so incredible and Senator Patrick yesterday
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.080]  withdrew his bill and then tried to bring it back to the floor when he thought
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.120]  he had the votes he originally had 30 of 31 senators confirmed and we've now
[03:14.120 --> 03:18.920]  discovered who the exact culprit is for gutting it at the behest of the Obama
[03:18.920 --> 03:24.160]  administration and he set to try to replace Perry as governor he said or he'll
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.160]  run for U.S. Senate with Bilderberg group member K. Bailey Hutchinson stands
[03:28.160 --> 03:37.280]  down he is a former CIA government overthrow specialist and he is the real
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.760]  governor of Texas after the Civil War because we had puppet governors down
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.480]  here they set it up where the lieutenant governor that comes out of the
[03:47.480 --> 03:53.120]  Senate the head of the Senate has the governor's powers Perry has almost no
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.320]  power formerly was lieutenant governor but Dewhurst really has the governor's
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.320]  powers and he killed the bill and senator Patrick's on record calling him
[04:03.320 --> 04:08.520]  out saying Dewhurst wanted to keep it secret I went to a lot of their offices
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.600]  yesterday a lot of the different Senate offices and I could tell when I went in
[04:12.600 --> 04:18.160]  Dewhurst offices I mean it was it was Pentagon central I mean I looked at these
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.680]  guys when I walked in and it was we own this country it's ours and that's the
[04:23.680 --> 04:27.800]  end of it and Dewhurst has always been a monster I've seen him in person he's
[04:27.800 --> 04:33.000]  one of those people who looks like Ted Bundy acts like Ted Bundy he's the
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.120]  wealthiest member of Texas government and when you're around him he just
[04:39.120 --> 04:46.200]  radiates evil and he is an Obama operative and Dewhurst no matter how
[04:46.200 --> 04:50.440]  much money you got Texas is angry you it's in every major paper you're going
[04:50.440 --> 04:56.360]  down you will bomb us supporting anti-Texas black ops spook you will not
[04:56.360 --> 05:01.800]  bring down Texas like some third-world country boy when you're out on the road
[05:01.800 --> 05:08.800]  the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens

[06:11.040 --> 06:14.840]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[06:14.840 --> 06:18.480]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[06:18.480 --> 06:23.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[06:23.040 --> 06:27.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.080 --> 06:30.880]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:30.880 --> 06:34.480]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.480 --> 06:38.840]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[07:59.320 --> 08:04.800]  the Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[08:04.800 --> 08:12.720]  show because there's a war on for your mind it is Thursday the 26th day of May
[08:12.720 --> 08:21.560]  2011 my voice is a bit blown today but we are here live due to bullhorn level
[08:21.560 --> 08:25.680]  shouting without the aid of a bullhorn outside and inside the Texas State
[08:25.680 --> 08:31.560]  Capitol the front lines of the fight of the illegitimate globalist power grab
[08:31.560 --> 08:37.880]  via the federal government as they attempt to codify by practice and
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.160]  administrative law the sexual molestation of women small children and
[08:43.160 --> 08:49.440]  men first outside the pants now in the pants now in the underwear actually
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.960]  grabbing the genitals and I have witnessed with my own eyes it's been
[08:52.960 --> 08:57.920]  videotape countless times just eight months ago they were denying it in
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.200]  October November of last year now it's all admitted and it's out in the open
[09:02.200 --> 09:07.080]  what they're doing that they plan and are now executing the program to roll out
[09:07.080 --> 09:12.800]  on the streets of America seizing the entire infrastructure this is martial
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.360]  law in slow motion now going into higher gear they will never call it martial
[09:18.360 --> 09:22.800]  law it's called security and it is the end of the Fourth Amendment the end of
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.040]  the Republic if they succeed all of this is being done ahead of the economy
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.360]  completely collapsing and going into IMF World Bank receivership to the very
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.000]  private banks that operate through those consortiums who have maneuvered the
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.680]  country to this position and put their corporate and FBI and former
[09:43.680 --> 09:48.200]  intelligence officer people in place over almost every major state and city
[09:48.200 --> 09:53.440]  they control the narcotics traffic they control the white slavery traffic and
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.680]  it's all on record they are an absolute 100% pure mafia that controls our
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.160]  police and military but our average police officer our average military
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.720]  men and women are great people I've met them I know them I've seen them give
[10:08.720 --> 10:14.200]  more money than anybody else combined to Ron Paul in the last election both some
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.040]  of the major independent law enforcement lobbies but also the military and so
[10:18.040 --> 10:23.880]  that's really signifies there that they are beginning to wake up the problem is
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.200]  they are commanded by this mafia it's called tyranny when this happens and the
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.040]  Nuremberg defense the Nazis used if I was just following orders is not going to
[10:34.040 --> 10:37.360]  work so you've got a decision to make now I've got a million things running
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.440]  through my head so many incredible issues that need to be covered and I'm
[10:41.440 --> 10:48.960]  going to go over all of it the economy is just accelerating into freefall we're
[10:48.960 --> 10:54.160]  going to go over that new leak feared it's tricking Japan nuclear plant just
[10:54.160 --> 10:58.640]  meltdowns full-scale Pakistan trims US military mission is
[10:58.640 --> 11:04.480]  mistrust grows Rick Perry's rethinking his pledge not to run for president yeah
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.680]  Perry pledges to do something then you want to put your money on him breaking
[11:09.680 --> 11:15.520]  the pledge of course he's gonna run for president if he doesn't think they won't
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.920]  use blackmail against him he's got well I'm not gonna get into it continuing
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.000]  here we have more on the horrible tornadoes and our hearts and prayers go
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.520]  out to all those people I was reading a media report about a man caught on video
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.040]  with his wife and they're running with the baby and his wife fell down and the
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.960]  tornado was right behind him and he grabbed the baby and kept running and
[11:41.960 --> 11:47.400]  I've had talks with my wife about things like that you know what if we were in
[11:47.400 --> 11:52.160]  the water and you know the kids were about to go under and I had to save you
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.160]  or them what would you do she says we'll save them and it's the same way but just
[11:56.160 --> 12:01.240]  realize that our children come first it's instinctive it's basic any parent
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.120]  who's got their head even screwed on halfway straight would take a bullet for
[12:05.120 --> 12:13.080]  their children so how are we gonna let a bunch of miscreant unauthorized federal
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.960]  goons do it well again if they can get away with this they can do anything
[12:16.960 --> 12:22.960]  molesting our children so I'm gonna be going over that also it's in Wired
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.360]  magazine the Associated Press curtain demo did a big detailed report on it
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.000]  Oregon senator reveals secret government surveillance grid here's a Wired
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.200]  magazine there's a secret Patriot Act senator says and that senator Ron
[12:38.200 --> 12:44.720]  Whaden of Oregon folks none of this is secret you can read Patriot Act one and
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.560]  two it states it in clear English if you go follow the US code at least and if
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.960]  you read the telecommunications act as I've told you everything is fed over
[12:54.960 --> 13:01.800]  government snooping grids with keyword facts email voice radio that they've
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.880]  got listening devices all over the place trying to pick up all CB they've got AI
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.960]  computers for at least 30 years highly advanced now with incredible space to be
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.960]  able to basically filter everything and the main grid is there to make sure that
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.480]  local police don't bust CIA bringing drugs in or to make sure aircraft with
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.000]  little kidnapped American kids make it out of the country that's been in the
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.800]  Chicago Tribune even it's mainly for the criminals take to surveil the good
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.800]  guys which scousin thinks there's more people on the dark side and government
[13:36.800 --> 13:40.640]  than not most people are compartmentalized low-level I'd say 20% or
[13:40.640 --> 13:44.800]  dark side 80% just don't know which end is up and or just like the general
[13:44.800 --> 13:51.640]  public but I guess in positions of power yeah more than half are very corrupt
[13:51.640 --> 13:56.960]  and we've got an analysis of this but here it is and now now see it's all
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.720]  illegal and they're doing it to completely illegal and none of it has to
[14:02.720 --> 14:07.920]  do with al-qaeda unless it's trying to track other agencies if they're gonna
[14:07.920 --> 14:10.720]  launch an al-qaeda attack to make sure those agencies are ordered to stand down
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.560]  that's why FBI agents were in major newspapers if we're 9-11 saying it was
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.880]  as if al-qaeda had moles in the FBI above us well of course they had moles
[14:19.880 --> 14:25.640]  there the commanders of al-qaeda were above you at least the al-qaeda patsy's
[14:25.640 --> 14:32.040]  and that's why the FBI superiors and CIA superiors and special forces
[14:32.040 --> 14:35.920]  superiors in the army would come to the people and say you're not gonna do
[14:35.920 --> 14:38.760]  anything like that was in the news yesterday and they even the Associated
[14:38.760 --> 14:44.040]  Press military ordered and intelligence ordered to not track bin Laden in the
[14:44.040 --> 14:49.880]  month before 9-11 because they had Sybil Edmonds at the NSA FBI translator
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.840]  for NSA communicates with as you came and said al-qaeda is being run here are
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.480]  the tapes they're getting ready for something big they say they're talking
[14:57.480 --> 15:01.120]  to someone who's in some of it laden they're running white slaves weapons
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.320]  drugs there's about being attacked and they said we'll take those communicates
[15:06.320 --> 15:14.000]  shut your mouth now again this is all on record so it's time for folks to
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  grow up what is so hard to understand a scientific mafia a corporate mafia is
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.400]  in control of the federal government this same mafia is in control of almost
[15:25.400 --> 15:30.920]  every country in the world rogue countries like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela
[15:30.920 --> 15:37.560]  Ahmed on a denigad in Iran Muammar Gaddafi it doesn't mean they're good
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.040]  guys see people think in a one-dimensional way either the criminals
[15:42.040 --> 15:50.400]  that run us are good or they're bad or Gaddafi is good or he's bad no no Gaddafi
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.400]  are your normal government control freak people but nothing compared to the
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.320]  globalist with their scientific evil who they don't run yet their pieces left
[15:59.320 --> 16:02.760]  on the risk board or there are a few pieces left on the chess board and
[16:02.760 --> 16:07.120]  they're being wiped out and then the end then domestically your farms your
[16:07.120 --> 16:11.120]  ranches your local factories your jobs that's being wiped out in this
[16:11.120 --> 16:16.120]  corporate model of total domination anything they don't own and control is
[16:16.120 --> 16:22.760]  to be destroyed and to be taken over this is a giant monopoly game and and
[16:22.760 --> 16:28.640]  monopoly means there's only one group it means total domination full spectrum
[16:28.640 --> 16:35.360]  dominance and they get these guys up into their criminal orders their criminal
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.720]  organizations and they all become fat and wealthy off of us and then they
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.280]  commit so many crimes in the process both political parties or three political
[16:45.280 --> 16:50.200]  parties in England it's the same paradigm same in Europe they always set up
[16:50.200 --> 16:53.800]  hardcore secret police systems cracked down on free speech cracked down on
[16:53.800 --> 17:00.720]  demonstration try to intimidate the public because they better in Greece
[17:00.720 --> 17:06.920]  they're stealing the pension funds of paid-in doctors and thousands and
[17:06.920 --> 17:09.640]  thousands of doctors took the street and the police just went in and there and
[17:09.640 --> 17:15.600]  split their heads open boy when you start doing that to professionals these
[17:15.600 --> 17:21.600]  countries are gonna get overtaken by the people and it takes that tyranny for
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.720]  for folks to finally wake up once the professional class gets their teeth
[17:26.720 --> 17:32.160]  knocked out or their kids abused it's over it's on the real resistance starts
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.040]  and so they've had the fake terror they've been pushing and staging ahead
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.400]  of knowing real resistance will finally physically mount and then they're gonna
[17:40.400 --> 17:44.200]  say oh that's terrorism well if you believe that then George Washington was

[24:00.320 --> 24:16.480]  well there's a bunch of issues here before I get into all the other
[24:16.480 --> 24:21.120]  financial and geopolitical and Obama now quoted again saying he's got a stealth
[24:21.120 --> 24:27.720]  plan to get our guns I want to spend some time on this TSA situation because
[24:27.720 --> 24:32.160]  this affects not just the US with the entire planet not just Texas but every
[24:32.160 --> 24:38.720]  state in this Union it is now confirmed what we told you nine years ago because
[24:38.720 --> 24:43.240]  then it was public as well just not widely circulated that the TSA is the
[24:43.240 --> 24:48.600]  domestic national security force and you notice it's bipartisan Bush Obama
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.200]  across the board they want to make this a Republican Democrat issue so when
[24:52.200 --> 24:56.280]  Obama's in Democrats will support the TSA and then when Republicans are in
[24:56.280 --> 24:59.520]  they'll support it that's how they divide us in the left-right paradigm I
[24:59.520 --> 25:02.480]  don't care if you're a liberal conservative libertarian communist
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.000]  Easter Bunny whatever it is you shouldn't want this to be done to you and
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.880]  your family I mean the Soviet Union at its height didn't you know take Miss
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.080]  Soviet Union or whatever at a checkpoint stick their hands down her pants
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.400]  they would know one whatever not in communist China I talked folks that fly
[25:22.400 --> 25:26.800]  there all the time even touch your body if they're suspicious or think you're
[25:26.800 --> 25:29.960]  doing something they call you behind closed doors and interrogate you but
[25:29.960 --> 25:34.880]  but again political correctness they're not making a mistake hearing oh we
[25:34.880 --> 25:39.920]  don't want to target certain groups so everyone has hands down their pants it's
[25:39.920 --> 25:47.400]  designed that way so they flip it around and say all of you are guilty but but
[25:47.400 --> 25:55.800]  I'm digressing here's the points I want to get into a great job to the hundreds
[25:55.800 --> 25:59.680]  of people that showed up during the afternoon and throughout the evening
[25:59.680 --> 26:07.840]  when they closed the day session at past 11 o'clock at night folks were in the
[26:07.840 --> 26:16.680]  gallery and you said traders treason and New York's made sarcastic remarks to the
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.800]  media saying I guess they don't like all we've done for them and then laughed
[26:21.800 --> 26:26.880]  about Patrick and made some sarcastic comments about Senator Patrick who's
[26:26.880 --> 26:31.680]  now exposed do Hearst I want to talk about the state police I had a Dutch
[26:31.680 --> 26:35.480]  film crew with me and they couldn't believe citizens marching into a
[26:35.480 --> 26:43.200]  Capitol and screaming at the lobbyists screaming at the senators going to their
[26:43.200 --> 26:46.640]  offices and screaming at them well that's what freedom looks like if you
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.360]  don't have that you've got the opposite what this country's now turned into
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.400]  that's your birthright and if you don't like seeing people behave like that and
[26:56.400 --> 27:04.680]  do things like that and this quote civil society when you have an a outrageous
[27:04.680 --> 27:11.840]  federal power grab meant to break our will meant to set a precedent where they
[27:11.840 --> 27:17.480]  can do anything they want extreme tyranny calls for extreme actions and
[27:17.480 --> 27:21.240]  this was not extreme actions going down there and showing them that we're angry
[27:21.240 --> 27:30.080]  and getting in their face and then garnering literally hundreds of TV
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.760]  stations there were hundreds of TV stations there in the final days of the
[27:33.760 --> 27:38.280]  Texas legislature and at any one time I had 20 news cameras around me and then
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.200]  my job was done in an hour hour and 20 minutes I left and I said okay all you
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.640]  great patrons that came out you go be on the media now they were all over TV our
[27:46.640 --> 27:51.280]  listeners and all over newspapers and they stay there till past 11 o'clock at
[27:51.280 --> 27:58.000]  night just absolutely incredible to see the people there frankly a lot of them
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.960]  doing a better job than I did when I saw them on the news and there's no way to
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.440]  watch on the newscast there are hundreds of Texas newscast dozens of
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.920]  national newscast hundreds of newspapers another devastating blow against the
[28:10.920 --> 28:18.960]  globalist oh they unanimously passed it in the house 138 to zero they had 30 of
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.760]  31 senators almost unanimous and do hers killed it and we now know how do hers
[28:24.760 --> 28:31.600]  killed it and and we won this battle oh we didn't lose by them engaging in this
[28:31.600 --> 28:37.320]  treachery many Texas papers across the board both Democrat and Republican
[28:37.320 --> 28:43.120]  editorial boards are saying do herst is done do herst it's over you know why he
[28:43.120 --> 28:48.480]  didn't proudly get up and say I worked for the Justice Department and I and I
[28:48.480 --> 28:51.600]  want to be a US senator and I'm a toady and I've and I've worked with
[28:51.600 --> 28:55.520]  Obama's people he let senators know and they're on record saying don't let
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.000]  anybody know I can't have fingerprints on this we're gonna kill it and he worked
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.920]  the floor and made threats and made promises to kill it and knocked the 30
[29:04.920 --> 29:11.640]  31 votes down to almost zero with some of these cowards and the fact that his
[29:11.640 --> 29:18.800]  treachery has been shown and the fact that finally senator Patrick hit him
[29:18.800 --> 29:23.480]  with both barrels and said you are a disgrace you are a traitor I mean he's
[29:23.480 --> 29:28.040]  all over the news here you you did this behind the scenes I will not support you
[29:28.040 --> 29:32.680]  for us senator will not support you for governor and Patrick's as powerful as it
[29:32.680 --> 29:38.680]  gets in the Senate I mean Patrick finally your people are finally starting to
[29:38.680 --> 29:42.760]  become Americans again and say I don't care about being a political toady I'm
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.040]  taking you on they're finally becoming Texans we're gonna talk about this on
[29:47.040 --> 29:53.200]  the other side Liberty is contagious we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.200 --> 29:59.200]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.880 --> 30:05.680]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[30:05.680 --> 30:11.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[30:11.160 --> 30:14.680]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[30:14.680 --> 30:19.360]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[30:19.360 --> 30:24.520]  Sharks I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[30:24.520 --> 30:29.040]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[30:29.040 --> 30:33.720]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[30:37.760 --> 30:41.440]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[30:41.440 --> 30:46.520]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[33:49.680 --> 33:58.120]  just in a succession give you a report of exactly what happened yesterday here
[33:58.120 --> 34:08.520]  in Texas the TSA announced Tuesday evening and sent lobbyist on record to
[34:08.520 --> 34:15.520]  work behind the scenes with Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst behind
[34:15.520 --> 34:25.400]  the scenes to have him go threaten via the letter a federal blockade a federal

[34:58.920 --> 35:02.800]  you're allowed to fly or not and then you swipe a special biometric card and a
[35:02.800 --> 35:08.520]  retina scanned I noticed the lobbyist the politicians their handlers they all
[35:08.520 --> 35:11.480]  get to bypass security at the Texas Capitol that they just put in a few
[35:11.480 --> 35:16.000]  months ago and the same system is now going into the airport so this is how
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.120]  they heard us into accepting it so it's a total societal takeover and it's
[35:22.120 --> 35:26.280]  outrageous and so I was trying to call them live on air it was going right to
[35:26.280 --> 35:29.560]  voicemail even the general switchboard number and I said that's it I'm going
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.840]  down there at 12 30 we had an hour and a half left in the broadcast 12 30 central
[35:34.840 --> 35:40.920]  time and I got down there about 245 and there was about 80 people outside I went
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.880]  inside another 60 70 hundred I don't know had already gone in everybody was
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.040]  split up all over the Capitol and I came back out an hour and a half later
[35:48.040 --> 35:51.720]  there were a bunch of people I hadn't met or talked to everywhere more people
[35:51.720 --> 35:57.000]  arriving cars pulling up I'm told that it increased several hundred throughout
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.720]  the next few hours and people were just there all day right up until past 11
[36:02.720 --> 36:11.880]  30 at night when they close the session that day session absolutely booing just
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.120]  just just fulfilling because I don't like being on the defense I don't like
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.800]  seeing the tyranny grow the creeping evil watching people cower watching
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.640]  America lose its fighting spirit it was so good to see old people young people
[36:25.640 --> 36:33.080]  black people white people Hispanics Asians everybody you know just a true
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.480]  cross-section of Texans of Americans with liberty and the same light of
[36:38.480 --> 36:41.760]  freedom burning in their eyes to shake their hands people bringing their
[36:41.760 --> 36:50.200]  wonderful dear children to the event and we went in we sat there and rebuked the
[36:50.200 --> 36:56.160]  the metal detectors they put in and pointed out that soon there would be
[36:56.160 --> 37:00.600]  even more and then they would phase in groping and that was the plan we marched
[37:00.600 --> 37:07.240]  through and I just yelled in my drill sergeants loudest voice and I doubt
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.560]  that's one gift God gave me I doubt folks anybody could get louder than this I
[37:11.560 --> 37:21.840]  mean this was loud it was shaking the building I had sent as a probe hours
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.760]  before my show was over and left and I don't have before Rob Jacobson he was
[37:26.760 --> 37:34.880]  three floors up in the dome down a hall and he was actually in the chamber
[37:34.880 --> 37:39.720]  videotaping the senator's breaking law and I could play the little newscast
[37:39.720 --> 37:43.320]  where they admit it's illegal but they do it and they vote for each other when
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.840]  nobody's there they're just running down the line it was like 10 guys in there
[37:48.840 --> 37:52.360]  20 something gone they were just all sitting there hitting buttons just
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.560]  committing crime right in front of everybody well we've been doing it for
[37:56.560 --> 38:02.200]  decades so it's all right I mean it was incredible people won't believe that if
[38:02.200 --> 38:08.600]  you just type in Texas you know representatives vote for each other
[38:08.600 --> 38:11.120]  or something like that you'll you'll you'll you'll pull up the incredible
[38:11.120 --> 38:14.120]  newscast but we have footage of it we're gonna be putting that out we just got
[38:14.120 --> 38:19.400]  so much footage to go through and and before it's the real big story today the
[38:19.400 --> 38:23.000]  big breaking news dealing with this I'm just set the table in the background but
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.240]  people have a full spectrum view of what was going on it's important to look at
[38:26.240 --> 38:30.200]  things very in a complex way the media is always dumbing things down by design
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.200]  they've got white papers on that always dumbing the cartoons the culture the
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.400]  movies down to to dumb you down it's not you're dumb you want dumb things sure
[38:40.400 --> 38:43.000]  after you've been fed on poison for a long time you start thinking it's
[38:43.000 --> 38:50.240]  mother's milk but to make a long story short here
[38:53.400 --> 38:57.960]  folks all over America are commenting in the news articles and on YouTube and
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.360]  all these different news sites go and I've never seen people act like this
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.960]  marching in screaming in people's faces aggressively talking to their
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.040]  officials that way well there are servants and they've done something
[39:09.040 --> 39:16.680]  horrible a unanimous house did the right thing 138 to 0 and the Senate had 30 of
[39:16.680 --> 39:20.400]  31 votes and it was gonna pass Perry claimed he was gonna sign it but he
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.880]  uses minion do Hearst in there that's Perry's master of that kill things
[39:24.880 --> 39:28.840]  quietly then he claims he would have signed it it's just perpetual with Perry
[39:28.840 --> 39:33.160]  I live here folks I study him he's a Bilderberg attendee he's a snake but I
[39:33.160 --> 39:44.040]  digress talks all the right talk doesn't walk the walk so there was rage and
[39:44.040 --> 39:50.360]  even though I was screaming when they wouldn't let us in to the Senate gallery
[39:50.360 --> 39:56.560]  and and blocked us even though I was screaming at the top of my lungs traders
[39:56.560 --> 40:03.960]  criminals sellouts most of the state police were smiling and nodding saying
[40:03.960 --> 40:08.560]  hi Alex and when there wasn't a camera on saying we agree with you well of
[40:08.560 --> 40:11.920]  course they agree they don't want their wives and daughters and husbands having
[40:11.920 --> 40:14.960]  people stick their hands down their pants so even though I was like a wild
[40:14.960 --> 40:21.280]  rhinoceros bellowing and running around in there the police didn't see me as the
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.360]  enemy even though quite frankly I was seeing the lobbyist the entire
[40:25.360 --> 40:32.560]  government system as a giant affront in my rage they understood the anger and
[40:32.560 --> 40:37.240]  now that I can look back on the videos and in hindsight think about it and I
[40:37.240 --> 40:42.280]  think are the model the way the state police behaved of what peace officers
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.600]  and and public servants are supposed to act like and I've certainly seen bad
[40:47.600 --> 40:52.760]  behavior from the Texas state police as well before but checkpoints and things
[40:52.760 --> 40:59.960]  but this this was what America is all about and why this country is special
[40:59.960 --> 41:07.560]  now I am so upset about what's going on this country it's why I don't have a
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.480]  lot of rallies I don't have a lot of demonstrations because my anger is real
[41:11.480 --> 41:22.760]  ladies and gentlemen and it is massive and I get out there in these positions and
[41:22.760 --> 41:30.060]  it it it takes a toll on me on my voice on my diaphragm on my mind but at the
[41:30.060 --> 41:35.200]  same time this this this was fulfilling because even though they killed the
[41:35.200 --> 41:41.400]  bill now we're exposing the evil many times in a war you've got to do a
[41:41.400 --> 41:46.520]  probing action to see the response and call the enemy out and then to build our
[41:46.520 --> 41:50.520]  forces and to show the establishment we're coming with 20 plus other states
[41:50.520 --> 41:54.600]  moving to do what Texas attempted to do and they will not succeed in every case
[41:54.600 --> 41:58.800]  and there will be other states I would imagine Montana Wyoming Utah they're
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.080]  all moving where they will call the feds bluff let them run a blockade over
[42:03.080 --> 42:09.760]  business let them try to shut things down they will fold every time they're
[42:09.760 --> 42:14.560]  confronted they will fold there their position is untenable it's indefensible
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.920]  and so I just want to say to the state police and you know I don't sit here and
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.880]  kiss up to to quote authority because it's become a religion to do it but it
[42:24.880 --> 42:30.600]  was fulfilling and good and genuine and edifying to see the state police even in
[42:30.600 --> 42:35.240]  the face of a rampaging and that's how the media described it you know Texan
[42:35.240 --> 42:42.320]  stormed the capital you know Jones you know exploded I mean they've got a bunch
[42:42.320 --> 42:49.640]  of descriptions of it and it was good to see the police in the face of that
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.840]  behave themselves so that's their proper role and that's the right thing to keep
[42:54.840 --> 43:00.840]  the peace but to have the bosses there telling their servants those Senate
[43:00.840 --> 43:06.480]  members that we're aware of what they've done now adding to that I cannot
[43:06.480 --> 43:14.640]  describe how proud I am of the house doing the right thing in a world of
[43:14.640 --> 43:19.680]  universal deceit telling the truth the Revolutionary Act and unanimously saying
[43:19.680 --> 43:23.080]  it's already illegal to stick your hands down people's pants we're putting
[43:23.080 --> 43:28.280]  it on record with a new law on top of it that you're gonna go to jail on the
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.000]  outside of the genitals or the or inside the pants I mean that's just just
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.960]  seconding common sense and that they had 30 of the 31 votes it was killed in the
[43:37.960 --> 43:42.720]  Senate this reveals what's going on now we confirmed Kirk Watson the mafia don
[43:42.720 --> 43:46.240]  of Austin the senator from Austin the state senator was with the Democrats

[44:07.040 --> 44:14.520]  from Obama to threaten a blockade an act of economic siege and warfare let's
[44:14.520 --> 44:19.760]  call it what it is so the Civil War started folks was the north starting to
[44:19.760 --> 44:25.560]  block cotton coming out of ports this is an act of war under the Jiva
[44:25.560 --> 44:29.520]  convention you name it this is so outrageous just like sticking their hands
[44:29.520 --> 44:32.840]  down our pants is outrageous or spying on everybody without warrants it's all
[44:32.840 --> 44:38.200]  criminal it's all outrageous and we're just recognizing reality Dewhurst has
[44:38.200 --> 44:44.160]  been called out on this now and it's all over Texas papers and national papers
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.000]  I mean I've got the Dallas Morning News Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst favors

[51:04.240 --> 51:08.320]  key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the
[51:08.320 --> 51:12.120]  treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign
[51:12.120 --> 51:17.120]  central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds in order to
[51:17.120 --> 51:21.360]  rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[51:21.360 --> 51:25.720]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of
[51:25.720 --> 51:30.080]  US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.760]  at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon
[51:33.760 --> 51:37.480]  become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes

[54:09.320 --> 54:16.520]  Watson we did some research and found out he was involved but the main guy was
[54:16.520 --> 54:20.400]  Dewhurst and that's what these Republican leaders are all about always
[54:20.400 --> 54:24.520]  acting like their constitutionalist while they're the ones involved gutting

[54:40.640 --> 54:44.760]  the man who was instrumental in working with the federal government to sabotage
[54:44.760 --> 54:50.920]  a bill that would have made TSA grow up downs of felony the state of Texas was
[54:50.920 --> 54:54.560]  Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst a former CIA agent and establishment
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.800]  insider considered to be the wealthiest man in Texas politics as we have
[54:58.800 --> 55:03.520]  documented the anti pat down bill and was even called the anti-grope bill it's
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.960]  it's either the our state just told it like it was straight talk the anti pat
[55:08.960 --> 55:13.400]  down bill was derailed in the Texas Senate having unanimously passed the
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.400]  House a hundred thirty eight zero votes after the Department of Justice sent a
[55:17.400 --> 55:22.080]  letter threatening to impose a no-fly zone actually over Texas and shut down
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.880]  Texas airports the warning was nothing short of a federal blockade and an act
[55:26.880 --> 55:31.480]  of financial terrorism it's an act of war and international law but the federal
[55:31.480 --> 55:35.680]  assault was aided by a traitor from within the state
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.320]  Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst who only serves to amplify the threats made
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.600]  by the DOJ in communicating them to members of the Senate convincing them
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.120]  to cave in as a total bluff they were they were holding you know the junk
[55:50.120 --> 55:54.720]  hand they claim it was a royal flush call their bluff let them run a blockade
[55:54.720 --> 55:58.760]  come on you terrorist we know you're the ones carrying out the attacks anyways
[55:58.760 --> 56:07.880]  you scum continuing to members of the Senate convincing them to cave in and
[56:07.880 --> 56:11.920]  forcing the hand of Senator Dan Patrick to withdraw the bill before could be
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.560]  shot down permanently he came up with the elaborate political ploy to kill the
[56:16.560 --> 56:20.320]  bill without any fingerprints and Senator Patrick Republican Houston adding
[56:20.320 --> 56:23.400]  his fingerprints are all over it then he goes in as he witnessed him on the
[56:23.400 --> 56:30.600]  floor talked everybody he's the one with DOJ hacks withing which by the way
[56:30.600 --> 56:33.480]  they're not supposed to lobby on the floor the federal government that's a
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.240]  whole nother scandal oh I mean this guy's a black cop guy here to bring down
[56:37.240 --> 56:39.920]  America what do you expect you think they'll overthrow other countries to
[56:39.920 --> 56:45.600]  suck them dry won't do it here this guy is a voracious monster go get around in
[56:45.600 --> 56:51.080]  person just just Ted Bundy he just just got that evil power tripping psycho look
[56:51.080 --> 56:54.920]  and I'm sick of it I'm not your property you may think it's fun to grow up
[56:54.920 --> 57:01.280]  little kids punk but we're done with you okay someone who will undermine his
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.440]  members and someone who will not stand up the federal government you have to
[57:04.440 --> 57:09.280]  ask yourself what kind of person that we need in the US Senate Patrick said
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.120]  adding do Hearst sideswiped him on Tuesday night by turning members against
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.320]  the bill and then it goes on and we're about to go to break here but Patrick is
[57:18.320 --> 57:21.880]  now planning to insert an amendment within the bill that will mandate the
[57:21.880 --> 57:26.520]  federal government comply within six months however some will merely see
[57:26.520 --> 57:30.480]  this as an unnecessary watering down the legislation I hear he's thinking about
[57:30.480 --> 57:33.280]  running for governor Patrick said I heard thinking about running for state
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.440]  senator in the last 24 hours he's given me some things to think about given the
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.320]  fact that lieutenant governor do Hearst is undoubtedly an establishment insider
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.920]  it's unsurprising that he played the role of Judas in protecting the agenda the
[57:46.920 --> 57:50.800]  bomb administration over and above the will of his own legislators and the
[57:50.800 --> 57:54.920]  people of Texas and the Constitution in common sense I would add this is a guy
[57:54.920 --> 57:59.640]  who who wants men to be able to stick their hands down my daughter's pants I'm
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.560]  sorry do Hearst you're an enemy of the Republic he is one I'm not just saying
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.760]  that during his tenure in the CIA in the early 1970s do Hearst help the US
[58:08.760 --> 58:11.480]  government violently overthrowed democratically elected regimes in South
[58:11.480 --> 58:15.320]  America to plunder their oil and other resources including the coup that helped
[58:15.320 --> 58:22.440]  neo-nazi Bolivia in general Hugo Banzir come to power Banzir was aided by the
[58:22.440 --> 58:27.280]  notorious Nazi Klaus Barbie the butcher of Lyon who escaped France after the
[58:27.280 --> 58:30.920]  end of World War two to enter Bolivia work with CIA and I'm gonna come back

[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.040]  last night I was telling the foreign news crew that was here and I was telling
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.760]  the cops up at the Capitol I was saying you know at 9,000 locations are putting
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.840]  in telescreens saying watch your neighbors the cops will I come on Alex
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.240]  no they're not see people can't believe this stuff because it's so crazy I
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:31.800]  understand but not only do I have Dewhurst's background and his behavior
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.360]  and all his other backstabbing and land grabbing I've been around him repeatedly
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.600]  at the Capitol and you know these people that you meet you meet them you look at
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.400]  them and it's like man that is you know just a one creepy looking creepy acting
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:54.920]  person never run into people and I mean a book doesn't always match its cover
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.760]  the cover of a book doesn't always tell you what's going on inside of it I don't
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.920]  normally judge people off that but when you get the willies around somebody you
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.920]  better I got the willies around Janet Reno I've gotten willies around other
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:17.680]  globalist but I've gotten a really bad case of willies around Dewhurst and I'm
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.240]  just sick of these scumbags and all their treachery see this is why we got
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.920]  him secretly working with the Obama administration to kill this bill and the
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:32.840]  will of Texas and common sense in the law and not wanting people to know it's
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.960]  gonna haunt you forever Dewhurst I know you got the electronic voting machines
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:42.480]  going in almost everywhere so who knows but there's a good chance that he's in
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.000]  a crash and burn because if his poll numbers get low enough when he runs for
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.240]  US Senate they won't even fund him because they know it's too obvious they
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.440]  only like to steal close elections is what I've been able to break down now
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.840]  here's the other news I want to cover after I finish up with the whole Dewhurst
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.120]  situation and open the phones up specifically if you were at the
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.800]  storming of the Texas Capitol media called it storming it I know we went
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.120]  in there and went to the stupid checkpoint that wasn't there six months
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.520]  ago and then we got in their face and preached at these people and and I'd
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.400]  walk in and like at first the lobbyists are lining the halls they'd be laughing
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.320]  at me and giggling and they're all these metrosexual looking men and I'm not
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.560]  judging them on their sexuality I'm saying they're all coft and oiled and
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.400]  you know they've got the pedicures or whatever and they're just all have that
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.840]  same giggling snickering demonic frat boy behavior and and I would just say
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.880]  listen cockroach it didn't funny my kids getting groped by the government it
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.320]  didn't funny having a federal good force rolling out on the highways of
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.680]  America it didn't funny the 27 trillion stolen don't you laugh at me you
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:03.120]  understand I'm done I mean even Jesus Christ who was a meek and mild person
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.440]  got angry with the money changers and went in there and overturned the tables
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.200]  and beat him upside the head with a whip now I didn't do that I'm not calling for
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.480]  that but the point is when you get around these scum and they're giggling
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.560]  their snickering believe me they weren't laughing after I was done and only one
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.920]  state police guy a sergeant ran up and started trying to give me an eye and I
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:27.080]  said do whatever you want I'm not gonna continue to live in fear with all this
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.840]  crud okay I'm gonna I'm gonna rebuke this scum one way or the other now get out
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.920]  of my face later he was false around smiling and we shook hands and stuff but
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.400]  the point is is that we have to teach them that we're not their slaves okay
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.680]  now if you want to be an American this is what it's all about you want to be a
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.000]  free person so it's all about you want to be red-blooded it's what it's all
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.040]  about okay if this is alien to you the lay I act the way I behave it's because

[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.720]  the federal government threatening a no-fly zone federal blockade of all
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.520]  air traffic in and out of Texas if the state of Texas dared challenge the
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:36.880]  domestic security force of the TSA now groping at high school proms rolling out
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:43.000]  at checkpoints on highways federalizing local police this is a key fight and the
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.440]  lieutenant governor of Texas after reconstruction Texas changed the law
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.800]  where the lieutenant governor the leader of the Senate is really the
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.800]  governor he has more powers than the governor and breaking this down he
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.720]  controls the committees he's the exo facto member of several statutory
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.240]  bodies including the legislative budget board legislative counsel and Dewhurst
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.560]  is caught red-handed multiple state senators on record not wanting it to be
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:14.320]  public saying that he supported the anti-TSA groping bill but behind the
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.960]  scenes with the Department of Justice lobbyists threatening and killing it
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:25.160]  it passed unanimously 138 in the house they had 30 of 31 votes in the Senate and
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.280]  Dewhurst killed it and then came out and said he supported it this is a
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.240]  operative now I went over some of his history we were getting to the Dewhurst is
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.120]  the creature of the federal government having worked as a CIA agent also served
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.320]  in the US Department of State he was also the director of the state task force
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.720]  on Homeland Security that's the federalization of the state during his
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.440]  tenure in the CIA in the early 1970s Dewhurst helped the US government
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.840]  violently overthrow democratic elected regimes in South America to plunder
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.640]  their oil and other resources including the coup that helped neo-nazi, Bolivian
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:10.080]  general Hugo Banazir, Suraz, pronouncing that right, come to power.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.120]  Benazir was aided by the notorious Nazi class Barbie who they declassified was
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.920]  working for the CIA, the butcher of Lyon who escaped France after the end of
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.400]  World War two to enter Bolivia. Barbie an expert in cruel and inhumane forms of
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.000]  torture but the purpose of interrogation was a key CIA liaison throughout the
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.800]  years Dewhurst served in South America when the Austin Chronicle asked Dewhurst
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.440]  whether he had enjoyed a drink with the butcher of Lyon at the US Embassy bar he
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.760]  responded I never comment on intelligence matters so in Dewhurst we
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.160]  basically have a man who helped neo-nazis as well as Nazi torture experts
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.280]  overthrow legitimate governments in the 70s now helping the Obama
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.600]  administration overthrow America in 2011 by protecting an army of TSA thugs
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.400]  who are being used to completely demolish constitutional rights following
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.600]  the recent raid on a some of bin Laden's alleged compound Dewhurst hinted that he
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:09.120]  still much very much he still moved very much within spook circles when he
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.640]  stated I can't go into details but the capabilities the United States has
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.080]  developed over the years is nothing short of breathtaking little is known
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.480]  about Dewhurst his life story is an impenetrable fog of obfuscation
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.280]  punctuated with tantalizing facts reports the Texas Observer the secrecy has
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.000]  extended from his military record to his sources of wealth and to his current
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.440]  financial conflicts he has repeatedly gotten into trouble the Texas Ethics
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.880]  Commission for overly vague filing financial filings state elected
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.360]  officials are required to either disclose their finances or put all their
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.680]  assets in a blind trust until 2008 Dewhurst declined to do either putting
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.000]  his money in a non-blind trust and declining to release information about
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.480]  it during his campaign for a Senate governor in 2001 Dewhurst ran an ad
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.520]  featuring a German Luftwaffe officer standing in front of American flag
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.560]  somewhat appropriate given the fact that Dewhurst obviously believes Americans
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:10.720]  should be forced to show their papers at checkpoints manned by TSA goons who are
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.240]  popping up all over the country just like in Nazi Germany where people were
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.360]  also forced to under checkpoints and strip searches so there you have it
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:29.120]  headlines XCI Spook Dewhurst sabotages anti we need to call Watson occurred I
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.720]  think we should change the headline XCI Spook Dewhurst sabotaged anti groping
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:39.520]  bill for Obama administration it says anti TSA and the headline on Info Wars
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:46.320]  is Republican Lieutenant Governor killed TSA bill for Obama so there you have it
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.480]  this secretive lifelong black operator running the state of Texas as the
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:13:02.120]  Lieutenant Governor with his Nancy boy Rick Perry and I've had enough I've had
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.960]  enough of it now continuing here speaking or at Perry remember Rick Perry
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:10.000]  just last week putting on his well I guess he is actually from West Texas he
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.920]  didn't put on a fake accent like Bush did but going well you know I tell you
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.320]  I'm not gonna run for president Texas got too much needs to be done and these
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.400]  rumors about me doing they're just unfounded I pledge that's not gonna
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:30.640]  happen well he's got the Fed up presidential book he was being booed
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.240]  everywhere two and a half years ago by the real tea party so suddenly he said
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.080]  I hunt coyotes in Austin when I'm jogging I I think we ought us to see but
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.600]  I'm just joking I I'm against the new world order Rick Perry has repeatedly
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.240]  said he won't run for president 2012 but there are signs he might not stick to
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.320]  that pledge in a press conference the Texas governor notably declined to rule
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.160]  out a White House bid flip flopping from last week amid calls from Rush Limbaugh
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.680]  and others that he should enter the 2012 race meanwhile his top strategist
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.200]  acknowledged to Texas Tribune that Perry is indeed thinking about a bid for
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.880]  the GOP nomination though he insists his boss is far from actually entering the
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.040]  race the development comes on the heels of report last week that suggested
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.480]  Perry who got into business with Carl row that was his first Carl Rose first
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.360]  client was actually Perry is waiting to be summoned in the 2012 presidential
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.520]  race but it's unclear how much momentum the Texas governor actually has in the
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.720]  GOP primary as the ticket noted yesterday there's been an uptick in those
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.280]  floating Perry for the GOP nod in the wake of Mitch Daniel's decision to
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.040]  bypass the race and it goes on they got another puppet they probably end up
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.200]  running together that was the intel I was given a year ago paling near top of
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.640]  reshaped GOP field and she's getting ready to announce then they'll run
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.280]  against each other in a staged event like Hillary and Obama this is in the
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.400]  cards and then she'll be vice president he'll be president and it's a done deal
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:01.680]  that they're gonna win the woman and the pretty boy and it's all over here's
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.960]  another one is Sarah Palin preparing a presidential run so that's just some of
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:13.160]  the news that we've got on that front but I just want to say it again
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:21.360]  incredible job to everybody the TSA is in deep trouble their rollout nationwide
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.880]  even though a federal judge ordered them into the high schools to commence
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.840]  groping as part of our rights we're he said we have a right to be properly
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.080]  grubbed this is a total conversion where all public places are gonna have body
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.600]  scanners metal detectors bare minimum checkpoints and we've got to fight this
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.520]  and the same things being put in in Europe this is the surveillance grid the
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.520]  illegal wiretapping all of it and notice now they're going yeah all your
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:48.600]  cell phones are listening to you yeah your cell phones are tracking under
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.880]  federal regulations yeah we are listening to you yeah there are secret
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.720]  police yeah we are doing this meanwhile they try to use national security to hide
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.560]  how many trillions have been stolen by foreign banks there's more news on that
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:08.200]  front today but let me get into this first now again the media is acting like
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.760]  this is a secret and now because the senator is being honest that it's that
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.640]  some new revelation they're just getting ready to use this more publicly in court
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.640]  with illegally obtained information or frame ups so now they've got to admit
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.880]  they're doing it that's all that's happening it's in place they've been
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.600]  tracking now they know that the depression is about to fully go into
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.840]  effect and so they're letting everybody know here's wired magazine there's a
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.080]  secret Patriot Act senator says you'd think you understand on the Patriot Act
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.520]  allows the government to spy on its citizens senator Ron waden says it's
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.840]  worse than you know Congress is set to reauthorize three controversial
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:52.760]  provisions of the surveillance law as early as Thursday Wayne waden
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.200]  Democrat of Oregon says the powers they grant the government on their face the
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.520]  government applies to a far broader legal interpretation interpretation the
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.960]  government has conveniently classified so it cannot be publicly assessed or
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:12.600]  challenged but one prominent Patriot Act watcher asserts that the secret
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.120]  interpretation empowers the government to deploy quote dragnets for massive
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.680]  amounts of information on private citizens the government portrays the
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.080]  data collectors and efforts much differently and here's Kurt Nemo's
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.440]  article breaking it down Oregon senator reveal secret government surveillance
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.480]  grid let me explain something again
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:41.680]  Telecommunications Act 96 gave him five years under law but it violates all the
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.880]  other laws so it's null and void to have the spy chips the kill switches the
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.320]  tracker chips in all the new major electronics communication systems
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.640]  computer cell phone smartphones all of it I told you then I said it I said the
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:03.640]  phone companies aren't tapped whole floors our NSA and then a decade later
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:09.600]  it came out oh yeah whole floors of AT&T other telecommunications they call them
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.800]  secret rooms and secret floors it's all wired in and people came out and blew
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.640]  the whistle about that and so now they're trying to reauthorize the Patriot Act
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.800]  yet again and expand even more things into it and none of this has anything to
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:33.800]  do with protecting us from terrorist it turns out the NSA picked up all the 911
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.680]  shatter on record and when they're people listening to the transmissions and reading
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.280]  the transcripts because that's mainly what it is they don't even listen to
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.600]  tapes as transcripts of it like Sybil Evans and others heard the plans to
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:52.160]  attack it they were under the command quote of the CIA and she said they were
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.280]  running white slaves that's what many other experts have come out and said
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:03.080]  drugs money laundering terrorist well of course these guys are but because
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.640]  they're clean-cut and wearing well-tailored suits and talk with
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.920]  Texas accents a lot of them or New York accents you know the accent of your
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.160]  area and because people have the image of Mafia only being Colombians or
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.840]  Italians the Italians got the Italians were blackmailing Jagger Hoover that's
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:27.080]  now been confirmed it was known for decades but now confirmed with some of
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.160]  the things he was into and that's why he's on it can testify to Congress
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.760]  there's no such thing as organized crime it's a conspiracy theory now 60 years
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.840]  later that's asinine I mean you laugh at that there's no such thing as organized
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.240]  crime and finally they went ahead and cracked down on the Italians they said
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:48.000]  you're gonna you're gonna blackmail us we'll go ahead and run stings against you
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.080]  but but but the larger mafia there's a lost mafia there's a Dixie mafia there's
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.560]  the Jewish mafia there's Irish mafia German mafia is big in Texas I mean
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.360]  they're the real mafia's it is well known that protein nutrition is a key to
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.200]  optimum blood sugar levels but to benefit at all from protein your body
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.720]  must first be able to break down protein into amino acids once amino acids are
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.520]  liberated from proteins your body uses them to make brain chemicals that make
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.720]  you feel alert and peaceful at the same time your pancreas uses them to regulate
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:23.640]  blood sugar and insulin people are waking up and doing an about face when it
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.640]  comes to nutrition they're learning that a high carbohydrate diet may encourage
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:32.120]  obesity and diabetes they are now emphasizing proteins more to compensate
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:36.880]  one protein source that is more easily broken down into amino acids is non

[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:17.320]  nature of power structures throughout time there are always corrupt

[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:27.200]  come in with excuses to enslave you because that's their nature and things

[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.960]  joining me for just 10 minutes in the next segment to break down some very
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.760]  important news but then I'm going to open the phones up until the end of the hour
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.800]  then Bob Barr is only with us former congressman for 20 minutes and I'll
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.400]  have open phones throughout the rest of that hour but the first round of calls
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.120]  I take I want to specifically only be and we'll open up for everybody else
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:20.600]  towards the end of the show I wanted to only specifically be folks that were
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.880]  down there at the Texas State Capitol yesterday to give us your view on what
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.560]  happened I just want to say I'm proud of you I appreciate you you did an
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:37.560]  incredible job and you were boisterous you were focused you were intense the
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:42.600]  newspapers have confirmed that they had to even stop some of the voting and
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.480]  actions in the Senate because of our shouting even though they blocked us
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.400]  from entering the chamber the gallery above the chamber that it completely
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.760]  took over the event and now lieutenant governor in Texas that's the real
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.760]  governor the governor's the lieutenant governor it's backwards he's called a
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.480]  governor but he's the lieutenant governor Perry's the lieutenant governor
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.680]  Dewhurst is the real governor and again that's a post-civil war thing to keep
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:12.440]  federal puppets out they've turned it around and now me the lieutenant governor
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.320]  of federal puppet that's how tyranny works his political star is falling like
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:28.240]  a bat out of Hades towards the ground right now and that's good because we're
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.320]  gonna win this fight it's it's not gonna happen overnight it's not gonna happen
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:39.960]  a single day but just like the airline pilots last year just said we're just
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.960]  gonna stop flying we're just you're not gonna stick your hand on our pants the
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:49.000]  feds had to back off and now Napolitano is partially beginning to back off but
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.200]  into another control grid okay we'll have trusted traveler you'll enroll with us
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.960]  we'll decide if you're allowed to fly and then you just have a card and then we
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.000]  face scan you to decide if you can get on the plane and then of course they're
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.920]  going to keep the Gropers there and they're expanding the Gropers to the
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.680]  streets so it's a false way out but the point is they're accelerating that
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.560]  trusted traveler national ID card program right now because they understand
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:19.200]  this is an issue that makes liberals conservatives constitutionalist libertarians
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:26.680]  socialist folks across the political spectrum angry and it's a unifying
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.440]  event they meant it to be our waterloo where they broke our will conditioned us
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.520]  to submit to them and that's why I've spent so much time on this whole TSA
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.000]  issue remember people middle of last year before drudge started picking up our
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.560]  articles every week before it became a huge national point I said look they're
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.720]  groping people they're getting ready to roll out on the streets here's the
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.840]  documents and then as it began to come out it became a national issue for over
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.880]  a month the number one issue in the country it wasn't Lindsay low hand it
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:02.600]  wasn't some political distraction it was the federal power grab and now the
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.680]  drudge report with the New York Times admitted last week is the biggest news
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.640]  site in the world does set the news agenda hard for the New York Times and
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:19.000]  others to have to admit that drudge say what you want about him and his
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.840]  affiliation with the Republican Party in the past that drudge clearly doesn't
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.280]  like being grew up by the TSA and cares about freedom and as a human being at
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.560]  his base he's always been anti-abortion got fired from Fox because he wouldn't
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.080]  shut up about killing babies and that's the litmus test right there if you
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.640]  rationalize killing the unborn and if you rationalize partial birth abortion
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.560]  there's something fundamentally wrong with you if you fundamentally are
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.560]  outraged by abortion and it makes you sick I mean how could people be
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.200]  freaking out about these little toddlers and babies getting killed by these
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.280]  tornadoes once you have kids it just gets so much more intense when you hear
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.760]  about children being killed or hurt how can you how can all these pro-abortion
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.360]  people get upset about one two-year-olds getting killed by tornadoes but dehumanize
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:15.200]  those babies inside their mamas and say that that's not a human and then go
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:21.080]  along with them being chopped up you know more than 20,000 babies a year get
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.480]  killed in this country that could be adopted they're a hundred percent
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.040]  viable they can be delivered but they don't even tell the mothers that they
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.960]  don't tell them there's charities that'll pay them between 50 and a hundred
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.480]  thousand dollars to have the baby and to adopt it instead they have the CPS
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.920]  hunting people who don't want to give their kids up to sell them for hundreds
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.120]  of thousands there's no need for any of this and drudge is anti-abortion you
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.160]  always has been that's why but we just appreciate him standing against the TSA
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:59.480]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:58.280]  I've got some very important news and information here London Telegraph US food
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:03.840]  prices rise steepest in decades here's another one 20 signs of horrific global
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.600]  food crisis is coming economic collapse want to go over these hedge farm hedge
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.880]  funds buying up farms as doomsday food price scenario New York observer there
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.480]  was one guy four or five years ago telling me all this was going to happen
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:23.400]  and the reason I started getting Steve Shank on for these reports is because I
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.120]  bought storeable foods from three other companies they had MSG crud in them made
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.840]  in China old so I searched around and I found out well the J. Michael Stevens
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.960]  group that's the a lot of people make claims that aren't true they are the
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.280]  oldest they are the biggest they have the widest spectrum everything they have
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.600]  is clean food non-gmo non-hybrid right here in America except for the bananas
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.640]  they won't really grow here and but that's not why he's on this today to
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.320]  pitch their storeable food to the foods direct.com I've asked him to start
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.440]  coming on every few weeks or so to give us a report because he has big giant
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.920]  factories I mean I mean he's the guy most the places people buy food from it
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.040]  came from him and he's now tripled production on top of that and he's
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:09.440]  buying food out a year before not meaning the foods a year old he the
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.400]  contracts are a year out for when he's gonna buy it to lock in prices when he
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.600]  buys it fresh and he's seeing it just skyrocket so I wanted to get him on to
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.440]  break down this area of commodities we look at gold we look at silver we look
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.760]  at oil we look at everything else we also want to look at food Steve thank
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:29.800]  you for joining us today. Alex it's just a pleasure as usual and all I got to say
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:36.800]  is go Texas my gosh I was just excited about what you did there with this TSA
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:43.360]  debacle I don't know I would love to see a bunch of other states declare
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.720]  their sovereignty and go after this this is a this is a big Achilles hill for
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.040]  this for the administration. What do you think of David Dewhurst the
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:56.520]  supposed Republican Lieutenant Governor we now learn secretly this is all over
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.160]  Texas news taking Obama orders to gut the bill and then saying he supported it
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:08.280]  publicly this guy is just absolute scum. Well all I can say is he's a politician
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.200]  one of they lying when their lips are moving you know that type of thing it's
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:19.120]  just you know I I look at what's being done particularly you know you know I
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.400]  I focus in on everything connected with food I look at what's going on with the
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:32.160]  the fiasco of cutting farmers out with no bank loans shutting farmers down all
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.800]  all across the country we're getting word in now on a regular basis of farmers
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.840]  that are working with us to a certain extent but they're just saying hey we
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.320]  can't even afford to plant the crops this year because we don't make enough to
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:49.200]  pay for the fuel at fuel prices the way they're they're they're being blown up
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.520]  and that means food prices are going to actually for the first time in 10 years
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.760]  food prices are going to inflate faster than the fuel prices and make it
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.480]  impossible for millions of more families not to be able to afford food it's just
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:08.640]  insane. Well how did you know I mean literally four or five years ago those
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.200]  recordings are out there you wrote articles about it you said it was
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:16.380]  coming I guess you knew because you're you're buying a year a year and a half
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:21.960]  out. Yeah absolutely and the and the thing is is that if you have your pulse
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:27.720]  on what's going on with food you have to understand that we receive articles
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.920]  from from several different sources constantly fed into us as to what's
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.960]  going on but we're in touch a lot of farmers are aware of what we do in terms
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.120]  of distributing getting as many families prospered and fed in this
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.640]  country as we possibly can and we get feedback from what's happening with them.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:53.280]  We heard before it was announced on the news that they were cutting the
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:59.680]  irrigation water to the California farmers because they couldn't prove that
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.200]  they had irrigation they cut the irrigation water because of environmental
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.800]  reasons and then the banks concluded that they weren't going to loan the
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:14.040]  farmers any any money to plant unless they could prove that they had water and
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:17.640]  what they're doing is taking that that that prime development zone and they
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.360]  did it in southern Oregon and northern California and other areas in the in the
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.800]  name of a fish that is not even indigenous to that particular reservoir
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.400]  that mountain reservoir now now now expanding on that I remember thinking
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:35.200]  back four and a half years ago the reason you knew many years in advance of
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.520]  the food price increase you broke it down was food commodity prices were
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.280]  already going up but the major manufacturers were just adulterating
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:50.760]  or adding fillers and manipulating to try to keep things at a lower price even
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.960]  though they'd gone up but now they've shrunk the size of the packages they've
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.920]  adulterated now that won't even work I'm sure you've noticed folks everything's
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:04.160]  gotten smaller I mean look on the back of a cereal box instead of you know 24
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.400]  ounces now it's 20 all of this is happening and but but now even with
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.400]  that they're unable to hide the type of inflation Steve described to folks who
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.240]  really don't know how big your factory is just so they get an idea or factories
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:24.320]  and how many food packages you make and and what you're doing so they get an
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.960]  idea of how deep and how long you've been in this business close to four
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.360]  decades and so you can then break down for them what the real inflation is
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:42.160]  you're seeing at the master manufacturer level well very very simply Alex what we
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.720]  have to do is that you mentioned that we're we're buying raws raw materials
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.960]  out or contracting for them out a year ahead we want to get out a little bit
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.720]  further than that and the reason we do that is because we need to keep our
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.680]  our processing facility where we where we combined the recipes on these new
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.160]  new diversa foods and and get them packaged and pouched we need to keep
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.600]  that running full bore we are having a great deal of difficulty we've put in
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.680]  about four new lines that are each capable of millions of pouches per month
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.960]  just so that we can keep up with the demand that folks are laying on us
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.440]  because they're they're believing and understanding they're looking around and
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:30.960]  saying hey what's going on we we have to keep that facility running at full
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:37.840]  the full speed ahead so that in between the times when people when people surge
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:43.120]  in there and they're buying of foods we can build up an inventory so that we
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:50.160]  can keep our our shipping where it needs to be this last punch after the
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:56.280]  Japanese earthquake every food storage company now we don't classify ourselves
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:02.760]  as that but every food storage company was eight to ten weeks behind and we
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:08.320]  let our people know that we we had processed ahead enough so that we were
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.720]  able to ship within the four-week time frame that that we had even on massive
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:17.320]  orders so that's what we have to do but you know right now we've got a perfect
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:22.800]  storm Alex in terms of of what's going on in our country we are having one major
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.960]  news where worthy disaster right after another to the point where people are
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.680]  almost getting to the point where they're desensitized and it's a real
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.560]  distraction from what really needs to go on you know we look at what's going on
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.640]  with the with the tornadoes and and all of the all of the disasters and you
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.800]  notice that we're not coming out telling people oh you got to get prepared for
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:48.720]  disasters and doing all this ambulance chasing here's the point you and I have
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.080]  been talking for years telling people that if they will just take care of the
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:58.400]  one thing they have control of you see people are scared right now because of
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.160]  all the disasters that are going on and the economic crash and the dollar going
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.200]  down the toilet and Washington make just at making absolutely horrendous
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:11.640]  decisions with regard to our lives but the fact is that they have no control
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.560]  over those things the families don't know whether an earthquake is going to
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.960]  hit them whether the government's going to do something weird or whether we're
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:24.920]  going to have a situation occur that they can do nothing about and they
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:30.320]  they're concerned about panic the message is don't panic don't worry just
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:35.680]  do what Alex has been telling you for all these years and if you take care of
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.960]  the way you have no control over all that stuff you're a victim of
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.760]  circumstance if you happen to be sitting in the wrong place and nobody knows
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.040]  whether they're going to be sitting the wrong place tomorrow very simply if you
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:52.400]  will take care of the one thing you have control over you have control over
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:59.920]  your greatest dependency food and if you want to be fearless what you do is you
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.880]  eliminate a dependency that threatened and you take control of that which you
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.400]  have power over and by the way by the way all of these events all of these
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.200]  events that are going on that make it appear that that people don't have any
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:18.320]  control over their destiny very simply they do if you get a supply of food in
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.920]  then you have taken care of all of the events that could occur or the things
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.840]  that you can't predict and you're safe and you're fearless from all that stuff
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.680]  well it's an interesting concept isn't it Alex now it is I mean here's the
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.320]  bottom line the feds do everything they can to shut down family farms ranches
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:40.040]  their admission is they want us dependent they they don't want third
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:45.040]  world countries being independent the globalist are mafia dons there they
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:51.360]  have a sharecropper owner mentality and you notice in the internal government
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.000]  documents and executive orders for decades they demonize hoarders people
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.800]  that store food people that have firearms people that have water filters
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:02.800]  people that live in rural areas and and want to be off the grid there's a lot
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:07.360]  of demonization of that because you're strong you're independent when they try
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:11.720]  major power grabs they know you're gonna be the people that folks then respect
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:16.560]  and look to but suddenly the last five years they've had this you know government
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.600]  program you'll get ready and oh have one week of food and water that way when
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:24.720]  everything totally implodes they could say well we told you have a week of food
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.960]  and water and meanwhile government is hoarding and preparing I hope we never
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.360]  have to use this stuff but it's insurance you can eat the bottom line is folks you
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.880]  need to be as self-sufficient as you can be whether it's tornadoes Katrina
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:45.280]  depression wars all this stuff that's going on you can see the acceleration of
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.960]  this and the last thing they want is for you to be self-sufficient they're
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.880]  scared to death of it now Steve we're almost out of time here I know that you
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.360]  are running a special and thanks for giving us that news on on where food
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.400]  prices going briefly what is the inflation you've seen the last four
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.400]  years you know dead reckoning number and then tell us about the buy three get
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.440]  the fourth free special that you're running right now well the inflation
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:14.800]  that we've seen for the last little bit your your your listeners know about that
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:19.560]  but what's gonna happen is that we are we're presently just just to give you
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:24.320]  some real value we've got over 50 million families that are on food stamps
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.920]  that means that they can't afford to buy food a vast majority those people are
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:34.240]  still employed that means that millions and millions of Americans every every
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.800]  month are falling behind the ability to even afford food gas prices are
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.520]  considered continuing to shove the prices of food up and as we have these
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:48.360]  disasters are shut down farmland we're not going to have production and we've
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.520]  also got commodities buyers as you just mentioned on some of those news articles
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:59.480]  that you referred to that commodities buyers are buying up food and farms
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:03.120]  that's the big investment and they're putting a lot of the corn and things in
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:10.440]  the ethanol now here's the thing eFoods Direct has not had a price increase in
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.720]  the last since last October so very simply the families that are putting
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.360]  food in right now as we as we speak are freezing their prices of food at last
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.280]  year's prices the other thing that they're doing we talked about availability
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.520]  it's disappeared and that's that's why we're telling people to do exactly what
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:34.600]  we're doing to supply them we're buying out ahead if these families will have
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.240]  the common sense to freeze the availability of their food by putting
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:44.080]  it in their possession they will they will completely solve the issues in the
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:49.320]  problems of all these other disasters the very simple fact is that what we've

[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.480]  yesterday and i was so heartened by the warm reception that we got from
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.080]  everybody at the capital yeah nobody likes having hands stuck
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.920]  on their pants but black ops commander david dohurst
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.400]  nobody seemed perturbed by us being there and being so loud and
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.280]  it was wonderful it was it was very heart heartening and i do commend all
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:52.000]  the officers that were there that's the way we like it and you know
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.200]  i'm sorry go ahead i noticed that channel 24's
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:59.440]  coverage this afternoon only showed two protesters being removed from the senate
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.280]  chambers didn't show anything about all the people that were there
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.040]  yeah there was about i don't know 100 inside then we we'd all split off and
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:09.520]  mill around to different offices in the media
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.080]  we would like to shoot a shot of myself standing towards the crowd but
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.120]  show no one behind me instead of showing the crowd in front of me
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.280]  so they did do little tricks they also took video stills in all the major
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.360]  papers of uh of the most unflattering uh you know shots of
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:28.880]  myself screaming but overall it was still pretty positive
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:31.440]  talking to the crew here that watched the local news
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.560]  and watching some of the local news pieces myself i've got some i'll play
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.080]  later um and and unanimous the house voted
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.640]  unanimously uh to say no i know why the police have riots
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:45.760]  sometimes the police get into a mob psychology
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:49.840]  even good cops sometimes get a little wild uh when they're dealing with riot
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.280]  control we started you know
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:56.640]  getting a little wild and somebody's like there they are as we start screaming
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:58.880]  and it's the house that we're screaming at traitor
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:02.800]  traitor traitor but you know we're on the floor we're
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:07.200]  we're on the the arena floor and so obviously we're going to charge around
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.600]  like wild hyenas and and rhinoceros and and and and and and
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.680]  but then we regrouped and then went after the senate the point is the message
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:19.120]  has been served and great job uh to the house
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.240]  uh it was great uh meeting you nancy anything else

[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:14.480]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:17.440]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:21.280]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:28.800]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:28.560]  well for this little short segment in the next former congressman bob bar
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.720]  author researcher libertarian presidential candidate
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:37.040]  bob bar dot org liberty guard dot org he's been on the front lines exposing
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:40.160]  the expansion of the war on terror the attack on our liberties
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:45.200]  and the tsa and all the horrible activities they're engaged in
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:49.840]  now congressman i'm even seeing mainstream media say this is a federal
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.360]  unsworn police force doing things fbi can't even do
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.120]  they have no statutory authority to stick the hands on on the outside and
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:01.520]  touch the generals are inside as you know now a federal judge has said it's
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:05.600]  that you have a right to have tsa they upside down put their hands down your
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.640]  pants uh at the um at the school proms in in in santa fe
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:13.680]  they're announcing a rollout on the highway streets roads
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.920]  the infrastructure is being seized uh what's your overall view of where this
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.920]  is going it's outrageous and if americans don't
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:25.920]  do what uh where you and many of your listeners have been doing by setting the
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.200]  example and that is to uh stand up and say not just nobody he'll know
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.000]  then uh you know the the limitations on government and the protections for our
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.760]  privacy and our persons that are embodied in the fourth amendment will be
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.040]  essentially meaningless uh it's just absolutely outrageous uh not only
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:48.800]  what government and tsa in particular are doing
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.520]  but what is most distressing is the number of americans that sit back like
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:57.520]  damn sheep and accept this nonsense well said
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.600]  my friend no you're absolutely right well it's time to get angry uh the the
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:07.120]  texas legislator voted in the house 138 to 0 unanimous
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:11.440]  to enforce the law and not let them uh grope women and children
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:15.280]  or men for that matter and then the republican leader of the senate the
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.040]  lieutenant governor david dohurst and then there are state senators on record
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:23.520]  in the dallas morning news you name it uh that that he said don't let anybody
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:26.480]  know i'm doing this but with the justice department
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.840]  he threatened and lobbied and and the justice department put a letter out
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:34.160]  publicly congressman saying they would blockade and have a no fly zone
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:40.880]  over texas uh if they did not uh back off of this bill what's your take on that
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.280]  well i used to i used to think that uh you know that the the slogan don't mess
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.440]  with texas actually meant something but i'm beginning to wonder now
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.040]  uh you know they uh that they back down
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:58.480]  on this at least the senate apparently did i mean it's ridiculous to let the
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.280]  government uh bully a state like this a knife no fly zone that people can't
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.840]  fly in and out of texas give me a break i mean how in heaven's name
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:11.040]  would they enforce something like that obviously they couldn't
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:14.880]  uh and if they tried uh then texas would stand up to it they would
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:19.040]  they would have security at the the airports uh that was that would be
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:23.520]  probably perhaps certainly as good as if not probably better than what tsa
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:26.560]  uh provides
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:31.280]  well what does that say about the mindset of the justice department and in
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.760]  janet napolitano at homeland security that they would have a u.s attorney send
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:40.080]  a letter just arrogantly saying we'll shut down your air traffic
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:44.640]  i mean this is this sounds like how the civil war started
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:48.080]  it it doesn't surprise me and i doubt that it
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:52.240]  really surprises you alexary or your listeners i mean we've seen this
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:56.480]  federal bullying by republicans and democrats democrats alike
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.000]  for many many years now and i was hopeful uh you know until until yesterday i
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.120]  guess it was uh that texas would finally stand up to this uh to this nonsense
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.760]  uh but now you know obviously uh you know they've at least backed out for the
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.880]  moment unfortunately uh hopefully uh perhaps congress i mean how
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:21.200]  is uh how is the lone star states uh congressional delegation handling this
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:26.560]  are they going to uh fight for the freedom uh and the fourth amendment
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.840]  for at least texas well that's the word a headline
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.600]  yesterday powerful bipartisan uh group is forming in the house of
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:40.800]  representatives to defund part of the tsa and defund the naked body scanners
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.880]  as a former senior congressman bob bar let's talk about strategies
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.680]  uh that you could recommend to try to beat this and

[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:38.320]  bob bar is our guest for this one segment to look at the whole tsa situation
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:43.040]  congressman why have you weighed in and started an organization and for a
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:46.480]  request uh dealing with the stand down of
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:49.920]  thanksgiving and the reported secret political
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:56.400]  persecution list the tsa why for you is the tsa such an important issue
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.240]  it's such an important issue alex because it embodies
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:03.600]  uh what is happening to our fourth amendment protection which is the
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.680]  fourth amendment being the the essential privacy protection
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:12.640]  we as citizens in a free society have or should have
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:18.240]  against unreasonable government intrusion uh if there is a better example
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:21.440]  other than the sum of the nonsense with the patriot act which we can talk about
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.280]  on a different day which is very important uh a better example of how the
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:30.240]  government that does not give a darn about the fourth amendment
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.800]  than what tsa is doing that i'd like to hear it uh when a person uh and i've
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:38.240]  had this happen to me uh goes through uh to
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:41.680]  border plane first of all i don't think they uh they have any right uh or
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:45.280]  reason to you know look at my idea that has nothing to do with
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:49.600]  with whether or not i have weapons or explosives but be that as a mate
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:53.600]  once a person goes through the metal or explosive detectors
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:58.720]  unless there is some other reason articulable reason the tsa has to suspect
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.760]  that person uh opposing a danger they have no right whatsoever to search that
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.760]  person further and to say well simply because you don't
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:12.800]  want to have a a new body scan taken of you uh you're going
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:18.160]  to have uh a groping which used to be reserved for uh for suspected criminals
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:23.920]  upon arrest or detention uh that uh that provides the reasonable suspicion is
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:29.280]  absolute nonsense so the point is uh if we don't stop the government here uh
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:32.960]  based on violation of fourth amendment then there really is not going to be
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:36.640]  very much at all in the future that we'll be able to stop the government from
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.480]  doing that's why this battle is so important
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:47.600]  also a new video is out of a congressman on c-span uh congressman on a recent
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:51.600]  flight said tsa patted down child little old lady
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:57.600]  but ignored a man in arab garb and uh that of course the hill newspaper is
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:02.960]  also reporting that paul brown republican of uh georgia saying
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:06.640]  your state well i have to confirm i i fly quite a bit
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:12.080]  and in places like santa rosa uh san jose other areas
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:19.520]  uh new jersey all i see is women and children i do not see them
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:22.720]  if somebody's in a wheelchair and can hardly walk they go after them like
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.080]  wolves if if it's a baby they they they check in the diaper i've seen it if
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:32.400]  it's a young woman and but if you've got if you're wearing
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:35.920]  arab dress in a turban and i'm not seeing i'm not attacking those people in
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:39.440]  sign they should be singled out either it's they're left alone
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:44.480]  uh so this really just appears to be conditioning
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:48.240]  for the american people to have these federal goons
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.720]  the fb i can't stick their hands down your pants without a warrant
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:58.320]  how how then can they do this well they they they do it because we let them do
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.440]  it uh because americans by the millions say oh it
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.720]  makes us safer or oh i have nothing to hide uh and therefore they uh like like
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:09.600]  sheep they they let the government do this uh the
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:12.400]  only way this is going to be stopped i don't think it's going to happen through
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:16.240]  the courts unfortunately uh but we have to fight these battles through the
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:20.320]  courts also the only way we're going to have any hope is if people rise up
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.480]  against this uh and go to their members of congress
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:28.320]  go to their state legislatures uh go to their senators
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:33.760]  and demand that tsa be reigned in and that the fourth amendment
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:40.880]  actually be uh given uh the uh uh the the the the the power to protect
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:46.320]  individuals that it used to have sir looking at the tsa
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.000]  announcements that they want to be in high school proms
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.760]  if you're a new listener that's not a joke uh in santa fe a federal judge
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.640]  ruling that well we'll send them there to grope kids
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:00.080]  to to make sure their rights aren't violated it's just a bizarre orwellian
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.000]  statement or tsa now actually in florida texas
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.440]  massachusetts new york california are now setting up checkpoints
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:15.040]  on highways not just bus terminals and doing the groping and and the hands and
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:19.120]  the pants i mean i this is so off the charts i can't even
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:23.360]  believe this is really happening i mean this is this is the soviet union didn't
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:27.760]  do this it's uh it's unprecedented uh and again if we
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:31.280]  don't put a stop to a pretty darn quick the fourth amendment will have lost any
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.480]  meaning uh whatsoever the same thing is happening
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:38.160]  even here in in in georgia tsa and department of
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:42.400]  homeland security are setting up uh i forget what the the acronym stands for
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.960]  the viper program vi pr where they will set up
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:53.040]  roadblocks on major highways uh sometimes during rush hour uh they will
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.200]  set up uh set up folks at train stations you might have seen
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:01.360]  a couple months ago this happened at the train station in savannah georgia
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.240]  and they will uh start conducting random searches of people
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:11.920]  stopping trucks at truck stops uh and you know supposedly looking for
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:15.680]  terrorists i mean utterly arbitrary utterly nonsensical
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.280]  but as you said a moment ago and you're absolutely correct this is conditioning
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.640]  americans to having government be able to do
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:27.040]  anything it wants them it's not about security alex it's about control
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:30.800]  well here's an example of that i have been going down to bolivar
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.240]  since i was a child and i hadn't been in more than a decade so i took my children
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:37.200]  there and then the the ferry from galveston to
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.400]  bolivar there's a road you can drive around a few miles out of the way
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:42.960]  but i thought let's take the little ferry takes about five minutes to go
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.440]  across and when i pulled up they had all the families
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:50.320]  out and they search every car now and dig through your
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.840]  belongings before you get on the ferry and and then they said well you don't
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:57.520]  like this uh we set up highway checkpoints now
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:02.160]  and it's it's so asinine and and then with dominate strouse con
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:06.320]  they have a new bill in new york state that all of the hotel maids must wear
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:11.040]  emergency necklaces because one guy might have tried to grope
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:14.400]  somebody so the idea is the government will keep you safe from
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:17.680]  everything well the government can't keep you safe from everything
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.600]  and every time government claims it's going to do that historically congressmen
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:26.560]  aren't they a government tyranny always the greatest threat to life liberty
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:30.240]  it certainly is because they have a monopoly on legitimate power in terms
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:34.080]  that they define what the citizens can or cannot do
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:38.960]  it's the typical government reaction uh whether it's about guns whether it's
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.680]  about prescription drugs for example we just had a bill in georgia that was
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:49.120]  passed and signed by republicans of course uh that now sets up a
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:54.800]  database of prescription drugs uh the reason for this is well there are
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:57.520]  these folks out there that abuse prescriptions
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:01.120]  therefore in order to make law enforcement's job easier to catch these
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:05.200]  few scoff laws we're going to inconvenience and invade the privacy of
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.000]  everybody that gets a prescription bill and people just sit back and say oh it
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.400]  makes us safer well it must be okay then
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:17.440]  and now with political hit list we know medical records have been used by
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.360]  presidents and people now if any of these cops without a warrant
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:25.920]  want to know exactly what i'm taking exactly what my wife's taking exactly
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:29.760]  what my children have taken this is one of the most sacrosanct
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.120]  privacy areas there are and it's uh i don't know how it is in
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.640]  texas but uh in georgia and down in florida
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:44.000]  it's republicans i i tell you alex without exaggeration like georgia's
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.200]  perfect example when the republicans get into power and control both branches
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:52.640]  both the executive and the legislative branches of state government
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:58.800]  uh they impose more controls and invade more of our liberties than the
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.560]  democrats did and that's what was so wonderful
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.920]  about the texas situation the unanimous 138
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:10.720]  vote in the house to criminalize what's already criminal with the tsa
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.800]  but start prosecuting these these molesters to have republicans and
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:18.000]  democrats come together for the bill of rights and constitution
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.120]  and then have the republican david dohurst a bush
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:26.560]  carl rove protege kill it in secret and senators have gone public that he said
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:30.560]  keep this secret i'm doing this uh what's your view of
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:36.560]  something like that it's uh highly unethical uh certainly uh it ought to
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:40.400]  outrage the citizenry ought to outrage the governor i mean what does that
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:44.480]  governor perry intend to do about this well senator
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:49.920]  dan patrick uh the next senior republican senator under dohurst
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:53.360]  uh is the one blown the whistle and others are now in the papers saying oh
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:57.200]  yeah uh dohurst had federal obvious with him
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:00.400]  and was threatening everyone and saying they couldn't pass it while publicly
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:03.760]  saying he supported it i mean if that isn't
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.040]  a new level of political treachery i don't know what is
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:10.560]  well it's pretty treachery and pretty political cowardice as well
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:14.480]  uh and i'm uh you know delighted uh that you're standing
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:18.320]  firm on this and uh and bringing light to this and hopefully many many of your
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.800]  other colleagues in the media will be doing the same
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:24.400]  and i hope uh i hope perry does not i hope he doesn't just cave into this now
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.680]  we've only got a minute left i i ran out of time
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:30.880]  uh your four-year request you told me privately you're getting ready to sue
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:34.000]  if they don't answer your four years speak to that briefly
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.800]  and then also homeland security saying they won't show
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.480]  the statute where they have the authority to stick hands down pants
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:45.760]  uh the tsa is an agency with the support of his parent agency department of
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:49.280]  homeland security that believes it's above the law very honestly
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:53.520]  and congress needs to step in and rein it in in the absence of that what we're
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.320]  doing at liberty guard at www.libertyguard.org
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:02.080]  is uh going through the the freedom of information act
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:06.800]  which tsa is fighting uh and it looks like uh we're you know we're just
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.040]  trying to get some basic information on on how all of this these scanners and
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.720]  the groping is being conducted and so forth and then what authority
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:17.920]  they're refusing to divulge it and it looks like we'll have to go through the
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:22.800]  the court system and you know it will leave people's support for that
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:26.240]  absolutely and and and now we learn congress one of the radiation readings
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:30.960]  and then they gave them fake ones i mean the these guys think they're god
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:35.200]  oh they they do i i used to think that being a lawyer that
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:38.960]  the most powerful people on the face of the earth were uh were federal judges
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:44.240]  once they get the robe and uh but uh they're uh their kids compared to
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:49.120]  these folks at tsa and department of homeland security congressman bob bar

[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:23.440]  any fourth amendment total power grab and uh more states are fighting texas is
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:26.720]  going to continue to fight we're taking your calls right now and i've got some
[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:29.840]  other financial and global and military news i'll hit before the show ends the
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:34.960]  broadcast ends uh but um
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.040]  we're taking phone calls from the great lovers of liberty that showed up
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:43.600]  yesterday between two o'clock and 11 30 at night
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:46.480]  um in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds i mean there were people just
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:49.920]  milling around everywhere biggest our crowd ever got the statesman counted
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:52.640]  said was about a hundred that's running around the capital
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:56.800]  we split up into different groups more people are coming in constantly
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:01.200]  uh again some media estimates 300 to 400 but this was just spontaneous boom in
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:04.880]  their face and it was so exciting and we went
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:07.920]  down there because we learned that that the bill had been sabotaged when they
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:12.160]  had 30 out of 31 senators unanimous in the house had passed it
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.240]  and we now know it was david dohurst just
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:21.440]  unbelievable and again if he's for this he should be public he did this
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.600]  secretly and there are senators like dan patrick that have called him out and
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:31.680]  dan patrick's the next senior under him so uh the the the
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:36.160]  lieutenant governor is the leader of the senate and again you can even look
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.560]  this up in the online encyclopedias in texas he's really the governor
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:44.000]  um that gets confusing but you got to take texas government government to
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.040]  understand it's the only state that has it uh he's bad news i mean this guy is
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.280]  bad news you saw bob bar about these republicans and he's a republican
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:57.520]  himself how bad they are how bad they are
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.840]  it's just it's just terrible terrible that a bipartisan group did the right
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:06.880]  thing in the house in this slime bowl working with obama did this
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.840]  shame on obama shame on dohurst remember dohurst is a minion of obama
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:16.160]  dohurst works in secret with obama against texas and america
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.080]  remember the name dohurst who worked with claus barbie

[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:34.240]  hi there alex um you know i was working yesterday and
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:38.320]  i was just getting more and more serious the journal and was just pumping
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:43.200]  through me uh if the senate would have no guts to call the bloc of the tsa
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:46.240]  one thing i haven't heard people say too much about is the fact that we have
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:50.560]  three major airlines headquarters uh in texas stop west airlines
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:53.840]  american airlines and continental so let me stop because i want to be able to
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:57.680]  hear what you have to say jennifer are you on a speakerphone
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:01.120]  no that's a little better yeah that's better yes there's three major airlines
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.680]  based here they would have never gotten away with this call for a blockade
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:10.560]  of texas i mean it is it is a blockade a no fly zone
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:14.000]  right so the the fact that the senate did not have the guts to call their bloc
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.360]  just made me so angry and as i was listening to you yesterday my husband
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:20.800]  and i uh we uh got in the car and headed down to the
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:23.760]  capital and we got there about 30 minutes before
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:27.520]  you did maybe 45 minutes before and i had on my
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.680]  pierney response team shirt and my husband had on his
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:37.280]  1984 answer 1776 shirt so immediately other people started coming up to us
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:40.960]  and and uh that we're just plain close people that also heard the call
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.360]  and we formed a little group and we went down to stay there finish your story on
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:48.320]  the other side jennifer then kori ronnie erin and others if
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:54.880]  you were there 800 259 93 1 we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:06.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:10.320]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:13.280]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:16.480]  americans at home and have turned tremendous influence
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:20.800]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:25.680]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:28.880]  fall the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:33.280]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:36.560]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:40.240]  bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:44.160]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.680]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:10.160]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.000]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.200]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:24.400]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:27.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:31.280]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:34.400]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:38.320]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:41.200]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:44.080]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:25.360]  all right i'm going to continue taking some calls from folks that went down to
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:29.920]  the storming of the texas capital when the house did the honorable thing with
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:32.880]  a unanimous vote against tyranny what else could they do
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:36.400]  against the groping of our poor defenseless children being trained to be
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:40.240]  victimized by people in uniform and discrediting everybody in a
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:43.280]  uniform the state stood up and said no to them the
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.640]  police despite the fact that i was behaving
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:50.400]  like a wild rhinoceros were very professional and did their job
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:54.880]  but you should extremism and defense of liberty is no vice
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:59.840]  as berry goldwater said you're supposed to be mad this is a normal behavior
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:02.320]  they continue to push because we don't get mad
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:07.120]  our ancestors for far less and i'm not saying go there
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:12.320]  hung people tarred and feathered them okay wrote them on a town on a rail
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:15.920]  because old timers knew you let a bunch of scum in government
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:18.800]  start ruling over you they're going to rob you blind they're going to hire a
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.640]  bunch of thugs to carry it out on you our ancestors and every culture have
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:27.760]  gone through this over and over again and your anger your your focus that they
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:31.520]  shunt off into sports and things where you care so much about your team
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:34.880]  your team's supposed to be your liberties your freedom your family
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:38.480]  that's what all those those energies are for
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:41.280]  and i don't go out to a lot of demonstrations and things especially
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:45.280]  where i'm around globalist because when they're laughing and making jokes as
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:48.720]  some lobbyist and some senators were doing
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:53.920]  kirk watson locked himself in his office i mean i i i really
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.360]  almost start coughing up blood i was screaming so loud
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:00.560]  and that's why i did an hour and a half and had to leave i know folks continue
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:05.120]  to show up in the hundreds off and on until the early morning hours
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:08.720]  now going back to jennifer then quarry ronnie erin mike want to move quicker
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:12.320]  now jennifer describe because i'm told even bigger crowds started
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:16.480]  showing up and infesting the capital with liberty to drive out the globalist
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:19.200]  roaches that the the lobbyists that scattered like
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.120]  roaches when they saw us coming describe what you saw throughout the evening
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:26.720]  people getting out on the gallery when they destroyed the bill
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:30.880]  past 11 a.m uh uh past 11 p.m excuse me at nine
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:35.600]  what you saw last night being there well i was there earlier in the afternoon
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:38.880]  and one of the main things that i found offensive is
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:42.640]  after visiting kirk watson's office a group of about seven or so
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:45.440]  info warriors that we all kind of found each other
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:49.120]  headed to the uh the senate gallery doors and
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:53.200]  they one by one as we approach the doors
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:56.400]  you know that they let each person in and then they stopped me
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:59.600]  and they said you can't go in there with that shirt on and the shirt that i had
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:04.000]  on was a kirby response team shirt so they let everybody else go in that
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.560]  was part of the group except for me and i was told by the head of security that
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:12.400]  that that was considered a protest banner and if i wore the shirt into the
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:15.520]  gallery that i would i would have to be arrested
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:19.280]  so i didn't want to get arrested so i backed down and just kind of hung out
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:23.360]  in the uh in the foyer there in front of the gallery until everyone else came
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:27.840]  out so shortly after that there was a wonderful woman handing out
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:32.160]  all sorts of pens and signs for all of us to make
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:35.760]  make signs and then we headed back down to the main foyer which was right about
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.120]  the time that you that you were entering and of course we followed around with
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:42.880]  the crowd after that but i think that the kirby
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:45.680]  response team shirts are very powerful and that they're
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.120]  they're afraid of that message so i definitely encourage anybody that
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:52.560]  doesn't have one of those if we can have protests like this in the
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:55.600]  future where 50 or 100 people show up wearing those
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:59.440]  those specific shirts i think it would be really fantastic
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:03.520]  and i'd just like to say that for for those that have never
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.880]  done anything like like what happened yesterday uh the adrenaline of participating
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:12.640]  in something like that is it's unlike anything that you've ever experienced
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:16.160]  before i mean who cares about going to the super bowl or
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.360]  you know other things that may seem exciting in life if you're actually
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:23.120]  there participating in the overthrow of tyranny
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:26.080]  what can be more important on this entire planet
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:29.280]  and and not going and just holding signs and groveling
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:32.560]  when when they're trying to literally molest us
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:36.000]  you've got to let these perverts these criminals these tyrants
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.640]  that want to break our will let them know scum we're aware of what you're
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:43.600]  doing we know you don't care about keeping us safe
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:47.360]  you want to be able to get rid of our basic liberties
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:50.720]  everything this country was founded on jennifer great to hear from you
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:54.880]  cori in texas at the rally go ahead

[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:01.920]  quick you know i i was sitting there my couch yesterday

[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.760]  you know we went marching around the state capital there
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:24.960]  and just letting our voices be known and it just felt so good i i drove home
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:28.560]  just high on life and high on you know it all
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:33.120]  man and i and every day can be like that because we literally
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:36.400]  routed that capital i mean they describe it in the news
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:40.480]  that the booming chanting just totally took over
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:46.160]  uh and and and made the bill passage actually have to stop for a while
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.120]  uh the politicians were were the senators were scrambling in fear
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:55.200]  uh because because they know they've been doing wrong
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:39:00.000]  and and and those senators are such cowards that when the house
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:06.480]  did the right thing 138 to zip they were all going to vote for it but one and
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:09.760]  that's do hers we now learn and do hers with the feds
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.840]  which violates state state ethics rules the media is reporting
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:17.520]  with federal lobbyist on the floor went around and
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:20.720]  basically threatened people and said you don't tell anybody i'm doing this
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:24.400]  but you don't do this or we're going to have the fed shut down transportation

[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:32.880]  unbelievable this guy needs to get out of texas
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.720]  much less he should not be our lieutenant governor i mean that guy
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:41.280]  makes me want to throw up i completely concur alex
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:46.080]  i do i do what do you think of do hers now though i mean he
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:49.760]  i mean it's not just that he brought the feds in and did this but he wanted to
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:52.400]  keep it secret well here's the thing you know i
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:56.080]  was having the thought that you know there's i think that there's far more
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.040]  good people in this world than bad but it just seems that bad people seem to
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:04.320]  have the hand on on the power and can sneak their way in and
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:07.840]  and wiggle their way into control us you know but there's enough good people
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:12.080]  out there if we just stand up and let our voice be heard you know
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:15.200]  and that's what yesterday was about for me
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:18.880]  well it's important for everybody to call do hers office but also call other
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:22.400]  senators office and say it's going to be a litmus test
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:26.880]  and let me remember that do her secretly sided with obama
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:30.800]  to destroy the will of the texas house and the senate
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:34.240]  and to violate the constitution and bill of rights of the federal and state
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:39.440]  government and that he is a a a a deceptive weasel
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:45.120]  who one newspaper reported celebrated after its defeat and made jokes
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:50.240]  so he has a hatred such a hate of liberty and freedom
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:54.720]  and honor that he that that he's willing to pose as a conservative
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.480]  so he can sabotage things and sit there and lie
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:01.600]  and say he supported the bill i mean is that not just
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:05.760]  just just sickening as low as low could be man
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:12.320]  as it is sickening you're you're right well let it be known david duhurst is

[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:22.960]  with the deluge so what did he say the cia uh
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:28.160]  when you brought the cia yeah well uh you know there's a bunch of conservative
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:31.680]  guys the lake travis republican men's club and and he just kind of you know
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:34.800]  they all he just looked at me he just looked at me with this evil thing
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.440]  he just yes you know he just kind of yes but how dare you ask me
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:44.000]  uh but you know so that was well it's not that even was at the cia a lot of
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.720]  them are analysts or you can look at their histories
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:52.880]  he has a death squad history with claus barbie a top nazi admittedly he was
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:56.480]  under the cia control and we have all the links to mainstream news in our
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:42:59.680]  article about it so of course he doesn't want you to bring it up
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:04.080]  i mean i mean this guy is a tyrant and he thinks
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.520]  because he's a smiley faced fake texan with a fancy suit
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:11.360]  that we're all here to bend over and then and then he and then it's cute that
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:14.320]  potbellied pigs want to grow up our daughters and sons
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:17.920]  that you know duhurst you're the one calling for this you're the one pushing
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:21.520]  it you're the one trying to basically urinate all over
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:24.000]  liberty well we're not putting up with it
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.880]  yeah screw loose i call listen i appreciate your call ronnie
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:31.600]  and and again by my point is he's like a dog hiking his leg on the constitution
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:34.560]  and and and trying to dominate us and trying to sneak around
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:42.800]  we're calling you out okay we you don't own us get that through your punk brain
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:49.920]  let's go ahead and talk to um erin um in texas go ahead you were at the rally
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:54.560]  yes thank you very much alex for uh deciding to change your mind and get
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:57.840]  active again and because i think you're a great leader i always
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:02.960]  thought that and uh but please stay uh focused and keep doing it that's all i
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:07.440]  mean one time is not enough man are you willing to uh keep on keeping on
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:12.320]  we mean one time's not enough i uh fly around speak to groups of people
[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:17.360]  bend to hundreds of demonstrations dozens of black op gun confiscation
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:21.920]  drills i've uh gone to belterburg i've been arrested detained
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:26.080]  and people call me up and say you need to make your bones boy you haven't uh
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:29.680]  you haven't you know done anything i um and i appreciate you saying i'm a
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:32.960]  leader look look here's the reason i don't go to a lot of
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:38.320]  demonstrations and things it's it's up to the citizens to do that it's up for
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:41.840]  you guys uh to be leaders and that's why i went
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:45.440]  to an hour and a half and then i left i said every new more people were coming
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:48.640]  and i said you know this is part of your birthright
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:52.800]  uh i i don't want to make it a cult of personality
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:57.040]  uh about alex jones i want it to be a cult of personality about liberty
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:02.800]  and freedom and ideas because ideas uh are bulletproof also i get so wound up
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:05.600]  in public i mean if you were there that you know
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:11.280]  that i mean it's it's it's it's it's a wild situation
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:16.640]  okay and also i can electronically in the time i go out and do a
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:20.160]  demonstration or something and maybe have a little local media
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:22.320]  coverage or something and that's good for everybody else too because in the
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:25.600]  aggregate it's huge i can sit here and do radio tv
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:30.720]  interviews do special reports that reach millions of people a day who are new
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:34.800]  and so i'm trying to spur the overall awakening
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:38.400]  uh and and you know if i am a general in the fight for liberty which quite
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.120]  frankly um one of the biggest generals out there after ron paul
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:47.840]  then i need to be out there you know generally
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:52.240]  breaking down the enemy operations not always charging around the field
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:56.480]  i mean i mean i was a private a long time ago and then i was a sergeant then i
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:00.880]  was a captain and at a certain point um
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:06.560]  here's another issue and and when i have events or announce events or go to
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:09.920]  other things with a long-term position that gives
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:12.960]  co-intel pro a chance to get in position
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.760]  and and and and try to manipulate it or deceive people or put provocateurs in
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.200]  okay because because a head's easy to cut off
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:25.600]  uh a head is easy to politically discredit that's why if i can spontaneously
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:28.080]  announce something and go do it it'll be a success
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:31.440]  because they don't have time to maneuver their fake patriots in a position
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:35.760]  to cause problems does that uh clarify things for you erin
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:40.160]  well again um i i just uh if you stay active in whatever measured way will be
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:44.400]  great and doing the tv channel idea where you're uh like on a tv channel type
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:46.240]  thing i think that's what you have going forward right
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:49.600]  that's really going to be a great idea that's really the alternative media
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:55.120]  going more uh full fledged with uh full copia options for people
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:00.880]  erin so overall what word what was your view of what happened yesterday
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:04.000]  oh i i just think it's the greatest thing ever because i know when you get
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.160]  these texans riled up they're going to do the right thing the american thing so
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:12.560]  i'm you know so happy about it god bless erin the action
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:16.240]  i hear you listen well that is why it was so empowering
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:20.240]  because we shook that place we dominated the media
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:23.760]  the media that was covering the house and senate dozens and dozens of cameras
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.360]  came newspapers and it's all over the world that people are
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:30.640]  resisting and now it's in every major paper out there that i've
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:35.120]  looked at that do hearst is a sneaky little creature
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:39.280]  and that the republicans were going to blame democrats for killing this
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:43.760]  well it was a republican it was do hearst with obama
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:48.080]  and and and so we've drawn them out it's a big victory big victory
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:51.040]  we're getting fluoride taken out in cities all over europe canada in the
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:55.440]  u.s big victories when we take action we have victory
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:59.840]  not the first second third fourth fifth tenth 30th 50th time
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.960]  but you keep pushing resistance is victory you are unstoppable
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:11.680]  let's talk to christie in texas who was there christie welcome
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:17.120]  can you hear me i can christie welcome hello um
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.080]  we were there a little while after you got there
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:25.600]  yesterday and uh my family and i my two daughters and my husband win and a
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.160]  friend of ours and came in and and heard the noise and found
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:35.120]  you upstairs so uh it was just amazing it was an
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:39.520]  awesome experience for the girls and i'm told that my voice but then all the
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:42.080]  chanting literally filled the entire capital and it's
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.400]  giant rob said that he was in the chambers of the senate
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:50.480]  and heard us three levels down just taking over the entire chamber
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:54.080]  yeah yeah we were we were you know wondering where to go and
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.560]  well you know what that is that that's why in wars when a bunch of armies
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:01.520]  clasters is because people are getting fired up
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:06.880]  and it was that totally freaking out and it was like a song the cops were
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.160]  smiling and oh hearing it wanting to join us i
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:14.160]  could see it in their eyes i mean it was liberty which is
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:17.120]  right and then that's what for freedom is it was
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:20.800]  we're coming for you pitchforks here cops take some
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:24.640]  but it was figurative and it's that song of liberty
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.480]  that that will rise the spirit of freedom do you see what i'm saying
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:34.000]  god-given thing that is a a right given by god not by
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.400]  the government not by the police not by anybody
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:42.480]  and it's instinctive and natural and and you know
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:49.200]  anybody that that knows that it's obvious but uh you know we just it was a
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:52.240]  great experience for the girls they really wanted to talk to you
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:56.240]  if you have time to talk to them we homeschool and they're here right now
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:59.440]  so oh are those some of the great children i met
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:02.960]  they were the two the two girls that we've got a 13 year old and a 10 year old
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:05.760]  well i was going a little wild a few times i'd look around and see children
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:09.600]  so i apologize if i was rebuking some of the lobbyist and was
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:12.800]  acting like a frothing goblin but sure we're going to skip this final break
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:16.160]  so we have time to talk to them and uh the other folks that are holding but
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.000]  uh bring your daughters on how are you young ladies doing
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.160]  they're doing great you know they uh last night before we went to bed my
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:27.360]  oldest daughter said mom this was probably the greatest day the
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:30.560]  best day of my life and uh you know i'll let her talk
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:34.960]  about that herself but but anyway it was just it was great
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.800]  to actually do something we were listening and going about our day and
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:42.480]  it was about lunch time and you know you said come down here i'm going down
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:45.440]  and and you don't have an excuse especially if you live close to austin
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:48.400]  and she just looked at me and said mom we don't have an excuse
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:51.840]  so i called my husband and he said yeah let's let's go
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:55.440]  and it just happened and and it was great and they you know they both agree
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:58.960]  that we just need to do this more and we need to
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:03.200]  you know just say what we believe and and not back down and
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:06.640]  you know we're just past the point of caring who doesn't like it and and who
[02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:09.760]  doesn't agree well see that's that spirit that's the
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:13.440]  spirit of standing up not being intimidated by the cops
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:17.520]  and the metal detectors and the surveillance stepping through any fear
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:20.880]  and then suddenly you're empowered and you realize you've got the moral
[02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:25.040]  authority and it's that spark that can light the fires of liberty
[02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:29.200]  that will sweep these vampires aside they will burn up
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:33.120]  like vampires at high noon uh go ahead and put your oldest daughter on
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:37.920]  okay her name is renny and here she is hi how are you doing
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:41.760]  i'm good how are you good it was good to meet you uh what did you think about
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:46.240]  what happened yesterday i was really proud to be a part of it
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:52.320]  and i just thought it was amazing just to do something
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:55.920]  well you've got great parents that don't sit you in front of a
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:51:59.040]  apprentice an american idol in in this culture of death
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:03.120]  and we need to reach out to more young people and to more parents
[02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:06.240]  so that their young people can experience the birthright
[02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:09.680]  of free human beings not just americans or texans
[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:12.960]  anything else that you'd like to add what does your little sister think about
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:16.240]  all this i'm not sure what she thought but we
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:22.160]  both thought it was just so cool to be with other people who
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:28.400]  know the same thing because it's not that it's rare to be with
[02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:35.040]  other people well the big secret is we are the fastest
[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:38.960]  and largest minority in the country we have much more than five percent that
[02:52:38.960 --> 02:52:44.560]  started in one the revolutionary war and we really are beginning to become the
[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:49.680]  majority we just haven't gotten together this culture this this television
[02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:54.640]  culture this this this this fake culture they've superimposed
[02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:58.240]  has blinded people from their real human culture
[02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:02.560]  of liberty and freedom and so we are the majority and that's why getting out in
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:05.280]  public talking to others going to city council
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:09.280]  speaking at the school board that's where we're going to find the like-minded
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:12.960]  people and learn that we really are the majority and we have
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:17.040]  the right to not be servile slaves
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:24.480]  i agree it was great and here's my sister

[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:32.080]  um dps guys out there kind of bugged their eyes out at you
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.920]  wouldn't like that in the past instead we're like this government's in the
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:41.120]  wrong this senate are traders and we're here to expose the threatened federal
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:45.040]  no fly zone over texas and we had the moral authority
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:48.400]  and and i've been watching the video and it can't even capture it
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:53.680]  that building it was like designed for sound to just blast through it
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:59.200]  and uh what was the sound like the way that building was shaking
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  so loud i mean it was unbelievable i i'm on the same
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:06.960]  uh i had the same reaction about those videos because
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:11.760]  it was it was unbelievably loud it was just yeah exactly the way it would
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:15.200]  carry uh the way everyone's voice would just carry
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:19.200]  again you know when we got it right up to the next to those doors alex
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:24.960]  yelling cowards cowards cowards they i mean i can't even imagine what it was
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:30.480]  like on the other end of that those guys had to be just shaking
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:33.280]  well they were to run for cover or something i mean how you want to wet
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:36.480]  themselves i mean i don't i don't know i mean and looking around even at those
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:38.880]  guards those guards were looking at us like
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.640]  like they were in the wrong like even they were in the wrong like they didn't
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:47.760]  they didn't even want to be doing their job well because they're protecting
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:51.920]  a criminal group of leadership senators
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:56.800]  rebuking the unanimous vote of the house which is unprecedented
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:01.440]  and having the feds come in and say well shut down all your air traffic
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:05.360]  that's how the civil war started i mean this is big stuff
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:09.840]  and and and now dohurst is being routed in the texas media i mean i read some
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:13.440]  of these headlines earlier that dohurst was sneaking around it doesn't want it
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:15.840]  known and the republicans are turning against him
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:19.520]  senator dan patrick is saying he won't support him for governor or u.s senator
