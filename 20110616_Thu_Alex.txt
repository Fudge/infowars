[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.960 --> 00:43.240]  thank you for joining us it is Thursday the 16th day of June 2011 we're gonna
[00:43.240 --> 00:49.280]  be live here for the next three hours we're working on getting Max Kaiser to
[00:49.280 --> 00:57.120]  join us if not today tomorrow from Greece on the front lines of the fight
[00:57.120 --> 01:00.880]  against the globalist the people there are fighting back and saying they're not
[01:00.880 --> 01:04.120]  gonna pay hundreds of billions of dollars to the private Federal Reserve
[01:04.120 --> 01:09.880]  and other private shareholders of the global banking consortium that they do
[01:09.880 --> 01:16.120]  not owe and of course it's come out that their leader Papandreov was financed and
[01:16.120 --> 01:20.520]  on the payroll of Goldman Sachs and others and he's announced that he's
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.960]  ready to resign and is reshuffling the cabinet now under riots going on all
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.280]  over the country against the criminals in government and so we have that news a
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.720]  day and regardless we'll be covering it political turmoil in Greece amid
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.040]  austerity uproar associated press Greek Prime Minister to reshuffle cabinet IMF
[01:42.040 --> 01:47.440]  concerned Papandreov set to fall within days as one of the other headlines
[01:47.440 --> 01:53.080]  Greek PM George Papandreov to unveil again a new cabinet and is saying he may
[01:53.080 --> 01:59.000]  resign this morning it was he was going to resign now it's he may resign and so
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  it's not just Muammar Gaddafi that is a set to be possibly falling it's people
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.680]  like Papandreov okay there is a lot of other incredible news Wiener has
[02:11.680 --> 02:18.040]  announced he's gonna be resigning so we've got that report that's not very
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.560]  important overall there it is interesting little soap opera that we've been
[02:23.560 --> 02:27.360]  watching ongoing and they tried to sell the idea that oh it's okay all
[02:27.360 --> 02:30.920]  politicians do this just let him get away with it so it is a good sign that
[02:30.920 --> 02:36.080]  these people are not able to just get away with anything which is what they've
[02:36.080 --> 02:39.600]  tried to do they're trying to break our will and train us that they can get away
[02:39.600 --> 02:45.000]  with basically anything also some good news this happened a few days ago and I
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.840]  wasn't aware of it but I heard on local radio last night and it's confirmed that
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.120]  Rick Perry has done the right thing reportedly and added to the special
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.560]  session under massive pressure the TSA anti-groping bill that passed
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.080]  unanimously in the house and was killed a month ago in the Senate so we're gonna
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.320]  be breaking that down some very positive news we're told that the known CIA
[03:09.320 --> 03:13.560]  asset who dines secretly at the Pentagon according to Fox News and Associated Press
[03:13.560 --> 03:20.320]  has been appointed the new leader of Al Qaeda and we're seeing all sorts of new
[03:20.320 --> 03:23.560]  hype about how Al Qaeda is going to hit us any minute so we need to give up all
[03:23.560 --> 03:28.160]  of our liberties and our freedoms in geopolitical news Russia and China
[03:28.160 --> 03:32.760]  warned West against Arab interference and on top of that China military paper
[03:32.760 --> 03:37.360]  urges steps against US cyber war threat so there's a big cyber warfare race
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.360]  going on and China will use its crackdown in the name of fighting the
[03:41.360 --> 03:45.240]  United States as a way to restrict its citizens access to information more and
[03:45.240 --> 03:51.800]  so will our nation that's why these police states love war or the threat of
[03:51.800 --> 03:58.760]  a new war and new types of war so that is just some of the news that we're going
[03:58.760 --> 04:04.280]  to be breaking down on that front today will also be tracking stocks as they
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.920]  continue to fall in Europe on news that pop and dry off may fall because you have
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.760]  Wall Street and the European brokerage firms know that they're not going to get
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.160]  unlimited taxpayer money out of Europe to pay off their bad bets that they've
[04:18.160 --> 04:22.480]  in paid our governments off to tie themselves into and that means the end
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.240]  of the party the end of the crony capitalist system that is the opposite
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.120]  of free market and actually create socialism at the grassroots to steal
[04:31.120 --> 04:34.520]  our wealth and transfer it to them through fascism and speaking of that
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.440]  coming up later they want Texas taxpayers in Austin nights predominantly to
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.760]  pay for a 250 million dollar formula one track why is that important well the
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.880]  owner of this whole situation his daughter's worth four billion and she
[04:47.880 --> 04:52.280]  just bought the most expensive house in the United States and most of it is from
[04:52.280 --> 04:59.120]  people's tax money so we'll be looking at crony capitalism today stay with us
[04:59.120 --> 05:05.520]  in the past two months over 2,000 natural disasters have been recorded with

[05:10.360 --> 05:14.240]  of the exploding price of fuel many farmers can't afford to plant their

[08:05.880 --> 08:22.120]  radio network it happens every day the news only gets more intense more crazy
[08:22.120 --> 08:27.040]  you're not imagining things everything is accelerating there is a worldwide
[08:27.040 --> 08:32.640]  quickening happening there are riots all over Greece today many of the police
[08:32.640 --> 08:38.440]  are now joining the citizens and guess what the tyrant is doing pop and
[08:38.440 --> 08:43.680]  ray off openly financed by Goldman Sachs openly working for them openly put
[08:43.680 --> 08:47.720]  into power it's all over the Greek news that he did meet three years ago and two
[08:47.720 --> 08:52.880]  years ago planning the implosion of the Greek economy to transfer all wealth to
[08:52.880 --> 08:57.720]  the offshore banks and that's why they're rioting and burning things and
[08:57.720 --> 09:02.040]  the government is set to collapse and pop and ray off is now announcing that
[09:02.040 --> 09:07.200]  he's appointing a new cabinet in a transition to resign weiner gate is
[09:07.200 --> 09:13.600]  coming to a close now except there may be charges for lying to the FBI and
[09:13.600 --> 09:18.280]  others when he filed that fake report of hacking by Breitbart keep saying
[09:18.280 --> 09:21.960]  Brett Bart I know it's Breitbart and the tendency is one of my foibles to screw
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.680]  names up it's like I was calling it st. Mort's instead of st. Moritz at
[09:25.680 --> 09:30.560]  Bilderberg but he still could get in trouble for lying and saying he was
[09:30.560 --> 09:34.400]  attacked and then civilly he should get in trouble for saying that Breitbart did
[09:34.400 --> 09:39.400]  it just shows you how sneaky and desperate and underhanded these people
[09:39.400 --> 09:44.720]  are but all of that pales in significance and we're going to cover it all to the
[09:44.720 --> 09:52.120]  ATF caught lying under oath and saying they never knew of a plan to ship guns
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.720]  into Mexico so they could then demonize the Second Amendment and claim the crime
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.640]  wave the total collapse the failed state that is Mexico was caused by our
[10:01.640 --> 10:06.040]  Second Amendment and it turns out the ATF had cameras in the shops ordered the
[10:06.040 --> 10:10.000]  shops to do it and was running the whole thing and do full well the guns were
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.400]  being used to kill people and to shoot at US law enforcement and Congressman
[10:15.400 --> 10:20.080]  Issa has said okay caught you under oath I'm releasing your internal emails of the
[10:20.080 --> 10:26.160]  people that testified in their own admissions that they did all of this so
[10:26.160 --> 10:35.000]  huge huge huge issue on that front and what's happening is the politicians are
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.440]  learning they're not above the law you can go to prison for lying to an FBI
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.320]  agent in a criminal investigation well then why can Bill Clinton lie why can
[10:44.320 --> 10:51.320]  George W. Bush lie why can the ATF lie you're not above the law you're not
[10:51.320 --> 10:56.440]  above the law and the Attorney General all of these people that ran this false
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.440]  flag terror attack against the Second Amendment that's what it is a staged
[11:00.440 --> 11:06.640]  frame-up of the Second Amendment need to be indicted now don't expect the FBI
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.440]  and the Justice Department under Homeland Security to indict their own
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.720]  people don't expect the Attorney General to be indicted that's why Congress he's
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.640]  a move forward with immediate impeachment against Barack Hussein Obama aka
[11:21.640 --> 11:26.240]  Barry Cetero it needs to happen now we're gonna be going over that now the
[11:26.240 --> 11:32.720]  the really big news is from multiple sources at Fort Hood on and off air
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.720]  letters I've received from Fort Hood from separate individuals saying the exact
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.760]  same thing and phone calls on air confirming the same issue and since
[11:42.760 --> 11:49.200]  then we've gotten even more confirmation now this is not a 100% deal
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.520]  because they'll tell the troops keep us on the down low but you're going to be
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.880]  going in to this country or that at set date that means they've been told it's
[12:00.880 --> 12:05.920]  got a green light but it hasn't been initiated yet and change and plans may
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.160]  change but they've not even been told that and a lot of these same sources
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.080]  right down the line have told us exactly what country is going to be toppled
[12:14.080 --> 12:18.480]  next where troops are going to invade next where drone attacks are going to be
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.320]  deployed next and so we're getting this from multiple multiple sides and I'm
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.920]  going to open the phones up throughout this hour while I cover other news
[12:27.920 --> 12:36.440]  specifically for contractors US military personnel husbands wives spouses of US
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.960]  military personnel to either confirm or deny to either add confirmation to this
[12:41.960 --> 12:48.560]  or to subtract from it but right now it's a 98% confirmation it's really
[12:48.560 --> 12:54.240]  about a hundred in my estimate but we always like to second guess ourselves a
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.920]  bit because it's on a totally a hundred percent nailed down but here is the big
[12:59.920 --> 13:05.760]  news and it's just a quick blurb up at info wars.com with an accompanying
[13:05.760 --> 13:12.080]  special report video that we need to get out to everyone US invasion of Libya set
[13:12.080 --> 13:20.680]  for October US special forces to intensify their moves into the region
[13:20.680 --> 13:27.600]  coming up by early next month so less than 15 days from now in early July and
[13:27.600 --> 13:37.200]  then in late September early October they are set to send in the 3rd Corps which
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.080]  is in overall command specifically of the 1st Cavalry Division and parts of
[13:43.080 --> 13:46.120]  that are broken up around the world but I did some checking last night today and
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.120]  did confirm large contingents of 3rd Corps obviously based at Fort Hood with
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.360]  contingent and also at Fort Bliss with 1st Cavalry large contingents of that
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.680]  there and they are being prepared to invade Libya with ground war and they
[14:00.680 --> 14:08.120]  have been told that it will be between 12 and 20,000 frontline armor troops and
[14:08.120 --> 14:14.120]  then just as many support troops that will come in after the initial landings
[14:14.120 --> 14:19.240]  and they're looking at aircraft landings in the east backed up with the
[14:19.240 --> 14:26.120]  al-Qaeda forces in Benghazi and globalist slash al-Qaeda held areas that
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.600]  our troops are going to be working with and also amphibious ships marine
[14:30.600 --> 14:34.800]  corps ships British and US off the shore we have not gotten any
[14:34.800 --> 14:41.800]  bonafide confirmed intel blurps from Marines we've gotten a little bit but
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.000]  but nothing triple confirmed and we're out to quadruple confirmed right now
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.880]  but that isn't a hundred percent yet but we know the Marines are off the coast we
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.800]  know they call it they say this isn't a war Obama put out a statement saying
[14:53.800 --> 14:57.560]  it's not a war so he doesn't need congressional approval Congress is
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.080]  suing him over this first time a president has gone into a major three
[15:03.080 --> 15:06.600]  months of military operation that's expanding and said it isn't a military
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.200]  operation and on top of it called it a kinetic action and then lied about the
[15:12.200 --> 15:16.960]  plan for ground troops when NATO a month and a half ago openly wrote up the
[15:16.960 --> 15:21.680]  battle plans and are prepared to vote for the full ground invasion we know US
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.920]  troops are on the ground at least advising and we've got reports from
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.760]  inside the mortuary division of two dead US Army soldiers and three dead
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.840]  contractor civilians we're trying to double confirm that but that's what the
[15:37.840 --> 15:43.720]  type of casualty casualties you'd expect to see associated with advisors we
[15:43.720 --> 15:46.960]  know there's US advisors that was admitted before the three-month old
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.640]  conflict started we know there's British advisors and SAS that have been
[15:51.640 --> 15:59.200]  videotaped controlling anti-tank artillery from hilltops and directing it
[15:59.200 --> 16:06.520]  but also pulling the trigger kicking the switch on them we've also got US and
[16:06.520 --> 16:10.200]  British special forces also reportedly there's some other NATO forces inside
[16:10.200 --> 16:13.840]  the Germans have pulled out as you know two months ago but they're reportedly
[16:13.840 --> 16:17.840]  French special forces and others also lazing targets on the ground for those
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.480]  that don't know what that means they're there with lasers or with GPS grid
[16:21.480 --> 16:27.960]  markers marking the hellfire missiles dropped from the drones the 2,000 pound
[16:27.960 --> 16:35.480]  bombs dropped from the F-15s and F-18s and F-16s and also GPS marking grids of
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.320]  were hidden equipment is and of course all of that was denied for months but
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.840]  is now admitted we had the intel sources confirming it before the war even
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.400]  officially started told you it was coming confirm the troops were there
[16:47.400 --> 16:54.440]  but now there's gonna be a major kickoff in July for the month of July into
[16:54.440 --> 17:00.760]  August two months of special forces getting intel on Gaddafi's force
[17:00.760 --> 17:08.440]  structure ahead of the major ground invasion and as I said 12 to 20,000
[17:08.440 --> 17:16.440]  actual troops deployed in armored columns Abrams Bradley's the Marines go in
[17:16.440 --> 17:23.400]  warrior vehicles and as many backup troops behind them this is just
[17:23.400 --> 17:29.120]  unbelievable we're looking at 20 to 30,000 troop deployment from our sources
[17:29.120 --> 17:35.480]  on that front this is very very big news and I want to give you the toll free
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.560]  number to call us if you're in the military or a family in the military if
[17:39.560 --> 17:44.720]  you can confirm or deny the intel picture that we are rapidly putting
[17:44.720 --> 17:49.040]  together only a few pieces left in the overall spectrum analysis that we're
[17:49.040 --> 17:59.000]  doing toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 of course in the
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  larger analysis there is a plan to basically send US and NATO troops into
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.240]  all of North Africa and the Middle East there is a plan to go into Syria and
[18:08.240 --> 18:13.880]  then plans to go into Iran and I can't see any way that the establishment is
[18:13.880 --> 18:19.200]  going to attempt to launch this without stage terror attacks and right on time
[18:19.200 --> 18:24.360]  we're seeing huge hype that LCI Ada is gonna attack shopping malls grocery
[18:24.360 --> 18:31.560]  stores walmarts train stations highways police stations soft targets in
[18:31.560 --> 18:38.080]  asymmetrical warfare we're seeing unbelievable hype at the same time that
[18:38.080 --> 18:42.720]  Gaddafi is going to desperately pull out his secret WMD's and use them on
[18:42.720 --> 18:46.960]  Europe and he might actually do that if he gets cornered they may not have to
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.760]  stage something but it's the same thing going in and having this needless war
[18:50.760 --> 18:53.880]  that he's gonna respond they're gonna use that to take more of our liberties
[18:53.880 --> 18:58.280]  and use that as a political smoke screen from the full-on real revolution
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.080]  happening in Europe Europe has a revolution against the private banking
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.720]  cartel a global revolt against the crony capitalist the non-free market
[19:06.720 --> 19:13.160]  actors in this planetary geopolitical system and so they every time globalists
[19:13.160 --> 19:16.360]  get in trouble every time this ruling oligarchy gets in trouble they launch
[19:16.360 --> 19:21.920]  wars knowing that you will primitively basically rally around the flag of your
[19:21.920 --> 19:26.320]  nation give up rights give up liberties accept rationing accept depression
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.880]  accept this metamorphosis towards open world government and world carbon
[19:31.880 --> 19:36.320]  taxes and forced austerity that means being poor as a political weapon against
[19:36.320 --> 19:41.760]  the middle class always the enemy of entrenched plutocrats and so we see all
[19:41.760 --> 19:46.640]  the pre-hype now beginning for the stage terror attacks and perhaps even real
[19:46.640 --> 19:50.800]  military responses that are asymmetrical guerrilla attacks they'll call
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.360]  terrorists and you can see the new order moving into high gear it looks like
[19:55.360 --> 19:59.400]  about an 85% chance they're gonna pull the trigger on all of this stand by will

[24:39.200 --> 24:42.920]  United States is in the midst of one of the greatest constitutional crises in
[24:42.920 --> 24:48.560]  our history for more than three months United States forces on the ground in
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.480]  the air have been attacking the sovereign military forces of Muammar
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.200]  Gaddafi in Libya we've been told that this is not a war but a kinetic action
[24:58.200 --> 25:04.040]  we've been told that tens of thousands of dead on both sides is a humanitarian
[25:04.040 --> 25:10.800]  operation and we were told by Obama that the action would last days not weeks
[25:10.800 --> 25:16.720]  info wars.com can now conclusively report that the date of a full ground
[25:16.720 --> 25:24.000]  invasion of Libya by U.S. military forces under NATO and UN command is set
[25:24.000 --> 25:33.000]  for October and November of 2011 just three months away larger contingents of
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  U.S. special forces are already preparing to move into the nation in mid
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.240]  July info wars.com can now report information that we've been gathering
[25:43.240 --> 25:49.040]  over the last month from multiple sources known to us inside Fort Hood, Texas
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.680]  yes I did Alex I'm actually former special operations and paramilitary
[25:53.680 --> 26:00.640]  contractor and everything you said has been 100% accurate as far as the troops
[26:00.640 --> 26:06.840]  in Libya and special ops down there in Libya and Pakistan and stuff like that
[26:06.840 --> 26:12.120]  everything you've said so far has been 100% accurate. The 1st Cavalry Division
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.920]  heavy armor and three cores are deploying to Libya the troops we've
[26:16.920 --> 26:21.240]  talked to on and off air are all extremely concerned they know that
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.160]  Congress wasn't even consulted and Obama quote use the UN's authority as the
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.560]  power to launch this new war you heard it here first America and the rest of the
[26:30.560 --> 26:36.480]  world listening a huge expansion of the war in Libya with at least 12,000
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.960]  frontline troops set to smash into Muammar Gaddafi's forces coming up in
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.040]  October and November. I'm with the Mortuary Affairs section but you know I'm
[26:48.040 --> 26:54.440]  tracking our dead fellow soldiers coming in from you know which country that they
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.720]  get killed so I'm already tracking guys from coming from Libya that are you
[27:00.720 --> 27:05.200]  know already getting killed. If we allow the escalation of this illegal war what
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.680]  comes next well we already know drone attacks in Yemen and ground invasion of
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.660]  Syria many of the troops we've talked to have been told that this will be the
[27:15.660 --> 27:20.160]  beginning of World War three and the complete occupation of North Africa the
[27:20.160 --> 27:23.880]  Middle East and Central Asia.
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.240]  Ask yourselves what are you doing in this time of great challenge? What are you
[27:31.240 --> 27:37.800]  doing to unlock mines? Go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv for the
[27:37.800 --> 27:44.040]  latest headlines and cutting-edge information. All right that is the
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.400]  special report that we cut last night and just premiered here US invasion of
[27:49.400 --> 27:56.080]  Libya set for October. Now if you look at the public statements by NATO and
[27:56.080 --> 28:00.280]  Obama now they're saying through next year and that yes ground troops maybe
[28:00.280 --> 28:04.920]  needed to assist the forces they're calling him humanitarian there's nothing
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.460]  humanitarian about the 2,000 pound bombs and the cruise missiles and the
[28:08.460 --> 28:12.760]  hellfire missiles dropped from the reapers and the predators there's
[28:12.760 --> 28:18.960]  nothing humanitarian about working with Al Qaeda, LCI, Ada there's nothing
[28:18.960 --> 28:22.840]  humanitarian this is about grabbing the biggest water supply in North Africa the
[28:22.840 --> 28:28.120]  trillions in oil and about stealing the seven plus billion that Qaddafi invested
[28:28.120 --> 28:34.520]  with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and that's the bottom line of what's going
[28:34.520 --> 28:40.200]  on and happening here. Now here's the larger issue that needs to be discussed
[28:40.200 --> 28:46.200]  Qaddafi allows quote his citizens because they're freer than some North
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.160]  African states it's certainly a dictatorship overall to have firearms
[28:50.160 --> 28:54.880]  and first he handed out a million more when the bombardment happened and since
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.680]  then they've reported several million more fully automatic weapons grenade
[28:58.680 --> 29:05.580]  launchers handed out let's say 10% of the Libyans fight in guerrilla low
[29:05.580 --> 29:10.800]  intensity conflict it will be really bad for the troops and undoubtedly thousands
[29:10.800 --> 29:20.920]  will die there will also be a resistance because Qaddafi's people are based on a
[29:20.920 --> 29:25.200]  tribal system and the tribal grids they're fighting in the east that are
[29:25.200 --> 29:29.000]  Western backed have also said they're going to be torturing and murdering and
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.840]  killing large portions of the population that's already been happening with both
[29:32.840 --> 29:38.640]  sides to some extent in tribal warfare so there will be a resistance and US
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.120]  troops will undoubtedly die in large numbers but it's okay they don't care
[29:43.120 --> 29:47.280]  about the troops and after all it's not a war because Obama said so we'd be their
[29:47.280 --> 29:53.080]  days not weeks three and a half months later. We're on the march the empires on
[29:53.080 --> 30:01.600]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five

[33:20.720 --> 33:35.200]  worldwide it's Alex Jones okay we have not confirmed this but generally when we
[33:35.200 --> 33:42.400]  get scores of phone calls something's going on and in the network's phone
[33:42.400 --> 33:46.200]  lines are full of people to the point we can hardly even get to other folks
[33:46.200 --> 33:51.160]  calls saying why aren't you covering a nuclear meltdown in Nebraska and I just
[33:51.160 --> 33:55.000]  heard about this about two minutes ago and so I searched nuclear meltdown
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.440]  Nebraska and I got new six Fort Calhoun flood defenses and it says the Fort
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.400]  Calhoun nuclear facility is an island right now but as one of the authorities
[34:07.400 --> 34:11.880]  say is going to stay dry they say they have a number of redundant features to
[34:11.880 --> 34:16.640]  protect the facility from floodwaters that include the Aqua dam earthen berms
[34:16.640 --> 34:20.480]  and sandbags so I think this is just a bunch of hype and that there's a flood
[34:20.480 --> 34:23.560]  going on and people are saying this but listeners are saying why aren't you
[34:23.560 --> 34:34.280]  covering it and I type it in and all I find out is stuff about Fukushima so I
[34:34.280 --> 34:39.360]  mean it's kind of like on why 2k was on ABC news that a missile had been fired
[34:39.360 --> 34:42.680]  from Russia on ABC news and everybody calls it why aren't you covering I said
[34:42.680 --> 34:46.680]  okay they're reporting ABC news missile fired it's like you made up a missile was
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.520]  fired I'm like no it was on ABC news and then they said oh it was just a drill
[34:51.520 --> 34:57.560]  that the NORAD and the Russians were running as a joint friendship operation
[34:57.560 --> 35:06.600]  so it was once some weird psi-op they did but I can find nothing here there's
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.120]  a business insider report talking about airspace closed over flooded Nebraska
[35:11.120 --> 35:17.200]  nuclear power plant so there's that I really can't news gather my shelf while
[35:17.200 --> 35:22.640]  I'm live on air but they put this URL in because the link's not working for
[35:22.640 --> 35:27.520]  whatever reason here and I'll try to find out what's going on with that airspace
[35:27.520 --> 35:31.920]  over flooded Nebraska nuclear power plant still closed and this was last
[35:31.920 --> 35:37.240]  night business insider usually a pretty good source it says then a stupid ad
[35:37.240 --> 35:43.320]  just launched on here excuse me folks a fire in Nebraska's Fort Calhoun nuclear
[35:43.320 --> 35:48.000]  power plant briefly knocked out the cooling process for spent fuel rods
[35:48.000 --> 35:55.200]  wow and that is a link to the report I guess listeners are right is it just
[35:55.200 --> 35:59.040]  me or is all hell breaking most every day now they had that Canadian nuclear
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.440]  power plant dump tens of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water in
[36:03.440 --> 36:06.920]  and the media said it was no big deal they said well make the lake 20 times
[36:06.920 --> 36:11.600]  or more radioactive than it should be but Canada's raise what they say the safe
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.280]  levels are so everything's fine yeah turns out we were right months ago three
[36:16.280 --> 36:20.240]  of the six plants at Fukushima did completely melt down and blow up each
[36:20.240 --> 36:25.360]  one many times worse than Chernobyl because the plants are bigger and one
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.520]  was a plutonium based system and oh my gosh those radiation 7,500 times safe
[36:30.520 --> 36:37.960]  levels but everything's fine I just got dizzy for a minute just all this
[36:37.960 --> 36:40.880]  craziness happening it just got overwhelming and I didn't get chills
[36:40.880 --> 36:46.240]  just now actually just got dizzy I gotta I gotta get out of here there must
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.760]  be some kind of way out of here like Jimi Hendrix says in the watchtower all
[36:51.760 --> 36:57.920]  along the watchtower a fire in Nebraska's Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant
[36:57.920 --> 37:02.560]  briefly knocked out cooling processes for spent nuclear fuel rods Matt will
[37:02.560 --> 37:08.440]  you post a link to this and then also to the pro-publica report and it goes on
[37:08.440 --> 37:13.920]  the fire occurred June 7th so we never heard about this and knocked out cooling
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.200]  for approximately 90 minutes after 88 hours the cooling pool would boil dry
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.400]  and highly radioactive material would be exposed on June 6th the Federal
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.000]  Administration of Aviation FAA issued a directive banning aircraft from
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.240]  entering the airspace with a two-mile radius of the plant no pilots may
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.320]  operate the aircraft in the area covered by this N-O-T-A-M they've got a link to
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.600]  the FAA statement remember what happened in CME Valley back in the 50s they had
[37:41.600 --> 37:45.600]  a sodium nuke plant blow up and they kept it secret for decades and it was
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.680]  worse than Hiroshima and the amount of radiation it released a lot more than
[37:50.680 --> 37:57.120]  that Chernobyl's 500 times Hiroshima or Nakasaki since last week the plant has
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.160]  been under a notification of unusual event notice you know you think the
[38:01.160 --> 38:04.400]  alternative media be able to pick up on this turns out this happened over a
[38:04.400 --> 38:08.760]  week and a half ago and we just now learn about it I'm gonna print all
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.280]  these articles here you see I've got all this other big war news I want to get
[38:12.280 --> 38:17.520]  into and all the other news and this stuff is unfolding but I'm I'm printing
[38:17.520 --> 38:24.520]  all these articles right now here's the FAA press release get that printed yep
[38:24.520 --> 38:28.640]  that's what they're saying it's shut down can't fly over it because it's so
[38:28.640 --> 38:35.200]  good for you now I don't know if it's a meltdown as people are saying but it
[38:35.200 --> 38:43.520]  sounds pretty darn bad electrical fire knocks out spent fuel cooling at
[38:43.520 --> 38:52.120]  Nebraska plant guys get me Paul Watson right now on air please let's go ahead
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.960]  and dial in put him up with me right now I'll have him do this okay so there you
[38:58.960 --> 39:06.280]  go ladies and gentlemen we'll probably need to do a news report basically
[39:06.280 --> 39:09.880]  saying that there have been two nuclear disasters in North America in the last
[39:09.880 --> 39:17.720]  three months that no one is even covering all right I'll stop news
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.680]  gathering here live on air while we get Watson and then I'll have to reset and
[39:21.680 --> 39:28.440]  go back into the big story here ground invasion of Libya that's our intel from
[39:28.440 --> 39:36.480]  Fort Hood and from sent com folks in Georgia and others that that is on with
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.240]  special forces increasing their presence starting in July and then full-on
[39:40.240 --> 39:46.840]  invasion September into October and so we will continue to break all of that
[39:46.840 --> 39:56.800]  down continuing with this information my friends we'll go to some of your phone
[39:56.800 --> 40:03.880]  calls here if you're in the military and want to be able to give us some
[40:03.880 --> 40:10.640]  comments on this let's go to Colonel six in Texas who's called before Colonel six
[40:10.640 --> 40:16.280]  what can you tell us about the three core and the first cavalry under it
[40:16.280 --> 40:21.400]  reportedly parts of that set to start moving in in September October before
[40:21.400 --> 40:27.320]  going to that actually me just say something that I talked with you last
[40:27.320 --> 40:34.240]  year and I told you in March that that McCrister was on his way out and then
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.800]  July or June he was actually fired that's right nobody was talking about that at
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.080]  the time you even said that before the Rolling Stones he's came out
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.840]  exactly I knew about the Rolling Stone piece and I've been trying to get in
[40:46.840 --> 40:52.480]  touch with you to tell you about this and some other things ever since then I'd
[40:52.480 --> 41:00.800]  like to direct people to look at colonel six dot com and look at one aspect of
[41:00.800 --> 41:07.800]  things that have been happening is the scandal that has be plagued the Ohio
[41:07.800 --> 41:13.840]  Army National Guard you can also find that at before it's news dot com before
[41:13.840 --> 41:18.280]  it's news I understand but but but sir tell us specifically about the issue of
[41:18.280 --> 41:24.160]  the ground invasion in September October since May
[41:24.160 --> 41:32.040]  Marines and Special Forces have been in Libya Yemen Syria doing and when they
[41:32.040 --> 41:36.880]  called laser any work that's what that is is you're on late you think guys do
[41:36.880 --> 41:43.000]  stand on the road doing surveys I need to survey property and they use lasers
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.320]  with the now it's the same deals to get distances from from one point to
[41:47.320 --> 41:54.040]  another I don't think it's going to be that long I think it's going to be in
[41:54.040 --> 42:01.240]  fact I am pretty certain let me just say that that it won't be that long and we're
[42:01.240 --> 42:08.280]  looking at the end of September your October November windows is good but I
[42:08.280 --> 42:16.800]  can tell you that this is good this is World War three and that General
[42:16.800 --> 42:22.320]  Gould was was right on yesterday and saying the things that he said and the
[42:22.320 --> 42:25.800]  guys that called in said you know the young man to call from the mortuary
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.920]  services is exactly correct and I bet if he calls back in today he'll tell you
[42:29.920 --> 42:36.880]  that 10 more came through last night Wow well yes sir I don't want to get into
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.480]  all of my sources but that's what they're saying and that basically the
[42:41.480 --> 42:47.040]  the third core and the first cavalry will only be used if several thousand
[42:47.040 --> 42:52.160]  special forces from the Marines in the army and the Navy reportedly aren't
[42:52.160 --> 42:56.280]  able to bring him down that it's basically the decision is he will be
[42:56.280 --> 42:59.920]  removed whatever is needed will be used and the only way there won't be a full
[42:59.920 --> 43:06.240]  on-ground invasion with you know heavy armor directly going into Tripoli is if
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.320]  Gaddafi gives up or is killed that's why they're trying to assassinate him but
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.760]  what I want to expand on here with you is if he's handed out millions of fire
[43:14.760 --> 43:18.960]  arms and grenade launchers and other weapons and his population North
[43:18.960 --> 43:22.480]  Africans statistically are going to fight a lot harder than what we've seen in
[43:22.480 --> 43:26.960]  some of the other areas in that region that it's going to be very hazardous to
[43:26.960 --> 43:30.960]  the military personnel that go into there and the Gaddafi undoubtedly has
[43:30.960 --> 43:35.440]  stored a lot of chemical and biologicals and that those similar things were
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.440]  destroyed in 1991 and our and the chemical detectors went off but they
[43:39.440 --> 43:43.240]  just told the troops false alarm don't worry and then just didn't give him
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.040]  treatment and tens of thousands have died of course from exposure since then
[43:47.040 --> 43:50.080]  to it and so there's a good chance that they're not going to have the stage
[43:50.080 --> 43:56.000]  terror attacks Gaddafi may attack Europe you know we know he's got stay
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.800]  behind networks in place and so it'll be real terrorism and if he had
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.360]  able to do it they'll just stage it for him as a as a pretext what's your take
[44:05.360 --> 44:09.560]  on that statement let me tell you this first of all individuals need to
[44:09.560 --> 44:12.960]  understand that and you'd like to see you go through colonel six dot comment
[44:12.960 --> 44:16.320]  I'm not really trying to hide but you but I've been telling the story has been
[44:16.320 --> 44:22.280]  going along okay and I talk about how many projects China has going on in
[44:22.280 --> 44:28.240]  Libya okay from the building different sorts of no that's on record so yeah
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.320]  I mean so but I'm showing people that let me tell you something Libya is not
[44:34.320 --> 44:40.800]  Iraq okay and Gaddafi has all of Africa behind him he has Kosovo and the
[44:40.800 --> 44:45.720]  suburbs the people Muslims out of it Europe behind him he's got China behind
[44:45.720 --> 44:56.080]  him and he also has Iran and the some other of the the countries there in
[44:56.080 --> 45:01.440]  that region and I would I wouldn't bet that now especially after yesterday
[45:01.440 --> 45:06.560]  Pakistan and Afghanistan may be behind him because you know the thing is is
[45:06.560 --> 45:14.880]  that you over the months Karzai has asked big pleaded told him quit bombing our
[45:14.880 --> 45:19.560]  people you know he said he wanted to go out you know and only want to say
[45:19.560 --> 45:29.040]  anything smart was Gates Gates said if I were you know any future Secretary of
[45:29.040 --> 45:33.400]  State that tells his president to go into North Africa or the Middle East need
[45:33.400 --> 45:38.280]  to have his head examined and so put so eloquent by the general well he also
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.680]  came out last week and said that NATO that the US may have to leave NATO and
[45:43.680 --> 45:49.200]  that NATO may be basically destroyed in this Libya operation and I know you've
[45:49.200 --> 45:53.320]  given us really good information in the past Colonel six with your military
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.400]  contacts and I know what a year ago you said you were about to get out but you
[45:56.400 --> 46:03.000]  still have those contacts but specifically you're saying well what
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.920]  we're hearing from current military people that this is meant to become a
[46:06.920 --> 46:10.840]  giant regional conflict that then grows into World War three is that what
[46:10.840 --> 46:16.720]  you're saying exactly what it is and you go back you look and you see where the
[46:16.720 --> 46:27.640]  general over over AFRICOM I forget his name has said a while back that we need
[46:27.640 --> 46:35.440]  we may need to send troops into Libya one thing about it is is that Dr. Gates
[46:35.440 --> 46:41.040]  said that they wouldn't go in while he was in office he's about to leave office
[46:41.040 --> 46:49.720]  so that is something that can be I mean use a man of his words but I can't
[46:49.720 --> 46:52.400]  remember that general's name I'm gonna look forward and I'm gonna post it well
[46:52.400 --> 46:56.160]  Colonel six we got to jump to Felix and others that are holding from Texas with
[46:56.160 --> 47:03.000]  this continued confirmation that 1st Cavalry and under the 3rd Corps is
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.880]  going in but specifically do you have any information on those specific groups
[47:07.880 --> 47:15.520]  3 Corps is going to be the the head group to go in as the army but as you
[47:15.520 --> 47:20.000]  know if you see the the history of how we go into it the Marines will go in
[47:20.000 --> 47:27.600]  first and they're gonna be slaughtered to tell you to because there's things
[47:27.600 --> 47:35.360]  that Gaddafi has under his hat that people don't know about and he is a
[47:35.360 --> 47:42.640]  master at warfare has been for years and he is a threat there's not to be taken
[47:42.640 --> 47:46.040]  lightly and I'm gonna tell you something this whole thing is behind
[47:46.040 --> 47:52.080]  Brother Sconey and the guy that came before David Cameron Blair and Bush
[47:52.080 --> 48:00.120]  getting a lot of dirty deals done with Gaddafi him deciding not to go through
[48:00.120 --> 48:05.760]  with it anymore and you know in the gets in the gets all their fuel from
[48:05.760 --> 48:11.680]  Libya so for them to be flying sorties along with the British and have the
[48:11.680 --> 48:16.000]  British drag them into a slaughter is absolutely stupid but you will be
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.080]  start seeing that they won't be able to hide that these people are coming home
[48:20.080 --> 48:24.000]  and I'm gonna tell you something somebody from those fields that got killed on
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.320]  that raid it didn't go down somebody's wife mother and cousin brother is gonna
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.080]  come forth and break the break it that they hadn't heard from Mike since you
[48:35.080 --> 48:40.480]  know that day and you're talking about oh yeah what's the scuttlebutt on the
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.520]  because the stuff we're now getting from multiple sources is they sent the seals
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.240]  into a dummy house blew the helicopter with them up in it and that it was a
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.480]  special secret team within seal team six is that what you're being told yes
[48:53.480 --> 48:59.120]  it is and and that the day crashed they didn't blow the helicopter up they
[48:59.120 --> 49:06.120]  crashed and they were killed the people on board the helicopters are killed
[49:06.120 --> 49:10.680]  numerous people not you know the pilot and co-pilot and you know numerous of
[49:10.680 --> 49:15.480]  the fields that were on there were a boy were killed so all of this is like I
[49:15.480 --> 49:20.000]  say come six dot com you go through it you know I understand listen you've
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.880]  always given us great info thank you for the call I'm gonna bring Watson up
[49:22.880 --> 49:26.960]  briefly on another issue we're gonna come back with Felix and others but it's
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.480]  on folks huge ground invasion of Libya and it is gonna be a slaughterhouse on
[49:32.480 --> 49:36.640]  both sides but hey it's not a war Obama said so and Wiener didn't send that
[49:36.640 --> 49:41.160]  photo it's all right by its fault because the government told you so and
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.880]  they're good people Watson sorry keep on hold while that was going on we have

[49:53.760 --> 50:01.480]  to sniff it out right now that at Fort Calhoun nuclear generating station back
[50:01.480 --> 50:07.200]  on June 6th that's confirmed there was an electrical fire and some explosions
[50:07.200 --> 50:11.880]  and they were worried about a meltdown now today and last night they're
[50:11.880 --> 50:15.840]  reporting a flood in the area and they're battling to keep the facility from
[50:15.840 --> 50:19.680]  being flooded there's floods in that area and there's photographs of the
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.240]  facility with water all around it and it looks like flooding into it from

[53:05.440 --> 53:09.480]  bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.800]  currency and a new World Bank to act as savior but we've only seen the beginning
[53:13.800 --> 53:17.520]  their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern
[53:17.520 --> 53:21.640]  times shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land
[53:21.640 --> 53:25.640]  the insiders have discovered that they must control two things to cease total
[53:25.640 --> 53:30.000]  power phase one is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to

[54:04.400 --> 54:09.760]  okay jaren back on june 7th the day after this first started it put it in my
[54:09.760 --> 54:13.120]  stack and I never saw it or didn't get to it but he went pulled it out of the
[54:13.120 --> 54:17.440]  stack in there and gave it to me I don't know why our phone systems being
[54:17.440 --> 54:21.680]  flooded genesis phones systems being flooded because yeah it appears that
[54:21.680 --> 54:25.360]  there that there was it's confirmed there was a fire they were worried about
[54:25.360 --> 54:31.400]  that if it melted down there could be explosions back in on June 6th and 7th
[54:31.400 --> 54:36.960]  and there was a fire an electrical switch room on Tuesday briefly knocked out
[54:36.960 --> 54:42.080]  cooling for a pool holding spent fuel at the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant outside
[54:42.080 --> 54:50.000]  home of Nebraska now I've got Fort Calhoun flood defense with wot.com
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.360]  News 6 out of Fort Calhoun saying that the flood waters are rising and I've
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.240]  gone through all these articles online I see photos here in the business insider
[54:59.240 --> 55:04.640]  of it surrounded by water and they're trying to put in more sandbags so people
[55:04.640 --> 55:06.960]  calling it saying there's been a meltdown there's no evidence of that and
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.280]  no evidence of explosions though I found a bunch of websites saying that with a
[55:10.280 --> 55:16.600]  search but they haven't confirmed it so again I would normally think everything's
[55:16.600 --> 55:21.000]  okay but you have the Simi Valley thing in the 50s where it blew up and they
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.080]  covered it up for decades and was a total meltdown the sodium reactor and
[55:25.080 --> 55:28.640]  then you had what three months ago or two and a half months ago the whole
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.200]  problem and radioactive release up in Canada and that was not even on the
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.640]  radar screen and they told us that the situation was wonderful and fine and
[55:37.640 --> 55:42.200]  nothing and melted down in Japan when we saw reactors blowing sky-high and now
[55:42.200 --> 55:45.800]  we know that's indeed what happened we had nuclear engineers and others here
[55:45.800 --> 55:48.920]  confirming then they picked up the different radioactive isotopes and
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.320]  knowing that it meant massive fission explosions had taken place that's now
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.960]  confirmed after it's off the radar that the establishment admits it but we'll
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.760]  continue to look at this Watson do you have any comments on this situation
[56:02.760 --> 56:18.440]  well that's the concern is it is an island in the waters rising up right to
[56:18.440 --> 56:22.120]  the edges and there's a danger of flooding some say water is getting in
[56:22.120 --> 56:25.760]  but that's similar what happened with the tsunami but this won't be 20 feet of
[56:25.760 --> 56:29.360]  water smashing equipment so hopefully everything will be all right but how do
[56:29.360 --> 56:34.240]  we trust the feds to tell us if something has happened Paul
[56:34.240 --> 56:38.960]  well I'm sure we can trust them Alex it's not why they really ignored the
[56:38.960 --> 56:43.920]  radiation threat from Fukushima and nearly raised the safe level to make
[56:43.920 --> 56:48.480]  people stop worrying about it Paul shifting gears let's just investigate
[56:48.480 --> 56:51.960]  this let's put out a call for investigation you know what the world's
[56:51.960 --> 56:58.120]  going on at the nuclear plant and in Nebraska fire and flooding what we need
[56:58.120 --> 57:01.360]  to get some state people in there that are more trustworthy on average other
[57:01.360 --> 57:06.280]  than the feds now so they're listeners you flooded us I've looked into it we
[57:06.280 --> 57:09.680]  don't know what's happening so we'll try to figure it out briefly as I go to
[57:09.680 --> 57:12.680]  break and go back with our military callers what do you make of all these
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.800]  confirmations and we know the US troops are there but they're building up the
[57:16.800 --> 57:23.440]  numbers I had a full invasion with the third core and first cavalry I mean
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.600]  they've sent marines in there before there was a report that they were sending thousands
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.800]  of marines in months ago there were already special forces on the ground in
[57:32.800 --> 57:38.920]  March before they even announced the no-fly zone and of course our Bilderberg
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.880]  last week the Tucker and also a doing South Boots you were saying that there
[57:43.880 --> 57:47.720]  could be a massive war in the Middle East I'll be which he said that Bilderberg
[57:47.720 --> 57:54.200]  hit an agenda towards Syria would make itself visible and that's our Monday
[57:54.200 --> 57:58.680]  and then lo and behold three days later you've got warships heading towards the
[57:58.680 --> 58:06.440]  Syrian coast as they prepare for this intervention Watson you're gonna be on
[58:06.440 --> 58:12.880]  with us tomorrow and so we look forward to you joining us also Aaron Dykes to
[58:12.880 --> 58:15.680]  cover the wide spectrum of what's happening but also break some new
[58:15.680 --> 58:18.840]  Bilderberg news and information here today by the way we now have the full
[58:18.840 --> 58:23.200]  Bilderberg agenda from our sources that article by Curtin MO very lengthy went

[58:31.400 --> 58:34.800]  World War three I'd say that most of our attention now needs to shift towards
[58:34.800 --> 58:38.080]  that and the stage terror attacks they're gonna use to kick it off thank you

[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:40.240]  lied about us and British forces crawling all over the ground in Libya
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.760]  since before the war started three months ago that's now been confirmed by
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.440]  western press months after we documented it and we've had our sources of the
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.480]  military we've also been tracking down and confirming that us forces at least
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:56.720]  two us army officers our members of the army have been killed and three
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.880]  contractors and that the first cavalry division under the third core out of
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:06.600]  Fort Hood is set to invade in late September and early October and to go
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.160]  directly into Tripoli the Marines are there remember two and a half months
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.800]  ago the Marine Corps commander at a base said yes we're getting on ships and
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.160]  going we're invading and it was and then later they corrected and said well he
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.840]  misspoke he was just honest we're loading up we're going over there get
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.000]  them first you know last to know first to go first to go last to know however
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.280]  you say it so there you have it and we're taking your calls if you're in the
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.600]  military and confirm this or give us the scuttlebot but our reports are at
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.520]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com us invasion of Libya set for October Felix
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:47.240]  in Texas you're on the air go ahead yeah what's going on Alex hey buddy so
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.720]  what's the information so it is first to go last to know and scuttlebot for all
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.000]  you people that don't know it's just you know talk around the water cooler
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.560]  basically in the military anyway I work up in Colleen a lot of my customers
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.640]  obviously they're military I'm former Marine I got some rapport and I'm an
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.080]  info warrior so I keep my mouth open and and I talk to these people and yeah
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.320]  we're going dude I mean it's semantics at this point when Clinton gives away all
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.400]  our ports you know 20 years ago or whatever it was I mean all everything
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.120]  we're talking about now it's semantics I mean our country's been hijacked we're
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.400]  waking up as a dead nation and I just hope that I think that what this is
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.000]  going to do is spark the revolution worldwide but it's also going to
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.640]  accelerate their their plan for total war so they can hopefully come out on the
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.600]  other side after the thermonuclear war has been conducted and then they can
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.120]  start their their their society or whatever they want to do but how did
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.480]  that keynote speak go I'm real curious about what you did there we're gonna we're
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.160]  gonna we're gonna get it out in the next few days it's like a 30 minute
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.880]  speech so we've got to get it dumped from two cameras and encoded and
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.400]  everything we've been busy dealing with the world war three news and the video
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.160]  we put together last night that I premiered here earlier but it should be
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:12.000]  out by tomorrow in fact if do can get it out by tomorrow we might air excerpts of
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.440]  it or parts of it here on the show tomorrow but we'll leave that up to Rob
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:24.720]  do and play that by ear but he's in there editing it together right now
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.200]  I just hope you just you know nail them right between the eyes when I did no way
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.160]  I mean they said hey we want to put you on the cover of the magazine which has
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.880]  probably gotten us 30 affiliates and since it came out two months ago it's
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.640]  really really is prestigious and you know limbaugh has been the keynote
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.080]  speaker there before Sean Hannity was there and I mean it is the insiders
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.600]  it's kind of the Bilderberg group meeting of talk radio that's what they said look
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.800]  who's coming to dinner like this Sydney pointy a movie you know where the black
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.200]  guy comes to the white girl's dinner that's kind of the like you know that
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.880]  you know the bad guy the outsiders coming to dinner and a lot of them didn't
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.840]  like me I'd say 65 percent were were supportive but some were very you know
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.280]  very disgusted by what I had to say but I tried to be positive with them they
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.720]  really wanted me to give them some magic widget or you know some way of why I was
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.640]  so successful and I explained to them I'm not even the smartest guy in the
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.920]  world don't have all the answers I've tried every different venue I could to
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.680]  get the word out that's why we dominate on so many fronts and I said that you
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.720]  know the bottom line is tell the truth be bold decide what side you're on all
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.480]  of you are expendable and I saw former Congressman JD Hayworth and I talked to
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.720]  a lot of Fox News people you know the behind the scenes are like we agree
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.040]  with you but it was it was very very interesting and I appreciate talkers

[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.880]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.920]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.800]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:24.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.520]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.440]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.800]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:31.680]  Alex Jones okay we've had panic calls the office today and yesterday and so is
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.640]  the network and we really dug into this whole nuclear plant situation and if
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.920]  you believe government there's no problem and I think is that folks don't
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.400]  believe government was even caught lying so much but nuclear Nebraska plant
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.400]  was under alert this is out of CNN back on June 8th that there was a fire and
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.240]  now there's flooding in the area and they're worried that it could flood but
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.000]  I really don't need to get radiation readings from the area but I just think
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.400]  this is a bunch of hype airspace over flooded Nebraska nuclear power plants
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.120]  still closed and that's looks like it's a technical thing they always do and they
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.720]  have a basic emergency there w o w t tv is reporting but we'll look at it we'll
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.920]  watch it and see what's what's happening there but it could be bad I mean
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:26.880]  government lies so much who knows okay we've got joining us from Athens Greece
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.200]  Max Kaiser and he also has another gentleman with him who reportedly
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.280]  filed suit against Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan for colluding with Popindray
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.880]  off and Popindray off is now saying the leader of Greece that he first he was
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.280]  gonna step down this morning now he's putting forward a new cabinet of new
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.840]  puppets and then may later step down there is riding all over the country the
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:55.080]  vast majority on record the money owed that the people are supposedly have to
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.760]  have their taxes raised and their social security type checks cut and their
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:05.240]  pensions cut the majority of that is not owed by them but their government
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.760]  induced by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan just like our government has signed on
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.520]  to the debts just like the Irish government and the Portuguese government and Germany
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.600]  is predominantly is forced to then as the wealthiest country in Europe the only
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.320]  one that's not completely deindustrialized to to finance all of this and it
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.080]  goes right to the private banks just like they've done in third world
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:34.560]  countries so this is crony capitalism and later in the next hour I'm gonna get
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.240]  into just one example of crony capitalism and I'm asking my producers
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.800]  really stay on me when I say I'm gonna cover something make sure I cover
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.640]  formula one and how that empire was built through crony capitalism it's
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.840]  similar to the billion dollar and eight hundred million dollar with the cowboy
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:57.280]  stadium over a billion dollars paid for by taxpayer money and then the owners
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.960]  make millions in profits of your money they're like well it helps the economy
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.080]  well what if it would have already succeeded and help the economy you pay
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.400]  for it I didn't get government money to start my operation I don't get
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.440]  government money I don't get your tax money I'm offended by that we're going
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.200]  back to your calls here in a moment but I'm gonna break this down into tell
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.520]  next hour because I'm really angry about this and what illustrated it for me
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.840]  yesterday as I was getting online I saw Yahoo news story I did some research on
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.480]  it and the daughter of the guy who is set to get 250 million but you look at
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.640]  the contracts it could be double that and generally these stadiums and race
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.320]  tracks are about double some stadiums you've seen examples where it's three
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.600]  times but but let's just say it's 250 million and the biggest piece of it's
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.640]  from Travis County where I live well now I live right outside Travis County
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.680]  technically but my office pays to these slime bags for abortions everything
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.480]  else I'm tempted to move my operation out of here only county in Texas where I
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.680]  got to pay for people to get their abortions my money for the stinkin
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.320]  hospital district your money by supporting my broadcast goes to these
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.760]  stinkers but side issue they just passed that last year it's just it's
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.600]  outrageous now you heard about the the most expensive house in America a
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  mansion 57,000 square feet 22 year old girl racing heiress her mommy died she
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:26.920]  got four billion dollars of daddy's 23 billion dollars four billion dollars and
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.960]  she owns two houses totaling in value more than 200 million but the one house
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:39.820]  was 150 million Aaron Spelling's home 50,000 square foot mansion and there it
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:45.040]  is right there this guy is going to get 250 million conservatively of my money
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.200]  of your money of your a Texan he's done this all over Europe I looked him up
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.960]  well no wonder he's got a profitable sport but on top of it I've got to build
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:00.720]  him a track and the giant hotel complex I'm angry ladies and gentlemen my
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.600]  property taxes go up and up and up and part of that's going to go through this
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:10.440]  fund to him and if I don't pay my property taxes they will take my home I
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.440]  don't really own my home in America we have property taxes the last 50 years or
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.160]  so in most states and if I don't pay it it goes up and up and up housing markets
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.600]  down to matter goes up try to go contest it they don't care up and up and up and
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.380]  up and up and up and up and up and up and and and I don't really own my
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.440]  property it's a rent I pay the government and then if I didn't pay that
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.240]  property tax they would sell my house in the courthouse steps and then if I
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.600]  didn't leave my house the deputies would call a SWAT team and they'd kill me
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.040]  dead in the hammer so think about that in America I will be murdered you will
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:53.400]  be murdered by paramilitary police if you don't pay for the formula one race
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.920]  track and all the rest of it and the three million dollars they want for a
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.840]  private contractor to shut down major roads in Austin and make you rent bikes
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.800]  from the government the way 30 pounds a piece that nobody's gonna use and the
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.280]  capital Metro with all its scams and literally no one riding it and now they
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.360]  want to shut down major roads all over Austin and put trains on it when we're
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.520]  set up to not be able to use it people like well why it fails everywhere why
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.080]  are they doing it because they're getting paid off openly Austin's so
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.440]  corrupt that former city council people mayors and others that stole tens of
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.920]  thousands acres from ranchers wouldn't let them build on it for a decade then
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.120]  forced them to sell for pennies on the dollar adverse possession they turn
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.640]  around take restrictions off hotels golf courses million dollar for ten million
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.680]  dollar homes just totally lavish and they all publicly get the money and if
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.960]  you don't like it SWAT teams are standing by literally why do we need
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.640]  sending photos out doesn't care they don't care they don't care and okay I'm
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:56.560]  already doing the rant it's just that I'm gonna cover it next hour it really
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.320]  hit me driving home last night about six o'clock it really hit me hard it's like
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.200]  wow this is what tyranny is it's just corruption it's people that have given
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:10.640]  into it and there's no into it this woman buys a 250 million dollar house and
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.400]  if she'd have gotten that by developing a new energy system or writing books or
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.960]  or or making movies you know whatever long people bought it as long as I didn't
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.080]  have to finance it but no I went and researched these people months ago with
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.640]  this formula one and found out all over they get taxpayer money to finance them
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:35.600]  of course baby daughter 22 gets four billion smackers and large portions of
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:41.160]  it is taxpayer money from Europe and now Texas that's who we're fighting and
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.200]  these people go buy politicians for a few million and they get billions and
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.360]  and and and that's why they have the police state it's in it's in place to
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.240]  make sure they get away with all of this and I'm sick of it but something's
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.720]  gonna happen the same thing we're seeing and then I'm going to Felix the same
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.640]  thing we're seeing right now in Europe in in Spain and what we saw in Iceland
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.200]  they rioted the Icelanders rioted and took over government buildings
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.120]  peacefully for a full year off and on their police finally joined them and
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.800]  they went and finally got the books kicked out the economics minister they've
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.120]  been told it was all debt they owed 90 plus percent just like Ireland just like
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.560]  Greece 90 plus percent of the money that their government said they owed was not
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.960]  even their debt and was the debt of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and the
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:34.720]  private banking ministers running their country of 400,000 people what is
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.880]  Iceland is well I think it's less than 400 though they pull up population
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.520]  Iceland please I believe it's right at 400 thou got a double check here got a
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.360]  double check got a double check now it's a little brain game you got to get
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:51.520]  smarter folks you got to get aware you got a that always scan for data and they
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.200]  found out they didn't owe it and they said go fly a kite and then the British
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.760]  government declared them a terrorist nation and began seizing Icelanders this
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.680]  is a year ago private bank accounts and is now trying to sue government
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.960]  officials that have been elected doing their job you know you don't owe it
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:14.800]  Britain is a piratical criminal group sucking off their own people 319,000
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.680]  that may be an old number I think the little one the latest census is their
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.200]  population's gone up as close to 400 thou that was the headline I saw Iceland's
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.760]  population approaching 400 thou but doesn't matter 319 thou so they're now
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.360]  rioting all over Greece and the police for the last year would beat them in the
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.080]  heads up but now the cops have been told yeah your pay is gonna be cut by about
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.480]  half and you're not gonna get your pension fund you dirty welfare recipient
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.480]  the cops are like I'm not a welfare recipient I paid into that stinking
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.800]  pension that's why 20% of my check in there every week you wait police in
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.960]  America till they take your mommy's house you wait till they cut your pension
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:59.800]  just wait decide what side you're on now okay period they got this fake
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.080]  libertarian thing that oh we're gonna cut government folks I'm all for cutting
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.280]  welfare and cutting the illegals off and all that but you didn't matter you get
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.640]  rid of all that you get rid of all the big government entitlements all of it
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.880]  it won't fix this debt black hole for every stinking dollar that's created or
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.120]  every euro that's created a dollar of debt is created to these banking families
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.880]  there's only eight families we've published reports and info wars dot com
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.520]  documenting it okay this is a Bernie made-off Ken lay type group that took
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.600]  over the whole world through fraud and if you don't wake up with their fraud
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.040]  and say no nothing's gonna get better nothing's ever gonna change it's only
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.520]  gonna get worse okay they're not gonna stop George Washington said the level
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.520]  of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you allow it's real simple
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.040]  if you let criminals run wild if you let Obama launch wars without congressional
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.280]  approval and let me tell you that was an evil war with Iraq but they got
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.960]  congressional approval it was not treason it was illegal because they lied to go
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.200]  to war but the point is is that even Dennis Cassinage came out and praised
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.280]  Bush yesterday George W. Bush said at least he went and got congressional
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.440]  authorization Obama got you in authorization I'm gonna come back go
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.560]  to Felix who's out at Fort Hood I want to hear from other troops about this

[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:52.400]  us and there's so many ethnic groups that don't have representation that
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.360]  don't know the knowledge that we know we need to keep spreading the word with
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:01.160]  more voices we need to keep getting out there I live in Austin I go to Colleen
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.480]  and I work and I hand out films and I talk to soldiers and I tell them I'm
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.680]  just like you you know you know we've confirmed from the documents but we
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.600]  constantly get calls that in the army the Marines this goes back over a decade
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.880]  they come in and tell them don't listen to Alex Jones even when people aren't
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.000]  listening and that it's the demonization briefings that are actually getting the
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.680]  military to tune in how dumb are these globalists well I'll tell you what you
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.800]  know I'm 30 yeah they're stupid I'm 38 years old man I took an oath when I was
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.120]  you know 18 17 and I was like yeah whatever I don't know I just want to
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.280]  you know be that guy on the poster and go kill people you know whatever but you
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.880]  know obviously you grow and you mature and and now looking back at it that oath
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.480]  means more to me now 38 than it did when I was 18 and I'm just trying to tell
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.800]  people it means something you look around you look at your children your
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:57.280]  children are going to grow up in a we're already in martial law and I can say
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.400]  that because when someone declares martial law only that president can
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.480]  undeclare it okay and you don't need to go to the Congress at that point you can
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.920]  go to the UN and that's exactly what this is an evidence of the martial law is
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.640]  that he did you know surpass our car you're right and he's telling Congress
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.080]  look look it's evidence of martial law that an FBI agent can't stick their hand
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.560]  on your pants but the TSA can and now that it's evidence of martial law the
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.520]  FBI issues a new manual this week not a law saying they can break in your house

[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:25.720]  yeah Alex I'm overlooking Constitution Square right now in Athens you can see
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.320]  my shoulder here the people that are gathered in front of the parliament
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:34.520]  building demanding that the current leadership resigned in the wake of all
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.520]  these massive financial scandals and banking scandals the current government
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:43.760]  was caught committing high treason by trading with the enemy and the credit
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:49.960]  default swap market and now they want to seek retribution and last night you
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.800]  should have seen it Alex it was quite exciting the place erupted in a full
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.720]  scale revolutionary spirit our hotel was pelted with bricks they were ripping
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.560]  bricks up off the pavement they were throwing them at the hotel our window
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.320]  downstairs was smashed we were huddled on the seventh floor of the building here
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.960]  as the mob which is infiltrated by anarchists and of course these were
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:20.280]  anarchist actually policemen dressed up as anarchists to try to create a false
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.720]  anarchy movement and by the way you're not just saying that national TV a year
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:32.600]  ago a year ago was on national Greek TV that special police units were dressed
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:37.600]  up as anarchists breaking windows of middle-class people to turn them against
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.120]  the overall movement so that's been confirmed yeah you're not just saying
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.120]  that in Greece the government's been caught there as they have in the US and
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.840]  Canada and England provocaturing please continue Max Kaiser yeah we got footage
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.520]  exclusive footage of the the the fake anarchist the agent provocateurs right
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.320]  underneath our building which we're holding on to right now until we leave
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:03.280]  the country because we got some faces on the on screen we'll be sharing that
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.360]  once we're out of town but they were infiltrating the crowd they were using
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.920]  huge amounts of tear gas we got hit with tear gas last night and I can tell you
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.240]  it's very unpleasant to be caught up in a cloud of tear gas was quite stinging
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:24.120]  and it's quite revolting but we the spirit is fantastic I addressed a group
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.920]  of lawyers last night who were in the process of suing a Goldman Sachs they're
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:35.160]  trying to subpoena the CEO of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein for the crimes
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.240]  that he's committed the banking crimes Dr. Tobros who is the one of the key
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.920]  figures at his website is a very important website it's called stop
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.160]  speculators dot gr for Greece he and his partner Nullis are two lawyers that have
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.440]  gone against the status quo they put their political careers on the line to
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.600]  fight the banksters and you know you have on your site Alex this story about
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.560]  money markets in America could be hit with the US banking crisis I can tell
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.000]  you a little bit about that that's that is a very interesting story because all
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.160]  of the European banks that have bought the Greek bonds that are suffering as a
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:20.280]  result of the Greek troubles in actuality they sold or I should say they
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:26.120]  bought insurance from American banks in the form of credit default swaps and
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:31.600]  now American banks are on the hook for 127 billion dollars so now they're
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.520]  putting out the story that oh American money markets are going to suffer as
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.280]  a result of Greek tragedy and that's how they always hold us hosses with too
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.280]  big to fail and notice three years later it after the October fiasco of oh
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.800]  eight things are only worse not better now now I want to talk to Jerry
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:53.280]  Ackos Tobros of a stop speculators dot gr after you introducing but but but Max
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.520]  I could hear a minute ago chanting even up 1520 stories it looks like you're
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.480]  pretty high up I could even hear the chanting and the and the sounds of the
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.640]  crowds through the sliding glass window well I'm exactly we are six stories
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:13.720]  high yesterday we were on the first story and the the the bricks that were
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:19.920]  being pelted at the hotel and the front door was shattered and it was quite a
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.600]  scene but dr. Tobros is on his way here I'm hoping that he can get here in time
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.000]  okay now listen for Americans max who were new listeners as we're getting new
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.640]  affiliates every week now big stations all over the United States they're
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.280]  saying why do I care about Greece why do they care about Portugal why do they
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.440]  care about Iceland why do they care about Ireland why is this fight
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.800]  important because for folks that don't know most of the bailout money we now
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.360]  learn quote went to foreign banks well these are really multinationals so the
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.040]  people running America also run Europe so it's all well another head of the
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.200]  same Hydra and if they can be ousted and charged and indicted in Greece in
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.520]  Portugal in Ireland in Iceland in England they can be brought down here so
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:07.760]  this is a global fight against the banking cartel explain the crimes and
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:12.680]  and and how Papandreou was taken over there and how Greece was engineered for
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.200]  implosion so folks understand why important this fight is and the move
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.600]  towards him stepping down why that's so important well let me give you an
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:25.240]  exclusive Alex I we arrived at the hotel yesterday and I actually I went
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.880]  into the wrong hotel next door to me and I bumped into Steve Forbes Steve Forbes
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.040]  of course the son of Malcolm Forbes of Forbes magazine Steve Forbes is here with
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.160]  the International Chamber of Commerce the topic of discussion for their forum
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.040]  is selling the assets of Greece and sell those assets to foreign banks and the
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:49.080]  people who are creating the crisis the crisis is made as constructed by the
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:53.440]  banks to bleed this country into a point where they have to start selling
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.600]  the vultures are there for the fire sale so so he was perching wanting goodies
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.440]  that's right Steve now I know Forbes family going back 25 years Malcolm Forbes
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.160]  had his boat parked in New York Harbor back in the 80s when I was a stockbroker
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:11.080]  and so I chatted with Steve Forbes for a few minutes and I said Steve you know
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.720]  what's the deal here and he said Max you know this is an opportunity of a
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.520]  lifetime we're gonna get the the airport the lottery we're gonna get
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.440]  everything for pennies on the dollar this is a fantastic opportunity for our
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:27.760]  private account and all the people that have me incredible Max said did your
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:34.120]  Skype just cut out I don't think so my Tobras I don't see it okay he's getting
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:39.000]  the guest up to the room which really Kaiser's in the middle of it Kaiser was
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.600]  also in Iceland two years before they imploded it with Goldman Sachs and JP
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.280]  Morgan lawyers at the bar because you know he's a quote insiders so they
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.880]  talked to him bragging about how they were gonna implode their economy they
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:55.080]  get their operatives in their alumni into the finance ministership position the
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.280]  presidents the prime ministers they do this in every country and then they
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:04.480]  blow it out it's just total fraud this is incredible so Forbes was there Max
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.920]  like a vulture literally rubbing his hands together to you saying what a
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.720]  what a goody-goody gumdrop this is all gonna be yeah yeah if you look up Steve
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.040]  Forbes on if you do a search you'll find out an international chamber of
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.800]  commerce and of course you know to answer your question why is this important
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.040]  for people in the United States you know this is a test run Alex the groups that
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:28.200]  are stripping a grace for its assets and causing this financial holocaust using
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.280]  weapons of mass financial terror and they're gonna they're using the same
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.680]  techniques in the u.s. to take over the highways and the income producing assets
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.040]  of the u.s. all those things that were built by American taxpayers over the
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.160]  past decades are gonna fall into the hands of the privateers and the private
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:49.240]  contractors and that income will have to be replaced somehow and of course that
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:53.680]  means a lot more Americans will have to go to war and go to jail to pay
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.200]  for the a strip mining of these assets and they're doing it as a test run here
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.400]  in Greece and in Ireland and they're warming up for the big act because of
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.920]  course America is the big pinata that they're gonna love to whack and to shake
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.680]  out all the goodies and that'll go into private hands and it'll completely be
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:15.040]  destroyed as a free open democratic capitalist society and it'll just all
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:18.160]  those assets will flow into the hands of a few Wall Street bankers and let's
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.840]  explain they've got most the mainline Republican hosts saying that big banks
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.560]  are good their free market they're doing God's work these are the opposite it's
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:30.000]  always the big banks pushing carbon taxes socialism for the public to then
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.040]  get us under their control and steal our money here's a microcosm example Petra
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:40.520]  Eccleston 22 got one or got four billion dollars from her daddy who's
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:45.680]  worth 23 billion and almost all of his wealth is from formula one and I looked
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.200]  him up because in Texas they're about to give a 250 million dollars or it'll
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.600]  probably go double that of taxpayer money just like these superdoms they
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:58.720]  build of my money but my my my taxes here in Austin are going to this she
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.880]  just bought a hundred and fifty million dollar mansion and the most expensive
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:08.440]  in America 57,000 square feet she's got another hundred million dollar house and
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.120]  this is just his 22 year old daughter and it turns out all over the world the
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.000]  their race tracks are paid for so this is the this is the crony capitalist class
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.680]  they come in they bother politicians they give them all our money and and I
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:28.520]  mean this is a good microcosm of this isn't it yes they use debt Alex that's
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:33.560]  the key in other words the country of Greece was loaded up with hundreds of
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.080]  billions of dollars worth of debt that was pushed on to their balance sheets
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:44.640]  with the with the the the compliance of the very corrupt government and now
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.920]  they're saying they have to pay that debt and to pay the debt they want them to
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:52.320]  sell their assets but that debt was artificially pushed on to them to begin
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.320]  with it's the same thing we see in South America in Latin America that was
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.680]  written about by John Perkins and his book Confessions of an Economic Hitman
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:02.000]  the same techniques are being used in Greece and Ireland and the same
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  techniques will be used in America when America is having to suffer austerity
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.400]  measures to pay for the debt that debt was artificially created by Wall
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.600]  Street banks to make that situation happen as its experience today and by the
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.040]  way we have the IMF World Bank documents the BBC got in 2002 this is not your
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:23.760]  opinion these are briefly describe how they set this up three years ago with
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.680]  the Prime Minister what they're now doing I mean that's that's why the Greeks
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:31.320]  are so mad it's in the news there they know it's premeditated well what
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:38.160]  happened was that the postal service was loaded with credit default swaps and
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:48.400]  the Prime Minister got into a deal where he sold for roughly 1.3 billion
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.760]  these credit default swaps that later turns out were flipped six months later
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:57.680]  for 27 billion dollars into the and put that money into the pockets of his
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.360]  cronies and friends so that that roughly 25 billion dollars was taken out of the
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.280]  pockets of the Greek people and now they're saying that they have to pay
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.920]  that 25 billion dollars and other liabilities as part of the austerity
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:15.800]  measures let's be clear they take your money give it to the bankers the bankers
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:21.120]  steal it and then say you owe us money for money we stole yeah now I have one
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.920]  of the lawyers here sure introducing okay can I introduce the guest mr.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:33.920]  new loss is is on the front line of this have a seat mr. new loss and then
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.160]  actions folks not to talk once he's on because the people are talking in the
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:43.320]  background and he's involved in this lawsuit now against the government

[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:27.560]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:31.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.040]  break and come back one minute later basically points that need to be made
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:39.120]  but we're really interested in the the fact that the prime minister is
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:43.560]  admitting that he may step down very soon they're reshuffling things and
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.360]  we're seeing reports that that that the people of Greece have really woken up to
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.960]  the fact that this was orchestrated fraud so can parliamentarian new list
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:55:04.000]  breakdown how it was orchestrated fraud you say here in before 15 months yes
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:12.160]  the economic terrorist yeah that's it so we have to a special work and in 600
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  pages we have dried all the responsible who makes all these games against the
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:30.440]  people I want to mark this point they're responsible of them market group I
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:37.720]  think it's Samir's our car if I say the goods say I don't care about the Greeks
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:45.320]  because they ask you don't care about these persons you destroy this social
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:51.440]  network you destroy this civilians I don't care about the Greeks it's his
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:56:00.080]  problem it's it's their their problem I care I only care for the money so that's
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:07.680]  is the proposition of the people who destroy the social networks is the
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:15.160]  be the proposition of the people who destroy the citizens well after they're
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.800]  done destroying Greece they're gonna suck Germany dry they're gonna suck
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:26.720]  America dry is the first step you see the other steps is Portugal Ireland
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:36.560]  Spain Italy and no I think the same game that would be continued into another
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.880]  places of the world and why not in the USA also oh they're already doing it
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.280]  they're already doing it sir that they're raising all our taxes let me cut in

[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.440]  keiser joins us from athens grease the parliament is under siege by the
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:33.760]  population george newlas former member of parliament a prominent lawyer met with
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.600]  keiser and hundreds of other top lawyers moving forward lawsuits against
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:44.400]  goldman sachs jp morgan popindraya first he said he would resign this morning now
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.040]  he's saying reshuffle the cabinet obviously he's been trying to hold on to
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.600]  power where do you go from here i mean he obviously it's public that they made
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:59.520]  these inside deals why doesn't the courts just go ahead and indict him why
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:08.160]  isn't he thrown into chains right now mr. newlas i think the people start to
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:13.360]  understand because the game is very very very difficult to understand what
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:22.720]  happens where i am specialized lawyer and also i am internationalist i was my
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:31.600]  job it was in brazils i european council and after i was known for
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:37.880]  tangents and i am a specialized lawyer for economic affairs so we're so you
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:43.000]  specialize in this area yes that's it that's it okay expanding on that then
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.520]  where is it going it's not family life and family lives for the people for the
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:55.760]  common people this story i want to say something very important you know we'd
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:06.920]  pay for sign the deal with the imf and cost this deal one billion third third
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:15.480]  300 million euros only to write the deal is impossible unbelievable but it's
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:27.200]  host so many many many euros and this year is equal to ten year cuts of the
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:36.240]  gallery of the people yeah if i can jump in this is the methodology that the
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:40.000]  banks use and this is how they pay themselves what new list mr. newlis is
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.600]  saying is they paid themselves over a billion dollar fee to create the
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:51.560]  memorandum with the imf the memorandum gives the imf control over the Greek
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.720]  assets above and beyond the constitution it's completely outside of the
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:03:00.120]  constitution so the government violated the constitution so the imf using the
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:05.080]  fake debt that they created that they gave the banks in this country are now
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:09.920]  saying through this imf that they charge 1.2 billion dollar fee to just sign
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:15.400]  the contract that gives them rights above and beyond the constitution now you
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:19.120]  asked earlier why the people why there's not you know chains handcuffs putting
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.440]  put on these men right now and there's something going on here these these
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:29.880]  politicians is extremely what you would describe as a crony capitalism situation
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:34.360]  there's extremely cozy relationship so it's very important that the people doing
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.560]  what they're doing on the street the politicians need to make the calculation
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:42.160]  that the will of the people is so great that their their political career would
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:46.280]  benefit by fulfilling the law and by putting these people in jail and that's
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:49.360]  why these demonstrations are important that's why the people on the street
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:52.480]  doing what they're doing is so important they're pushing the politicians to obey
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.320]  the law and to go forward and this is what mr. newlis is is on the front line
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.600]  on the legal side and he's working part and parcel with the people on the
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.280]  street now we've got the process just arrived Alex I don't know how much time
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:10.600]  you have left there if Dr. Tobros is arrived we'll come back you know these

[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:13.760]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we now
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:17.840]  take you back live to the front lines globally of the fight against the
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:23.760]  mega central banks the eight banking families it's on record mainstream news
[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:28.280]  news in the u.s. that Goldman Sachs predominantly but also JP Morgan and
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:33.360]  others went in three years ago and basically put their people into the
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:41.200]  government the finance minister the prime minister George Papandreo and that
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:45.480]  they engineered the implosion of the economy tying it into the derivative
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:50.640]  debts most of which is not owed by the population and Iceland said no and they
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:53.640]  finally got the documents and learned that over 90% was not owed by the
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.080]  government that was owed by the very central banks claiming that they owed
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.440]  them the money they create fraudulent systems and then tie the national pension
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:06.440]  funds to it that's an oversimplification but but that's part of the scam now
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.720]  you're saying why do you care about this because the euro will go under if
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.200]  they're unable to secure and gobble up Greece remember Ireland just two years
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:19.320]  ago was the wealthiest and fastest growing per capita fastest growing not
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:24.240]  wealthy of Switzerland's that country in Europe they're brought into the EU the
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:27.560]  receivership contract suddenly they're bankrupted they're told that they've
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:31.560]  got to raise their taxes cut their benefits then it was confirmed in BBC
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:35.320]  that most the money's not owed by them it's private banks taking over their
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.840]  economic conquest and economic terrorism Max Kaiser joins us from Athens
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.000]  above the parliament six stories up you can hear the crowds chanting from time
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.720]  to time even through the sliding glass doors it's that powerful street battles
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.680]  attacks provocateur police that Max is confirmed they caught him a few years
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:57.160]  ago in Greece attacking peaceful people and blaming and on the demonstrators
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:01.400]  and attacking middle-class neighborhoods so they are in the middle of bedlam
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:06.440]  we're talking to a former member of parliament there George Nullis now the
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.840]  gentleman has gotten there dr. Tobros who is an economist and he's there with
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:16.920]  Max Kaiser max this is historical what's happening the New World Order falls if
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:22.040]  they can't gobble up Greece is that an overstatement or is that accurate no I
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:27.960]  think that's accurate Alec the Greece is really ground zero they are the pin
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:32.720]  that needs to stay up and we don't want Greece to go down dr. Tobros journalist
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:38.040]  economist he's working with mr. Nullis getting the word out to the public and
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:44.280]  so I want to bring dr. Tobros to this and he can talk about what he's what
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.120]  he's what they discovered in terms of the role that Goldman Sachs knows have
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:52.680]  played in the trees and in in the financial scandal so let me turn it over
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:57.400]  to dr. Tobros make sure he speaks up like you're doing go ahead okay good
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:03.160]  afternoon how are you good sir thank you for having us so break down the lawsuit
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:11.280]  being filed in the evidence you have yes this lawsuit started on April 2010 we
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:16.920]  started out together with the lawyer Greek lawyer mr. Nullis with whom we
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:22.240]  are partners in this case and we started that because we discovered that the depth
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:30.600]  of the Greek government today on each 70% it is an accumulation of years of
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:36.480]  interests because we pay that this capital for so many times and for the
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:42.320]  next of our lives we have to pay capitalizations of interest and nothing
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.280]  more this debt what this government has it was accumulated by the years by swaps
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:53.680]  on swaps and against what this is the debt of swaps and nothing else so it's
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.960]  derivative based it's derivative based it is also derivative based but in any
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.800]  case the debt of the Greek government as the major parts of the debts here in the
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:10.920]  southern Europe let's say in the peaks okay it is a scam all the debt itself
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:17.280]  because it was used for years for the governments to help the issuers of this
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:23.680]  debt to issue money you understand because debt today it is a necessary
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.320]  instrument for the central banks to issue money you know very well that
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:33.480]  because in the recent years after the 50s that say the gold system is not
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:38.920]  existing anymore that means there is not any gold collateral on the money issue
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:44.040]  the governments they discovered the government debt in order the central
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:48.720]  banks to issue the money this is a scam this is a very big scam that all the
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:55.480]  countries are involved and what happened here in Greece with the crisis after
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:01.080]  2010 when the problem started it is exactly the same game what happened in
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.560]  the United States with the case of Lehman Brothers and AIG the same thing
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:12.200]  cds on CDOs here we have cds on government bonds the game is the same
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:18.160]  the people who made the game are the fraud businesses let's come and say so all of
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:22.280]  us we have to revolt because we don't have to pay this debt but let me cut in
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:26.280]  here Alex for a second just a couple points number one number one the
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.760]  comparison to Lehman Brothers and AIG is a good comparison in other words the
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:34.880]  capture party risk as they describe it the billions and billions of debts that
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:39.720]  are owned in terms the company sold the fraud to the government so it's their
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.920]  fraud we don't know it because they induced us into fraud they go to prison
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:48.160]  the debts are written off but if they induce us to pay off the fraud they
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.640]  become our owners through fraud they essentially it's a it's a daisy chain of
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:58.040]  fraud and if one goes down in this case Greece you have another financial
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.920]  collapse like it had in 2008 now to get back to what Dr. Tobros was saying
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:05.520]  originally in terms of the debt and the layering of the debt in other words what
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:09.640]  what they have discovered through their to their to their discovery process is
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:14.400]  that the same multi-billion dollar tranche of debt with interest attached to
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:19.320]  it was resold over and over and over again the same piece of debt so they're
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:22.840]  saying that he sold us originally now we've discovered that you've sold us the
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.680]  same debt 10 15 20 30 times and you're charging us 30 times the interest on the
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:31.880]  same piece of debt you're selling us our own supposed debt back over and over
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.320]  again and that's how you get bizarre isms like Bank of America for closing on
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:41.280]  a million dollar house they never owned or had a deed to and it was paid for in
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:47.040]  cash it's just pure criminal evil yeah so Greece then becomes as I mentioned at
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:53.040]  the top of the show the European banks own the Greek debt that is going to go
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:58.840]  down however the European banks bought insurance of their debt form of credit
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:03.200]  default swaps that were sold to them by American banks so if they're what
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.320]  their American banks are trying to do is to bleed grease to death without an
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:10.920]  outright default because it's a game that they're playing a very high stakes
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:15.520]  global risk game if Greece outright defaults then American banks are going
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:21.280]  to go under in a huge way because they own the insurance on the debt so they're
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:25.720]  trying to bleed grease to death without it going into outright default and max a
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:29.440]  lot of a lot of unsophisticated Americans or others may say well good
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:32.840]  let's bleed then that'll help us know the banksters will then continue the
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.320]  next phase against us this is going to be painful either way it's time to
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:42.720]  default on it all bring the bankers down arrest them remodel ties the system
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.880]  as Ron Paul has said through proper congressionally controlled money it's
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:52.200]  time for the Federal Reserve global sorrows crime syndicate to go down you
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:55.840]  know they're holding us hostage saying too big to fail it's gonna hurt but it's
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:01.360]  gonna hurt worse if we let this monster pull us down with it that's that's right
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:04.760]  and as we described it earlier right next door to this hotel is another
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:08.040]  hotel where Steve Forbes and International Chamber of Commerce are
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:12.480]  licking their chops at 50 feet from the rock-throwing protesters discussing how
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:16.840]  to carve up the assets of Greece you saw this as well dr. Tobras yes this they
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:24.400]  make they did meeting here the first months of 2010 of January they call
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:29.080]  here all the international sharks of the market you know them all of them they
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:34.880]  were here portion funds or of them and they organized first how to collapse the
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.920]  Greek market how to manipulate this market and then following the same formula
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:44.200]  of what they did in Greece they start making the same game all around Europe
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.520]  they did the same on Portugal on Ireland and they will follow with that even
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.680]  in Spain and Italy don't worry they will do it remember Alex in Iceland six
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:57.280]  months before a collapse I made a film about the collapse of Iceland and I
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:00.080]  met with the Lehman brokers and other Wall Street brokers discussing the
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:03.480]  collapse of the country and the currency and how they're gonna profit from it
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.640]  and that's what they do they collapse countries now to profit from the collapse
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:12.760]  using these derivatives and short sales and naked short sales and and as they
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:16.920]  get bigger and as you go through the chain of events you go take down a
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:21.560]  Greece then an Ireland then you go after Spain which is a big a lot bigger big
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.760]  juicy you become a monster and then you can attack Great Britain you can
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:30.400]  actually go after the in America and that's the end game absolutely and
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:33.440]  they've stated all of this and they need to be clapped in irons immediately
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:37.720]  these are economic terrorists but but here's the good news and I want to get
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:41.880]  dr. Tobras's take and your take on this enclosing we got three minutes left
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:45.720]  Max's has been very historical the reportage here today and I want to thank
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:49.440]  you for giving us these exclusives here at info wars.com the syndicated
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:54.120]  broadcast it looks like they're failing in Greece what does it mean that the
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:58.560]  Prime Minister has set the step down where do we go from here
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:02.880]  oh the prime minister will say prime minister don't worry nothing will change
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:08.760]  here because unfortunately it's not the greek people that decides it's not the
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.920]  greek parliament that decides they just following orders coming from abroad
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:17.360]  they're just following orders coming from international banks and
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:22.680]  speculators this is a game and today believe me what happened in this point
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:27.560]  the greek parliament today and yesterday was was a shame against democracy
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:33.480]  because yesterday all deputies they couldn't enter in the parliament because
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:38.480]  people were outside and they were really angry believe me and they make
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.520]  some something just to make to the people to think that something different
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:47.880]  could happen today but today prime minister was again in the parliament
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:51.720]  he spoke against with his deputies with his parliament are a team and he said
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:58.440]  simply that nothing will change we have to pay all these derivatives debts we
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:01.960]  have to continue to pay for all our lives and nothing will change that is a
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:06.440]  game unfortunately but but one from what I get in the news this the european
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:10.880]  markets are crashing and that then a lot of experts are thinking that grace is
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:16.400]  gonna default openly I mean isn't that what we're looking for here max well a
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:22.280]  lot of it a lot of the volatility is is induced to create trading opportunities

[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.280]  couple of weeks ago they spread a false rumor to create volatility to profit
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:32.560]  from the volatility there's a lot of false rumors going on the markets to
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:37.240]  create wild no no I understand wild swings but but overall Greece is standing

[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:16.760]  only a errand boy sent by a grocer to collect a bill as Colonel Kurtz would say
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:22.880]  by the crony capitalist non-free market George Soros class that pushes
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:27.000]  socialism through government to collectivize our wealth and then transfer
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.040]  it to themselves and you see great examples of this with the big mega central
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:35.280]  banks but I've seen one of the clearest examples in a long time with formula one
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:40.680]  you know about Jerry Jones up in Arlington Dallas area getting over a
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:44.360]  billion dollars for cowboy stadiums you've seen it in countless other cases
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:47.480]  where they claim a stadium is going to be 500 million and ends up being a
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.560]  billion or more and it's taxpayer money and they sell it that well you know we'll
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:57.560]  sell this debt we'll sell these bonds and then you'll get all this business well
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:02.600]  here's the deal doing research on the owner and you're really the creator of
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:07.680]  modern formula one he's made almost all of his money in Europe by dozens of
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:14.240]  tracks being built by government money and now he's got track projects going
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:20.760]  on two of them here in the United States and here's Bloomberg business week
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:25.760]  goes on to say the state of Texas is planning to fund but they've got to get
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:31.000]  Austin where I live in the county to pony up the largest portion of it 250
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.680]  million dollars of taxpayer money and tax breaks so you don't have to pay taxes
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:45.760]  and you get our money to build this giant formula one complex now this
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:53.040]  individual his daughter Petra Eccleston 22 he just gave her $4 billion he's
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:58.640]  worth 23 billion dollars and growing and now he's moving the formula one
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:06.480]  franchise to more and more to the United States expanding it and he wants a
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:11.480]  quarter billion dollars and of course it always goes over to build this giant
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:15.720]  modern formula one facility out in East Austin all the local real estate
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:21.080]  moguls are getting special deals on it the politicians are you know getting
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:25.880]  front row seats and cozying up most of them sell out for nothing and here she
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:31.800]  is fat off of European taxpayer money now becoming fat off American taxpayer
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:40.760]  money getting the biggest mansion 57,000 square feet in Los Angeles 57,000
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:46.200]  square feet that's just the main house there's some other buildings biggest
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:51.520]  mansion in the United States 150 million dollars Aaron's spelling and
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:56.440]  always you've got another hundred million dollar mansion and most of their
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:01.800]  profits you see are from the facilities being given to him free now this is why
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:04.680]  no one can compete with the globalist they control the issuance of currency
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.280]  and credit but as if that's not enough they get taxpayers to pay for their
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:12.560]  sports stadiums their formula one tracks their NASCAR tracks and I hear idiots
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:16.160]  calling to talk radio and go good big good for our economy big good for our
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:20.760]  economy oh socials health care is gonna be good oh yeah the insurance companies
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:26.000]  write the health care to make 35 million Americans buy it to control what

[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:35.080]  come out and say you're a racist if you don't want government-run health care
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:39.000]  crony capitalist health care it's not even socialist socialist doesn't exist
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.400]  it's always a scam it's always so they can domesticate you and control you and

[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:15.080]  it's very simple in the final equation powerful groups have always gotten
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:18.640]  together taken over governments whatever the system is and started
[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:22.600]  consolidating all businesses all industry all land under them through
[02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:28.240]  fraud it's called tyranny and it's a disease that every republic every
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:34.900]  nation every empire gets and we got it really bad now this is simple common
[02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:39.520]  sense in mathematics if special interest can make you build the sports stadium
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:46.160]  and make you build the formula one and make you pay trillions of dollars in
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:51.280]  quote bailouts to them that they designed holding economies hostage what
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:57.640]  comes next every step they take they get wilder they get crazier they get more
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:02.440]  out in the open and a lot of people get more disheveled more people get more
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:07.480]  downtrodden they get more lackadaisical they get more and more that they just
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:12.720]  give up and then what happens is societies totally collapse production
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:16.720]  drops down to nothing and the banking parasites move on to the next country
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:21.680]  they haven't fully dominated yet just because it's still got a life blood so
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:29.240]  it's very very simple the globalist are setting up a tyranny to continue the
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:34.520]  mining operation and they are shearing the sheet now down the bone look at
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:38.160]  America now as a giant farm and they're targeting the middle class that's why
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:43.640]  every time I turn TV on CNN ABC News this week with Christina I'm on poor any
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:47.880]  of them it's Warren Buffett it's it's it's Ted Turner it's Bill Gates how what
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:56.800]  great heroes they are how they care so much about everybody how they love us
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:01.360]  how they want to raise taxes on everybody on the quote rich that means
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:04.160]  we're making a half million dollars a year a hundred thousand dollars a year
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:08.840]  and and how they don't pay enough taxes meanwhile they have the laws written
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:18.400]  for they pay zero to 2.4 2.8 Google Microsoft all of them now they are
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.560]  getting most their contracts from government most of it from major
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:25.000]  combines they're creating monopolies so you have the richest people in the
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.440]  world constantly promoting higher taxes which they have written the laws to be
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:38.480]  exempt from it's elementary and you go to EDS and Ross Perot he got finesse by
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:43.040]  government contracts you look at Microsoft all these people Oracle it's
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:47.960]  always government seed money and that's how they control the system and so you
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.800]  sit there and you watch people exempt from the taxes telling us that we need
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:58.040]  to have our taxes raised for constant you know hotel projects and golf courses
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:06.360]  and developments formula one NASCAR billion-dollar sports stadiums as they
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:12.000]  make obscene profits not from free market they're squeezing the blood out of
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.920]  us and I've had enough of it and it's time for the stupid moron liberals to
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:22.160]  shatter their paradigm and realize just like in Soviet Russia any big pot of
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:27.760]  money is going to be robbed by the insiders the only way you stop that is
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:32.200]  true libertarian free market but you got the fake libertarians like the founder
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:36.320]  of a PayPal at who's all into transhumanism and world government openly
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:39.680]  we're doing research on him and they had a Microsoft and all of them they're
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.240]  openly trying to censor the web and consolidate it for a monopoly for them
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:48.520]  they're not free market and you've got them saying anything corporate is okay
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:53.680]  these corporations act as governments they grow fat off of our money and so
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:56.680]  you got to learn that there's a counterfeit of true libertarian ideas you
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:02.240]  need local autonomy and control you to be self-sufficient and big mega big things
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:07.160]  are always bad because they always become and operate like governments the
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:11.640]  Rockefellers going back a hundred years ago would send their Pinkerton
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:15.400]  security and people just out to mow down whole groups of people that own their
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.920]  property sometimes they kill hundreds of the swath look up history they operated
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:23.080]  they were bigger than government until folks stood up to them these are
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:30.720]  terrorists now Catherine Austin Fitz joins us and I'm glad that we got her
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.320]  on today for the balance of the hour to talk about the move towards World War
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:39.520]  3 the open move for ground troops in Libya talk of invasions into Syria
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.960]  aircraft carriers steaming into the area all of this coming down as they
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:46.840]  openly announce a private global corporate government we will pay our
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:50.960]  carbon taxes to and she's a former secretary of assistant secretary of
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:55.520]  housing for federal house commissioner under Bush one managing director and
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:01.080]  member of Wall Street firm Dylan Reed and co and she has led the portfolios and
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:04.920]  investment strategy for 300 billion of financial assets and liability salari
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:08.800]  dot-com and she blew the whistle on corruption more than a decade ago and
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.520]  she was also the president of Hamilton securities group investment bank at
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:17.520]  financial software developer she exposed the whole promise situation with that
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:22.280]  software but Catherine am I wrong in saying we can see the acceleration
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:28.120]  clearly they're pulling the trigger on on global conflict as a smokescreen for
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:34.440]  destabilization to further consolidate wealth worldwide well they did the great
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:41.840]  you know we're moving into the Middle East and it's starting much greater
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:47.720]  control and part of that Alex there's more war and and part of it is with the economy
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:53.520]  so the extent it is you know I need to say this but we're in a war machine and
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:59.040]  the war machine needs another war so whether it's conquest of more markets
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:03.880]  the system subsidized or more work is the war machinery Catherine are you on a
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:09.360]  cell phone yes because I'm having trouble picking up exact are you near a
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:16.360]  landline I'm not okay well just are you on a hands-free yes can you unplug the
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:22.920]  hands-free I'm I'm not using it okay well just try to get the receiver close
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:25.320]  to your mouth because I want to be able to hear the important things you're
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:31.600]  saying I'll go ahead start over so Alex the whole you know the whole planet is
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:35.200]  run with an investment model I call with the central banking warfare model and
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.640]  the central banks print money and then the military makes people make it and
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:46.120]  right now it's in a download spiral it's not efficient so as we centralize we
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:50.000]  choke off real market activity you're right real markets work and we're not
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:55.560]  using them and the more centralized it becomes the you know so that the weaker
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:59.520]  it becomes the more fragile it becomes and then the more market you need and
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:03.880]  so moving in in a much bigger way doesn't surprising to build workers are
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:06.880]  talking about much more war in the Middle East they need much more war in
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:10.720]  the Middle East especially if you're gonna keep driving up the oil price so
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:14.400]  if you're not if you're gonna have a controlled and very high oil price then
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:18.760]  you've got to assert control of the Middle East you can't get there so you
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:24.400]  know we've seen an effort globally to maintain a very high oil price and and
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:27.640]  they need much more control in the Middle East if they're gonna make that
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:33.080]  happen and they needed if they're gonna keep the war economy going so as long
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.000]  as we're in this model we're gonna see more and more warfare both economic
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.200]  warfare and physical warfare it's it's sort of an economic imperative that it's
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:47.480]  very unpleasant but the reality is can we change the model and you're right
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:50.920]  part of changing the model is decentralizing and right now there's
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.800]  you know there's been a tremendous effort to centralize and it's choking off
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:01.600]  entrepreneurial activity and capital to entrepreneurial activity everywhere and
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:06.720]  you know one of the challenges though Alex is if you look at every American
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:10.760]  household budget and if you look at their assets and their savings and their
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:16.240]  investments we're all financing it so you know most people for example hold
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:20.880]  tremendous amounts of money and Treasury securities and and other and you talk
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:26.120]  about ways to to divest to get out of their system on your Solari website
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:30.360]  that's excellent but why why every time a global implosion starts and they're
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:33.840]  greedily consolidating wealth but it's also endangering their system at the
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.480]  same time why do these elites always try to launch new wars because war is good
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:44.800]  for business in other words war war how did we get out of the depression we have
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:51.880]  World War two so unfortunately we now have several generations of people both
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:56.920]  leaders and and society that know how to make money from war but they don't know
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:02.360]  how to make money from peace I mean war is a good business and it's a way to
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:07.560]  generate business fast and to pick up natural resources cheapen to get more
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:13.720]  I hate to say you know for many many centuries war is work and that's what
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:18.320]  the system knows how to do and the question is can you know can we can we
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.680]  get to another system part of what you're watching and we're seeing this with
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:26.440]  the you know the possibility of a Greek default yet again hanging over the
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:32.840]  market is is we have an entire generation of baby boomers in the first
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:36.720]  world who generated lots of capital but now they're aging and and they're ready
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:42.240]  to retire and it's very economically attractive to advocate those those
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:46.760]  contracts and shift the capital out to the emerging markets are out into space
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.600]  which is what they're doing and and they've shifted that money out and now
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:54.320]  the boomers are ready to retire and that's that the politics of that have
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:59.440]  to be faced and it's a very ugly politics and it's a very very policy yeah
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:03.720]  the baby boomers money another war exactly baby boomers money has been
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.120]  stolen and so now we've got to go into a pure authoritarian system so they don't
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:13.360]  get too uppity during that process but I don't see things going well for the
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:17.480]  globalist for the social engineers and that's my big concern Catherine is that
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:23.440]  that they're full of hubris hoodspub whatever you want to call it and they
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:28.720]  have the nukes they have the military but and they're committed to holding on
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:32.600]  the power and expanding it but you can see the collision course where it takes
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:41.440]  us to to rack and ruin I agree I think they are having real trouble and and
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.240]  they're having real trouble Alex because the you know implementing the various
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:52.240]  plans to let the baby debt boomers down nice or hard are not working you know
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:56.680]  trying to get an austerity program implemented in Greece you know they're
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:02.200]  facing unbelievable pushback and and so you have you have not only the sort of
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:06.040]  competition between the pro-centralization and the pushback from
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:09.680]  everybody else but but the other thing you've got is you've got real
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:13.280]  disagreement between various leadership so the European leadership
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:18.480]  wobbling with the American leadership and and the squabbles are very very hard
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:23.600]  to manage and I think you know for people to be part of something they need
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:29.520]  to have a real mission and vision that they share it has to be about more than
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.280]  Howard has to be about more than money it has to be part of something you know
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:38.680]  you all really want to be a part of and believe in and and they lack a vision
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:44.200]  which is really attractive and inspiring you know it's it lacks light and so I
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:50.200]  think the chances of you know of things falling apart because they can't hold
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:54.920]  it together are reasonably good and of course that's always the risk that they
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:59.640]  that that happens now you know I hate to tell you if if you really want to see
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:05.680]  a decentralized society and we need to the centralized society to fail so you
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:09.680]  know you can't you can't get to a success without having a failure that
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:14.600]  we don't want and we've got to get in in in prepared for the failure it's not
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:18.040]  that we even want it to fail or correct me if that's not your view it's that
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:23.160]  their system is designed to consolidate and turn us into vassals while they kill
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:28.480]  us with the GMO food and the rest of it and and so their economic looting is a
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:33.160]  process of putting us into a servile position for our population to be
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.760]  reduced it's like in James Bond movie do you expect me to talk no mr. Bond I
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:44.360]  expect you to die people need to really get right but if remember Alex let me
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:48.080]  speak in your defense because I've been part of you know at a lower level the
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:53.400]  leadership and what I will say is they're grappling with a message from the
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:58.120]  American people that says what we just want more stuff we want more money we
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:02.920]  want more stuff and we're not willing to be held accountable and live within a
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:07.880]  financially accountable model but they've never seen a political real political
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:11.440]  support in this country for anything that's accountable whether it's at the
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:18.840]  local or global level but from the deep literature of the of the upper cross to
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:22.920]  the ruling class they are obsessed with a planetary dictatorship to forcibly
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:27.680]  reduce population they do just call us a disease and it's social Darwinism so
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:31.480]  whatever horrible things they do to us is loving for the planet at the end of
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:34.400]  the day because after all you know it's kind of like you dehumanize the Native
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:38.920]  Americans before you kill them are you to humanize the Arabs or before you kill
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.960]  them are you to humanize the Jews before you kill them in Nazi Germany we see the
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:50.920]  same mindset being basically put we see we see an anti-humanist mindset but we
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:55.480]  don't just see it at the top Alex is you know at this point it runs throughout
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:58.840]  throughout different parts of the culture now that happens in any big
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:02.440]  rodent population and they've done studies the rodents at a higher
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:05.920]  population start eating each other killing each other the rats start having
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:09.600]  wars and you look at the general public most of them hate each other they're
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:14.400]  nasty they're entitled they're petulant they're not excited they're not seeing
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:18.040]  the beauty of the world I agree with you it's very very scary so it's not just the
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:24.600]  social engineers making culture ugly the general public you some say good let
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:28.240]  us have war let us have destruction because they're so unhappy that's because
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:33.000]  they are decadent and haven't tasted real real degradation they will beg and
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.600]  plead later right here's the reality if you know there are a lot of honest
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:42.960]  people in leadership position and what they've been taught is trying to do the
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:47.600]  right thing for the whole will only get you punished and it's not just punished
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.000]  from the top it's punished from the bottom so that's part of the conundrum of
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.040]  how we get here today now what can people do and I think the first thing is to
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:01.360]  think of traction what you want to do is you want to separate yourself out as
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:06.240]  much as possible you want to put as many degrees of separation between you and
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:10.120]  the people who are centralizing things and also you and the people who are not
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:16.080]  productive I mean you you want to limit your network you want to limit your your
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:21.240]  work and business life to people who are positive and who get real things done
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:26.320]  and and a lot of this is going to come because millions and millions of people
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:29.880]  you know once had a friend who ran for governor in the state of Tennessee and
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:33.640]  he said you know you think it's no like a perilous until you realize if enough
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:38.480]  get together they can shut down the earth city and the reality is the system
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:44.480]  we're watching can't succeed and so the rest of us that does withdraw and start
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:47.960]  you know and this has come down to thousands of incremental things to
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:53.120]  build a more self-sufficient decentralized economy locally and in your
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.680]  network everybody's different so how it plays you know plays very much in where
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:02.200]  you are and and what you're into but you want to put as many degrees of
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:06.520]  separation between you and people who can't be trusted as possible it's just
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:10.240]  it all fashion common sense and part of what we're seeing in the economy is
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:14.160]  people just withdrawing because they've had it they realized something and this
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:18.360]  is terribly unhealthy and terribly perverted so they you know that's the
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:22.120]  natural recession that happens when people say you know I don't want to
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:29.080]  invest in this excuse me well it's it's all coming to a head and with all our
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:31.880]  military intel sources say they are getting ready for the big ground
[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:36.840]  invasion of Libya and Syria and the whole nine yards which is what the
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:42.240]  Bilderberg group reports coming out last week confirm we've got a new full data
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:47.240]  dump from the Bilderberg sources insider leaks a reveal full Bilderberg agenda
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:51.880]  on war and alternative media and they are going to try to bring in a total
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:57.240]  authoritarian planetary system and all of humanity needs to understand that
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:02.960]  these top globalists are not going to give us any quarter okay so let me make
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.480]  a prediction because the Bilderberg meeting is important but for people
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:11.440]  based in North America the most important meeting is coming up in a third
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:14.800]  week of July and that's fucking in growth and I know you know it's coming up
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:21.160]  Alex you've done more than anybody to bring transparency people will come to
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:24.320]  you know leaders will come together to prove a lot of decisions will be made
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:28.720]  including my guess is on the death ceiling and sort of the budget deals for
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:33.040]  next year but also currently so you're saying we'll see a lot of decisions at
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:36.400]  the end of July when they break up by the way the Washington Post had a big
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:44.720]  article today about it well it well it it showed the our whole video on YouTube
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:48.880]  the dark secrets in cyber-hemian grow and it was a pretty fair piece I mean what
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:55.400]  does that say about the system that more and more they are free and the
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:59.960]  way they're going to get it is the last thing really slow down throughout the

[02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:33.120]  men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an

[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:29.360]  items I'm gonna hit but Catherine finishing up your right the the ruling
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:33.640]  class that goes to Bilderberg most of them also go to Bohemian Grove and in
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:38.040]  that 15-day meeting with all the male prostitutes and the drugs and the
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:42.120]  alcohol a lot of the decisions do get made so you're predicting that we'll
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:45.800]  we'll see what's gonna happen with the debt ceiling and so much more after the
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:52.360]  mainly a Republican leadership gets together for a little gay sex is that
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:59.520]  what you're saying my read is that they want another 2-e3 they want they want a
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:04.800]  comp economy hard and they're gonna do that but they want political support for
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.440]  it so they're gonna let us really choke during the summer grovel to approve a
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:13.800]  2-e3 and then we'll come out and it'll be quite a fractious fall the one in
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:18.040]  which inflation will kick up even more so I think they're working towards
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:22.280]  getting a 2-e3 and a deal on them on the budget to release six with the main
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:27.800]  street and I think they'll get it so it's gonna make watch what they do with
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:31.080]  the growth and watch what Congress does before at least the right after the
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:38.640]  growth gives them a signal absolutely well again the website for folks to

[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:06.320]  didn't know anything about shipping the guns to Mexico so they could track them
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:10.080]  back and blame the Second Amendment but the government through subpoenas has the
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:14.400]  emails and witnesses and that the ATF had cameras in the shops running the

[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:55.360]  remarkable and we are being censored more and more with the new Google
