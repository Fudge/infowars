[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:27.280]  welcome my friends the kickoff of the live four-hour Friday global transmission already
[00:27.280 --> 00:32.080]  the fourth day of December 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones Lee and Matthew will be
[00:32.080 --> 00:36.640]  hosting the fourth hour today wow we've got our reporters on the ground now in
[00:36.640 --> 00:41.040]  Detroit tracking these different Islamic training centers we've got so much huge
[00:41.040 --> 00:44.560]  breaking news on the economy and so much more a bunch of big guests coming up
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.960]  today but here it is out of CNN the Associated Press what we told you a day
[00:48.960 --> 00:53.600]  and a half ago the shooters in San Bernardino had pledged allegiance to
[00:53.600 --> 00:58.960]  ISIS they had tactical gear pipe bombs it was premeditated it wasn't over the
[00:58.960 --> 01:02.400]  Christmas tree though I'm sure they did target Christians and Jews and others
[01:02.400 --> 01:05.600]  I mean we know that's amongst those that were killed some of the other folks now
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.400]  it's coming out and that's what we're working on who were connected to Islamic
[01:08.400 --> 01:13.040]  groups were left alone that's the way it always is with a jihad and Obama is
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.600]  proud of his work here's John Bounds report let's just call it what it is
[01:17.600 --> 01:23.080]  because we can at the bare minimum the coordinated massacre that just took place
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.000]  in San Bernardino California was a jihad as was the 2009 massacre that occurred
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.600]  at Fort Hood but the media spun that one too calling it workplace violence ABC
[01:34.600 --> 01:39.480]  later reported attorneys for the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood massacre said that
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.400]  the alleged shooter's admission that he gunned down his countrymen to defend the
[01:43.400 --> 01:48.040]  Taliban proves that the assault was a terrorist attack and not as the
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.200]  government had implied workplace violence but the bottom paid for media
[01:53.200 --> 01:57.000]  its handlers in the Obama administration won't let up on their
[01:57.000 --> 02:13.640]  warping of reality within minutes of the shooting a deluge of leftists on
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.760]  Twitter immediately blame the massacre on white people conservatives Donald
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.640]  Trump supporters the NRA the second amendment pro-lifers and men in general
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.760]  after the shooters were named as an Arab man and woman progressive suddenly
[02:29.760 --> 02:34.520]  lost all interest in the story while media would have us all shelter in place
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.960]  in gun-free zones to be picked off like scared little rabbits gun sales sky
[02:39.960 --> 02:45.000]  rocketed days before the shooting during Black Friday breaking record
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.920]  background checks and the whole debacle stinks of a false flag funded by the
[02:49.920 --> 02:55.080]  mysterious 50 plus billion dollars Americans blindly throw at the avalanche
[02:55.080 --> 03:00.480]  of liberty devouring alphabet agencies illegally surveilling and manipulating
[03:00.480 --> 03:05.320]  the public consensus to keep the big brother machine rolling the inland
[03:05.320 --> 03:09.720]  regional center that was attacked in San Bernardino California had been
[03:09.720 --> 03:14.840]  conducting active shooter drills for months the LA Times writes at first
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.760]  Dorothy Vaughn assumed it was a drill just like all the others at her work at
[03:19.760 --> 03:23.840]  the inland regional center where she's a nurse that puts in her mind works with
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.840]  clients and parents of clients who are sometimes that's soft mind control
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.320]  shooter drills every month or so the devout Muslim man and mail order
[03:33.320 --> 03:38.040]  Pakistani bride that unleashed the coordinated attack at the inland
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.240]  regional center had been creating remote controlled bombs in their home

[03:58.000 --> 04:02.080]  shooting massacre was apparently radicalized and in touch with people
[04:02.080 --> 04:07.120]  being investigated by the FBI for international terrorism law enforcement
[04:07.120 --> 04:11.840]  officials said on Thursday not a workplace grievance Washington this has
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.400]  jihad written all over it in my humble opinion we are reaching a point
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.720]  eclipsing any talk of impeachment or the evocation of the 25th amendment
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.880]  considering President Obama's sanity or lack thereof we may have arrived at a
[04:26.880 --> 04:31.320]  point when Frank J. Larkin sergeant at arms and doorkeeper of the US Senate
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.400]  being the only officer that can arrest the Manchurian candidate currently
[04:35.400 --> 04:40.720]  quarterbacking an American jihad in the United States must dust off the handcuffs

[04:58.320 --> 05:02.200]  here's what we know about the shooting that took place in San Bernardino
[05:02.200 --> 05:07.840]  California where 14 people were killed and 17 others were wounded the shooters
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.520]  were husband and wife Syed Farouk and Tashfin Malik according to authorities
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.880]  the couple crashed an employee holiday party dressed in assault clothing and
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.280]  working as if they were on a mission according to co-workers Farouk was a
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.080]  devout Muslim who traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and returned
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.520]  with a wife his wife was believed to be from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.560]  Arabia before coming to the US on social media accounts Farouk describes
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.960]  himself as a Sunni the council on American Islamic relations immediately
[05:39.960 --> 05:43.800]  went into damage control Muslim leaders asked that people not implicate

[08:52.040 --> 08:58.840]  we do here live 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time four hours a day now for
[08:58.840 --> 09:03.800]  almost 19 years weekdays been on air 21 years coming up in about a month and a
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.040]  half I am your host Alex Jones thank you so much for joining us on this live
[09:09.040 --> 09:15.360]  Friday December 4th 2015 Joe Biggs and crew are visiting different radical
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.240]  Islamic centers that have been reported around the United States reported
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.160]  training camps you name it and we've got very powerful drone footage over one of
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.880]  the more famous ones in upstate New York known as Islam a bird they call it that
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.080]  themselves and they've now gotten out of the area and have gone to Detroit so
[09:35.080 --> 09:39.640]  they're able to report on what actually happened in New York fully coming up in
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.560]  about 25 minutes from now they're also going to be going to Dearborn and other
[09:44.560 --> 09:50.240]  areas that have been fully Islamified and whether you're for that or against
[09:50.240 --> 09:53.800]  that we're just detailing something that mainstream media does not really focus
[09:53.800 --> 10:00.400]  on then we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us as well Peter Schiff and more
[10:00.400 --> 10:06.640]  today Peter Schiff obviously on the economy US health spending hits three
[10:06.640 --> 10:12.280]  trillion as Obamacare and rising drug cost kick in it's massively increasing
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.160]  the overall cost of health care the opposite of what they promised initial
[10:16.160 --> 10:25.080]  jobless claims in US rose massively last week 269,000 S&P post biggest drop
[10:25.080 --> 10:30.720]  since September standard and pours that is just some of the economic news on that
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.040]  front we talking about for 30 minutes with Peter Schiff today again Paul Joseph
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.800]  Watson will be joining us on the latest that's unfolding with the terrorist
[10:40.800 --> 10:45.000]  attack that they now admit did take place in San Bernardino California a day
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.640]  and a half ago two days ago this will be two days ago in a couple hours and it
[10:51.640 --> 10:56.240]  will also be breaking down the expanded war on Christmas we're all over the US
[10:56.240 --> 11:02.080]  official colleges from the Dean's office with the president are saying red and
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.880]  white or red and green are racist now and are gang colors hateful to other
[11:06.880 --> 11:13.160]  groups and do not have secret Christmas parties secret Christmas parties will be
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.840]  persecuted prosecuted attacked and I'm reading these statements it's like the
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.320]  Twilight Zone don't disguise a holiday party you know don't disguise a
[11:23.320 --> 11:29.200]  Christmas party as a holiday party that's an actual quote so you think we're
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.000]  in a tyranny now this is what young people are learning when they pay
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.480]  $40,000 a year to go to college and to have their development arrested and to
[11:38.480 --> 11:44.000]  be put deep into debt and to basically have a worthless desperate future where
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  they cling to the system and the promises that they've been told that will
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.520]  deliver them to this wonderful heaven as long as they submit to the latest
[11:52.520 --> 12:00.080]  greatest political correctness so that's obviously coming up as well or on
[12:00.080 --> 12:08.080]  Christmas and more is coming up but first this cultural overwrite of America
[12:08.080 --> 12:15.560]  this political correctness offensive that's taking place against free speech
[12:15.560 --> 12:21.680]  in any existing culture not controlled by the social engineers has a real ace
[12:21.680 --> 12:25.080]  in the hole and whether it's Europe or the United States whether it's
[12:25.080 --> 12:31.160]  Australia or Canada they use radical Islamic terror as a way to actually
[12:31.160 --> 12:35.760]  restrict people's free speech saying we must submit to the radical Islamist or
[12:35.760 --> 12:40.280]  they will attack us we must do as they say and then the government and the
[12:40.280 --> 12:45.240]  socialist organize an alliance with ISIS and others to then take the people's
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.920]  liberties in the name of safety and security and community tranquility when
[12:50.920 --> 12:55.280]  they're the ones dumping in third-world stone-age populations that can't live
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.160]  with each other in peace much less with us then when the terror attacks take
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.960]  place the Panoptagon spy grid is endorsed it is expanded and then focused
[13:05.960 --> 13:12.060]  and targeted against the actual Liberty loving populations so this is a
[13:12.060 --> 13:21.080]  classic problem reaction solution and the social engineers also know that when
[13:21.080 --> 13:29.360]  they have shooting drills for not one not two not three but four years every
[13:29.360 --> 13:37.640]  month at the health department San Bernardino City complex complex of big
[13:37.640 --> 13:44.000]  buildings and government activity a political correct cult of demonizing
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.040]  guns living in fear having police drills learning to put your hands up and
[13:48.040 --> 13:52.480]  march out protected no one did it the neighbor said yeah we thought they were
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.800]  planning something was very suspicious they were living right next to them in
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.000]  a duplex where they're making bombs and had body armor and all these guns and
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.520]  weapons I mean that's not suspicious at all is it when it's two people from
[14:03.520 --> 14:11.960]  Saudi Arabia but they wouldn't report it because it would have been politically
[14:11.960 --> 14:18.440]  incorrect that is in the LA Times there's town hall neighbor didn't report
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.920]  suspicious activity of San Bernardino killers for fear of being called racist
[14:21.920 --> 14:30.000]  and so when you have drills every month for years and he worked there for years
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  imagine an unstable crazy person who then went to Saudi Arabia got radicalized
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.760]  got his wife in Saudi Arabia and came back ready to commit jihad you just had
[14:40.760 --> 14:45.520]  a couple months ago when he was in Saudi Arabia the nation's main clerics main
[14:45.520 --> 14:53.400]  imams main religious leaders calling for low intensity conflict gun and bomb
[14:53.400 --> 15:02.480]  attacks on soft targets in the West the great Satan being numero uno target so
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.840]  you people coming from that region over here and everyone coddling them and the
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.920]  very liberals that worshiped this jihad being killed and of course Paul Watson
[15:14.920 --> 15:18.880]  wrote an article about it last week ISIS came out and admitted an alliance with
[15:18.880 --> 15:24.640]  the European socialist and told its ISIS operatives do not target leftist do
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.840]  not target the socialist parties do not target those opening the border well
[15:28.840 --> 15:34.480]  obviously this guy didn't get the memo and he went and targeted Christians and
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.360]  Jews that's who they killed at the workplace attractive women there's
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.360]  just hundreds of people in the building but he targeted the good-looking women
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.720]  he targeted Jews and Christians classic so some of it was workplace I don't know
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.280]  when to back up what Obama saying but yeah show everybody you know in your
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.800]  jihad just how manly and tough you are when you gun a woman down begging for
[15:54.800 --> 15:58.720]  her life on her knees knowing that she'd never have a gun to defend herself
[15:58.720 --> 16:08.080]  this might try a jihad right here a 357 Magnum M4 riot shotguns armored doors I
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.600]  mean we're just not gonna roll over sorry not gonna be a cakewalk not gonna be on
[16:12.600 --> 16:21.640]  my knees going please but you've got your scumbag leader who they say spoke
[16:21.640 --> 16:26.120]  Arabic and was able to quote the Quran better than some of the top clerics when
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.400]  he first spoke in Egypt and apologized for America and apologized for
[16:29.400 --> 16:34.480]  Christianity the Muslim world's mouth was hanging open especially the Muslim
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.160]  Brotherhood because he was speaking from passages used mainly by hardcore
[16:39.160 --> 16:45.240]  radical Sunnis and they hit their knees and they said is this the return of the
[16:45.240 --> 16:52.040]  Imam of the Monty and now many radicals do believe Obama is the Monty and I
[16:52.040 --> 16:56.200]  used to hear this six seven years ago from people World Net Daily Joseph Farah
[16:56.200 --> 17:01.000]  Glenbeck picked it up and I just said there is no way that's actually
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.040]  happening our elites as corrupt as they are would not pull something like this
[17:05.040 --> 17:11.000]  well they are I just cannot believe it myself now it's a class of civilizations
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.480]  I believe down the road they're gonna crush it but our liberties in the
[17:14.480 --> 17:19.200]  process now for about six seven hours after the attacks happened two days ago
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.640]  up to about eight at night and we've done reports on it we've shown you the
[17:22.640 --> 17:29.360]  articles the video clips CNN MSNBC ABC News NBC CBS said probably a white person
[17:29.360 --> 17:33.160]  probably a right winger it's Donald Trump's fault there were three articles
[17:33.160 --> 17:38.200]  I saw saying fresh off Alex Jones's show there's a mass shooting I bet him and
[17:38.200 --> 17:46.560]  Donald Trump are proud of themselves now so within minutes they were blaming
[17:46.560 --> 17:52.840]  people who are pro-second amendment and then they've been covering up the last
[17:52.840 --> 17:56.000]  day and a half since it came out that they were terrorists connected to ISIS
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.480]  ISIS praise the attacks that burned down America here's the headline CNN it's
[18:01.480 --> 18:06.240]  also the Associated Press San Bernardino shooting attacker pledged allegiance to
[18:06.240 --> 18:12.880]  ISIS officials say and they've gone into their computers all the rest of it and

[18:20.960 --> 18:25.080]  officials familiar with the investigation told CNN Malik Post was
[18:25.080 --> 18:28.520]  ran on account with a different name one US official said the official did not
[18:28.520 --> 18:32.560]  explain how they knew Malik made the post well they all got their little jihad
[18:32.560 --> 18:37.200]  handle gnome to plumes where they go out and have their fun and they're
[18:37.200 --> 18:42.600]  recruiting and they just sit here in the middle of this Babylonian decadent

[19:27.120 --> 19:30.520]  I mean before all these quote liberals say bring in all these refugees you
[19:30.520 --> 19:35.080]  understand Saudi Arabia and others tried to just take over Syria it's very nice

[24:57.880 --> 25:04.440]  locally they aren't one one hundredth as predatory as the big six global banks
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.000]  that have written regulations all over the world to shut down all the small
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.600]  local banks and it's pretty near impossible now to get a small business
[25:12.600 --> 25:21.720]  loan or a farm loan they only give the big companies the loans and the banks do
[25:21.720 --> 25:26.440]  still classically try to call in those notes a few years early hoping you can't
[25:26.440 --> 25:32.200]  pay when you've been paying 18 years on a 20 year or 25 year note on that farm or
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.840]  that house they try to come in and repossess it and they're doing it all
[25:36.840 --> 25:42.880]  with fiat made up money from the Federal Reserve that they get for zero it's a
[25:42.880 --> 25:57.640]  big club and we ain't in it to quote Carvel and a lot of folks out there that
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.200]  don't realize how much trouble we're in and in behind the social warfare garbage
[26:03.200 --> 26:08.200]  they think the average guy that has a new Mercedes or a five bedroom house is
[26:08.200 --> 26:12.800]  rich and somehow screwed him over so if he falls they're gonna get wealthy they
[26:12.800 --> 26:20.960]  understand that it's the big mega rich that are openly funding the class war
[26:20.960 --> 26:34.400]  affair itself to bring down the wealth ladder now ladies and gentlemen the
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.800]  landlord has now invited the media into the killer's home in San Bernardino
[26:38.800 --> 26:52.960]  California there really is no end to this and I talk a lot about how we see a
[26:54.360 --> 27:00.160]  overthrow of reality and overthrow of common sense by design Obama's bringing
[27:00.160 --> 27:07.240]  in the so-called refugees almost 99% of them I mean it's in the high 90s our
[27:07.240 --> 27:13.280]  Sunni will hobbyist most of them upwards of 80% have fake passports and aren't
[27:13.280 --> 27:18.160]  even from Syria they aren't vetting them they're bringing them in they won't let
[27:18.160 --> 27:23.200]  anybody look at them when they disappear the federal government says don't worry
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.600]  about it and they keep parroting these aren't terrorist this isn't a terror
[27:28.600 --> 27:35.720]  attack until it's proven that they've got Facebook's pledging allegiance to the
[27:35.720 --> 27:44.080]  leader of ISIS and of course linking to Al Qaeda it's the same organization the
[27:44.080 --> 27:56.400]  same movement and so it was George Carlin that said it's a big club and we
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.080]  ain't in it he goes you know the test scores never gonna get better because the
[28:00.080 --> 28:06.440]  nation's owners the owners want us dumb and you know we interviewed George
[28:06.440 --> 28:09.960]  Carlin once when he was doing a book signing one of my reporters did we said
[28:09.960 --> 28:16.360]  what do you think of 9-11 the official story goes I don't buy any of it you
[28:16.360 --> 28:19.680]  think you can believe anything this government does it's been used to take
[28:19.680 --> 28:24.160]  our liberties and our freedoms now again does that mean the average cop ran the
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.360]  attacks or the average military person no the media always spun that like the
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.240]  post office ran the attacks Alex Jones believes the post office ran the attacks
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.840]  and the NYPD they actually said that he believes the government did it no the
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.440]  government ally with Saudi Arabia bare minimum let it happen to take our
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.680]  liberties and they've been proven and that's why I've been demonized by the
[28:44.680 --> 28:47.720]  criminals and government not the government but the criminal element
[28:47.720 --> 28:53.320]  that knows what's going on because we understand folks that they are allowing
[28:53.320 --> 28:57.600]  radical Islamists to come in and to attack us and then they turn around like
[28:57.600 --> 29:00.880]  Obama has done I'll play it after the break with his White House press
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.320]  secretary saying yes the president believes gun control is the answer
[29:04.320 --> 29:09.960]  that's right these people got the guns legally through a background check from
[29:09.960 --> 29:14.240]  someone who got them from the police but in California even if it's a private
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.560]  sale they call it you know the the private sale gun show loophole they
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.960]  don't have that loophole in California in California they bought the guns as
[29:23.960 --> 29:29.560]  Arnold would say legally they bought the guns through the system and in their
[29:29.560 --> 29:36.120]  next door in a little duplex making bombs and jihad jihad talk and the
[29:36.120 --> 29:39.880]  neighbors are all freaked out and scared and so they have Stockholm syndrome and
[29:39.880 --> 29:45.360]  so they don't tell anybody we're always talking about here this is classic then
[29:45.360 --> 29:49.440]  we all lose our freedoms because of Saudi Arabian terrorists they'll probably
[29:49.440 --> 29:53.920]  attack Iraq Obama will probably blow Iraq up and said they did it again the GCN
[29:53.920 --> 29:56.840]  radio network
[29:57.920 --> 30:03.280]  could a high-tech doomsday weapon wipe out America a new report warns that the
[30:03.280 --> 30:08.000]  US military has failed to keep pace with China and Russia in electromagnetic
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.240]  warfare tech boss and presidential candidate John McAfee recently warned
[30:12.240 --> 30:17.440]  about a doomsday electronic weapon that could wipe out 90% of Americans within
[30:17.440 --> 30:21.800]  two years of the attack and he urged politicians that this is the number one
[30:21.800 --> 30:26.520]  threat facing the country weapons that wipe out enemy electronics are a staple
[30:26.520 --> 30:30.520]  of science fiction films McAfee claims the country and its leaders are
[30:30.520 --> 30:35.680]  unprepared for EMP weapons and warned that gun crime should not be the single
[30:35.680 --> 30:40.000]  issue that decides votes recently president Obama declared voting against
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.760]  those politicians who are on the wrong side of the gun control issue McAfee
[30:43.760 --> 30:48.760]  says this is confusing because the possibility of 90% death for citizens
[30:48.760 --> 30:54.000]  of the US far outweighs gun violence which causes fewer deaths per year than

[33:33.840 --> 33:40.360]  decepticon media is being allowed into the reported killers home and of course
[33:40.360 --> 33:42.920]  they're digging through their websites they're digging through their photos
[33:42.920 --> 33:49.880]  they're creating just a media bonanza in here that will selectively be reported
[33:49.880 --> 33:53.720]  now our reporters are in Detroit they're out in the middle of nowhere in upstate
[33:53.720 --> 33:56.680]  New York yesterday they drove to Detroit they're gonna be reporting from there
[33:56.680 --> 34:00.920]  today then they're gonna be going to California to report on the American
[34:00.920 --> 34:05.160]  Caliphate and then back to other states that we've not listed yet they were in
[34:05.160 --> 34:08.880]  Islam a Berg one of the most famous centers that no one's been able to get
[34:08.880 --> 34:16.440]  into in upstate New York so they're gonna be until next week out there on the
[34:16.440 --> 34:22.720]  road Joe Biggs is gonna be joining us here in just a moment from Detroit with
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.280]  the crew but the media we're analyzing it right now live on air is now basically
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.320]  showing how these people lived now before we go any further we also have
[34:35.320 --> 34:40.000]  drone footage we're gonna be showing at Islam a Berg and getting the details the
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.720]  background of it and what Homeland Security had to say to our reporters as
[34:43.720 --> 34:47.120]  well now that we're out of the state of New York we have to report on what's
[34:47.120 --> 34:51.920]  happening in detail once we're out of that particular state and once we've
[34:51.920 --> 34:57.880]  moved away from these particular centers for obvious reasons now they're also
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.800]  reporting now that he was arguing with Christians at work evangelicals
[35:02.800 --> 35:07.920]  Christmas trees Christians it was their fault see they didn't submit to radical
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.960]  Islam and so they had to pay so we all have to tailor ourselves and our speech
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.880]  to Saudi Arabia standards where they execute you for preaching the gospel
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.800]  where women are executed for having sex out of marriage where homosexuals are
[35:23.800 --> 35:28.800]  executed they're gonna have 50 executions what this weekend beheadings
[35:28.800 --> 35:35.440]  people that writes a poetry about atheism are executed the left is in a
[35:35.440 --> 35:42.280]  literal lip lock worship fest because these are fellow totalitarians and they
[35:42.280 --> 35:48.160]  hate Christians as well so it's a very very sick group at the top that is in
[35:48.160 --> 35:54.880]  love with the blood version solitarianism of radical Islam but now we know
[35:54.880 --> 36:00.640]  something even more insane when I say this has false flag on it false flag
[36:00.640 --> 36:03.960]  that our government open the border our government brought these people in our
[36:03.960 --> 36:08.920]  government vetted this Saudi Arabian woman two months ago that he brought
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.720]  back his bride or his terror partner or whatever she was and they knew where he
[36:13.720 --> 36:16.800]  was going they knew who he was seeing they knew what he was doing on Facebook
[36:16.800 --> 36:21.000]  I mean we had Homeland Security call-up Joe Biggs's number and then Josh's
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.240]  number and then our other reporters number two nights ago when they didn't
[36:25.240 --> 36:29.560]  have their numbers or even know what reporters I had in New York other than
[36:29.560 --> 36:33.800]  Joe Biggs they went right into their database what flights they were on their
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.120]  phone numbers where they were traveling the GPS on the phone marks where you
[36:38.120 --> 36:42.600]  travel it's just like GPS in your car it was designed to do that and then the
[36:42.600 --> 36:45.720]  police are like the head of the counterterrorism task force one of the
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.200]  heads that talked to us was like well I can't get into the technology but yes we
[36:49.200 --> 36:53.400]  know right where you are oh really I mean when that guy was probably in high
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.560]  school I was exposing what was gonna happen not because I'm smart but because
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.440]  I'm informed I just love how these Homeland Security guys act like we
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.400]  don't know what's going on we blew the stingray systems open a decade ago we
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.680]  proved it all two years ago with the secret documents out of Seattle we've
[37:11.680 --> 37:16.280]  blown more of these illegal operations than anyone else and by the way I'm not
[37:16.280 --> 37:21.280]  overtly proud of that because it's dangerous I don't like actually being
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.840]  the 8,000 pound gorilla smashing globalists all over the place I mean
[37:25.840 --> 37:30.280]  they know it we know it but I finally just realized why not just let the
[37:30.280 --> 37:34.680]  audience know the real power of info wars we are a slaughterhouse politically
[37:34.680 --> 37:37.880]  crushing tyranny thanks to you and everything you do and your support and
[37:37.880 --> 37:40.960]  spreading the word we just cut right through their garbage like a hot knife
[37:40.960 --> 37:45.840]  through butter and I'm not enemies with the average Homeland Security person but
[37:45.840 --> 37:49.360]  they are selected out of the state police and local departments because they
[37:49.360 --> 37:54.240]  buy into the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL line well you got to decide you want
[37:54.240 --> 37:57.440]  to go along with the establishment line or do you want to see this country not
[37:57.440 --> 38:01.600]  be destroyed because we've been proven right we know what we're talking about
[38:01.600 --> 38:07.520]  we are the good guys we're here to help okay you got that this country is on the
[38:07.520 --> 38:14.840]  razor's edge of fully collapsing and now this Washington Post false flags true
[38:14.840 --> 38:19.720]  believers and trolls understanding conspiracy theories after tragedies a
[38:19.720 --> 38:23.960]  lawyer for the family of one of the San Bernardino attackers invoked skepticism
[38:23.960 --> 38:28.400]  over another mass shooting and questioning police accounts in the mass
[38:28.400 --> 38:32.360]  shooting there are a lot of questions drawn in regard to Sandy Hook and whether
[38:32.360 --> 38:36.800]  or not that was real incident or not attorney David Chesley said in a video
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.280]  uploaded to British tabloid the Daily Mail his comments were an apparent
[38:40.280 --> 38:43.480]  reference to conspiracy theories that 2012 shooting in Newtown Connecticut
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.600]  in which 27 victims were killed the stage promote gun control agenda now this is
[38:48.600 --> 38:52.400]  now being suggested about this we'll be talking about it with Joe Biggs in a
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.120]  moment but but here's the difference Sandy Hook they didn't send emergency
[38:58.120 --> 39:01.880]  helicopters they didn't send ambulances they sent porta potties first they had
[39:01.880 --> 39:07.320]  PR they launched an email internally through Bloomberg's anti-gun group get
[39:07.320 --> 39:13.520]  ready tomorrow we're about to make a big move that came out they had the students
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.400]  marching in circles like it was a drill in and out of the same building there
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.480]  weren't shootouts on the streets there weren't pipe bombs there weren't
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.920]  hundreds of witnesses there weren't real people with backgrounds we saw weird
[39:25.920 --> 39:28.880]  stuff where somebody be laughing go oh the news is on and then do the famous
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.160]  actor deal where you hyperventilate start crying for the camera we caught
[39:32.160 --> 39:35.320]  Anderson Cooper doing weird blue screens green screens with his nose
[39:35.320 --> 39:40.280]  disappearing and the same Luke tapes I mean I don't know what's fake about it I
[39:40.280 --> 39:44.200]  don't know all the details because it's fake we don't know exactly what happened
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.800]  did they really kill people I don't know all I know is it's as funny as a
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.520]  $3 bill this isn't phony as a pure false flag because you've got jihadis you've
[39:55.520 --> 40:00.120]  got a global call you've got ISIS being real invading multiple nations in
[40:00.120 --> 40:08.440]  Africa in the Middle East and in four wars again is being demonized was
[40:08.440 --> 40:13.200]  San Bernardino shooting a false flag and Joe Biggs asked the question pointing
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.720]  out they had all these drills but from the perspective of defining a false
[40:16.720 --> 40:21.280]  flag if you open the door up and let a burglar know they can break in at a
[40:21.280 --> 40:26.720]  certain time you're now involved with the burglar so there's different types of
[40:26.720 --> 40:31.960]  false flags you open the door you let people in just like Hebdo just like
[40:31.960 --> 40:39.520]  Europe just like all of these cases and then you're aiding an abetting that's
[40:39.520 --> 40:42.920]  what we're saying when we talk about false flag and then you have the drills
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.600]  constantly so these weak-minded mentally ill people every month for years
[40:46.600 --> 40:55.480]  having a drill there of a mass shooting get it in their head ABC News in 2001 had
[40:55.480 --> 41:02.680]  a death education special on 2020 I did reports on at the time admitting that
[41:02.680 --> 41:06.280]  just a few years after death education started nationwide after Columbine
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.800]  Columbine was the pilot school for it in the in the late 90s suicides tripled
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.200]  in girls doubled in boys because they were teaching 11-year-old girls how to
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.920]  commit suicide by tying a shoestring around their neck and tying it to the
[41:19.920 --> 41:26.320]  coat hanger the hat rack or the coat rack in the stalls so little girls get
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.040]  depressed now they've been taught how to commit suicide it explodes you start
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.920]  hyping gun drills and active shooter drills and make it part of the culture
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.560]  it becomes something people then begin to think you're supposed to do you don't
[41:38.560 --> 41:41.720]  go home and commit suicide you go get a bunch of guns and go shoot a bunch of
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.240]  people that had gone free zone in fact WorldNet Daily did an article on it that
[41:46.240 --> 41:52.240]  they actually found from 1999 death education at Columbine High boom Samuel
[41:52.240 --> 41:59.520]  Blumenfeld remember interviewing him about that so there you go it tripled
[41:59.520 --> 42:04.520]  suicide in girls and any advertisement agent will tell you that 80% of
[42:04.520 --> 42:08.760]  advertising targeted at women because on average they believe they're quote more
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.320]  impressionable that's not what I say it's what the establishment says and who
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.320]  are the Democrats targeting and again that's on average it's not saying women
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.680]  are as smart as men women can be told come to the collective trust us we love
[42:22.680 --> 42:25.880]  you let us teach your 10 and 11 and 12-year-old daughters how to put a
[42:25.880 --> 42:30.120]  shoestring around their neck and hang themselves so they don't do it and then
[42:30.120 --> 42:36.240]  the suicides tripled they used to have cases when they would have a particularly
[42:36.240 --> 42:43.520]  powerful play in England 304 years ago of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that
[42:43.520 --> 42:49.680]  routinely women would go home and drink poison or slit their wrist because it was
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.400]  so powerful the love of Romeo and Juliet killing themselves to not be
[42:54.400 --> 42:59.200]  separated women would go and kill themselves and that's what they teach
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.600]  the little girls how sad it is and they show them cases of other little girls
[43:02.600 --> 43:06.440]  that killed themselves and show them video reels and the little girls out of
[43:06.440 --> 43:10.240]  solidarity a lot of times go in sad and want to join them and put the thing
[43:10.240 --> 43:16.960]  around and the government knew this full well they knew full well so this is
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.280]  what they've now done and now you're going to continue to see the mass
[43:21.280 --> 43:24.160]  shootings because this is our culture this is what America does this is our
[43:24.160 --> 43:29.640]  pastime we don't have barbecues you know at the government centers no they have
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.120]  shoot them up drills we're going to go to Joe Biggs here we're keeping them into

[47:18.600 --> 47:21.720]  Security had to say to him what's happened since we talked to him yesterday
[47:21.720 --> 47:27.480]  when we come back from break but I really cannot
[47:29.040 --> 47:35.400]  overstate how much the media is spinning and how much the mainstream media is
[47:35.400 --> 47:39.560]  deceiving when they're basically saying that info wars is saying the
[47:39.560 --> 47:45.560]  shootings didn't happen in San Bernardino day one we said it happened day
[47:45.560 --> 47:49.480]  one we said it was Islamic radical terror we're on record up one side and
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.240]  down the other but folks this is weaponized media Joe Big said was
[47:53.240 --> 47:58.160]  San Bernardino shooting a false flag pointing out that police guns got to
[47:58.160 --> 48:01.920]  them they were being protected no one stopped them and the government let them
[48:01.920 --> 48:07.680]  come in and do this that's a false flag when you let somebody do something when
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.600]  you help them to go after our guns which Obama says he's doing so they are
[48:12.600 --> 48:17.520]  twisting the meaning and then implying that without quoting us that we said it
[48:17.520 --> 48:20.960]  didn't happen this is what they're gonna do they're gonna say that we said the
[48:20.960 --> 48:24.440]  moon landings are fake they're gonna say that I believe in space aliens and
[48:24.440 --> 48:29.200]  giant wasp under the Capitol or under the UN member Rachel Maddow said that I
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.360]  literally believe giant wasp live under the UN building I never said that I never
[48:33.360 --> 48:39.160]  said anything about aliens they know it's not true once I said the elites are
[48:39.160 --> 48:43.400]  crazy out of the CIA training center in San Francisco and I've read in multiple
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.360]  books including some of the stuff Timmy Thurley wrote about that the elites
[48:47.360 --> 48:50.840]  believed when they're hallucinating on DMT and stuff that they're contacting
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.480]  other dimensions they made movies about it men who stare at goats I didn't write
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.360]  that book I didn't say and do all that I did have General Stubblebine on who ran
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.880]  the program but see so I report on stuff going on and then they say I'm saying
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.800]  it they also say I say I'm you know that I'm deeply racist or that I'm behind the
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.200]  Boston bombing it's because we're so effective folks they've got to demonize
[49:14.200 --> 49:17.680]  it's time to skip this one network break so that we have more time to break this
[49:17.680 --> 49:24.200]  down but Joe Biggs this is what we see unfolding and regardless of whether this
[49:24.200 --> 49:28.560]  is a classic false flag or they open the door and it's a partial false flag it
[49:28.560 --> 49:33.080]  doesn't matter because they did open the door up and this really shows
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.440]  desperation I notice you have a giant mosque in behind you where they have five
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.400]  times a day called to prayer we're gonna and you have the American flag flying
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.560]  in half mass there I guess for the folks that died so that's that's nice so Joe
[49:46.560 --> 49:50.440]  Biggs tell us exactly what you've discovered and in a few minutes but
[49:50.440 --> 49:55.720]  first off specifically you and I are being demonized in the Washington Post and
[49:55.720 --> 50:00.320]  a bunch of other newspapers right now that we're saying no one died and it's a
[50:00.320 --> 50:05.720]  hoax without ever having us actually say that this is desperate disinformation
[50:05.720 --> 50:09.760]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com now we're standing in front of the Islamic
[50:09.760 --> 50:14.440]  Center of America this is the largest mosque in the United States and let's
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.400]  get back to a point from the trip to Islamberg the fact that that you brought
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.960]  up earlier the fact that this terrorism task force everyone knew that I was
[50:22.960 --> 50:26.400]  gonna be on this trip because it's out there we said you're sending Joe Biggs
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.000]  but no one knew the crew that was gonna be there so this shows you that the
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.560]  government can track down individuals know their locations in remote areas and
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.480]  the guy even knew the city we were in so you mean to tell me that in San Bernardino
[50:40.480 --> 50:47.920]  this couple has a basically an IED making facility inside their home 11 pipe
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.720]  bombs tons of ammunition weapons and they had no clue about it that's where
[50:52.720 --> 50:56.160]  the false flag comes from it's not saying that people didn't die obviously
[50:56.160 --> 51:02.480]  people died but the fact that they can track me and you to a location a remote
[51:02.480 --> 51:06.000]  New York and know that I'm going to Islamberg but they're gonna sit here and
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  tell me that they're right down the road they're already ready in gear they've
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.760]  been conducting active shooter drills for the past few months at that same
[51:14.760 --> 51:19.560]  location but they had no clue that this was gonna happen that this all sparked
[51:19.560 --> 51:24.000]  because of a disputed a party no one has a disputed a party and then all the
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.480]  sudden just goes well I think I got some pipe bombs and all of them and some
[51:26.480 --> 51:30.800]  ammunition I'm gonna go shoot these people he did hate the question he did
[51:30.800 --> 51:34.120]  hate the Christians the Jews and others that were there that's now coming out he
[51:34.120 --> 51:37.840]  did pick his targets just like in Mali they would if you could cite the
[51:37.840 --> 51:42.040]  Korean two weeks ago they wouldn't kill you same thing in the same thing in the
[51:42.040 --> 51:46.040]  theater same thing at all these places so they are picking who they want to kill
[51:46.040 --> 51:51.080]  but but that's the final action this is premeditated yes exactly it's
[51:51.080 --> 51:56.040]  premeditated which means we have a government that spies on people heavily
[51:56.040 --> 52:00.280]  obviously they found Josh's number found where he was in New York so they can
[52:00.280 --> 52:03.200]  find that kind of information so the fact that they're gonna sit here lying
[52:03.200 --> 52:07.520]  go well we didn't know where this came from it's complete and total BS you know
[52:07.520 --> 52:10.800]  I don't understand how they can push that people are gonna sit there and go you
[52:10.800 --> 52:14.480]  know what I just think this randomly happened no it didn't randomly happen
[52:14.480 --> 52:18.360]  they knew what was gonna happen and then immediately following I mean within
[52:18.360 --> 52:22.360]  minutes you have Hillary Clinton coming out and going no not in my country we
[52:22.360 --> 52:25.880]  need to do something about gun control no bomb is coming out and exploiting the
[52:25.880 --> 52:29.160]  situation just like he did in Oregon we need to do something about this when
[52:29.160 --> 52:32.200]  he's stricter gun control well California has some of the strictest gun
[52:32.200 --> 52:35.920]  control in the nation and that didn't work out too well guess what there's
[52:35.920 --> 52:38.960]  people out there who want to do bad things there's people out there that
[52:38.960 --> 52:42.040]  have a hate in their heart and want to do something now if you look at the
[52:42.040 --> 52:50.280]  history of his wife she was from Saudi Arabia he flew there and went to this
[52:50.280 --> 52:57.600]  event came back met her online went back to go get her and got a fiance visa the
[52:57.600 --> 53:01.640]  Hill is now reporting they believe that she is the one who radicalized him and
[53:01.640 --> 53:07.520]  got him to essentially do this attack and then earlier before the attack on
[53:07.520 --> 53:12.200]  her Facebook page she pledged allegiance to ISIS so this is out in one of the
[53:12.200 --> 53:15.720]  articles from the Hill that's what's happening right now that's the latest
[53:15.720 --> 53:19.040]  news but for anyone to come out here and attack us because we're questioning
[53:19.040 --> 53:23.280]  what's going on the fact that active shooter drills are being conducted in
[53:23.280 --> 53:27.000]  the days leading up to this there was already a SWAT team on standby which is
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.400]  why they acted so quickly oh I'm telling you they'd been given tips but because
[53:31.400 --> 53:35.240]  the political correctness didn't act or yeah the neighbors the neighbors even
[53:35.240 --> 53:37.840]  said that they were scared to report their neighbors because they would be
[53:37.840 --> 53:43.000]  considered you know Islamophobic or racist or hateful in some kind of way so
[53:43.000 --> 53:49.120]  that's how ridiculous it's turned out from someone reported a clock boy and
[53:49.120 --> 53:54.280]  now he's suing Irving Texas for what 15 million dollars and now people here were
[53:54.280 --> 53:57.800]  too scared to report something that they thought was suspicious like with the
[53:57.800 --> 54:02.640]  clock boy and now 14 people are dead so political correctness is killing people
[54:02.640 --> 54:07.480]  and then you go past that homeland security if they get word most of the
[54:07.480 --> 54:10.880]  time does stand down because even if it's outsider Islamists are even from
[54:10.880 --> 54:13.560]  this country they'll then turn it around and use it against the Second
[54:13.560 --> 54:16.400]  Amendment in fact let's go to the White House press secretary and hear what he
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.760]  had to say yesterday about the Second Amendment and the fact that Obama does
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.680]  intend to go after the guns and as you just said Hillary has also said she's
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.800]  going after the guns they're gonna bring more refugees in more jihadis in and
[54:29.800 --> 54:33.080]  then they're gonna take our guns when they kill us here it is
[54:33.080 --> 54:37.560]  president Obama yesterday jumped to say that this mass shooting means it's time
[54:37.560 --> 54:42.760]  for common sense gun laws does the president really think that common
[54:42.760 --> 54:48.280]  sense gun laws would deter terrorists now that he has admitted these two may have
[54:48.280 --> 54:56.000]  been terrorists yes the president believes that passing common sense gun
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.560]  laws that makes it harder for people with bad intentions to get guns makes the
[55:00.560 --> 55:03.840]  country safer but so the president thinks that when there are potentially two
[55:03.840 --> 55:11.120]  terrorists sitting around planning a mass murder they may call it off because
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.360]  presidential Obama has put in place common sense guns well Peter we're
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.360]  still learning of the precise motives of the individuals who carried out this
[55:20.360 --> 55:24.280]  heinous act of violence yesterday one thing we do know is that the four
[55:24.280 --> 55:28.160]  firearms they were wielding were legally purchased some of the laws that are in
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.800]  place now that's a fact so that might lead some to conclude that we should have
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.520]  made it a little bit harder for them would that have changed the entire okay
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.400]  let's stop right there I have CBS news admitting that they got these guns four
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.480]  years ago from a friend because of California law did the background check
[55:46.480 --> 55:50.920]  went to the system you're going to have people that don't have a felony who are
[55:50.920 --> 55:53.880]  going to end up being crazy terrorist they're gonna be able to go out and get
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.560]  guns or they're gonna go rob somebody's house for a guns or they're gonna steal
[55:57.560 --> 56:01.080]  them out of a cop car they're going to get guns just like in France they're
[56:01.080 --> 56:05.120]  going to come after us we deserve to have guns to protect ourselves as the
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.080]  head of Interpol has said as Sheriff or Pio has said as the Detroit police chief
[56:10.080 --> 56:15.360]  has said this is common sense how dare them bring these people in protect them
[56:15.360 --> 56:19.800]  know what they're doing let them attack us and then blame the Second Amendment
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.560]  and how dare the media now two days into this still be trying to spin it wasn't
[56:25.560 --> 56:30.400]  terrorist even after they admit the the attackers pledged allegiance to ISIS
[56:30.400 --> 56:36.040]  officials say unbelievable job eggs yeah it's completely totally ridiculous but
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.600]  you know many props to like you said some of the different people calling for
[56:39.600 --> 56:43.280]  people to arm themselves like the Chief of Police in Detroit there was another
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.040]  guy in New York I can't remember the name of the town starts with the you I
[56:47.040 --> 56:53.000]  posted his Sheriff's Department post on my page on Facebook maybe someone can
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.280]  find it and pull it up but he said hey I want to call every single person out
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.760]  there that has a concealed carry permit to arm yourself go out go to the range
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.920]  shoot be proficient in this weapon and know how to use it know the laws and do
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.320]  it the proper way he says because more people we have that are armed the less
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.120]  this stuff's gonna have that's right and Joe Biggs make no mistake they're
[57:16.120 --> 57:21.000]  coming for our guns I've talked to the insiders in DC I've talked to the top
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.840]  experts they say the word is they're coming next year for the free speech for
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.280]  the guns with our medical freedom with force inoculations they're gonna start
[57:29.280 --> 57:36.480]  huge fines for Obamacare it's all coming 2016 folks get ready they are coming
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.720]  time is running out to quote Matt Drudge I want to come back to you Joe and talk
[57:40.720 --> 57:45.400]  about Islamberg I keep calling it Islamoburg it's a joke Islamberg and
[57:45.400 --> 57:49.520]  this famous facility that you were able to go up talk to him Homeland Security
[57:49.520 --> 57:53.320]  and more now what you've seen after you've gotten to Detroit I'm very pleased
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.680]  I'm gonna show the screenshot again of the mosque if we can or a live video
[57:56.680 --> 58:00.640]  feed if you're a radio listener we also simulcast television with reporters all
[58:00.640 --> 58:03.000]  over the world we're gonna have reporters next week from the New
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.280]  American with video feeds in Paris for the key parts of the world government
[58:07.280 --> 58:12.600]  summit here we are at the big Islamic Center of America in Michigan outside
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.880]  Detroit biggest mosque in the United States they have their Islamic flag at
[58:17.880 --> 58:23.640]  half-mask and the stars and stripes at half-mask most big mosque come out and
[58:23.640 --> 58:28.400]  don't condemn these attacks I'm glad that they've condemned the attacks and I'm
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.520]  glad they have the flags at half-mast so that that's a good thing because we
[58:32.520 --> 58:37.640]  need good people in Islam to decry these jihads because these jihads are gonna
[58:37.640 --> 58:47.080]  be used to set you up as well for a clash of civilizations stay with us
[58:47.640 --> 58:56.240]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[58:56.240 --> 59:00.760]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[59:00.760 --> 59:05.200]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[59:05.200 --> 59:09.840]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[59:09.840 --> 59:14.480]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[59:14.480 --> 59:18.080]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[59:18.080 --> 59:22.280]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[59:22.280 --> 59:25.360]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[59:25.360 --> 59:28.880]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are
[59:28.880 --> 59:32.680]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[59:32.680 --> 59:37.560]  out there introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile

[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.320]  obviously today or tomorrow probably today we need to go ahead as part of
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.600]  your investigation the american caliphate gets you on out to california just to
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.160]  show how they're trying to spend this and to investigate then you can go back
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.080]  on your leg or come back to austin then in next week go back on the road but I
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.760]  want to investigate the west coast the east coast there's been some famous
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:28.320]  islamic training centers on the west coast as well go ahead job yeah there's
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.600]  a there's one that I was reading about to an organ there was a farm a piece of
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.920]  farmland or something like that I believe I have the article in the truck
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.800]  where a lady said that it completely been taken over by by muslims in that
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.480]  area so that's definitely one of the places I'd like to check out but yeah
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.360]  this place is all over and since I've been on this trip we're getting emails
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.320]  people are sending us information about places they know of they're they're
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.040]  willing to take the time out of their day to go and show us how to get there so
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.760]  that's really encouraging and it's great to see but so right now we're in
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:02.480]  Dearborn now Dearborn is I believe southeast of Detroit am I correct on
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.360]  that yes is that it yeah and then ham track is where we're at earlier my
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:15.360]  ham track is completely been turned into a it looks like a street that I saw in
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.840]  Iraq every store is pretty much an arabic you have everyone walking up and
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.920]  down the streets mostly in that traditional arabic garb I even went
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.760]  into a store and purchased something the people in there were they seem pretty
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.460]  nice they didn't have any problems with me coming in there we went and filmed it
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.240]  you know I plan on going into this mosque as well but definitely the rumors are
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.320]  true about these two areas a large population of Muslims as you can see
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.160]  this whole place is packed out with people in there right now praying but
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.600]  the good news is it wasn't like Paris or it wasn't like Brussels Belgium where
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.920]  you were just told anywhere get out of here you're you're European you're not
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.000]  Muslim well yeah that was definitely towards nighttime too so it depends I'm
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.200]  sure people's moods change once there's not as many eyes or not a many eyes on
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.600]  but we're gonna go back out to ham track there is a prayer center out there
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.760]  where they do the call to prayer five times a day they had the big loud speaker
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.880]  I read about it in the telegraph article that you guys sent me before we came on
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.040]  this trip so we're gonna go over there as well and look around and see if we can
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.800]  talk to some people we'll try to talk to somebody in here and ask them how they
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.440]  feel about what's going on absolutely get that part of the mission down and
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.560]  then whether it's today or tomorrow get out to California and then obviously
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.840]  don't say we're gonna go after that some of the other places but you just
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.800]  decide where you want to go next but I mean don't you think Joe we need to go
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.440]  out to California oh yeah obviously I mean I think that's a great idea especially
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.360]  with what's going on the way they're trying to spend it on us saying that
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.080]  we're saying it didn't happen we definitely have to bring up the points
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.720]  and show people why people can question something like this you know I'm not
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.040]  one to jump on the the false flag bandwagon you can ask anybody you know
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.400]  in the office I'm very skeptical a lot of that stuff but this one has it written
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.600]  all over it now that doesn't mean that people didn't die obviously people were
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.480]  killed in this situation but you got pretty upset when folks said that the
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.720]  Paris thing didn't happen and the Hebdo thing didn't happen oh yeah I mean that
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.720]  that set me off and the Oregon shooting that one really made me furious you know
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.960]  because I was out there or the shooting in Rowan Oak Virginia where they said
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.960]  that the two reporters weren't killed I mean I sat there and saw the blood soak
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.600]  boards being changed out and all that stuff I mean stuff happens the false
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.160]  flag into this part what I'm saying what happened in San Bernardino though is a
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.080]  fact that we know our government can track us follow us and they didn't stop
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.160]  this from happening that is why Mike I'm concerned and I want to find out
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.400]  absolutely and the neighbors knew I mean this is ridiculous and they had
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.360]  pledged allegiance to ISIS stay there let's recap all that when we come back
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.560]  about five more minutes with Joe Beggs and with the other reporters if Josh wants
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.240]  to give us his take on things or Zimmerman and then we'll go to a
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:57.960]  Dmitri Robert Courtney and many others that are patiently holding on a lot of shows
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.760]  Monsanto going to trial for crimes against humanity that's right one of
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.560]  the most hated companies in the world will have to answer for its reign of
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.680]  toxic ecological terror several activist groups joined by food and farming
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.760]  experts are suing Monsanto but the way they plan on having Monsanto answer for
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.800]  their crimes may surprise you and may be caused for concern the International
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.480]  Court in the Hague Netherlands will use the UN's guiding principles on business
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.800]  and human rights which was developed in 2011 to assess damages for Monsanto's
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.400]  acts against human life and environment the court will also rely on the Rome
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.640]  statute created at the International Criminal Court in the Hague in 2002 so if
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.400]  this group is successful in suing Monsanto for crimes against humanity
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.080]  this will unfortunately open up the floodgates for companies all over the
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.640]  world to have fines and penalties weighed against them under an
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.200]  international tribunal this is exactly what giant bureaucracies want to do with
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.680]  the TPP but it's not really meant for large businesses it's meant to go after
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.680]  small businesses and individuals to get rid of competition Rob Dew reporting
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:02.760]  for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news and it's that type of
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:07.360]  behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical

[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.440]  are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no wonder they can't
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.480]  focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs working
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.800]  with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality

[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.640]  network
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:33.040]  the television left allied with radical Islam is truly disgusting but it's worse
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.720]  than that the republican leadership continues to allow hundreds of
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.160]  thousands of radicals to come into the United States every year and believe me
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.880]  the folks coming out of Syria and other countries are extremely radical and they
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.000]  are not compatible with western civilization they fight with each other
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.320]  and kill each other constantly over tiny disagreements on religion this is
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:04.840]  truly barbarous dark age type idiocy at the same time the left is trying to
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:11.480]  ban Christmas here's the story up on info wars dot com universities across the
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:19.440]  country deemed secret Santa mistletoe colors red green to be politically
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.840]  incorrect it's also sexual harassment at mistletoe so see they all mix it
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.440]  together new guidelines demand holiday celebrations are not a Christmas party in
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.800]  disguise we have to talk about don't disguise your Christmas party or will
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.640]  ban it you've seen the rioting the freaking out but you've got a band
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:49.280]  Halloween I might see the costume I don't do it I mean look at the photo if
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.880]  you're a TV viewer of a man and woman kissing each other with mistletoe and
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.600]  then go to the front page of info wars calm and look at the head of ISIS that
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.920]  this family there's this husband and wife pledged allegiance to and just look at
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.160]  the difference that's how we want to be in the west happy having a nice
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.640]  Christmas and then we got these other people running around killing each
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.200]  other and killing Muslims that don't want to be radicals and killing every
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.480]  Christian they get their hands on and I'm just sick of it and I just want to
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:23.720]  say the left are a sickening group of the Talitarian filth that's all I can
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.160]  say and I've had enough that scroll up a little bit on info wars because it says
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.840]  it all those images look at radical Islam then look at Christianity you can
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.040]  say well Christianity and people red and wearing red and white hats and a
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.640]  Christmas tree it doesn't matter it's part of the Christian culture mixed with
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.720]  European culture and it is about Christ and the system wants to get rid of it
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.360]  because it's pretty and it's happy and it's about Ebenezer Scrooge giving us
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.440]  money to the poor and it's about real liberalism and they don't like it
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:06.720]  because they're totalitarian scum there it is the Boston Post Christmas band in
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:14.680]  Boston and even back 300 years ago some of the Christian churches tried to ban
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.680]  it saying it was sacrilege and wasn't properly being engaged in because
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.160]  folks like to go out and dance and sing and have a little bit of fun and I'm
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.200]  against radical Christianity trying to control people because we don't have
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.520]  state-run religion in this country the separation church and state means the
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:39.040]  government has no jurisdiction in religion now if someone in a religion
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.760]  breaks the law then that's a different subject altogether but as long as you
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:49.480]  don't do that there is no jurisdiction well planning suicide vests and pipe
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.560]  bombs and planning to go kill everybody at work for the jihad you pledge the
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:59.720]  legions to under ISIS orders to commit jihad is a premeditated plan to commit
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:05.040]  mass murder and is illegal but they admit under political correctness couldn't do
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.320]  it and now attacker pledged allegiance to ISIS official say that is the
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.640]  Associated Press that is CNN as well but that's hardly even the news they're
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.880]  still on a lot of channels because we've got all of them on around here all the
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:24.120]  big ones each room is different CNN MSNBC CNBC ABC Fox they're still acting
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.920]  like it could be workplace violence I guess World War two was workplace
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.720]  violence or 9-11 was workplace violence or I guess the theater attack three weeks
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.400]  ago was workplace violence no this is the beginning of another attack and of
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.240]  more attacks just like they said the Fort Hood killing 14 people under Al Qaeda
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:50.240]  command saying he did it for Al Qaeda and for the Taliban made your ass on it not
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.240]  a terror attack attacks on recruiting centers not a tax attack in Garland not
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.800]  an attack all these attacks not attacks can you imagine if Christians were
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.200]  running around doing something like this you'd never hear the end of it so now
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.080]  that they have been proven liars that this was a terror attack and they tried
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.520]  to cover it up the first day and a half now they're shifting gears saying we say
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.680]  it didn't happen so get this through your head Washington Post New York Times
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:27.040]  CNN MSNBC and I know you'll lie and won't won't tell the truth it's for your
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.760]  viewers that'll come find us later and for others to know the truth we never
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:37.240]  said that we never said the moon landings didn't happen I never said
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.960]  there were giant wasp living under the UN building of its space aliens live under
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.760]  the UN I don't cover space aliens and by the way folks can you guys find Rachel
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.720]  Maddow says Alex Jones believes in giant wasp under the under the I mean
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.640]  she actually said that so see this is what they're doing they're so desperate
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.880]  they go on the news and they go Donald Trump says he hates Mexicans never said
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:07.480]  it Donald Trump says he wants 5 million to go on the CNN debate it's gonna be the
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.480]  highest rate because it's the last one he said I want you to give 5 million to
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.520]  wounded warrior or I won't do it tongue-in-cheek to point out they're
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.400]  not giving money to veterans and what they do at hundreds of publications they
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.200]  lied about him by saying he wanted money for himself this is the nature of their
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.000]  deception and why do you think Donald Trump came on this show and why my
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.440]  respect went up for him from about 60 70 80% growing the last few months to like
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:41.200]  95% because he did it to signal that the mainstream media is dead he did it to
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.160]  signal that he's not a coward just like Matt Drudge did he did it to signal
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.720]  he's aware of how much trouble we're in to everybody he knows they're gonna go on
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.000]  there and misrepresent what I stand for when he stands for it it was in over
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.320]  2,000 newspapers two days ago over 400 yesterday and several hundred today you
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.920]  can just type in Donald Trump Alex Jones click Google News see what day they are
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:09.760]  they bunch him in different groups 1600 here 400 there 500 here 200 here 80
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:17.080]  something here that's how desperate they are that's how pathetic they are that's
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.400]  how dying they are politically that they have to engage in all out lies I
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.200]  expect them to climb on a child molester next or a rapist I mean that's
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.760]  really all they haven't done well no no wait a minute Bill O'Reilly did say we've
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.320]  got to stop sex offenders online and stalking of women and then cut to a clip
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.000]  of me yelling and screaming about a police brutality case that had nothing
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.560]  to do with women and just said we've got to stop the perverts I didn't settle a
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.520]  case for the woman over perverts stuff like you bill O'Reilly you piece of
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.640]  trash I mean I don't want to get into bashing people but that's a low blow
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.520]  folks there's never been an allegation never a claim never done nothing of me
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.720]  doing something sexual online to women you sir are a fraud and in the old days
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.200]  I'd call you out in the street and I'm sure you're a tough guy your dad was a
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.840]  big tough New York Irish cop doesn't matter I'm in the right and I will kick
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.920]  your ass Bill O'Reilly for claiming stuff like that now I'm not saying I'll do
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.840]  something to him where he goes and calls the police on me he does that if he
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.880]  doesn't agree with a caller he calls the police on him and you know has his
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.360]  security go after him it just makes me so mad that I'm sitting there going next
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.080]  they'll say I'm a sex abuser and then I go away that they already did that I
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.920]  mean the point is folks they're going to try to destroy me because I tell the
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:36.200]  truth just be ready for that going back to Joe Biggs to the bottom of the hour

[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.840]  talking we're trying to get it back it's that they've put us in the story they
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.080]  lie about us they misrepresent they twist and this is what they do so we
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.480]  went to this one of these more famous centers Islamberg and actually put a
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.400]  drone over it to document or flew a drone along the property line to try to
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.760]  document exactly what's going on there and as soon as we get Joe Biggs back
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.640]  we'll cover it just please we need your prayers we need your support we need you
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.600]  to realize we're having an effect that's why we're under enemy attack when
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.720]  you're over the target folks that's when you get the flak you zero in on that
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:36.760]  we've got discovery channel level quality cameras now that just got amazing
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.840]  footage in the drone and on the ground beautiful area of upstate New York my
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.040]  god the one of the European settlers want to live there and others just
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:51.160]  gorgeous talk about last the Mohicans I mean this is it and info wars reporters
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.400]  have now been quizzed by terrorist task force about what they were planning to
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.360]  do well I mean that's not the story the story is homeland security tracks
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:06.200]  reporters not jihadists not the people that attacked and I mean when you're
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.760]  talking to the high-level anti-terrorism task force people going well we don't
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:15.240]  really think you're planning anything violent were you so come on so Joe
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:20.200]  Biggs is back Joe we're going to break in a moment but tell us about Islamberg
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.320]  and what you discovered there as we show some of this drone footage well I
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.120]  wasn't gonna say this too though I wrote this little thing down says if it's
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.160]  ISIS and his climate change Islamic jihadists then it's workplace violence
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.040]  terrorism then it's Christians you know when this attack on San Bernardino first
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.560]  happened people jumped out and said it was three white men who did this a
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.320]  Reverend Horton he just texted me sent me a screenshot of that article where
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.240]  they said three white men and then you have liberals all across the country

[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.000]  guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.920]  School and the massacre at Aurora Colorado were actually fake they were
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.800]  faked as an excuse to take away our guns and enslave us to the giant wasps who
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.340]  have beneath the UN building or whatever the same guy who says the
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.120]  Boston bombing was also fake it was faked for political purposes the same
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.120]  guy who says he doesn't believe the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster actually
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.080]  happened doesn't believe there was actually an Oklahoma City bombing
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.680]  naturally of course he also knows and sells the idea that 9-11 wasn't inside
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:25:02.840]  job that is all either total lies are twisted I said Oklahoma City happened
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.000]  but criminal elements of the government were involved that's been in the LA
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:16.200]  Times that's been in the New York Times that's been in lawsuits I did not say
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.720]  that Columbia disaster did not happen I said the San Francisco Chronicle reported
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.360]  that they saw lasers hit it and then the FBI seized footage out of a telescope
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.640]  at a university showing that it was basically shot by a laser from the
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:37.640]  ground I just read a newspaper article and then they said that I said that
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:44.120]  didn't happen I didn't say there's wasp under the buildings any of that so this
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.080]  is what they do folks they're getting desperate now Joe you're out in front of
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.320]  the Islamic Center for some reason the skype's breaking down I want you to get
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.600]  back out there and start reporting and doing a great job other key points that
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.720]  need to be made and then Islamaberg I want to talk about that someone will
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.280]  play some of the footage in the background while you discuss what
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:05.480]  happened in New York yeah well Islamaberg is a very an interesting place
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.000]  you know a lot of secrecy surrounds that individual location and like we said
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.480]  before that was a location that was started and founded in 1982 by Moon
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.680]  Bark Ali Jalani out of Pakistan now he's the guy who is also the head of the
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.360]  alfucra terrorism organization now the funny thing is the White House denies
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.960]  any kind of terrorist links but the State Department says that there is
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.800]  terrorism links to alfucra they were involved in a couple bombings and
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.400]  assassination attempts across the world now their front in America is Muslims of
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:40.920]  America that's something that Moon Bark Ali Jalani also started as well and
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:46.920]  that is where Islamberg comes in that whole place is run by Muslims of
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.440]  America and that there's another location in York South Carolina called the
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.200]  holy Islam bill which is also started by that guy and you know there's two sides
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.920]  of the story when you go out here and when you look at this you've got a lot
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.360]  of locals that have been emailing us saying that they're scared to go into
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.520]  at the Hancock or scared to shop because of the crazy jihadists that are
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.400]  there and then you've got people like the sheriff or the chief of police and
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:14.200]  deposit New York was just which is just at the bottom of the mountain who thinks
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.080]  that overall from the outside looking in they seem to be peaceful people but
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:22.720]  they do dress very militant he says he's seen them weapons he's heard the shots
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.320]  fired and explosions things like that they do everything internally they are
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:33.000]  governed by Sharia law they have their own newspaper that they put out the fact
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.880]  they've only let a few people in there to actually report mostly have been Arab
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.120]  TV stations Reuters I believe was letting there once a while back but the
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.280]  secrecy surrounding it the fact that we have this wide open border situation the
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.120]  fact that Obama purposely wants to bring in these radical jihadis put them in
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.240]  place it's not that hard to believe that a place like that in New York and
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.200]  Hancock would be picked by someone like that to go and stay at and live in
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.600]  absolutely and the media won't report on it the elephant in the room is we're
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:12.640]  seeing serious jihad attacks this is like the fifth in a year in the United
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.960]  States and the media is trying to cover it up they're not gonna be able to cover
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.920]  it up making stuff up about giant wasp yeah mass shootings are happening at it
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.400]  as alarming rates so it's that's definitely something that's getting out
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.240]  of control so that's the whole thing I don't know why people are concerned
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.800]  about us going and trying to look into this stuff like I said that that's a
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.520]  spot that if I were someone coming over to America I wanted to be left alone to
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.520]  be able to play in something that's the kind of place I would pick all I'm
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.840]  doing is putting myself in their shoes and thinking where would I go so I
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:47.080]  wouldn't be bothered so I'd be able to play in what I want to do and carry that
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.440]  out they pick places like that so that's all we're doing is we're going in
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.920]  we're investigating we're showing the people that it's a very secretive place
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.920]  it's hard to get in there they want to vet everyone that comes through and then
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.160]  the fact that we go there and Josh and I are called by the terrorism task force
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.760]  out of the New York State Police is just beyond and they know everything about
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.520]  shit admit they're at a threat fusion center with Homeland Security tracking
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.600]  but they don't know where the ISIS jihadis are though they don't know
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.760]  where they are but they know where everyday Americans are patriots are
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.880]  they know where we are they're keeping an eye on us Alex that's right Joe I'm

[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:04.600]  Hillary Clinton recently said that all rape victims should be believed so
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:09.760]  during a campaign event in New Hampshire today she was confronted by a woman in
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.440]  the audience who asked her about the women who accused her husband of rape
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.960]  that all rape victims should be believed but would you say that about
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.400]  Johnny to Broderick Kathleen Wiley and or Paula Jones should we believe them as
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:29.040]  well well I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:33.520]  are disbelieved based on evidence well based on the evidence Hillary your
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.680]  husband has a long history of sexual assault and rape what Hillary is the
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.080]  one who runs the cover-up Hillary is the point person to silence these women
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.640]  unless they get in the way of the Clintons lust for power and wealth that
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:52.240]  was political strategist Roger Stone on the Alex Jones show talking about his

[01:33:53.640 --> 01:34:00.920]  one constant in history is that tyrants and oligarchies fall and they've used a
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:04.000]  lot of high-tech systems to try to scramble people's brains and confuse
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.800]  folks and a lot of just outright lies but it doesn't really work as good as it

[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:37.520]  here in just a moment a lot of folks listening and watching on Roku and on
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:43.760]  boxy and on other cable and smart TV systems I don't even recognize I tell
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.560]  the fastest growing area of our viewer and listenership is people's TVs which
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.680]  are just computers now and the show is exploding and I don't say that to brag
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:57.560]  but in the media landscape it's more competitive than ever we're just getting
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.440]  bigger exponentially at the founder of the weather channel on yesterday and he's
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.760]  like yeah I was watching your show yesterday and then we talked to him off
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.520]  air and he's a listener for a long time and there's not many people we run into
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.280]  that aren't listeners even our enemies know who we are now just the average
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.560]  person on the street you know at least has some notion of what info wars is and
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.680]  then they actually find the show and find out it's not what they thought it was
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.480]  then they ask why do they have CNN and MSNBC saying stuff like he hates black
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:36.240]  people and believe giant wasp live under the UN building none of it's true they
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:41.000]  can't show me saying it and then people ask why are they doing that well let's
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.320]  just say they're vampires folks and I've got a big old bag of stakes wooden oak
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:54.560]  stakes on my back and I got a big hammer and I know who these people are and I
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.040]  know how to beat them and that's just straight up going I'm not arguing with

[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.480]  Dmitry in Ohio you're on the air worldwide listening on the free iPhone
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:59.440]  app go ahead sir yes can you okay yes I can brother all right just wanted to
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.840]  touch on this couple points first of I think that's when we use or Radical
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:12.240]  Islam or moderate Islam we're kind of playing part of the game that the
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:19.880]  leftist want us to play first of all the Quran which is the most people don't
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:24.080]  have never read the Quran they don't even know you know what this whole
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:30.080]  religion is about you know I mean most of the Muslim 90 plus percent of the
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:33.640]  Muslims have never read the Quran and they don't even know what religion there
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.480]  is I've seen the videos where street preachers read out of the Quran the
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.720]  Muslims that I can't believe it yeah exactly and it Paul Watson you're one
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:49.080]  of your reporters he has he has it down the closest out of you know all of you
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:52.240]  guys I mean I I love you and all this everything you're doing well that's
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.040]  because he's in London and it's basically turned into Islamabad yeah so I
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:04.120]  would I would suggest to get an expert a caller on on this really on this
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.240]  religion or on this topic like Osama duck duck he's the best guy I know that is
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:13.880]  the most knowledgeable in this his website is best straight way that word
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.560]  all right I will look into that brother and I appreciate your call here's the
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:23.520]  deal Islam had a period of about 400 years where it was not warlike where
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.400]  they saved ancient text when they were promoting peace and actually the West
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:35.360]  was more warlike and barbarous it is true that radical Islam is taking over
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.000]  Islam right now and I get that people don't want to criticize those Islam in
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.960]  general so they call it radical Islam but there really is radical Islam trying
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.520]  to take over other Islamic groups that are peaceful and they really are
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:54.760]  persecuting so I personally know that there's a lot of stuff I could agree
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.720]  with in the Quran I've actually read the Quran it's not that long I've read it
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.920]  front to back back when I was in college I've scanned over it since then and
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:10.200]  it's it basically has a whole bunch of different views and it's like Muhammad
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.360]  writing about a bunch of different groups and tribes and organizations and he
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:16.000]  says one thing in one chapter another and another and you have to look at it
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.160]  and say well that's in the particular situation it's kind of situational
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.120]  ethics kind of like the Bible has some of that too I'm not here to have a war
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.600]  with Islam the globalists want to create a class of civilizations why they're
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.480]  bringing in radicals it's why they're bringing in hardcore Sunnis that lost
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.880]  the takeover of Syria so far knowing they'll blow stuff up and kill people
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:39.680]  and then they're gonna say they're not Islamists turn your guns in I mean this
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.480]  is how dumb they think we are they're gonna let them in let them attack and
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:48.640]  then take our guns so we can't defend ourselves but I hear you you've Saudi
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.480]  Arabia and others in their attempt to take over of all forms of Islam are
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.080]  successful all of Islam will be radical will be dangerous and will want to chop
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.160]  your head off and take your daughter to basically a slate pit and that's true
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.080]  and our government is allied with radical Islam and then it attacks
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.360]  elements of Islam that are not attacking us it is very sick but the dominant
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:16.840]  Islam is Saudi Arabian Sunni Wahhabist craziness so a lot of us just
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:19.400]  intimidation in the government too they're bowing to it they're taking the
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:25.160]  money they are you know there's not just the weapons lobby in the military
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.760]  industrial complex in big pharma and the Jewish lobby in Hollywood and all the
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:36.760]  rest of it and in Wall Street there is a major Islamist lobby that spends
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.040]  hundreds of billions of dollars a year lobbying I've talked a long time about
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:45.360]  Saudi Arabia buying up Hollywood and Saudi Arabia you're moving in and
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:50.480]  muscling in on government China doing it as well people like oh yeah China runs
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.440]  Hollywood and the Arabs run Hollywood Alex oh what I said was is they were
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.000]  beginning to move in on it and now you see that there's not just one pig at the
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.480]  trough here of special interest are there leftist Israeli lobbies that try to
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.920]  get our guns and try to ban free speech try to federalize our police you bet am
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:14.800]  I against the ADL absolutely they've lost lawsuits lying about people they've
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:22.240]  said things about me that aren't true I mean I've been to an ADL meeting when
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:27.200]  they're trying to get guns banned at a big Jewish center in North Austin once
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.800]  they threw me out and that you'd have thought the devil had come in there but
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.000]  I don't project that on to all groups I don't project it on to Jews that there
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.720]  are some bad mafia organizations basically running many Jewish organizations
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:43.720]  in society I don't blame all the Muslims that they're run by hardcore death
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.680]  cults I'm just trying to put out the facts here and give people the benefit
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:52.000]  of the doubt I mean the white supremacist groups are completely
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:05.520]  globalist run and fed run I mean it's just we're a mess folks we're a mess let's talk to Courtney and Louisiana you're on the air thanks for holding you're watching on Roku
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:12.040]  hi Alex I just wanted to say that it's an honor to speak to you I actually have a
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:18.280]  nickname for you I call you the fearless leader of the resistance and and I just
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:24.840]  wanted to say that I have a way that we can prove how idiotic the lame string
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.240]  media is by wanting to blame a Christmas tree for that terrorist attack in

[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.320]  emotional and that's normal I mean we're going under sickening tyranny we're
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:56.160]  being conquered by evil right now and so we we all should have tears in our eyes

[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:31.560]  many occasions when I brought up the inverted reality points the cloud and
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.320]  hidden points I stay there then I don't want you to get cut off because you've
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.760]  been censored by others yes there is a move and I've confirmed it across AMFM
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.640]  stations across the country even so-called conservative ones the big
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.160]  banks are removing financing corporations aren't advertising with them
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:52.200]  there's an ordered campaign to bring down talk radio where the most popular
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:57.280]  conservative hosts at stations are being fired or removed including right here in
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.920]  Austin Texas to shout us out my dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.480]  late last year just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.

[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.600]  that I warned that dot-com companies would crash and they did those who
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:34.880]  listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.200]  stock market this will affect us all I've posted a free video at dollar

[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.840]  don't like to complain stations are owned by who stations are owned but to a
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:48.680]  great extent clear channels been taken over by some big leftist money I'm not
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.080]  on clear channel that still affects talk radio a lot of the big regional
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.880]  stations and networks have been sold they've got sponsor coalitions that
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:04.800]  very quietly offer big amounts of money from hospital coalitions that are for
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:10.760]  Obamacare to you name it that's happened here in Austin and they will come in and
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.680]  I mean spend millions of dollars in a year millions per station if it's a big
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.480]  one to change the format and I know you've been noticing last year suddenly
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:26.200]  staple conservatives on the morning and the afternoon on your stations have been
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:32.360]  going away haven't they haven't they I've confirmed from high-level people and at
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:38.280]  the low level and the mid-level at every level the last year really longer you
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:43.000]  notice we were taking off XM been on its six years there were good people at
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.040]  clear channel that just wanted to have ratings and be successful they had me on
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.840]  a libertarian channel it was hugely successful they had a lot of subscribers
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.720]  well it then came in big globalist companies I'm not going to get into all
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:56.680]  the details but it's been in the news and they took over and kicked off hundreds
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:00.840]  of conservative shows it didn't just stop there now all that people do is they
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.400]  get the free iPhone app they go listen on the internet they watch on their TV
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.720]  now they're moving to want to block that and not let that be on Roku or boxy or
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  Apple TV Apple you know came to us repeatedly one arm of it said hey put
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:18.400]  all your films on then they would just refuse them and not say why once we
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.760]  pay the thousands of dollars have them converted to their format Google wouldn't
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.240]  let us sell the Obama deception on their shopping cart six years ago remember
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:34.800]  that said it was racist they can't beat us in the theater of ideas and so they're
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:38.480]  doing it by just trying to get us off the mediums but it's not it's not just
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:43.360]  info wars that's why you better spread the word about info wars or any other
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:48.360]  patriot type show because there is a move to shut us down because we're so
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:55.120]  popular because we are so successful wildly successful they can't put us in
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.680]  the boxing ring when we weigh 800 pounds and convince press 10 million pounds
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.960]  compared to a chicken neck snot-nosed globalist that weighs 45 pounds and has
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.720]  pus dripping out of its eyeballs I mean you know there's just globalist rats is
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:14.320]  what we're talking about here nobody scum trash collaborators enemies who want
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:17.240]  to tell you there's no Islamic terror and want to tell you it's your fault
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.840]  there's mass shootings people are sick of that but they can't have anybody out
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.960]  there to let you know you're not alone to let you know you are common sense they
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.040]  want to make you think you're crazy where there's no one out there agreeing
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:33.680]  with you no one out there to validate what you're saying Davi I apologize for
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:36.360]  ranting over you got about a minute and I have to finish up but I've been getting
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:40.960]  into the you call and even so-called conservative shows and you say things
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:45.400]  like you know well the things you were bringing up earlier they all your
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:49.280]  conspiracy theorists see and that's the gatekeeping if they don't do that they're
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.880]  fired go ahead yes I brought up the attack on the family what they had an
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:00.680]  article about children shouldn't be forced to say the words I'm sorry by
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.560]  their parents I called in on that show and that was like they let me say my
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:07.360]  point and then they cut me off they wouldn't even let me respond to the
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.600]  host who again was trying to make me sound like a nut oh yeah this is the
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.600]  force-feeding that your kids don't belong to you right and I told them that it
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:23.000]  was the agenda of the totalitarian left well of course that's that the moth let
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.760]  me guess do these guys claim they don't know they're Democrat or Republican they
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.280]  they act like they don't know because that's the memo they act like I don't
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:35.880]  know who I am and they sit there praying on you with a job to suppress you stay

[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:41.880]  all all time all dimensions Amarillo by morning up from San Antonio I want to go
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:46.520]  back to Debbie who I've been cutting off I should do whole counter seminars to
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:51.040]  not just leftist and foundation seminar callers that for at least 25 years call
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.800]  him with talking points to major national shows and that's come out in
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:59.160]  Congress it's admitted Soros himself spent what I know of tens of millions
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:02.360]  just on seminar callers that's a conservative number he spends billions
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.560]  a year on different things obviously g-hot operations right-wing Nazi
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:12.360]  overthrow operations mass criminal activity operations you name it I mean
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:17.280]  he literally is beyond a specter commander from a James Bond movie he
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.360]  actually does poorly have cats I guess it maybe it's maybe the characters based
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:27.800]  on him but talk radio I've been told by local host I've been told by folks that
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.600]  I've known for 20 years I've been told by staples around the country that
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:38.800]  they're called in in the last two years and told you stop bashing Obama saying
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.680]  there's a criminal takeover saying all the stuff's really happening or you're
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:45.680]  gonna be off the air and your people are like but I have top ratings I'm popular
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:52.360]  they go doesn't matter and some of them go along with it some of them don't and
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:55.640]  this is what's happening they do not want you to have any communications
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:01.720]  medium and they're getting rid of most people locally and they're trying to get
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:05.040]  clear channel to axe Limbaugh and a bunch of other folks when their contracts
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:11.040]  and limbaugh knows not perfect people but the point is if they can kill talk
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.560]  radio they can kill it all and they've told Matt drudge and others the
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:21.120]  Supreme Court that this is happening next year well I'm seeing go on and I'm
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:24.800]  seeing them play every dirty trick they can to shut off our sponsors well you
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.000]  know I saw you try that years ago I said you know what I'll just direct sell
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.560]  myself see how you like that I mean I adapt I overcome with God's good
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.400]  graces with the brain God gave me but Debbie let me guess give us some of the
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.600]  topics you call in with when they call you a conspiracy theorist like when we
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:46.320]  said two days ago these guys were jihadis and we were conspiracy theorist and so
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.400]  that's what they do if you say the skies blue they say that it's a trick and then
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:52.120]  let me guess and correct me if I'm wrong don't disagree with me I mean I know you
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:56.000]  won't but do they act like they're kind of conservative kind of liberal because
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.440]  that's the new disinfo op is this wishy-wash thing and then they sit there
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:05.200]  and really squat on top the conservatives and then scream the calls to try to get
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.640]  the liberals on go ahead yes that's exactly what they did to me and then I
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:14.000]  got angry and I said to my husband do you believe this did you did you hear it's
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.280]  a label I was treated yeah and I would get angry and he would go well you know
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.640]  they have to play kind of the middle and I was like but let me finish my point let
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.680]  me at least answer like he lets everybody else answer but they hang up on me and
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:30.640]  real man it's a playbook I've talked to probably let's not exaggerate I've been
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.880]  to some of the big conferences and stuff in fact a couple of money to announce I
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:37.640]  was that just I could really talk to people everyone's being told you do this
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:43.920]  or you're fired so this is what they do and it's not both sides people don't
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.760]  want that they can get MSNBC if they want both sides a pack of liars if you
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.160]  talk about what's happening in this country they fire you they don't care
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.840]  about ratings because the big hospital groups and others don't want Obamacare
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:01.280]  repealed I know for a fact I'm not gonna get into it because it's off record the
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:04.480]  fact that I was told all this stuff so I'm just gonna shut up right now just
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:10.400]  just know what's going on people it's big okay I just you people wouldn't
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.520]  believe the amount of money being spent in fact it's actually a racket now to
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:18.560]  put me on the air for six months which is fine to actually have these people
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:23.760]  come buy out the time to get me off air and then as soon as that money goes up
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.280]  the stations put me back on to get the money again so I say fine let the
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:31.520]  stations do it to survive whatever I'm just telling you folks we're dealing
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.320]  with a criminal operation go ahead I tried to tell them about the flu shot
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.440]  fraud my father-in-law was dr. Richard wheeling from Valhalla New York who
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:48.000]  died in 2011 who told me never get a flu shot same as dr. group and I brought
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.040]  that up on a show when they were talking about the vaccines and they're like oh
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.360]  well there's no proof that there's no you held so much I'm gonna finish again
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.000]  then more calls and then I'm going to Paul Watson
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.600]  Monsanto going to trial for crimes against humanity that's right one of
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.360]  the most hated companies in the world will have to answer for its reign of
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.520]  toxic ecological terror several activist groups joined by food and farming
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:14.600]  experts are suing Monsanto but the way they plan on having Monsanto answer for
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:18.640]  their crimes may surprise you and may be caused for concern the International
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:22.320]  Court in the Hague Netherlands will use the UN's guiding principles on business
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:26.640]  and human rights which was developed in 2011 to assess damages for Monsanto's
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.240]  acts against human life and environment the court will also rely on the Rome
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:34.280]  statute created at the International Criminal Court and the Hague in 2002 so
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:38.240]  if this group is successful in suing Monsanto for crimes against humanity
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:41.920]  this will unfortunately open up the floodgates for companies all over the
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:45.120]  world to have fines and penalties weighed against them under an international
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.880]  tribunal this is exactly what giant bureaucracies want to do with the TPP but
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:51.840]  it's not really meant for large businesses it's meant to go after small

[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:29.520]  does he. Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones. You only live
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:35.040]  once on this plane of existence my friends. To fill your destiny and not be a
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:40.120]  slave program by the globalist. Rediscover human liberty and take action.
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:43.440]  I'm gonna go to a few more calls and Paul Watson will take calls with Paul
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:48.120]  Watson. I start hyperventilating and ranting when I talk about how this
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.880]  system's trying to kill talk radio, the war on talk radio, the war on free
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:57.880]  speech, the war on internet free speech, how they are purging local hosts around
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:05.400]  the country with advertising money. I mean it is really really really a big deal
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:09.880]  and I'm just too classy with stations we worked with for decades in some cases
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:19.320]  when I'm told stuff off record to divulge it but I tell you one has to
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:26.000]  wonder if this stuff's legal that's going on. But it's going on and it's going on
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.840]  because we're hurting the globalist. They used to think we were a joke. They
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.000]  don't think we're a joke now and again I want to be clear not Alex Jones. It's the
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.240]  thousands of hosts around the country. That's why I told people forever. If you
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.160]  got a business or whatever, you're successful. You got to go buy time on a
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:45.960]  local AM or FM that's got some decent ratings. You can buy time on the weekend
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:49.720]  for nothing. Start telling patriots about it and that one show can organize a
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:55.200]  political movement in your town or city that has a big effect. Well the globalist
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:02.160]  now know about that and they they are fighting that tooth and nail because
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.880]  believe me when tyranny comes in people really start listening to patriots. Now
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:12.240]  I'm one of the biggest fish in this fight so a lot of what they do to me
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:18.920]  bounces off. Though they've got their licks in but my scars make me strong but
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:22.520]  believe me I know how real this is because I've dealt with these people for a
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.800]  long time and all the sellouts. You know our big problem isn't the evil people
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.280]  it's all the sellouts that know what's going on and apologize about it and go
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.920]  gosh it's really real. Police chiefs and so many others that aren't even bad
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.920]  people they'll tell you yeah I know I know you're telling the truth now and I
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:44.560]  boy I don't know about this but I just got to go along with it though Alex
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.080]  because you know not all of us are gonna fight it like you I mean how do you
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:51.280]  fight it anyways I mean it's so big. It's like going in with your X-wings against
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:54.960]  the Death Star and saying look at the size of that thing folks we're gonna lose
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:59.480]  it all if we don't go in against this don't you understand that and the fact
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.400]  it's so big makes it easier to take it on it's so illegitimate it's so criminal
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.880]  it's so over-the-top and 98% of the evil is coming by good men and women being
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.400]  hin-packed bullied by political correctness to submit and now the
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:18.200]  sun's setting now they want to start arresting people and shutting down free
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.520]  speech and really coming after us there they admit the the armored vehicles
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.400]  aren't for Al Qaeda or ISIS or the jihadis that just hit us again they
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:33.240]  say it's for veterans gun owners Christians libertarians and that we're
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:37.640]  gonna have a war with the feds well what are they gonna do that's so bad that
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:44.520]  we'll be forced into a war you think about that they know when they start
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:48.480]  general gun confiscation and when they false flag and blaming on patriots that
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:52.600]  people aren't gonna go down to the police station and then people start
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:55.720]  disappearing oh they're just being interrogated they were just sent to the
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:01.600]  reeducation center they even call it a reeducation center in the 2012 army
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.720]  document that's it army dot mill I'm gonna say that again very slowly army dot
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.800]  mill has scores of white papers that will pull them up put them on screen for
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.040]  TV viewers admitting the preparation to round up the tea party and put you in
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.800]  camps so how do they respond they come out with Jade Helm about mastering the
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:28.440]  human domain about dominating about taking over and then we say look it's
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.840]  more conditioning for a takeover down the road and then they misrepresent and
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:37.520]  say that we're saying that the military's gonna take over and kill us this
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.800]  summer and then it doesn't happen it's all disinfo hoaxes army regulation 210
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:47.280]  dash 35 civilian and main labor camp program boom that's one of them also
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:50.920]  just type in reeducation camp army document that'll bring up that
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.880]  resettlement document here's a new article just went up on info wars calm
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:02.600]  Muslim migrants display it open or die banner at Macedonian border attack
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:08.840]  police open or die Greece and Macedonia formerly part of Greece's where
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:14.960]  Alexander the Great came from are not letting them in Turkey is as a direct
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:21.200]  conduit and they are killing and attacking people open or die submit or
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:29.400]  die and look all military age men wearing their designer clothing they
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:32.800]  want to make their mark they want to be a man they already had their jihad in
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:38.440]  Syria now they're coming to the West and the people running the government not
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:43.120]  the soldiers but the ones running the governments want to bring them in so they
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:45.720]  can then dominate control the population Debbie I've been ranting over
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:48.760]  you then I'm going to Watson and we'll take calls with Randy and others while
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.280]  Watson's on but you being censored trying to call and talk radio as a
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:58.680]  conservative this is done by design you know it's not just some goofy host this
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:04.640]  is a trend by design with big advertisers mainly in health care
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:09.680]  insurance and banking and governmental saying we will not sponsor you if you
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:15.560]  have true patriot programming on go ahead yep now absolutely I've basically
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.640]  covered as many points that I could think of while I was on hold but I just
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.960]  want to say Merry Christmas and God bless you all it and so was and thank you
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.880]  so much for all you do you really are fantastic and I adore you well now man
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:32.880]  please don't thank me I want to explain something I know this is a death battle I
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.640]  mean I've risked my life I know it's real I've been there I've seen it I've been
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:39.680]  attacked I've been threatened they've tried to buy me off I mean I know we're
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.080]  going down we're being taken over how could I sit here and not be crazed I
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:47.360]  mean to control myself and watch the country killed in front of me where my
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:54.040]  kids live takes a lot of control I'm a realist and so as a man all I'm doing is
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.400]  trying to defend my family that's normal so don't thank me for doing the self
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:03.640]  preservation move that's why I get so angry at other men but they just don't
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:08.640]  see themselves in the role of being involved they think other men do that
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.720]  they're little boys and I'm not putting those men down a lot of those guys will
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:16.400]  get to fight with if you look at them wrong but they wouldn't get involved
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:22.000]  politically in their life dependent on it they got all the trappings to be in a
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.520]  tough guy but when it comes down to their country it's shelf going down where
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:31.560]  are they what are they doing let's go to Paul Joseph Watson with his daily update
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.640]  with us Paul Joseph Watson joining us from London England Paul so much is
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:39.800]  unfold you've got a new report out I knew you'd have a bunch of stuff you were
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:43.040]  working on you can now break it here on air I will tell you I was talking to
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:47.720]  bigs during the break they confirmed that in Dearborn when the attack happened
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:52.080]  two days ago fireworks were shot off two separate groups of people now they've
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:56.520]  got other groups telling them fireworks were shot off Allah Akbar was announced
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:02.960]  and even played on loudspeakers so this is really getting bad Paul Joseph Watson
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:07.640]  but why would they be celebrating an act of workplace violence Alex I mean that
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:12.960]  makes no sense right so now we know the female attacker pledged allegiance to
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:18.200]  ISIS right before she launched this massacre a pro-ISIS media group is
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:22.440]  saying that followers of ISIS carried out the attack we know they watched ISIS
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:28.160]  propaganda videos but the media a lot of it is still saying that this could just
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:32.320]  be workplace violence and now I don't know if you've covered this but in the
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:38.080]  past hour or so MSNBC basically just burst into the apartment belonging to
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:43.560]  these jihadists contaminating evidence looking at shredded files you know
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:47.480]  putting fingerprints on the walls by the way I agree with you I haven't covered
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:50.720]  this properly but you're absolutely right when I watched them rummaging through
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:55.160]  grabbing stuff clearly they are government arm a southern probably lost
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.680]  center arm they were getting in there to get stuff they're afraid the public's
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:01.920]  gonna get to I can't believe the police would let them in a crime scene
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:07.120]  something's going on here well at first they said oh we got the landlord's
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:11.120]  permission but now he's saying they rushed into the apartment without his
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:15.200]  permission you know they're picking up drivers license how is this not still a
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:19.120]  crime scene if you've got accomplices we know they had neighbors who reported
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.840]  multiple Middle East men in that area how do they not know that other
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.640]  accomplices could have been in that apartment now they can cover it all the
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:31.480]  fingerprints it's a cover up completely ludicrous and notice who they sent in
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:37.240]  MSNBC I'm telling you folks MSNBC sits up in big conference rooms in basically
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:42.520]  military command their trendy outfits are you are our uniforms to fool the
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:46.640]  public okay you know the cute little shirts and all of it literally folks
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.720]  they are in military meetings with the CIA okay and top government
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.440]  psychiatrist this is even come out to Jack so is seeing in I cannot quote to
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:02.480]  you enough of how sinister these people are go ahead well another thing that
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.000]  you're gonna love Alex and this is on my Twitter page if you just scroll down a
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.360]  little bit they can throw up on screen the New Yorker came out with its new
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:16.960]  issue for December 14th and it's a drawing it's a cartoon of two Americans
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.400]  buying assault rifles and they're white this is supposed to represent what
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:26.680]  happened in San Bernardino it's a white couple shopping for assault rifles and
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:34.240]  groceries completely ludicrous and again you go back to for example salon.com
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.800]  you know after the Boston bombings salon.com said quote Muslims don't need
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:43.920]  to apologize for the saunas but after the Dillon Roof Charleston massacre they
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:49.600]  said quote white America must answer for the Charleston church massacre now what
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:55.160]  are they saying in the aftermath of this jihadist slaughter again go back to
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:00.680]  Dillon Roof they said quote white America is complicit so Islam must
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:06.560]  answer for the attacks and is complicit according to their yardstick yeah but
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.960]  this is what they actually said Saeed Farouk is an American let's stop the
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:14.640]  Muslim debate and take a close look at ourselves
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:19.920]  meanwhile he's watching ISIS propaganda videos he's radicalized he goes to Saudi
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:24.840]  Arabia they're pledging allegiance to ISIS online but again it's nothing to do
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:30.320]  with Islam the religion of peace but again it's completely disparate. Now let's
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.000]  remember this is White House connected Southern Primary Law Center connected
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.760]  media matters connected salon that has written five articles I know of saying
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:44.080]  that pedophilia is loving. Oh yeah they've completely jumped the shark at this
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:50.080]  point but again it it goes let's just remember that they don't think pedophilia
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:55.360]  is a big deal. No exactly they think it's an alternative sexual lifestyle and
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:59.840]  they give platforms to wannabe child molesters to say that and it's trendy
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:04.980]  it's liberal but now of course the report this morning was the CNN
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:10.920]  analyst speculating that Farouk may have found the Christmas party offensive
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:15.840]  there's also a report saying that he had an argument with a Jewish person who was
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:21.280]  critical of ISIS and Islam. Yeah the first guy he reportedly moved away was the old
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:26.720]  Jewish guy. Yeah he's dead now so they're going back to this rhetoric about well
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:30.880]  maybe if he was offended then it's somewhat justified like the Charlie
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:36.280]  Hebdo cartoonist massacred in cold blood maybe they were provoking. Yeah he saw
[02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:42.520]  Christmas tree he saw it too he had to do it. But it gets even more serious when
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:46.160]  you understand this article which ties in with it which we can discuss more
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.320]  after the break. Universities deemed secrets and to mistletoe colors red and
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:54.840]  green to be politically incorrect. Yeah I skipped the break and I know you're
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:59.120]  focusing on this Islam radical Islam admits ISIS admits it's alloying with
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:03.320]  the left of the feminist this is the most oxymoronic gibbering weirdness I've
[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:08.280]  ever seen but they're now really doing it across the country ban Christmas you
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:12.960]  better not have a secret Christmas party at a college or the Dean's gonna expel
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:17.320]  you and meanwhile the attorney general has come out and gave a speech yesterday
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:21.800]  to a Muslim group she didn't go comfort the dead's family you know she went to
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:27.080]  comfort the Islamist and says that she promises to criminalize speech and says
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:31.720]  they will go after people criticizing Islam I mean what a dirtbag sorry go
[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:35.960]  ahead. Yeah in line with what's happening in Germany where they're going after
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:41.280]  people on Facebook who express criticism over the refugee invasion going after
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:45.440]  them with a secret Starzy but again going back to this Christmas issue you
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:50.000]  know for about a decade or more liberals have made fun of the war on
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:54.400]  Christmas and I agreed with them to some extent I thought it was overblown
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:59.600]  until now reading this which is universities and colleges across the
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:05.240]  country are publishing these advisories to staff and students telling them that
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:09.800]  they shouldn't have secret Santa they shouldn't have mistletoe they shouldn't
[02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:15.400]  include the colors red and green in their decorations at these holiday parties
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:21.760]  because it might offend some other even going after the neo pagan stuff that is
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:26.680]  nothing but a regurgitation of ancient Germanic wintertime cults to bring an
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:31.040]  evergreen in to the hot during the freezing cold because it smelled good
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:34.840]  and medically believed it was healthy and and they would also decorate it
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:40.720]  that's not even Christian they even want that band even Santa using the term
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:45.000]  secret Santa is now inappropriate they say that you've got to call it practical
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.400]  joke gift exchange or secret gift exchange because saying the word Santa
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:55.360]  might offend somebody it might trigger somebody and it might force them to you
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:23:00.040]  know curl up in a ball in their safe space so this is Ohio State University
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:06.160]  it's Cornell University UT Knoxville they're all imposing these guidelines
[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:10.200]  saying that these things are offensive which is funny because three days ago on
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:16.160]  Twitter I predicted that they would start saying mistletoe was rape culture that's
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:19.360]  what they're doing because they're saying that people may feel excluded from
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:24.000]  that and again this all sounds crazy but it's meant to be crazy they've got to be
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.400]  able to ban whatever they want because they control reality they say what is
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:33.880]  allowed to exist it's called cult level brainwashing yeah and remember this
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:39.000]  Halloween I mean this was this was this happened at Yale where they surrounded
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.600]  the professor in a in a group in a mob and basically shouted him down screamed
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:49.240]  and cried and wailed because he said that wearing a Halloween costume like a
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:54.960]  sombrero or whatever was not cultural appropriation and that you should not
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:59.160]  take offense to it but then what a woman then when a woman says she's black and
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:03.080]  she's not which is cultural appropriation that's okay it's just
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:09.680]  totally friendly so I mean at least these these legislate these lawmakers in
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:12.960]  Tennessee are speaking out against it they're calling for the chancellor to
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:18.000]  resign after they issued these guidelines so we'll see what what happens but you
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.520]  know maybe they're right I mean after all Farouk that San Bernardino shooter
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:26.920]  might have been offended by the Christmas party so we should probably ban
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:31.960]  Christmas so as not to be insensitive to the jihadists because they are
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.960]  special snowflakes they do have feelings and we should cater to them by
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:41.480]  banning Christmas so I actually agree with this Alex and let's expand on that
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:47.080]  this just in from a Don Salazar in full wars dot com war on Christmas proposed
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:51.320]  city ordinance would ban Christmas caroling this has been done in Germany
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:56.160]  and in Italy in some areas holiday revelers into free speech zones or safe
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:59.560]  places we have new footage at a university in London the University of
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:05.280]  London or even a leftist group was not even allowed to speak about the issue of
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:10.160]  Islam to an Islamic group that they were helping bring in and the Islamists
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:13.400]  began to scream and yell at them and shut the meeting down and the school
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:16.880]  basically agrees shut down free speech that's good residents of the town in
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:19.960]  Florida may be fined for performing Christmas carols on public sidewalks
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.960]  they were proposed city ordinance passes but see you're allowed to have free
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.880]  speech a citizen is warning city commissioners in winter park Florida
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:29.920]  will vote later this month on whether to pass an ordinance regulating street
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:35.120]  performers and creating designated public performance areas see there you go
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:40.880]  Paul Joseph Watson the tyranny is coming in like a flood let's talk to Randy in
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:48.240]  Canada you're on the air sir go ahead yeah hi Alex our Lord said I didn't come
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:53.320]  back to make peace but to divide so the division is happening through the New
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.720]  World Order through the energy through the death through the chaos he's
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:03.920]  dividing us right now so that's true and through you you see without you you
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:06.920]  they're putting that message out the people wouldn't get it wouldn't for
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:10.360]  you they wouldn't get the difference to weigh it to see the difference between
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:15.000]  right and wrong I get it the fire has to separate the impure metal from the
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.440]  gold and the wheat from the chaff I mean I understand that but the globalist
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:23.280]  create artificial divisions show that oh you're not for Caitlyn Jenner the
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:26.400]  you're hateful when they're stealing all of our basic rights so they create
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:29.720]  fake divisions but you're right there should be divisions between us in
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:34.880]  Nambla thing if you if you were it's another thing to say this people think
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:39.360]  I'm crazy to say it but Satan has been doing God's work since the Garden of
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:47.000]  Eden well God's work is free will so of course Satan is an agent who basically
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.320]  allows that free will to be tested I hear you it's an interesting point thank
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.120]  you for the call on the move quick Robert now about you're on the air with
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.760]  Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones go ahead hey how y'all doing today good
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:03.800]  brother yeah I just want to speak on something the caller before this just
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:09.560]  said is I've been blocked on Facebook multiple times I repost and retweet
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:15.200]  everything y'all have to say and every time it's the same message in proper
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:22.280]  content and don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that right now
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:29.480]  when everybody's just waking up when everybody who wants to be free that all
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:34.440]  the sudden now Christmas they want to get from us to absolutely well sir here's
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:37.720]  what's happening just so you know people say don't use Facebook they can censor
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:41.160]  you and they do improperly apply their rules it's not fair it's unfair trade
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.520]  practices in my view but we will still use the platform because we reached the
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:50.360]  sheeple there our reach in just the last month has quadrupled and is set to
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:55.160]  quintuple by next year just on the platform with Facebook so despite all
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:59.040]  their censorship what you do is you change our headlines you copy our text
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:03.480]  into your own deal that will get around a lot of their bots you jam them you put
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:07.680]  our text up on your own website and send that out you you test enemy
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:12.120]  operations literally this is enemy operations to get the transmissions
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:16.360]  through the picket line and so that's how you counter them it's how you deal
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:20.680]  with them but yes all of it but we operate in these platforms because these
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:25.120]  are the electronic battlefields great point Paul Joseph Watson we've dealt
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:28.880]  with a lot of this it gets worse and worse that's why we're going to expand
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:34.040]  our offensives in the face of their activities well at Facebook's being
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:39.240]  caught deleting posts that are quote sarcastic towards ISIS they suspended
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:43.960]  access to your account for days because we posted an image of an ISIS militant
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:49.760]  alongside a news story so there are always those kind of snafus my posts get
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:54.080]  reported all the time for quote nudity when it's just a link to a news article
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:58.800]  no nudity whatsoever but the good news is they don't normally delete them so
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.280]  when people complain on math it forces those kind of algorithm algorithms to
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:08.000]  reset themselves and you know if you if you throw mass outrage at it then they're
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.600]  not going to implement that as a policy so I think it's a getting a bit better
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:16.840]  than it used to be on Facebook from what I've seen absolutely and again we're
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:20.240]  just reporting on what's happening and we struck back we fought back they've
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:24.040]  backed off some so is YouTube YouTube just sent us an award and there are you
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:27.480]  know million subscribers or whatever one of our channels so there are a lot of
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:31.160]  good folks there a lot of bad folks there that's why we have to dominate the
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:34.880]  marketplace of ideas and not let them censor us they're afraid we're becoming
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:38.640]  mainstream Paul Watson great job we'll keep watching you're reporting this
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:43.240]  weekend at info wars.com we've got economic news coming up in your phone
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:46.320]  calls I'm Alex Jones
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:56.480]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.200 --> 02:30:04.480]  Hillary Clinton recently said that all rape victims should be believed so
[02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:09.680]  during a campaign event in New Hampshire today she was confronted by a woman in
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:14.360]  the audience who asked her about the women who accused her husband of rape
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:18.920]  hey that all rape victims should be believed but would you say that about
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:24.320]  Johnny to Broderick Kathleen Wiley and or Paula Jones should we believe them as
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:28.960]  well well I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they
[02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:33.480]  are disbelieved based on evidence well based on the evidence Hillary your
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:38.600]  husband has a long history of sexual assault and rape well Hillary is the
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:43.000]  one who runs the cover-up Hillary is the point person to silence these women
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:47.520]  lest they get in the way of the Clinton's lust for power and wealth that
[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:52.160]  was political strategist Roger Stone on the Alex Jones show talking about his

[02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:17.840]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:27.160]  he comes on every two or three weeks last time he was on he predicted that the
[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:32.720]  job numbers coming out would be worse in the next month and that indeed has
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:38.760]  happened also coming towards the United States like a runaway freight train is
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:44.560]  the full implementation of Obamacare next year we've seen overall about a
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:51.360]  doubling of premiums in the last two years but the real hammer comes down
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.880]  next year and that's a story out of the LA Times we're gonna be going over that
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:34:00.800]  with Peter Schiff as well quite frankly when he comes on for 20 30 minutes on
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:04.360]  economic news it's interesting it's informative a lot of his predictions
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.880]  have come true Peter's really interesting though just on politics in the
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:12.680]  world in general so I want to invite him back up next time to spend maybe 15
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:18.080]  minutes on economic news but 30 or 40 minutes on other issues because so much
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:22.880]  is happening in the world that it's all tied together but it's so immoral to
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:27.600]  demand we take millions in the west of Islamic radical refugees from war-torn
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.480]  areas where people can't get along with each other give them everything free and
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:37.560]  then have them go around murder and shoot and blow people up attack Christmas
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:40.920]  parties hunt down and find out who's Jewish in the office and shoot them
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:46.080]  that's now coming out and then the media tries to cover it up I mean why is our
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:52.080]  media ally with radical Islam but then what attacked the wrong country after
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:58.480]  9-11 Iraq I mean it's just crazy but socialists are allied with others
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.920]  the Talitarians and radical Islam is the Talitarian we're gonna talk to Peter
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.200]  Schiff about that in a moment as well I know we probably didn't know he's gonna
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.320]  get into that but he is and then of course your phone calls into the next
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:14.520]  hour with David Knight and others hosting the fourth hour today and then

[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.320]  New York is the at the Islamic training centers and have drone footage of their
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:48.920]  training camps it's how we can have reporters at Bilderberg and reporters in
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:54.200]  Paris for the attacks and all of it because we are real news journalist
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.320]  organization the founder of the weather channel was on yesterday saying he's a
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:01.680]  viewer and that we're gonna end up taking over the media well it's not just us
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:08.520]  it's other patriots we're libertarians we just want freedom and to see MSNBC
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:12.960]  demonize us for saying two days ago that the attack in San Bernardino was an
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:17.600]  Islamic terror attack and now it's admitted headline San Bernardino
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:23.000]  shooting attacker pledged allegiance to ISIS official say had bomb vest tactical
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.400]  gear throwing pipe bombs at police and they say it's not terror and then blame
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:33.080]  American gun owners that's why mainstream media is dying two days later now the
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:38.040]  FBI is investigating as an act of terror imagine France investigating it for two
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:42.960]  days is an act of terror so Peter Schiff of Euro PAC comm billions under
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:46.320]  management folks that don't know who you are obviously we usually get you on
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:49.280]  about financial stuff we'll spend some time on that in the brief time we have
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:54.240]  but I've set the table here about the state of the world the open borders this
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:58.600]  idea we've got to pay for all these people who mainly invaded Syria to take
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:04.480]  it over and failed what is Obama Halon Merkel thinking that they're going to
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:08.360]  start attacking us they are attacking us what do they think they're going to do
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:12.040]  I mean they're going to get held responsible or maybe they're not I have
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:16.120]  no idea what they think about these things and I don't know how much they
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:20.040]  actually care about it I think you know Obama is just trying to finish out his
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:24.120]  term without any major disasters happening that's probably the most
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:28.200]  important thing for him and then if something happens after he's gone well
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.480]  it's somebody else's fault but you know the real problems that I'm that I'm
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:35.960]  paying attention to or what's happening in in the economy because those are
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:40.120]  man-made disasters those are disasters that we're really bringing about on our
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:44.680]  own and we have a lot of control there and I'm more concerned about the damage
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.040]  being done to our economy from within than what I'm concerned about the
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:52.280]  threats from from without and that's unfortunate because the federal government
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:56.480]  is there to protect us from our international enemies but instead we
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.560]  need protection from our domestic enemy which is the federal government well I
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:04.480]  agree but the very same thinking that's bankrupting our future Peter your
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:09.480]  audio just cut out for a moment that very same thinking is the thinking that
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:14.120]  brings in people from radical jihad areas and won't even screen their
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:18.560]  passports I mean this is insanity yeah well you know the problem is the
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:22.640]  government spends so much resources so much time doing all the things that they
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:26.000]  shouldn't do that there's not as there's not much left over to actually do the
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.440]  things they're supposed to do the government is there to preserve and
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.840]  protect our liberties and unfortunately our liberties are at threat from the
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:37.840]  government right to talk about having the Fox guard guard your head house
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:43.760]  that's what's going on right now when the government is there to protect us so
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:47.840]  what is the big economic news there's a lot of it yeah look a lot of stuff is
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:52.800]  happening you know today we got the non-farm payroll number which you know
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.600]  that's all anyone talks about they don't talk about the trade deficit that came
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:01.080]  out today too which was much worse than expected in fact our exports were at the
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.960]  lowest they've been in three years and in fact our trade deficit with Mexico just
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:10.240]  hit a three-year high they revised up last month's trade deficit made it
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:14.440]  worse than they originally reported so all of this is gonna weigh on GDP in
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:19.640]  fact earlier in the week we got the ISM manufacturing number it came out way
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:25.120]  below estimates 48.6 the biggest drop in more than six years this the last time
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:31.840]  the ISM was this low was during the 2008 2009 great recession the only time it
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:37.600]  almost got this low was back in 2012 just before the Fed launched QE3 so
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:42.840]  manufacturing is already in a recession we got the ISM non-manufacturing numbers
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:46.840]  yesterday which came out way below expectations as well not in contraction
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:52.200]  mode yet but given time I think this is coming so manufacturing is in recession
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:57.600]  the overall economy will likely join the manufacturing sector next year in fact
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.440]  in the jobs numbers that came out today we lost manufacturing jobs again all we
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:06.960]  did is create a bunch of service sector jobs low-paying jobs in fact the vast
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:11.160]  majority of these jobs are probably part-time jobs we had a big spike this
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:16.160]  month in involuntary part-time employment people accepting reluctantly part-time
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:21.200]  jobs even though they want full-time jobs yet everyone is still convinced the Fed
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:25.480]  is about to raise interest rates what a week and a half and you know they just
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:30.880]  might do it now because Janet Yellen has basically assured everybody that it
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:34.160]  doesn't matter if they raise rates now what matters is what do they do
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:38.600]  afterwards and that she's basically trying to take this thing out of it by
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.040]  making this the most dovish rate hike ever by saying look even if we raise
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:46.720]  rates we're not going to raise them very much in the future and it's going to be
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:50.000]  a long time before we raise them again so don't worry we're going to go very
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.920]  slowly in fact I think they're going to go so slow that it's going to be one and
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:57.280]  done I think when they raise rates the next thing they're going to do is cut
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:01.520]  them back down to zero because we'll probably be in a recession next year or
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:06.320]  close enough to it that the Fed tries to delay the onset of that recession by
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:10.840]  stimulating again by going back down to zero doing QE for and of course when the
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:15.920]  Fed does that they're going to look like complete fools well they talked about
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:19.560]  the jobs report was good raising a little bit but now Yellen's playing that
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:25.800]  down well she's been doing that for months now ever since the stock market
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:30.640]  was tanking in September when they were afraid of the rate hike Janet Yellen's
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.240]  been doing everything she can to backtrack but the only reason she might
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:38.520]  raise rates despite the fact that the data that she claims to be depending on
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:43.920]  is awful is because she feels that her credibility will be lost if she doesn't
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:48.440]  she only wants to raise rates to prove that we can do it it's to try to send
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:52.120]  some kind of message of confidence that the Fed is confident enough in the
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:55.920]  economy to raise rates even though they're not confident at all because if
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:59.220]  they were confident they would have raised rates years ago and they wouldn't
[02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:04.160]  be promising to move so slowly meanwhile you know the data is bad and they
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:08.680]  don't want to acknowledge that if the Fed was data dependent they wouldn't be
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:12.200]  raising rates based on their own criteria but they don't want to acknowledge
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:15.720]  what should be obvious but now even you know even Citigroup now is coming out
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:22.120]  and saying that they put the odds of a recession next year at 65 percent what
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:24.680]  does the move to bring the Chinese currency into the world
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:31.360]  Bastic of currency signify well I think for Americans it signifies the end of
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:36.360]  an era I think it's the beginning of a larger move that will elevate the value
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:43.320]  of V1 relative to the dollar and I think anything that threatens the dollars
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:47.080]  dominance as a reserve currency is a threat to our phony standard of living
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:50.640]  I mentioned earlier that we had a larger than expected trade deficit our trade
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:55.560]  deficits are enormous and what we do is we give the world the paper that we
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:00.680]  print for the goods that they produce and it's not an even swap we get things
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:05.000]  of real value and they just get little pieces of paper but as the world wakes
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:08.280]  up to reality they're not going to want our paper anymore they're going to
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:11.600]  realize that it's not worth the paper it's printed on and then it's going to be
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:15.680]  impossible for us to import the things that we need it's also impossible to
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:19.480]  produce the things that we need because we don't have the productive capacity we
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:22.680]  don't have the factors anymore we don't have the workers that even know how to
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:26.640]  operate the machines assuming that that we have them so the economy is all
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:31.000]  screwed up and it's not prepared for what's about to happen but the what's
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:37.480]  going on with the Chinese want is a step in that process going over the
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:43.400]  economic numbers the ISM and others does that just confirm what you thought was
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:48.120]  going to happen or does it change your prognosis in any way now it confirms it
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:52.840]  because this is all weak economic data showing the weakness underlying our
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:57.880]  economy that everybody wants to ignore meanwhile you know people were expecting
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:02.840]  much more money printing coming out of the ECB and Mario Draghi yesterday
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:07.600]  didn't deliver that and we had a huge drop in the dollar against the euro the
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:12.440]  dollar lost about 3% in one day gold has had a little bit of a muted reaction
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:16.200]  yesterday goes up about 10 bucks yesterday but now it's up more than
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:23.600]  $20 today in fact gold is now over $40 above it's low yesterday morning we're
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:27.560]  seeing big moves up now in gold stocks and the last time I was on this program
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:32.320]  what I was what I told you about gold is that I believe that regardless of what
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:37.200]  the Fed does whether they raise by 25 basis points or not gold prices are
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.280]  going higher because it's already fully discounted into the market in fact I
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.320]  believe more rate hikes that are actually going to be delivered have been
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:50.520]  built into the market lots of people have shorted gold on anticipation of a
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:55.240]  rate hike and I think they're buying the fact beforehand they're not waiting for
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:58.880]  the Fed to hike rates to start buying they're already buying and think by the
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:03.040]  time the Fed does hike rates if they do in a week and a half prices could be
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:06.840]  considerably higher for me here in the meantime I think the dollar could go
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:11.760]  down and what nobody is paying attention to is while everybody's pretending that
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:15.880]  everything is great in the US the economic data is actually stronger now in
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:20.440]  Europe than it is in the United States that's how bad our data is so our
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:24.240]  Federal Reserve is talking about tightening even though our data is weaker
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:27.480]  than the European data and they're talking about more stimulus so I think
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:31.360]  what's going to surprise everybody next year is the fact that the Europeans have
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:34.280]  to slam on the brakes we're the ones that are going to be stepping on the
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.240]  monetary gas and so the dollar is going to be the weak currency and gold is
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:41.200]  going to be the primary beneficiary of that I want to take a call for you
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:44.520]  Richard in California has a question about silver Richard go ahead you're on
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:49.320]  the Europe Peter Schiff of Pacific pack go ahead you're a Pacific pack go ahead
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:55.000]  there Alex of the capital Peter yes just go ahead caller oh hello there Alex and
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.760]  Peter Schiff it's good to talk to you both is I have a few points but first
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:05.560]  one is on silver what what do you expect silver to do I keep hearing the
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.960]  word that silver is supposed to be the new gold but I wonder what why and how
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:14.680]  and what way well I don't know if it's the new gold but it just needs to be the
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.720]  old silver I mean silver is still valuable it doesn't have to replace gold
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:23.360]  it's simply you know goals less expensive cousin it has monetary
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:27.960]  properties it's been used as money and the two precious metals kind of move in
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:32.160]  the same direction main maybe silver just has more volatility so when the
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:35.360]  metals are going down and silver goes down more and when they're going up it
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:40.720]  goes up more but I expect substantial appreciation in both gold and silver but
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:44.640]  when it comes to the difference between the two or the ratio between gold and
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:49.800]  silver I think there's actually more upside potential in gold well and silver
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:55.600]  rather relative to gold given the ratio now is very extreme in you know in
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:59.840]  gold's favor against silver so I would look in this bull market when this new
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:03.840]  bull market resumes and if gold's two thousand three thousand five thousand
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:07.800]  wherever it ends up maybe higher than that I think the appreciation over on a
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:12.080]  percentage basis will be even higher let me ask this which what which metal do
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:17.560]  you think is more undervalued I don't know I mean I think historically you
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:21.400]  would say silver if you just look at the ratio that's what I'd say you know there
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:24.280]  there could be there could be other things that are at play and that
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:29.280]  influence that but historically the ratio is pretty pretty solid one has less
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:32.800]  of a supply though what has less of a in-the-ground supply we know about isn't
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.320]  it isn't it gold well gold is going to be scarcer than silver I mean that's one
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:41.280]  of the reasons it's so much sure about it per capita though there's less gold they
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:45.480]  think in in new describable reserves in the metric from the articles I've read
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:48.920]  then there is silver still and what they're discovering gold's becoming even
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:54.000]  more scarce or is that wrong I you know I'm not I'm not certain of the of those
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.720]  numbers I know that gold in general is scarcer than silver and it has it has
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:01.680]  properties that silver doesn't have it's a more valuable metal based on its
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:06.960]  its properties and I think that when the world goes back to us gold standard I
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.160]  don't think it's going to go back to a bi metallic standard you know officially
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:15.240]  like we did the United States we had gold and silver but I think when we
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:18.480]  re-monetize gold I don't know that the same thing is going to happen to silver
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.400]  but silver is still going to be used I believe by the people as money and
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:27.960]  there's going to be a lot more demand for it I know this there's so much paper
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:31.600]  out there it's been going on forever all these credit default swaps this has
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.240]  got to come down sometime Richard thank you so much for your call when we come
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:39.120]  back I'm gonna try to go to some other calls here I'll do some overdrive to
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:42.240]  to finish with everybody's call people that are patiently holding like Dante
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:46.440]  Jared James Sean and others but the minute we've got before break Peter
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:51.520]  chef what else is on your radar that you think people should know about well I
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.760]  think the most important thing is this change in dynamic and you know everybody
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:01.080]  was looking for the Fed to begin raising interest rates as oh the beginning of a
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:05.200]  tightening cycle and I think if it's more of a one-and-done if it's hey we're
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:09.040]  just raising rates now to prove that we can do it but don't worry we're not
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:13.040]  going to be raising them a lot anytime soon I think that really changes the
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:16.160]  dynamic and you know it's very interesting because Janet Yellen was
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.880]  asked a question yesterday she was testifying before Capitol Hill and
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.440]  somebody asked her what if we are in recession next year what are you going
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:29.800]  to do what are your tools and what Janet Yellen said was well you know if it
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:33.480]  turns out that we raised interest rates we'll just lower them and then because
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.200]  you know quantitative easing works so well in the past we'll just do it again
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.240]  which shows you how cool as she is because if we are right back in
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:46.040]  recession next year that proves the quantitative easing didn't work absolutely

[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:21.640]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before a few years
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:26.240]  ago I warned that the housing prices would collapse before that I warned that
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:31.280]  dot-com companies would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:35.600]  save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:42.200]  affect us all I've posted a free video at dollar danger dot-com maybe you'll
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:46.800]  disagree with my conclusions but first you need to watch this video and see the

[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:09.120]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:12.320]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:16.600]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:20.840]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:24.880]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:29.360]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:33.240]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[02:53:33.240 --> 02:53:37.320]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers

[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:47.760]  lot of research it gets into things I don't get into so that's always a big
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:52.000]  compliment to show but I'll be hosting this Sunday briefly free shipping through

[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:29.240]  first Sean in Israel go ahead you're on the air thanks for calling how are you
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:34.080]  doing man I'm doing all right what's what's your take on the situation okay
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:39.400]  first of all when first I heard about a shooting I mean I hope you know nobody
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:44.360]  will get hurt but eventually when the news start coming up and the name of the
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:49.120]  shooter they came out that was pretty much clear what's really happening and
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:52.480]  it was also very clear and I know I have many American friends have traveled a
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:57.040]  lot to the states actually worked off a few years back in the state the camp
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:02.320]  counselor so I pretty much know how things work and when President Obama
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:07.600]  started saying we can't know that it wasn't he actually enter event and all
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:12.120]  that I mean this was exactly when they said we you know we can't ever tell he
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:17.160]  was setting the narrative because they know now the worst part is I mean I'm
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:21.520]  following your channel for quite some time and I really love your work you're
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:26.120]  doing a great work but here's something you might want to try and consider and
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:32.680]  check it out all those reports you're having about American policy this kind
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:37.680]  of work was actually kind of done in Europe but by an Israeli reporter now what
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:43.520]  he did he is an ex Shabbat he's an Israeli reporter working for Channel 10
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:50.000]  he did a documentary of two and a half hours in 2012 now what he did he's an
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:56.400]  ex Shabbat agent which is something like the FBI and Homeland Security so he
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:00.680]  can perfectly pose as a Muslim perfectly I mean you know how to
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:06.160]  no no I understand I mean that's like your internal like massage CIA and then
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:12.600]  so Vox like internal FBI or MI6 or MI5 so what he does he goes to European
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:16.760]  countries and goes to Muslim communities over there in Europe now
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:21.280]  because he's speaking Arabic he knows he posed perfectly as a Muslim he wants to
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:25.480]  get their take about the situation how it is to living in Europe again this is
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:31.720]  from 2012 he wants to hear their story and almost in every case they tell him
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:36.520]  we are going to take over we are going to kill we are going to do suicide attacks
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:40.240]  we are going to take the daughters we are going to take Europeans for actually
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:44.360]  I'm aware of those reports and that's what a lot of these people say on TV it's
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:48.360]  what their Imam say they had Imam of Jerusalem is saying this kind of stuff I
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:54.120]  mean this is pretty much mainline thought now and I guess this is this new
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:58:00.120]  invasion or something where do you think it's going oh they I mean look I mean I
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:05.800]  am real sufferer opinions they have no idea what's going on they have no idea
[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:10.240]  about a month ago I'm not sure if you heard about about a month ago there was
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:16.120]  a cargo ship that was caught in in Greece now this cargo ship was carrying
[02:58:16.120 --> 02:58:25.000]  supplies for rescue for poor refugees they found 1717 cargoes filled with
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:30.880]  weapons explosives that was that was hidden inside those cargo no I know it
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:34.040]  looks like that's the false flag as they're letting a huge jihad force come
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:37.360]  in all hell's gonna break loose and they declare civil emergency I think our
[02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:41.200]  government's know though very scary it's worse than I thought though we're gonna
[02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:44.400]  come back jamming more calls David I can get to everybody else I just couldn't
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:52.760]  cut that car off it's just it is crazy I'm telling him and it's that type of
[02:58:52.760 --> 02:58:56.640]  behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:58:56.640 --> 02:59:00.720]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:05.120]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:09.800]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:14.160]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's
[02:59:14.160 --> 02:59:18.000]  no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:22.240]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:25.320]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:28.840]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are
[02:59:28.840 --> 02:59:32.640]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:37.520]  out there introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile
[02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:42.240]  and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great obtain your child ease
[02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:46.960]  today at info wars life dot com that's child ease exclusively at info wars
[02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:55.600]  life dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:58.920 --> 03:00:04.320]  the Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:08.320]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[03:00:08.320 --> 03:00:16.760]  let's go ahead and go to Mike in Wyoming you're on the air go ahead yes
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:26.880]  hi Alex I don't know if you caught a Riley show yesterday but Trump I don't
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:30.280]  know I think he he must have scouted a Riley show and he wanted to sound
[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:39.520]  extremely radical and he made wild the statements about you know we need to go
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:43.960]  after the family members of terrorists and even you know Riley was caught off
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:48.480]  guard by the ridiculousness of the statement I mean we'd have a clash of
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:52.360]  civilizations that would go on forever no I agree well with what you're saying I
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:57.280]  didn't see that quote but I did see him making it on other shows and I drilled
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:01.440]  down deeper and then he had the proviso he's obviously doing it to feed the
[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:06.360]  bears to you know red meat saying arrest them interrogate them and that's
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:09.960]  actually what the CIA does is they actually threaten to torture people's
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:16.360]  kids to get fake confessions that happened in some big cases and of course
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:19.400]  I'm against that because they're basically not even going after even
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:23.480]  real terrorists we lose the moral high ground our government's funding the
[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:27.240]  radical jihadist so I hear what you're saying and Trump does do things like
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:31.240]  this I didn't see the O'Reilly did he without the proviso saying you know kill
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:35.960]  people's kids or wives or what do you say yeah yeah he said we we need to get
[03:01:35.960 --> 03:01:40.920]  serious and go after go after the family members he said they they they may be
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:44.120]  willing to sacrifice themselves but they do care about their families well he's
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:48.280]  been told that by Spokes because that's actually true and the big dirty secret is
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:51.680]  actually kill people's whole families and that is something jihadis don't like
[03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:55.840]  is their little kids getting killed I don't support that and there's a sick
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:59.320]  thought well we'll stop a big attack if we do that oh bull if they'd stop the
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:02.760]  real jihadis it would have to get rid of any of our morals you know they're
[03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:05.760]  letting this happen bare minimum let me ask you this Mike you've been calling
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:09.240]  in for 16 17 years hadn't called in in months the medical doctor folks that
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:14.200]  know who Mike is he's been a guest for briefly Mike what do you think's really
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:17.200]  going on with the shooting out there I mean they clearly knew they're trying to
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:22.320]  cover it up there are more sleeper cells coming in what is the point of all
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:29.400]  this well that that story you have on your site about the Fiorina quoting the
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:35.720]  BATF on this matter that that gun had been purchased on behalf of the San
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:39.440]  Bernardino police and then they quickly cut her off and then move off in a
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:42.920]  different direction that's very telling well Joe Biggs first reported that and
[03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:46.320]  that was in local media yes that he'd legally gotten it but that they come
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:51.480]  from a police sale of some type of tactical weapons but you know there's
[03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:54.880]  just a lot of odd things about stay there then don't hang up I'm gonna come
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:57.680]  back and do a part of a segment with David Knight and finish up some of these
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:00.800]  calls don't hang up I'm gonna come back to you with your response but here is
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:03.000]  the clip they've been trying to get me to play it all day I've dropped the ball
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:07.720]  here is the clip of her on national television bringing this up we got
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:11.400]  attacked when we first reported on it nationally but it was in the local news
[03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:16.920]  here it is all right doesn't rate me 100% perhaps that's more of a problem with
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:21.640]  how the NRA's values have changed than how my value maybe we just disagree on
[03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:26.560]  this but if you listen to your reporter earlier what he said was that the ATF
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:31.320]  believes that someone purchased this gun on behalf of the police department and
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:35.320]  somehow that gun ended up in the hands of this guy so it actually doesn't sound
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:40.280]  at all like this man legally purchased a firearm and let me say and by the way
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:43.720]  she's right it's a CBS news today I have it here in my stack because I'll dig it
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:47.200]  out during the break should have led with this quite frankly I just my head
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:51.600]  spins half the time with how much intel there is I just it's insane and then we
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:54.920]  have a nose for this like 99% of the time when we go with what we think's
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:59.800]  accurate it ends up being the accurate info because we just have learned how
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:04.040]  this is like an art form I can't even describe how we know how we understand
[03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:11.200]  things it's just we have immersed ourselves in this it's what we do and
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:17.160]  there is a real move by the West to allow massive jihad forces in and they
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:20.800]  are going to start attacking I mean it could be you just heard the caller and
[03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:25.320]  that wasn't the news thousands of AK-47s being brought into grace with all sorts
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:32.240]  of rich Arabic sponsors and stuff I mean you could see something like Paris
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:37.360]  times a thousand we're talking tens of thousands dying if you get a couple
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:42.360]  hundred shooters and they are bringing in people out of Syria with no background
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:46.560]  no fake passports everything else who are combat age males who it turns out
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:50.320]  many of them are ISIS fighters and the government on purpose is letting them in
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:54.760]  and I smell a rat and I wonder how are they gonna get away with it must be
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:57.880]  they're meaning to take over I mean something bad's about to happen
[03:04:57.880 --> 03:05:02.680]  Monsanto going to trial for crimes against humanity that's right one of the
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:06.960]  most hated companies in the world will have to answer for its reign of toxic
[03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:10.920]  ecological terror several activist groups joined by food and farming experts
[03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:14.720]  are suing Monsanto but the way they plan on having Monsanto answer for their
[03:05:14.720 --> 03:05:18.880]  crimes may surprise you and may be caused for concern the international court
[03:05:18.880 --> 03:05:22.520]  and the Hague Netherlands will use the UN's guiding principles on business and
[03:05:22.520 --> 03:05:27.000]  human rights which was developed in 2011 to assess damages for Monsanto's acts
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:30.720]  against human life and environment the court will also rely on the Rome statue
[03:05:30.720 --> 03:05:34.720]  created at the International Criminal Court and the Hague in 2002 so if this
[03:05:34.720 --> 03:05:38.720]  group is successful in suing Monsanto for crimes against humanity this will
[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:42.480]  unfortunately open up the floodgates for companies all over the world to have
[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:46.000]  fines and penalties weighed against them under an international tribunal this is
[03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:49.680]  exactly what giant bureaucracies want to do with the TPP but it's not really meant
[03:05:49.680 --> 03:05:53.120]  for large businesses it's meant to go after small businesses and individuals
[03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:56.960]  to get rid of competition Rob Dew reporting for info wars comm and info
[03:05:56.960 --> 03:06:04.700]  wars nightly news and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the

[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:15.920]  before we go back to a few of these calls a what's coming up in the fourth
[03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:21.960]  hour today and be on this Friday edition yeah Donald Trump and the next time
[03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:24.640]  he's on I will bring up some of these questions I brought up a few tougher
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:29.000]  questions time just ran out I was just so surprised a lot I was told off air and
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.800]  some of the other things I'm you know kind of deer in the headlights but yeah
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:36.840]  I've seen things like we need surveillance that'll stop it they have
[03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:40.840]  the surveillance and it wasn't used to protect us Joe Biggs is being spot on
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.040]  the feds are telling him you know we know right where you're at up there
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:48.320]  covering Islamic centers and but then they can't find these people pledging
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:52.440]  allegiance to ISIS I mean I get it Trump is saying when he thinks people want to
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:56.360]  hear to win and then he says stuff like go after people's families now CJ has
[03:09:56.360 --> 03:09:59.960]  seen the full quotes I've seen where he elaborated I mean interrogate him arrest
[03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:05.520]  him but is that just red meat for constituents or does this kind of show
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:10.040]  the more white horse side the man on the white horse side of a Donald Trump my
[03:10:10.040 --> 03:10:14.600]  issue is he's pro-gun pro-control our borders the globalist hating that makes
[03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:18.800]  you like him the other Republican leadership is so milk toast I mean I
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:22.560]  like Rand Paul know he's a good guy but his campaign managers you know wanting
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:26.800]  back like howdy-doody or something where do you see all this going on what do you
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:31.720]  think about Trump well trial Alex the thing that concerns me is not so much
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:34.840]  about Trump but it's about Americans you know we looked at Trump and you look at
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:38.720]  Carson they both seem to reflect a mentality that the president is there
[03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:42.360]  to fix all issues that they should have absolute power that we are electing a
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:44.920]  Caesar I mean we see these kind of pronouncements not just from two of
[03:10:44.920 --> 03:10:48.680]  them but from everybody and that's apparently what the Americans want they
[03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:53.840]  don't want a system of checks and balances of rights individual rights
[03:10:53.840 --> 03:10:56.680]  enshrined in the Constitution they just want somebody to fix problems
[03:10:56.680 --> 03:11:00.880]  that brings us to a very dangerous point and I think that's a danger that we see
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:04.320]  from virtually all these candidates and it's brought on by the desires of the
[03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:07.360]  American people so that's the thing that concerns me I agree that the American
[03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:11.240]  people could conjure something very very dangerous yes well then but you then
[03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:15.880]  you got Hillary and Bernie Sanders we know yes we know that's the second
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:18.920]  coming of Joe Stalin right there yeah and we know that about a lot of the
[03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:22.040]  Republican candidates as well we know that about Jeb we know that about Rubio
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:26.720]  Lindsey Graham and on and on so there's there's a lot of concerns about where
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:30.680]  this is going to head that's why I think that it's important to look at the
[03:11:30.680 --> 03:11:34.320]  presidential candidates we follow the debates because this is where the
[03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:38.600]  establishment floats as ideas this is where they test us see how we're going
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:43.040]  to react so I think it's important for us to know where they want things to go
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:47.520]  how they're trying to manipulate us to good point it's a test marketing phase
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:51.520]  yeah let's go back to Mike in Wyoming Mike your take on the terror where this
[03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:56.320]  is all going why they would be letting the whole Homeland Security system and
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:12:00.080]  the European system be in trouble letting terrorist attack do they think
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:04.000]  they can have a triumph over reality that they're the ones letting this happen
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:07.360]  but they're not going to get in trouble what do you really think's going on and
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:10.920]  closing comments on Donald Trump
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:15.920]  Mike in Wyoming oh I'm sorry I'm sorry Alex I thought that was directed at
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:22.080]  David Knight that I just understood you where do I think this is all going well
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:31.400]  clearly I think the internationalists have selected ISIS as a means to
[03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:36.240]  install the New World Order to a police state to to give them an excuse to take
[03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:42.520]  away our rights to take away you know all of our freedoms and they're going to
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:48.520]  use this worldwide it looks like not not accepting America so we better get
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:53.720]  busy and throw off our inhibitions and and start writing start talking to
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:58.200]  people and not worry you know get a thick skin not worry about how people
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:03.480]  perceive you just like Alex you know I just wrote an op-ed along these lines
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:09.560]  and you know if people are waking up that's the good news even the even the
[03:13:09.560 --> 03:13:13.080]  docs that I work with they're they're slowly coming around through to realize
[03:13:13.080 --> 03:13:18.000]  that this government is malignant and they are the source of most of the
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:21.880]  problems they're not well that's what I'm wondering for you and for David
[03:13:21.880 --> 03:13:26.440]  because I study all the angles this elite is so reckless now I've never where
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:30.640]  their narrative is worn so thin where most people even those that aren't very
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:34.920]  informed in every military person I talked to knows the government's running
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:39.840]  al-Qaeda and ISIS knows there's a takeover knows that Homeland Security is
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:44.480]  for us knows that this police state spending being put in place for us the
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:48.640]  cops I know are aware of this they they know there's a plan to cause a civil
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:54.280]  war with them I mean I just wonder if the globalists are so disconnected now
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:58.680]  that they think this is 1995 or something or 96 and they can blow up a
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:03.240]  federal building and blame it on us we got people worldwide everywhere that are
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:07.440]  awakened dialed in and every move the globalists are gonna try to make will
[03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:11.480]  blow up in their face at this point I don't I mean do you think they 80
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:16.420]  disagree and then be do they realize we're moving into checkmate on their
[03:14:16.420 --> 03:14:21.320]  butts I think we've entered into new territory here when when your top
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:26.720]  generals including you know Mike Flynn the former head of DIA and chairman of
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:32.320]  Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford you know if I think he's a four-star both
[03:14:32.320 --> 03:14:36.360]  count just flatly contradict the president I mean Flynn says that the
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:40.800]  administration is arming ISIS and Dunford says you know the president's
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:45.040]  incorrect we don't have ISIS contained you know big surprise after the Paris
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:48.360]  attack and we were ordered to do this because these guys know it's such a
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:52.560]  crime they want to be on record going I was ordered this is the equivalent this
[03:14:52.560 --> 03:14:56.600]  is a wimpy version of Operation Valkyrie and I agree with you people don't
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:00.560]  realize this is one step away from a military coup and they act like that I
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:03.760]  mean this these guys are risking their lives I wouldn't be surprised if both of
[03:15:03.760 --> 03:15:08.000]  them don't end up dead now I mean I don't think people understand folks how real
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:13.400]  this is you're absolutely right other comments Mike and then David Knight no
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:16.880]  no I I think you're absolutely right this is this is the equivalent of
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:21.760]  Valkyrie these guys they've certainly put their careers on the line if not
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:28.960]  their lives and I you know I equivocated for quite a while trying to decide as
[03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:34.560]  you do every day you know do I do I write something about this but when these
[03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:39.720]  guys are willing to put their lives on the line how can I not I mean well the
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:43.800]  fact that they're doing it shows they know how much trouble we're in they know
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:47.520]  this isn't just gonna be corruption as usual and maybe they can slowly fix it
[03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:52.000]  from the inside people now realize the evil is going for our neck this is a
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:56.320]  death battle folks that we're about to enter into the next couple years I just
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:16:01.240]  got chills I'm gonna say it again death battle I felt it in my gut for years
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:04.480]  building towards this the last six months now you see it's all happening
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:11.520]  and in my spirit is just like on fire just I mean it is ready I'm telling you
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:14.760]  folks I can feel the enemy just like these are Lord of the Rings analogy you
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:18.640]  know the sword glows when they when the goblins are close the sword is on fire
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:24.280]  folks I mean it is my sixth sense is on fire my spirit is on fire and my
[03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:28.360]  discernment is on fire and it is just and I know yours is as well God bless you
[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:33.400]  Mike now is the time to speak out and say no to the system now is the side to
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:36.920]  decide which side you're on David Knight you know Alex I saw an interesting
[03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:40.560]  op-ed piece from your old friend Pierce Morgan and what he said was if we treat
[03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:43.960]  all mass shootings as Muslim terror attacks America would have new gun laws
[03:16:43.960 --> 03:16:48.320]  faster than those bullets and I looked at that I thought is he absolutely crazy
[03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:52.880]  that is not the reaction of the American people when they see this this kind of an
[03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:56.960]  action or guns they want more guns but Alex as I thought about it and as I
[03:16:56.960 --> 03:17:01.000]  thought about the gun laws that Obama is proposing I thought you know he's
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:05.360]  actually right because think about what Obama is trying to sell right now the
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:09.480]  gun laws that they're trying to sell is the idea that based on somebody being
[03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:13.400]  on their phony no-fly terror list which they don't do anything about those
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:16.040]  people they just say well we got them on a secret watch list yeah we knew about
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:19.040]  that and we're watching them but we don't do anything about it and that's the
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:24.520]  other part of this leaving these people in place letting them do a terror
[03:17:24.520 --> 03:17:28.560]  attack that they really want to do really killing people and then using that
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:33.840]  to push the idea that we should take this no-fly list and use it for judicial
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:38.560]  action against people to deny our rights being put on this list secretly without
[03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:41.560]  even knowing you're on the list their new talking point yes their new talking
[03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:44.680]  point that was their original plan when Obama first got in you're absolutely
[03:17:44.680 --> 03:17:47.920]  right and the fact that they bring in millions of jihadis in Europe hundreds
[03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:52.680]  of thousands here knowing it's chopped full I mean I'd say 20 30 percent have
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:57.920]  been in combat large percentages are planning to strike they're actually
[03:17:57.920 --> 03:18:01.800]  bringing in a giant secret army David yes and so I think this could be the big
[03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:06.640]  false flag that takes us all down I mean this is it I'm pretty sure now and the
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:10.320]  very first story that I covered when I was here was the the guy who was on his
[03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:14.800]  way to visit his wife in Tokyo stopped in Hawaii remember he was then they found
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:17.880]  out he was on a no-fly list and they wouldn't let him get out of Hawaii you
[03:18:17.880 --> 03:18:21.400]  don't have any way to know that you're on a no-fly list until they take action
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:24.960]  against you you don't have a public trial you're not allowed to confront the
[03:18:24.960 --> 03:18:28.240]  accusers you're not allowed to call your own witnesses to have your own offense to
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:35.400]  have a public charge this is a star chamber proceeding exactly they let them
[03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:39.480]  into attack as the neighbors know and then we lose our rights on some magic
[03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:43.520]  secret list which then becomes a take you off the street list disappear your
[03:18:43.520 --> 03:18:47.640]  list yeah yeah yeah this isn't this isn't creating this attack is not
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:53.280]  creating the public's desire for greater gun laws but it fits into the Democrat
[03:18:53.280 --> 03:18:56.680]  agenda and so when you go back and look at the fact that they're having things
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:01.600]  like drills SWAT drills at that place on a regular basis having it going on at
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:05.840]  the same time the attack is taking place the reports that one of these guns are
[03:19:05.840 --> 03:19:09.680]  multiple pistols were police pistols that were were given to these people all
[03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:13.160]  of that when you look at that and the fact that they've got this agenda set
[03:19:13.160 --> 03:19:16.560]  in place that they want to run through I don't think that it's phony in the sense
[03:19:16.560 --> 03:19:19.760]  that these people didn't really want to do they wound them up yeah exactly gave
[03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:22.640]  them the guns they did everything no it's it's definitely a type of false flag
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:26.560]  there's the four different types three major ones the subgroup and this is
[03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:29.840]  definitely a false flag the whole thing is and it's sick and they're trying to
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:33.040]  blame gun owners right now David Knight here's the baton my friend Jared wants
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:38.240]  to talk about missing nukes from a few years ago Dante James Brando Noah and
[03:19:38.240 --> 03:19:42.520]  others David Knight and much more coming up David the command base is yours
[03:19:42.520 --> 03:19:47.040]  all right thanks Alex we're going to be coming back we've also got an interview

[03:22:59.400 --> 03:23:03.880]  something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old
[03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:07.320]  guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks
[03:23:07.320 --> 03:23:11.960]  and head-to-head fitness tests how is this even possible turns out the old guys
[03:23:11.960 --> 03:23:15.360]  in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated
[03:23:15.360 --> 03:23:19.920]  fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens Patriot Power Greens has
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:23.320]  been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:27.640]  joints stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past previously this
[03:23:27.640 --> 03:23:31.560]  drink was only available to elite military units but for a limited time
[03:23:31.560 --> 03:23:35.560]  the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free
[03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:40.160]  samples specifically for our conservative friends but you must act fast due to the
[03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:43.720]  high demand from members of the Coast Guard our supply is extremely limited

[03:24:12.520 --> 03:24:16.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host joining me now is
[03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:21.240]  Leanne McAdoo my apologies to the callers we wanted to have Leanne come on
[03:24:21.240 --> 03:24:24.000]  and talk about what's going to be on the nightly news tonight as well as a
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:27.160]  interview that's coming up at the bottom of the hour but real quickly Leanne
[03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:30.480]  before we tell us about what's coming up tonight I saw this article that we have
[03:24:30.480 --> 03:24:34.160]  up on info wars.com day Obama's Attorney General promises to criminalize
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:39.400]  speech he says violent language directed at Muslims is unacceptable and of
[03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:44.760]  course we look at all this and their take on it when the Obama administration
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:48.160]  first of all saying well this is workplace violence but then they say
[03:24:48.160 --> 03:24:52.320]  well this may be directed at Muslims and the same way that Jerry Brown says
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:55.880]  this has absolutely nothing to do with Islam but don't like the tree you know
[03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:58.920]  so he's admitting that it has to do with that because he doesn't want to trigger
[03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:03.280]  it and then he kowtows to it well you got the Attorney General Loretta Lynch
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:08.200]  saying that we're not going to let anybody do anything to Muslims painting
[03:25:08.200 --> 03:25:12.400]  them as the victims made me think of a movie a few years ago and this is just
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:16.200]  the right time of year for it American Carol it was done by the guys that did
[03:25:16.200 --> 03:25:21.080]  naked gun and airplane and and that's where and what it took was it was like
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:26.000]  the Christmas Carol theme okay where a guy goes to sleep and he's he's visited
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:30.040]  by ghosts but instead of ghosts about Christmas this goes about American
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:33.320]  history that come back and talk to him and there's a scene in there where
[03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:37.120]  they're talking about the threat of Christians and they have evidence of
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:42.440]  this let's look at the evidence of how dangerous radical Christians are
[03:25:42.440 --> 03:25:47.440]  fun on sort of death and destruction brought on by radical Christians as they
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:51.200]  attempt to spread their ideology to terror throughout the world there's a
[03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:57.000]  couple of priests who are breaking into a airplane cockpit sticking to a cross
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:17.240]  this is the image that the left portrays right that was funny when he did it a
[03:26:17.240 --> 03:26:21.000]  few years ago but you know it's really what's going on here and that's what
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:24.960]  the Attorney General is portraying as well well it's funny how they were I
[03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:31.400]  guess affected by climate change every evil in the world is climate change
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:36.000]  that's my guess in the next segment from the Cornwall now an alliance E.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:39.280]  Calvin Beisner is going to be talking about that and of course they've blamed
[03:26:39.280 --> 03:26:44.320]  human trafficking now on climate change you know prostitution and slavery
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:47.760]  that's because of just like terrorism it's all because of climate change even
[03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:52.200]  flying rocks okay right that's yeah and and Obama comes out and says that there's
[03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:56.360]  no imminent threat to the United States meanwhile now the FBI has announced
[03:26:56.360 --> 03:27:00.360]  they are treating this as a terror attack the woman apparently pledged
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:04.680]  allegiance to ISIS so you know he's wrong on that front but then his attorney
[03:27:04.680 --> 03:27:09.960]  general comes out and says yeah the real fear I have is the backlash against
[03:27:09.960 --> 03:27:14.320]  Muslims yes exactly they can't use the terms radical Islam because that wouldn't
[03:27:14.320 --> 03:27:19.440]  be helpful but it is helpful to their agenda to try to portray Christians and
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:23.480]  middle America as radicalized that's that's the whole perversion inherent in
[03:27:23.480 --> 03:27:26.240]  this and that should tell people everything they need to know the other
[03:27:26.240 --> 03:27:32.040]  thing that I was struck by was of course this this news report that the wife and
[03:27:32.040 --> 03:27:37.720]  mother had posted her allegiance to this this guy who's a high up in ISIS and
[03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:40.920]  when I thought about that and I tweeted this out last night I said you know the
[03:27:40.920 --> 03:27:46.320]  hatred of this religion of peace against strangers that they don't even know was
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:50.480]  so much stronger than their love for their six-month-old daughter right that
[03:27:50.480 --> 03:27:53.520]  they would leave her with somebody else lied to the relative about what this is
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:57.760]  so they could go kill strangers in the name of their religion absolutely they
[03:27:57.760 --> 03:28:01.680]  would also have her in a home where they're building pipe bombs and having
[03:28:01.680 --> 03:28:05.720]  all this IED explosive material just laying I mean you're absolutely right
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:10.080]  it's just truly shocking but you know Obama doubles down again and says if we
[03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:14.560]  take away the guns then people like this this will this won't happen but I'm
[03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:20.080]  sorry they're just gonna go and build pipe bombs or you know people aren't
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:23.680]  going to pay attention to the right to the laws if they're not being armed
[03:28:23.680 --> 03:28:26.720]  directly by the government because we know the government is giving arms to
[03:28:26.720 --> 03:28:30.160]  ISIS's kit Daniel's point out yesterday no background checks on the radical
[03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:34.280]  Islamists that he's giving these arms to because in most cases they'll turn right
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:39.080]  around and say well you know we were with the FSA now we're with Al Qaeda or
[03:28:39.080 --> 03:28:42.960]  ISIS or whatever and of course there's no background checks on any of the people
[03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:46.760]  that he wants to fly into this country he's telling us people who are on a no
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:50.920]  fly list and and again 91 a percent of those people when they were had a
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:54.480]  background check performed on them by the FBI were approved so the question is
[03:28:54.480 --> 03:28:58.920]  do they belong on this list is that Star Chamber procedure wrong but he
[03:28:58.920 --> 03:29:03.320]  doesn't care about that instead he's going to fly in terrorists okay while he
[03:29:03.320 --> 03:29:07.680]  tells us that if he arbitrarily puts somebody on a no fly list they don't get
[03:29:07.680 --> 03:29:10.760]  to get armed anymore and then there'll be other things that will be brought in as
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:15.440]  well there'll be other recriminations on people maybe travel restrictions or what
[03:29:15.440 --> 03:29:21.040]  besides the no flying like what the 270,000 people improperly on the no fly
[03:29:21.040 --> 03:29:25.520]  list yes yes real quickly give us the high points for what's on tonight on the
[03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:29.520]  night we're going to be talking about the bumbling idiots there at MSNBC and
[03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:34.200]  their lack of journalistic integrity as they're infiltrating an active crime
[03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:37.880]  scene rushing into the shooter's home we're also going to be playing some

[03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:04.360]  Hillary Clinton recently said that all rape victims should be believed so
[03:30:04.360 --> 03:30:09.520]  during a campaign event in New Hampshire today she was confronted by a woman in
[03:30:09.520 --> 03:30:14.200]  the audience who asked her about the women who accused her husband of rape
[03:30:14.200 --> 03:30:18.760]  hey that all rape victims should be believed but would you say that about
[03:30:18.760 --> 03:30:24.200]  Johnny to Broderick Kathleen Wiley and or Paula Jones should we believe them as
[03:30:24.200 --> 03:30:28.800]  well well I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they
[03:30:28.800 --> 03:30:33.320]  are disbelieved based on evidence well based on the evidence Hillary your
[03:30:33.320 --> 03:30:38.600]  husband has a long history of sexual assault and rape what Hillary's the one
[03:30:38.600 --> 03:30:42.840]  who runs the cover-up Hillary is the point person to silence these women
[03:30:42.840 --> 03:30:47.400]  lest they get in the way of the Clinton's lust for power and wealth that
[03:30:47.400 --> 03:30:52.000]  was political strategist Roger Stone on the Alex Jones show talking about his

[03:33:37.680 --> 03:33:41.200]  aren't Christians those of you who don't like religion let me explain to you
[03:33:41.200 --> 03:33:44.800]  that you need to understand that this is going to affect you and you need to
[03:33:44.800 --> 03:33:49.960]  understand the two different viewpoints because religion is very much brought
[03:33:49.960 --> 03:33:54.960]  into the politics of this and I would say that global warming a man made global
[03:33:54.960 --> 03:33:58.800]  warming itself is a form of religion that is being sold to people so you need
[03:33:58.800 --> 03:34:01.640]  to understand the different belief systems of the different people you need
[03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:06.560]  to have some tools in your belt to come back and talk to people who do follow
[03:34:06.560 --> 03:34:10.280]  the pope and many conservative Catholics are very appalled at his
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:13.920]  encyclical that came out in his actions and his push and the priority that he's
[03:34:13.920 --> 03:34:17.480]  put on this you know of course he wants to do economic redistribution he wants
[03:34:17.480 --> 03:34:22.480]  to have energy allocation all of those would be done by a global centralized
[03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:26.560]  control mechanism a global governance mechanism is there a different way to do
[03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:30.920]  that is that the moral case so we're going to talk to dr. bisoner real quickly
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:33.640]  before we get to him I just want to let you know about the specials we have
[03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:39.800]  today we have a special ending tonight the 995 silver bullet that's the lowest
[03:34:39.800 --> 03:34:45.120]  price that we've had that at ever and also 30% off of x2 nascent iodine both
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:48.840]  of those specials will end at midnight tonight and of course there is still
[03:34:48.840 --> 03:34:54.560]  free shipping so take advantage of that at info wars life.com let's go now to
[03:34:54.560 --> 03:34:58.640]  dr. bisoner of course he is an author of many books he's written four books on
[03:34:58.640 --> 03:35:02.840]  population resources economics and the environment over eight other books
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:05.920]  contributed over 30 books he's had hundreds of articles he's lectured
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:11.200]  throughout North America Europe Africa and Asia on these very things lectured
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:16.000]  or appeared and given testimony as an expert witness on the ethics and the
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:20.600]  economics of climate policy before Congress and it's a different point of
[03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:24.400]  view the Cornwall Alliance has let me read you just this little excerpt here
[03:35:24.400 --> 03:35:30.320]  before we go to dr. bisoner he says and what we're faced with right now is an
[03:35:30.320 --> 03:35:34.160]  environmental movement whose worldview theology and ethics are overwhelmingly
[03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:38.680]  anti-christian whose science and economics are poorly done whose policies
[03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:43.760]  often do little good for natural ecosystems but do much harm to the
[03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:48.080]  world's poor and whose religious teachings undermine fundamental Christian
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:51.920]  doctrine so without any more introduction let me go to dr. bisoner
[03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:55.240]  right now dr. bisoner thank you for joining us well thank you very much for
[03:35:55.240 --> 03:35:58.360]  having me on you know we've seen a lot of different things we've seen scare
[03:35:58.360 --> 03:36:02.600]  tactics first of all from the left we were just talking about some of those
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:08.800]  and that we've been told that even human trafficking now is due to climate change
[03:36:08.800 --> 03:36:12.480]  we've been told that terrorism is due to climate change it seems like every evil
[03:36:12.480 --> 03:36:16.840]  in the world is due to climate change we've even been told that we're going
[03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:20.760]  to have flying rocks due to change that was the one that came out this last
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:24.480]  weekend yeah I'm sure you saw that so all these kind of things I mean who
[03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:28.760]  wouldn't want to stop all of those things okay and and yet when you look at
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:32.600]  the prescriptions that they have for for this we're told that we have to stop
[03:36:32.600 --> 03:36:37.640]  having turkeys we have to stop having pumpkins we have to stop having meat as
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:40.880]  a matter of fact that even the way that we cook our vegetables they would
[03:36:40.880 --> 03:36:44.800]  control that we couldn't have wood burning fires or barbecues or anything
[03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:49.840]  like that I mean it is absolutely coming to every aspect of our life that
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:53.280]  they're coming after us and I want to talk to you about energy poverty the
[03:36:53.280 --> 03:36:57.960]  resilience of the earth but first talk about your difference in your solution
[03:36:57.960 --> 03:37:02.920]  to perceived problems the Pope has one of a global centralized control for
[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:07.520]  economic redistribution for energy allocation tell us about your approach
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:12.440]  well our approach is guided both by our understanding of scripture the Bible
[03:37:12.440 --> 03:37:17.640]  God's word and by our our study of history and science and economics and
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.480]  what what we find from all of these is that two things are fundamentally
[03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:30.160]  indispensable to having any society conquer and stay out of poverty the
[03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:34.880]  first one is a set of social circumstances private property rights
[03:37:34.880 --> 03:37:39.600]  entrepreneurship free trade limited government the rule of law that sort of
[03:37:39.600 --> 03:37:44.640]  thing and the second is access to abundant affordable reliable energy
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:49.320]  because without that energy the only energy you've got left is the bodily
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:54.000]  energy from whatever food you can consume and that typically that's very
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:38:01.600]  little energy most of us now in America consume on a on a daily basis the
[03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:07.640]  amount of energy that about 200 people would have consumed as little as a
[03:38:07.640 --> 03:38:11.640]  century ago and we do this because we can get that energy in the form of
[03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:16.840]  electricity especially but also in the form of gasoline for our cars and it's
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:21.280]  that energy that has delivered us from absolute poverty from the kind of
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:26.120]  poverty that dominated almost all of mankind for all of history up until
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:31.080]  the Industrial Revolution and that way people had average life expectancy of
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:36.040]  birth of between 27 and 28 years roughly half of all children would die
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:40.000]  before their fifth birthdays and that was just standard for the vast majority
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:45.440]  of people around the world but freedom and private property rights and energy
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:50.680]  have combined to lift roughly a third of the human race now out of even
[03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:55.680]  moderate poverty and much more out of severe poverty what we need to see now
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:00.400]  is for the last left there are roughly two billion people to be lifted out of
[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:05.040]  severe poverty and that's not going to come without the combination of freedom
[03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:10.760]  and abundant affordable reliable energy and unfortunately the prescription for
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:16.000]  fighting global warming is to reduce our use of the most important source of
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:20.800]  that abundant affordable reliable energy which is fossil fuels you know I've
[03:39:20.800 --> 03:39:23.880]  heard this a lot I've heard the point that you're making a lot and and the
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:29.040]  the leader of India gets this we're living in abject poverty because we
[03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:34.520]  have no access to cheap affordable energy and we don't have the freedom you
[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:39.400]  know it's affecting our longevity as well as our lifestyle it's
[03:39:39.400 --> 03:39:43.520]  beyond even just lifestyle implications is causing them to die early as you're
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:47.120]  pointing out and he doesn't like the idea that this is going to be allocated
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:51.440]  by somebody at a global basis that they're going to be basically kept down
[03:39:51.440 --> 03:39:54.920]  but it's far worse than that because they're going to use it to try to pull
[03:39:54.920 --> 03:39:58.640]  down the developed countries as well not only they're going to hold down the
[03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:01.960]  developing nations but they're going to pull down the developed nations as well
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:07.480]  yeah that's absolutely right you know the the typical major worldwide
[03:40:07.480 --> 03:40:11.480]  environmental advocacy organizations are headed by people who believe that the
[03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:17.880]  optimal human population would be about oh maybe 300 to 500 million which means
[03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:23.600]  we have to get rid of about 95 to 97% of the people in the world today they
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:29.000]  also think that the planet would be far better off if people lived as they put
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:33.240]  it in harmony with nature well you know Thomas Hobbs understood what harmony
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:38.720]  with nature meant he said that way life is solitary poor nasty brutish and
[03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:43.920]  short but that's that's the direction they want to go and part of how they
[03:40:43.920 --> 03:40:48.960]  want to do that is as you mentioned by putting in control of our economies into
[03:40:48.960 --> 03:40:54.960]  the hands of an elite unelected unaccountable few in terms of global
[03:40:54.960 --> 03:41:01.520]  governments replacing replacing capitalism free trade as the major
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:05.760]  economic system of the world with a global socialist system that's the
[03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:10.120]  wording that's the the claim of Christiana Figueiras who's the chairman of
[03:41:10.120 --> 03:41:13.720]  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change who said earlier this
[03:41:13.720 --> 03:41:18.560]  year that this is our best opportunity to replace the development model of the
[03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:22.720]  last 150 years which is basically capitalism with a new development model
[03:41:22.720 --> 03:41:26.960]  which is socialism well you know take a look where would you rather have lived
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:33.320]  over the last 80 years in the Soviet Union China North Korea Cuba places like
[03:41:33.320 --> 03:41:37.520]  that socialist countries or in Western Europe the United States Canada
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:43.080]  Australia and so on socialism is great at perpetuating poverty capitalism is
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:46.920]  great at lifting people out of it exactly you know I think that this is all
[03:41:46.920 --> 03:41:51.480]  being informed more by the Pope's Jesuit and liberation theologist background
[03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:56.520]  than it is by any any Christian theology that's involved in here and we talk
[03:41:56.520 --> 03:42:00.040]  about people being made poor by the socialism and the wealth redistribution
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:04.800]  that he advocates this story which just came out yesterday chicken for diapers
[03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:09.200]  bartering of bounds in scarcity stricken Venezuela here's one of the places of
[03:42:09.200 --> 03:42:13.600]  one of their socialist paradises we can see how it works out and we can see it
[03:42:13.600 --> 03:42:18.120]  in the poor countries where it is applied much quicker than we can in the
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:21.960]  richer countries we're now seeing problems developing in richer countries to
[03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:24.880]  the degree they've had socialism but you see it almost immediately when it's
[03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:28.680]  applied to a poor country like Venezuela they have no money for food for
[03:42:28.680 --> 03:42:31.720]  medicine for water they have to go to other countries and of course the
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:34.760]  globalist bankers who are financing this are bragging in Bloomberg that they
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:39.280]  get a 700% return on investment from Hugo Chavez and his successor because
[03:42:39.280 --> 03:42:43.960]  they understand that the banks get paid first but I want to go to the broader
[03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:48.400]  theological backgrounds here that the people are looking at because not only
[03:42:48.400 --> 03:42:53.120]  is is Pope Francis selling a unified solution he says we're not faced with
[03:42:53.120 --> 03:42:57.240]  two separate crises one environmental the other social he writes but rather one
[03:42:57.240 --> 03:43:01.640]  complex crisis which is both social and environmental so he sees this as a
[03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:06.520]  unified solution this global governance which is going to control wealth which is
[03:43:06.520 --> 03:43:10.520]  going to redistribute wealth okay at a global level but it also pulls out of
[03:43:10.520 --> 03:43:14.320]  something the way that he sees the world and kind of a I think really more of a
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:19.480]  pagan guy understanding of the environment he says there's a Christian
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:24.080]  idea that God gave humans the earth to cultivate but not to conquer and of course
[03:43:24.080 --> 03:43:28.120]  we never really use that word conquer we would use the word dominion we would
[03:43:28.120 --> 03:43:32.120]  talk about stewardship and we would talk about conservationism versus the
[03:43:32.120 --> 03:43:36.040]  environmentalism that really kind of comes back to this kind of Gaia where
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:39.840]  the earth is a living organism that is wiser than man and we're essentially a
[03:43:39.840 --> 03:43:45.160]  parasite on that organism yeah I think what you're seeing there is the the fruit
[03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:50.920]  of Christians or professed Christians really giving way to the secular world
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:55.360]  around us and adopting their values instead of biblical values you know the
[03:43:55.360 --> 03:43:59.840]  scriptures specifically state in Genesis 128 that having created man and
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:03.920]  woman in his own image God blessed them and said to them be fruitful and
[03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:09.440]  multiply and fill the earth and so do it and have dominion over it now that
[03:44:09.440 --> 03:44:14.200]  doesn't mean you know raping the planet okay that's not what it means right we
[03:44:14.200 --> 03:44:17.520]  should be good stewards of this earth and at the Cornwall Alliance for the
[03:44:17.520 --> 03:44:22.160]  stewardship of creation the ministry that I lead we define godly dominion
[03:44:22.160 --> 03:44:26.840]  this way it's men and women creating God's image laboring lovingly together
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:32.480]  to enhance the fruitfulness and the beauty and the safety of the earth to the
[03:44:32.480 --> 03:44:36.640]  glory of God and to the benefit of our neighbors that's what we're called to do
[03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:43.640]  and when we do that we can see economies grow and the natural world well
[03:44:43.640 --> 03:44:47.920]  stewarded at the same time as a matter of fact what economic and environmental
[03:44:47.920 --> 03:44:55.040]  history together tell us is that the freer and wealthier the economy is the
[03:44:55.040 --> 03:44:58.840]  cleaner the environment will be and there's really a basic from simple
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:03.160]  explanation for that but clean healthful beautiful environment is a costly good
[03:45:03.160 --> 03:45:08.000]  wealthy people can afford more costly goods than poor people can so as you
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:12.680]  get wealthier you become you become more concerned about making sure that
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:17.600]  your environment is clean and healthful and safe and you not only are concerned
[03:45:17.600 --> 03:45:22.040]  about it you can afford to do something about it that's why we at the Cornwall
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:27.680]  Alliance have launched a petition called forget climate change energy empowers
[03:45:27.680 --> 03:45:33.240]  the poor that's at Cornwall Alliance dot org forget climate change energy
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:38.200]  empowers the poor the point here is this the prescriptions to try to solve
[03:45:38.200 --> 03:45:43.480]  climate change would all slow stop or reverse the economic development that
[03:45:43.480 --> 03:45:48.480]  lifts people out of poverty what's needed instead is for people to rise out of
[03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:52.440]  poverty and then they can take much better care of their own environments
[03:45:52.440 --> 03:45:57.880]  absolutely and we've seen that in the sense that we know that and I've seen
[03:45:57.880 --> 03:46:02.000]  it firsthand I know that ranchers take better care of their land than the Bureau
[03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:05.560]  of Land Management does because it's their livelihood it's something that
[03:46:05.560 --> 03:46:09.840]  they are passing on to subsequent generations we've seen it in in Russia
[03:46:09.840 --> 03:46:14.240]  and China where the Chinese government would just dump toxic materials into the
[03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:16.960]  water without any regard for it and course there was no recourse because
[03:46:16.960 --> 03:46:22.760]  nobody had any private property rights right right and so where property belongs
[03:46:22.760 --> 03:46:26.640]  to somebody in particular that person has an incentive to take good care of it
[03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:31.720]  this is why you find graffiti on public bathroom walls not on the bathroom walls
[03:46:31.720 --> 03:46:37.160]  of your own home because you've got an incentive to take good care of it so we
[03:46:37.160 --> 03:46:43.320]  also recognize that that the historic track record of governments in terms of
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:48.640]  environmental quality is much worse than the historic track record of private
[03:46:48.640 --> 03:46:53.440]  corporations does private corporations sometimes do bad things of course they
[03:46:53.440 --> 03:46:59.520]  do all people are sinful but they can be held accountable governments it's much
[03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:03.400]  more difficult to hold them accountable they've got the guns yes yes absolutely
[03:47:03.400 --> 03:47:07.880]  and when we talk about stewardship let's unpack that for people a little
[03:47:07.880 --> 03:47:11.160]  bit because of course the steward is not the owner but he's the person who is
[03:47:11.160 --> 03:47:16.920]  put in charge of taking care of things essentially the the estate caretaker
[03:47:16.920 --> 03:47:20.920]  the number two the penultimate owner of the property and of course he has a
[03:47:20.920 --> 03:47:24.400]  vested interest in taking care of this because he has somebody to report to so
[03:47:24.400 --> 03:47:28.920]  when we talk about being a stewards of the environment we understand that God
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:33.720]  ultimately owns this we're ultimately accountable to him and we want to take
[03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:38.160]  care of this for that reason as well as for subsequent generations yeah that's
[03:47:38.160 --> 03:47:41.960]  correct and the Cornwall Alliance has produced a couple of different video
[03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:46.960]  resources that can really help on this one is 12 lecture series called
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:51.520]  resisting the green dragon which is that resisting the green dragon dot com
[03:47:51.520 --> 03:47:56.680]  those are 12 lectures on the biblical worldview theology and ethics and the
[03:47:56.680 --> 03:48:00.240]  good science and economics of environmental stewardship and then most
[03:48:00.240 --> 03:48:05.040]  recently in fact we've just now got these back from the duplicator a new
[03:48:05.040 --> 03:48:10.240]  documentary video called where the grass is greener and that is it where the
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:15.760]  grass is greener the movie dot com where the grass is greener the movie dot
[03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:21.240]  com this is interviews with over 30 of the world's top scholars on the science
[03:48:21.240 --> 03:48:27.400]  the economics the ethics the the political policy and so on of climate
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:34.520]  change and climate and energy policy and the the thrust of the message is that
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:39.320]  because climate risks are much much smaller than the risks from poverty
[03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:43.920]  since after all if you're even tolerably well off you can thrive in any climate
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:49.320]  from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara Desert but if you're very poor you can't
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:53.960]  thrive in the most wonderful tropical paradise since climate risks are much
[03:48:53.960 --> 03:48:58.600]  smaller than the risks from poverty economic development for the poorest
[03:48:58.600 --> 03:49:02.560]  people around the world really ought to be our priority so again climate
[03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:07.520]  forget climate change energy empowers the poor and that is at Cornwall
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:13.880]  Alliance dot org slash energy empowers the poor absolutely and I have an
[03:49:13.880 --> 03:49:19.040]  article here of yours that is 10 points 10 reasons to oppose harmful climate
[03:49:19.040 --> 03:49:23.840]  change policies one of these is mandatory reductions in CO2 emissions
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:27.040]  pursued to prevent dangerous global warming would have little or no
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:30.080]  discernible impact on global temperatures but would greatly increase the
[03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:32.880]  price of energy and therefore everything else just as you've been pointing out
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:37.040]  but you also point out in terms of talking about energy poverty and of
[03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:40.040]  course it is going to be those who are in poor countries that are going to be
[03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:44.280]  affected by the most but you also point out in developed countries the poor
[03:49:44.280 --> 03:49:47.360]  spend a higher percentage of their income on energy than others so rising
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:51.200]  energy prices driven by mandated shifts from abundant affordable reliable
[03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:56.160]  fossil fuels to diffuse expensive intermittent green energy will in effect
[03:49:56.160 --> 03:50:00.560]  be a regressive tax in other words a taxable tax support at a much higher
[03:50:00.560 --> 03:50:05.440]  rate yeah that's correct and Great Britain has been experiencing this in
[03:50:05.440 --> 03:50:11.000]  just tragic ways because Britain adopted policies in the early 2000s to try to
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:16.240]  reduce CO2 emissions by reducing fossil fuel use and replacing that with wind
[03:50:16.240 --> 03:50:21.840]  and solar their electricity prices skyrocketed as by the way candidate
[03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:25.120]  Obama told us would happen if he were elected president because he would
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:29.760]  bankrupt coal companies and coal power plants and as a result electricity
[03:50:29.760 --> 03:50:34.360]  prices would necessarily skyrocket well when that happened in Britain the
[03:50:34.360 --> 03:50:42.760]  number of what what are called excess premature winter deaths yeah we'll
[03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:44.920]  cover that when we come back we don't have enough time to get that but yeah
[03:50:44.920 --> 03:50:49.960]  the EWD's people who die because of it's cold and they can't afford the power
[03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:53.680]  when Obama said he's going to bankrupt the coal companies he's also going to
[03:50:53.680 --> 03:50:57.160]  bankrupt dust folks when he takes away our energy and he'll kill us at an
[03:50:57.160 --> 03:51:00.920]  earlier age stay with us we'll be right back with Dr. Beisner here at

[03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:16.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host and we're
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:21.560]  talking to Dr. Calvin Beisner of the Cornwall Alliance and we're talking
[03:54:21.560 --> 03:54:26.320]  about a Christian view of the environment one of the things we want to
[03:54:26.320 --> 03:54:31.160]  talk about of course is how fuel poverty affects people's lifespans in
[03:54:31.160 --> 03:54:34.360]  developed countries not just in the developing countries of course we can
[03:54:34.360 --> 03:54:39.560]  all see how how devastating it is to those people that are in countries where
[03:54:39.560 --> 03:54:43.000]  they have very little energy to begin with but understand that this is going
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:46.840]  to be an effect against you in this country as well before we go back to
[03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:50.840]  Dr. Beisner I just want to let you know that we have some expiring specials at
[03:54:50.840 --> 03:54:56.480]  the Info Wars store our 995 silver silver bullet special as well as 30%

[03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:15.760]  it's going to expire at midnight tonight again that's at info wars store calm
[03:55:15.760 --> 03:55:20.480]  info wars life calm Dr. Beisner we were just talking before we went to the break
[03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:25.200]  about early winter deaths you actually had an article at Cornwall Alliance
[03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:29.440]  about climate policies kill through fuel poverty you actually quantitized this
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:33.400]  and it's not your figures it's the World Health Organization says that they
[03:55:33.400 --> 03:55:38.200]  estimate 30 to 40% of the early winter deaths in Europe and Great Britain are
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:42.920]  attributable to fuel pop poverty and they say that just in England and Wales
[03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:48.200]  alone that would be 8 to 11,000 deaths because people can't afford to heat
[03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:54.120]  their home yes every winter and yet yet people like President Obama will tell
[03:55:54.120 --> 03:55:59.640]  us that climate change is our greatest threat I mean this is just absurd the
[03:55:59.640 --> 03:56:04.800]  reality is that poverty is what kills more people around the world every year
[03:56:04.800 --> 03:56:11.000]  than anything else take this as an example in sub-Saharan Africa the average
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:15.240]  woman spends about six to eight hours a day doing nothing but gathering wood
[03:56:15.240 --> 03:56:20.720]  and dried dung in order to use those as her primary cooking and heating fuels
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:24.960]  that of course means that that's six to eight hours a day of her bodily energy
[03:56:24.960 --> 03:56:28.160]  that she doesn't have to do other things to lift herself and her children out of
[03:56:28.160 --> 03:56:33.160]  poverty but the smoke from that kills about four million people a year most
[03:56:33.160 --> 03:56:37.800]  of them women and young children and it also gives hundreds of millions of
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:41.640]  others a spur of upper respiratory diseases and eye infections that keep
[03:56:41.640 --> 03:56:46.200]  them from working to lift themselves out of poverty so that kind of thing is
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:51.160]  actually probably the greatest environmental risk to humans anywhere
[03:56:51.160 --> 03:56:56.640]  in the world and what is needed to replace that is to get these people on
[03:56:56.640 --> 03:57:03.000]  an electric grid with energy provided for that grid by coal or natural gas
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:08.920]  in some places nuclear could be done where instead of that dirty dirty fuel
[03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:13.120]  they would have a very clean fuel and it would be abundant it would be
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:17.160]  affordable it would be reliable here in the United States the average household
[03:57:17.160 --> 03:57:21.280]  spends only a few minutes a day earning the income necessary for all the
[03:57:21.280 --> 03:57:25.800]  electricity that we use and yet that electricity does far more for us than
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:30.560]  just to cook our food and heat our huts right well they need to have that same
[03:57:30.560 --> 03:57:35.720]  kind of thing and yet the policies that President Obama the Pope Francis are
[03:57:35.720 --> 03:57:40.360]  promoting would actually keep them from getting this and would harm them as
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:45.840]  they're already harming the the fuel poverty stricken of Great Britain and
[03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:49.440]  I think that's one of the real ethical issues here where is that money going
[03:57:49.440 --> 03:57:52.560]  when you see the increase in utility bills we just had the day before this
[03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:59.000]  Paris climate talk began we had a Spanish company Abingoa went bankrupt and we had
[03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:03.880]  given them three billion dollars to subsidize a massive renewable energy
[03:58:03.880 --> 03:58:07.960]  source these people have in Spain where they were they've had tripled the rates
[03:58:07.960 --> 03:58:11.480]  there triple what they are here in the United States that's where the money is
[03:58:11.480 --> 03:58:15.560]  going to these crony capitalists who can't even stay in business without
[03:58:15.560 --> 03:58:19.240]  massive government subsidies thank you so much for joining us Dr. E Calvin
[03:58:19.240 --> 03:58:23.680]  Beisner he's with the Cornwall Alliance and will it that's it for today's show
