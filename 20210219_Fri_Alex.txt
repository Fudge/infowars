[00:00.000 --> 00:20.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20.440 --> 00:23.600]  You know, I learned something during the Trump administration.
[00:23.600 --> 00:32.000]  I had never tried to be in LA, or be in New York, or be in DC, and to be around the power.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.480]  I had never tried to go be a sycophant and in the system, but I noticed very early on
[00:38.480 --> 00:45.080]  they would work around the clock to try to make sure that I didn't have access to the
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.040]  president or access to anybody high level government, because I always just thought
[00:50.040 --> 00:55.320]  inform the public about things, and then that would percolate up into government and into
[00:55.320 --> 01:01.920]  governance, and then we would be able to stand up against tyranny and take action against
[01:01.920 --> 01:04.880]  the globalist.
[01:04.880 --> 01:07.440]  But it's a balance.
[01:07.440 --> 01:10.680]  It's a balance.
[01:10.680 --> 01:15.440]  You also need to target, obviously, people that are in the power structure.
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.360]  And I'm almost tempted right now with the news I have that I've been working on the last
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.560]  hour to just not do the show today.
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.240]  It probably would be better if I just call Tucker Carlson, call Stephen Crowder, call
[01:26.240 --> 01:29.360]  Roger Stone, and try to get on the phone with Trump, because I can get on the phone with
[01:29.360 --> 01:33.400]  him if I need to, because I'm not putting the audience down.
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.280]  We cover so much hardcore stuff here, but we're here every day.
[01:37.280 --> 01:39.400]  No one kind of takes it serious.
[01:39.400 --> 01:43.320]  We just drop bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.640]  bomb after bomb, but familiarity breeds contempt.
[01:47.640 --> 01:48.640]  And I get it.
[01:48.640 --> 01:49.640]  I get it for myself, too.
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.080]  I don't realize how important we are in the great work we've done.
[01:52.080 --> 01:53.720]  I understand that.
[01:53.720 --> 01:56.960]  I understand that.
[01:56.960 --> 02:01.720]  Distance makes the heart grow fond familiarity, breeds contempt, a contempt.
[02:01.720 --> 02:03.840]  So I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while.
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.400]  We're going to get real re-ready to shoot the show, go live here today.
[02:07.400 --> 02:11.720]  And then I may not do the show today, just because this is too important.
[02:11.720 --> 02:19.640]  I have the smoking gun, absolute, total, complete, master plan of the enemy.
[02:19.640 --> 02:25.200]  We have them by the short hairs completely, and no one is going to care.
[02:25.200 --> 02:26.200]  It's always the same.
[02:26.200 --> 02:31.680]  If it gives total proof of just absolute evil that will destroy the enemy, no one cares.
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.920]  If it's some vague cue thing, or somebody saw the Virgin Mary in a piece of toast or
[02:36.920 --> 02:42.440]  something, then it's the most important thing in the world.
[02:42.440 --> 02:45.040]  But I'm here to tell you, we had to get back in the new studio today.
[02:45.040 --> 02:46.280]  We weren't quite ready to launch.
[02:46.280 --> 02:47.280]  It's okay.
[02:47.280 --> 02:48.280]  I'm blaming the crew.
[02:48.280 --> 02:49.280]  That's okay.
[02:49.280 --> 02:52.520]  It's going to give me some time while they get set up and ready to go and to prepare
[02:52.520 --> 02:55.200]  my broadcast.
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.200]  Because here's the deal.
[02:56.200 --> 02:59.400]  I'm not just going to sit here and put this information out and just have it.
[02:59.400 --> 03:00.400]  Nothing happened.
[03:00.400 --> 03:01.400]  I'll quit today.
[03:01.400 --> 03:09.480]  I want to walk away from this place so bad, because we have all the evidence of what the
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.080]  enemy's done, and no one does shit with it.
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.080]  Nothing.
[03:14.080 --> 03:18.480]  I don't know why people don't have an instinct to victory, but it's incredible.
[03:18.480 --> 03:20.560]  What am I talking about?
[03:20.560 --> 03:21.560]  What's the big news?
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.560]  No one cares.
[03:22.560 --> 03:25.960]  I shouldn't even say it, probably.
[03:25.960 --> 03:29.080]  At least when I call other people that are influential, they care, and they'll look into
[03:29.080 --> 03:31.360]  it and put it out.
[03:31.360 --> 03:32.600]  I call Paul Watson with this.
[03:32.600 --> 03:34.160]  Oh, he's busy out on a date or something.
[03:34.160 --> 03:35.160]  I'm not mad at Paul.
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.600]  He already wrote like five articles today.
[03:36.600 --> 03:38.680]  It's just that I don't have the people.
[03:38.680 --> 03:40.120]  I don't have the infrastructure.
[03:40.120 --> 03:41.120]  I don't have anything.
[03:41.120 --> 03:44.600]  I mean, we could have the keys to put Lucifer into the pit of hell.
[03:44.600 --> 03:45.600]  No one would care.
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.440]  They'd be busy getting their fucking nails done.
[03:50.440 --> 03:57.840]  Oh, my God.
[03:57.840 --> 04:04.280]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, we have the smoking gun of what did the power outage.
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.920]  100% it was the Department of Energy and their order to keep the power off.
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.320]  You understand we have that, and no one gives a damn.
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.560]  I quit then, screw this whole freaking place, man.
[04:16.560 --> 04:19.640]  I mean, this is just all out of control.
[04:19.640 --> 04:22.480]  It's unbelievable.
[04:22.480 --> 04:25.160]  We have released so many smoking guns, so much proof.
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.080]  Joe Biden is on TV, on CNN, saying Xi Jinping is doing a good job invading Hong Kong and
[04:31.080 --> 04:32.680]  running giant death camps.
[04:32.680 --> 04:35.840]  Fine, if America wants that, then frickin' have it.
[04:35.840 --> 04:40.960]  If you want your power turned off by the Department of Energy, then enjoy it.
[04:40.960 --> 04:43.960]  I'm going to run some tape, so I'm not even sure I'm coming on today, screw this whole
[04:43.960 --> 04:44.960]  place.
[04:44.960 --> 04:47.840]  God, this country is totally after me.
[04:47.840 --> 04:50.200]  God almighty, let it all burn, then.
[04:50.200 --> 04:54.640]  I mean, we can't even admit aborting babies is murder, so we don't deserve to have power.
[04:54.640 --> 05:02.040]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[05:02.040 --> 05:07.400]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[05:07.400 --> 05:10.040]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[05:10.040 --> 05:11.540]  Because it works.
[05:11.540 --> 05:13.480]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[05:13.480 --> 05:21.680]  So whether it's sawpaw meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostaguard,
[05:21.680 --> 05:27.040]  or whether it is the super high-grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra-12, or whether it's
[05:27.040 --> 05:34.040]  the PQQ or the CoQ-10 in DNA force, or the pure Deep Earth crystal iodine in X2, these
[05:34.040 --> 05:40.800]  are all the very best supplements you're going to find in already great market of high-quality
[05:40.800 --> 05:41.800]  products out there.
[05:41.800 --> 05:43.800]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.200]  So even if these products weren't high-quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWare
[05:47.200 --> 05:48.200]  so you can't lose.
[05:48.200 --> 05:50.760]  InfoWare delivers in space.
[05:50.760 --> 05:53.440]  Please visit InfoWareStore.com and get the products today.
[05:53.440 --> 06:23.280]  Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWareStore.com.
[06:23.280 --> 06:24.280]  All right.
[06:24.280 --> 06:26.280]  The United States is being taught to be a third-world country.
[06:26.280 --> 06:29.560]  We're being taught to have no borders and collapsing power grid.
[06:29.560 --> 06:30.560]  It's all by design.
[06:30.560 --> 06:31.800]  It's all public.
[06:31.800 --> 06:37.480]  And I told you in the last few years, I told you in the last week, that I've got a lot
[06:37.480 --> 06:39.840]  of sources in the power grid, a lot of people working at power plants.
[06:39.840 --> 06:43.760]  It's all well known that the federal government orders them not to turn up capacity, and they
[06:43.760 --> 06:46.040]  got to get the government to authorize it.
[06:46.040 --> 06:48.120]  And I told you this on Monday.
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.280]  I told you this on Sunday.
[06:49.280 --> 06:52.000]  I told you this on Tuesday, on Wednesday, on Thursday.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.720]  And I just got hit before the show, like a ton of bricks, as we launched the Alex Jones
[06:56.720 --> 07:03.080]  show here on this Friday, February 19th global transmission.
[07:03.080 --> 07:08.000]  And it just hit me when I was given a Department of Energy document that's public, that no
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  one's going to care.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  No one cares.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.280]  I mean, it doesn't matter that it says you're not allowed to produce energy and you've got
[07:14.280 --> 07:15.280]  to keep your power cut off.
[07:15.280 --> 07:16.280]  It doesn't matter.
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.880]  You said you can buy energy from outside the state so they can enron scammers and charge
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.880]  us up to 10,000 times the amount.
[07:23.880 --> 07:26.680]  This is smoking gun stuff.
[07:26.680 --> 07:34.160]  And then I've got a bunch of other big, giant, smoking guns.
[07:34.160 --> 07:36.680]  But I'm too angry to do the show right now.
[07:36.680 --> 07:40.480]  I am too damn angry to do this broadcast right now.
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.160]  And there's a lot of other stuff going on, so I'm going to just, and I've got to go find
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.160]  my stack of news from yesterday.
[07:46.160 --> 07:48.520]  I've got to do a lot of stuff around here.
[07:48.520 --> 07:51.760]  I watched somebody walk out with my stack here and say, oh, no, you've got the stack.
[07:51.760 --> 07:53.920]  I'll go get it myself.
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.560]  But I'm not even bitching anymore.
[07:55.560 --> 08:00.080]  I just can't do this six, seven days a week and just with the public like zombies everywhere.
[08:00.080 --> 08:02.480]  Just like walking into globalist machine gun fire.
[08:02.480 --> 08:05.800]  And then that weird reanimated corpse, Biden stumbling around up there.
[08:05.800 --> 08:06.800]  Just all of it.
[08:06.800 --> 08:12.040]  It's a joke because people are unconscious from watching TV and playing on their phones
[08:12.040 --> 08:13.040]  all day.
[08:13.040 --> 08:16.280]  It manipulates all the deputy receptors where people think that's the real world and the
[08:16.280 --> 08:19.720]  real world, they're all, ooh, ooh, ooh, like this.
[08:19.720 --> 08:21.920]  And I just, I just don't want to be around this anymore.
[08:21.920 --> 08:22.920]  Maybe Bill Gates is right.
[08:22.920 --> 08:24.520]  Just kill everybody.
[08:24.520 --> 08:27.520]  But use neutron bombs at least and kill them quick, man.
[08:27.520 --> 08:29.520]  Don't mutate them and torture them and dumb them down.
[08:29.520 --> 08:30.520]  But Bill Gates likes that.
[08:30.520 --> 08:36.280]  Bill Gates, get a deal with the globalist and start neutron bombing the public.
[08:36.280 --> 08:39.400]  Just neutron bomb everybody, then we don't kill the earth that the humans are gotten
[08:39.400 --> 08:40.400]  rid of.
[08:40.400 --> 08:41.400]  Maybe he's right.
[08:41.400 --> 08:44.920]  Maybe I should go work for Gates and just come up with a neutron bomb plan.
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.640]  I know Bertrand Russell had one before they called it a neutron bomb.
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.800]  Maybe that's, maybe that's the answer, not a start over.
[08:54.800 --> 08:55.800]  You know, God did it.
[08:55.800 --> 08:56.800]  So I guess we're just imitating God.
[08:56.800 --> 09:02.600]  Maybe I should just salute Bill Gates right now on there, pledge allegiance to him.
[09:02.600 --> 09:03.600]  Nobody else cares.
[09:03.600 --> 09:05.800]  At least he actually wants to run something.
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.600]  Man, I tell you.
[09:09.600 --> 09:10.760]  All right.
[09:10.760 --> 09:13.440]  I have the giant news, but no one, no one cares, of course.
[09:13.440 --> 09:14.440]  I'm serious.
[09:14.440 --> 09:15.440]  No one cares.
[09:15.440 --> 09:19.200]  Maybe if I freak out, maybe if I cut a few fingers off with loppers and people go, and
[09:19.200 --> 09:20.200]  this is really important.
[09:20.200 --> 09:21.200]  This will bring down the globalists.
[09:21.200 --> 09:22.200]  Here, let me cut my pinky off.
[09:22.200 --> 09:24.400]  Oh, now you pay attention.
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.120]  The Department of Energy on record told Texas, you can't produce more power.
[09:28.120 --> 09:30.920]  I have the damn document with a direct link to them.
[09:30.920 --> 09:32.920]  They'll just have snopes say it isn't real.
[09:32.920 --> 09:41.080]  Hell, we wouldn't be able to pull it up in there, probably.
[09:41.080 --> 09:43.520]  So anyways, I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while.
[09:43.520 --> 09:45.560]  I'm going to try to settle down.
[09:45.560 --> 09:49.680]  And then I'm going to come back and lay all this out for you.
[09:49.680 --> 09:53.560]  It's so incredible.
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.400]  And then there's all this other big bombshell news we've got today.
[09:59.400 --> 10:00.400]  Let's just go to this report.
[10:00.400 --> 10:05.840]  We don't have time there the whole thing, but this is a good report.
[10:05.840 --> 10:12.000]  This is Tucker Carlson months ago warning about the COVID vaccine mRNA and saying it's
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.360]  unprivileged and untested, and the media all freaking out now just yesterday was saying,
[10:16.360 --> 10:17.360]  take him off the air.
[10:17.360 --> 10:18.360]  He questioned the vaccine.
[10:18.360 --> 10:19.360]  You can't do that.
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.800]  It's not even a vaccine.
[10:20.800 --> 10:24.840]  And then now you've got the internal Zuckerberg report that just came out where he admits
[10:24.840 --> 10:26.720]  he wouldn't take it because it's untested.
[10:26.720 --> 10:29.080]  And India did ban it.
[10:29.080 --> 10:32.480]  And then they had snopes come out and others say I'm a liar, but I have all the proof and
[10:32.480 --> 10:33.480]  all the documents.
[10:33.480 --> 10:34.480]  And I'm going to show you that.
[10:34.480 --> 10:39.400]  And Paul Watson wrote a big article up on infowars.com about it.
[10:39.400 --> 10:42.480]  So here is the Tucker Carlson report.
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.560]  It's actually four and a half minutes before I'm going to try to settle down.
[10:46.560 --> 10:48.320]  I'm going to try to come back in here.
[10:48.320 --> 10:53.040]  It's just that I was even mad at myself, too, because I already knew there was a Department
[10:53.040 --> 10:57.680]  of Energy directive not to turn the power up, but instead I just told you that instead
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.240]  of going and getting the document, one of our producers, Scott, God Blessing, did go
[11:01.240 --> 11:02.240]  get the document.
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.240]  But see, I'm even mad at myself.
[11:03.240 --> 11:08.440]  It's like, oh, I just tell you there's an agreement and an order and a law, which I
[11:08.440 --> 11:10.800]  knew, but the public doesn't listen to that.
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.320]  You have to see the document.
[11:13.320 --> 11:15.680]  Well, you will see it.
[11:15.680 --> 11:18.080]  You will read it and know why I'm so pissed off.
[11:18.080 --> 11:22.760]  I'm under attack, and so are you, and I don't want to put up with it anymore, and I won't
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.720]  put up with these people, bunch of damn criminals.
[11:26.720 --> 11:28.120]  Here's Tucker Carlson on the vaccine.
[11:28.120 --> 11:29.120]  We'll be back.
[11:29.120 --> 11:34.520]  After months of hearing that life could never return to normal until we get a vaccine, we
[11:34.520 --> 11:37.160]  got a vaccine, two vaccines, actually.
[11:37.160 --> 11:39.240]  But life did not return to normal.
[11:39.240 --> 11:40.560]  Life got worse.
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.680]  We were instructed to take the new vaccine as soon as possible and then to put on more
[11:44.680 --> 11:45.840]  masks.
[11:45.840 --> 11:47.760]  One mask was no longer enough.
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.360]  Anyone who complained about that was punished.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.640]  Most people obeyed the orders.
[11:51.640 --> 11:53.260]  They had no choice.
[11:53.260 --> 11:55.600]  But the whole thing made them nervous.
[11:55.600 --> 11:57.000]  How could it not?
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.880]  Why exactly did the rules change all of a sudden, they wondered?
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.920]  Was there a good reason for that?
[12:01.920 --> 12:04.360]  When are we finally going to repeal Corona law?
[12:04.360 --> 12:06.720]  And what about this vaccine?
[12:06.720 --> 12:12.160]  Why are Americans being discouraged from asking simple, straightforward questions about it?
[12:12.160 --> 12:14.280]  Questions like, how effective are these drugs?
[12:14.280 --> 12:15.280]  Are they safe?
[12:15.280 --> 12:18.000]  What's the miscarriage risk for pregnant women, for example?
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.200]  Is there a study on that?
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.560]  May we see it?
[12:20.560 --> 12:23.440]  And by the way, how much of the drug company is making off this stuff?
[12:23.440 --> 12:26.840]  Well, there's nothing QAnon about questions like that.
[12:26.840 --> 12:29.240]  They're not conspiracy theories.
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.480]  They're the most basic questions.
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.440]  In a democracy, every citizen has a right to know the answer.
[12:36.440 --> 12:39.320]  But instead, we got fluff and propaganda.
[12:39.320 --> 12:42.960]  The media rollout for the vaccine came off like a diet Pepsi commercial at the Super
[12:42.960 --> 12:43.960]  Bowl.
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.400]  Tons of celebrity endorsements, not a lot of science.
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.840]  It was totally disingenuous, and naturally, it had the opposite of the intended effect.
[12:52.840 --> 12:55.320]  Most Americans already supported vaccines.
[12:55.320 --> 12:58.760]  They didn't need to be brow-beaten in order to be convinced.
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.320]  They were grateful their kids no longer get tetanus and polio and chickenpox.
[13:02.320 --> 13:04.840]  They weren't anti-vaxxers.
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.480]  And yet from the very first day, the way the authorities handled the COVID vaccine did
[13:09.480 --> 13:11.520]  not inspire confidence.
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.160]  If the vaccine was so great, why were all these people lying about it?
[13:16.160 --> 13:17.400]  Honest question.
[13:17.400 --> 13:18.400]  And they were lying.
[13:18.400 --> 13:19.400]  Clearly, they were lying.
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.200]  You know that for certain, because from the moment the COVID vaccine arrived, the most
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.840]  powerful people in America worked to make certain that no one could criticize it.
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.200]  Here's Bill Gates' wife on CNN back in December.
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.600]  Do the social media companies, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, on and on, have a responsibility
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.400]  to do more right now, Melinda, in terms of getting this misinformation, this disinformation
[13:43.400 --> 13:45.600]  off their platforms?
[13:45.600 --> 13:48.120]  They absolutely have a responsibility.
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.000]  The internet and the rise of social media has happened so quickly that really the regulations
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.160]  and the good policymaking hasn't stayed out in front of it.
[13:59.160 --> 14:02.840]  And quite frankly, it needs to catch up.
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.080]  Quite frankly, she says, we need to censor people's views on the COVID vaccine.
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.840]  Now, remember, Melinda Gates is not a scientist.
[14:10.840 --> 14:12.720]  She did not develop this vaccine.
[14:12.720 --> 14:17.480]  She has no background in epidemiology or any relevant discipline.
[14:17.480 --> 14:20.640]  She worked in the marketing department at Microsoft.
[14:20.640 --> 14:22.280]  But she's the wife of a billionaire.
[14:22.280 --> 14:23.600]  That's why she's on television.
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.840]  It's why she's allowed to control what you're allowed to say about the drug she is demanding
[14:27.840 --> 14:29.800]  you inject in your body.
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.440]  Is this really science?
[14:31.440 --> 14:32.440]  Not even close.
[14:32.440 --> 14:33.440]  It's oligarchy.
[14:33.440 --> 14:35.960]  And all the billionaires are participating in it.
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.880]  The tech companies announced early they would not allow anyone to criticize this vaccine,
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.160]  and anyone who did would be kicked off their platforms right away.
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.080]  And then corporate media took it upon themselves to enforce this rule.
[14:47.080 --> 14:52.440]  Just yesterday, CNN ran a story with this headline, quote, Facebook vowed to crack down
[14:52.440 --> 14:58.560]  on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, but misleading posts remain easy to find.
[14:58.560 --> 14:59.920]  That's not a news story.
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.760]  That's an open call for censorship, and it worked.
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.760]  CNN identified a group on Facebook called COVID-19 vaccine injury stories, and the group
[15:08.760 --> 15:10.420]  was exactly what it sounds like.
[15:10.420 --> 15:13.480]  People talking about their experiences with the vaccine.
[15:13.480 --> 15:16.960]  Last week, that group was in the top 20 groups on all of Facebook.
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.320]  Today, after the CNN piece came out, we searched for that group.
[15:20.320 --> 15:21.760]  We couldn't find it.
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.840]  And when we searched specifically for its name, effectively, COVID-19 vaccine injury
[15:26.840 --> 15:28.640]  stories no longer exists.
[15:28.640 --> 15:31.640]  CNN shut them down, erased them.
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.120]  Instead, search for the word vaccine on Facebook, and you will find a lot of material, exclusively
[15:36.120 --> 15:41.000]  material, that matches precisely the storyline approved by Melinda Gates and her fellow
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.640]  non-scientist billionaires.
[15:43.640 --> 15:44.640]  And the line is clear.
[15:44.640 --> 15:45.720]  You've heard it a million times.
[15:45.720 --> 15:48.560]  The COVID vaccine is morally good, period.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.320]  Don't dare say anything else.
[15:50.320 --> 15:53.720]  So if your neighbor drops dead after getting the shot, keep it to yourself.
[15:53.720 --> 15:55.920]  Facts like that are not allowed on Facebook.
[15:55.920 --> 16:02.800]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[16:02.800 --> 16:07.440]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.280]  made the image of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free
[16:12.280 --> 16:13.280]  will.
[16:13.280 --> 16:19.280]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.960]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.480]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[16:28.480 --> 16:32.800]  of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[16:32.800 --> 16:33.800]  of music.
[16:33.800 --> 16:38.640]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself
[16:38.640 --> 16:41.520]  is what God teaches us, is worship.
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.080]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[16:46.080 --> 16:50.920]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God, and appreciate
[16:50.920 --> 16:55.080]  your consciousness, and appreciate pre-speech while you still have it, while you still
[16:55.080 --> 16:56.880]  have it.
[16:56.880 --> 17:02.640]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[17:02.640 --> 17:08.760]  food, and medicine, and with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.680]  to bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined
[17:14.680 --> 17:19.760]  up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open, and most of them getting turned
[17:19.760 --> 17:22.440]  away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.400]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.400]  in their house, and then running out of gas.
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king, and food is the energy our bodies run off of, and water
[17:33.160 --> 17:34.160]  as well.
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.040]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration, and the highest quality
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.520]  storeable foods right now, massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide

[17:48.040 --> 17:51.720]  storeable food in all packages at infowarstore.com.
[17:51.720 --> 17:59.800]  That's infowarstore.com or preparewithalex.com, big discounts for all of you, a few more days.
[17:59.800 --> 18:25.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:25.800 --> 18:38.380]  I expect to see articles saying, Alex Jones wants Bill Gates to kill the world's population
[18:38.380 --> 18:39.880]  with neutron bombs.
[18:39.880 --> 18:46.440]  It's called devil's advocate, I don't want that, but if you sit there and you say you
[18:46.440 --> 18:50.360]  don't want people to starve to death and have mass cannibalism, no one cares.
[18:50.360 --> 18:55.920]  But if you say as society collapses under agenda 2030, and the UN says billions are
[18:55.920 --> 18:59.160]  planning to starve to death the next decade, you're going to have a lot of cannibalism
[18:59.160 --> 19:02.920]  and breakdown of society in the third world, I've got to think about eating my neighbors.
[19:02.920 --> 19:07.840]  I've got to think about hauling them up with a chain, chopping them up to eat them.
[19:07.840 --> 19:15.400]  And I said before I said that, this is a Jonathan Swift allegory of a modest proposal where
[19:15.400 --> 19:20.240]  they were treating Irish so bad, and he was part Irish in English, and he was an aristocrat
[19:20.240 --> 19:25.880]  and he wrote a big essay, a modest proposal saying, these Irish need to stop bitching
[19:25.880 --> 19:29.960]  about their kids starving to death, and they'd also put them in poor houses, basically slave
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.440]  camps to work out their debts after the potato famine, they said, why don't they start plumping
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.760]  up their children and then we'll sell them to English lords and ladies to be roasted
[19:38.760 --> 19:39.760]  and eaten.
[19:39.760 --> 19:44.840]  Of course, they got satire back at the time and it really woke a lot of people up and
[19:44.840 --> 19:51.560]  they realized how callous they were letting the Irish, you just starved to death, but
[19:51.560 --> 19:55.360]  the left of course took it and said, oh my God, Jones wants to really eat his neighbors,
[19:55.360 --> 19:57.400]  and by the way, I knew they'd do that, I did it on purpose.
[19:57.400 --> 20:00.840]  I didn't lie, I said it was satire in the same segment.
[20:00.840 --> 20:04.960]  I knew they would take that, put it out and get 50 million views, send us a giant audience
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.680]  to find a real show, but what you saw last two segments was not me manipulating the left,
[20:09.680 --> 20:14.080]  that was me having a real meltdown, and I apologize the crew, they're great, this is
[20:14.080 --> 20:17.160]  the best crew I've ever had, they've sat up here, went through hell to be here to run
[20:17.160 --> 20:21.440]  the show, with the power off and all the rest of the insanity.
[20:21.440 --> 20:27.160]  But I'll just tell you, before I went live on air, I got a bunch of extra news that
[20:27.160 --> 20:36.080]  I would already was told by a very close person to me, and I dropped the ball on Monday and
[20:36.080 --> 20:42.440]  just said, I've been told by inside sources in Texas power plants that the feds ordered
[20:42.440 --> 20:45.920]  them not to increase power, I should have followed up on that, I already knew there
[20:45.920 --> 20:48.840]  was those agreements, I already knew about those documents, I should have gotten the
[20:48.840 --> 20:53.120]  current ones, I should have found out, well let me see the directive, instead I just went
[20:53.120 --> 20:59.120]  and poured another glass of wine, and sat by the fire in the dark.
[20:59.120 --> 21:04.280]  And then son of a bitch, a whistleblower inside Department of Energy contacted someone that
[21:04.280 --> 21:09.800]  works here and said, why is Jones not covering this, no one else is, and I read it 20 minutes
[21:09.800 --> 21:12.600]  before I went on air, and I already knew all that was real, we went and checked, it's on
[21:12.600 --> 21:16.640]  the Department of Energy website, and it was like being punched in the chest and the stomach
[21:16.640 --> 21:24.080]  over and over again to read for sure they raped us, for sure they're doing it.
[21:24.080 --> 21:33.400]  I am so freaking pissed man, I can't take much more of these people.
[21:33.400 --> 21:40.920]  In the way it's written, so slimy, so I tried to get focused, I tried to get ready, I tried
[21:40.920 --> 21:44.880]  to come on do a good job, but I blew up the last few seconds, but what I said was true,
[21:44.880 --> 21:50.120]  I can get more done if I call a bunch of influential people I know, and tell them to look into
[21:50.120 --> 21:53.020]  this and let them break it, I don't care about breaking it, and then it will actually have
[21:53.020 --> 21:57.080]  an effect, instead the audience is great, but I say so much stuff, people just hear
[21:57.080 --> 22:01.360]  it and just think, oh that's another thing Alex just said, no it's not, it's the biggest
[22:01.360 --> 22:09.920]  freaking smoking gun I ever saw, to quote Robert Duvall in network, it's a big titted
[22:09.920 --> 22:10.920]  hit, okay?
[22:10.920 --> 22:18.000]  I mean this thing would hurt them so freaking bad, I hate the new world order, I can't stand
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.320]  Bill Gates, I can't stand Warren Buffett, I can't stand Ted Turner, I can't stand Barack
[22:23.320 --> 22:31.320]  Obama, I can't stand him anymore, I want him off my back now you mothers!
[22:31.320 --> 22:36.560]  And then I sit there and I read exactly what I was told by my family that works in these
[22:36.560 --> 22:44.320]  damn plants, that they're ordered to go at zero or quarter power under the freaking federal
[22:44.320 --> 22:50.320]  government because Biden put them back under the son of a bitch two weeks ago.
[22:50.320 --> 22:55.000]  Now we all knew that, and everybody talked about it and said, oh did the Department of
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.280]  Energy do this, we have the freaking document, now you see why baby I shouldn't be on it,
[23:01.280 --> 23:08.640]  come here, let's just say this, I could probably win a boxing match right now, that's why I
[23:08.640 --> 23:13.280]  put me in a ring, I know you could too, and I don't want violence folks but I cannot take
[23:13.280 --> 23:14.280]  it anymore, okay?
[23:14.280 --> 23:23.760]  It'll say you better settle down here and have a hard time, yeah probably so, I mean
[23:23.760 --> 23:30.920]  yesterday I had like 50 articles, type it in, Texas exceptionalism is to blame for no power,
[23:30.920 --> 23:35.760]  this sucks, Texas is a joke, Texans are idiots, Texans don't know how to do anything, Texans
[23:35.760 --> 23:39.400]  don't know how to have power, and I had all the proof they turned off over 100 of our
[23:39.400 --> 23:44.480]  coal plants and Urkots run by leftists under federal control and I knew the windmills failed
[23:44.480 --> 23:48.760]  so awesome, I mean I knew all that, I knew they were lying, but to know they're doing
[23:48.760 --> 23:54.200]  it while the Department of Energy ordered them to do it, yeah there's one of the, I
[23:54.200 --> 23:59.160]  mean these things are everywhere, it's time to bury the myth of Texas exceptionalism.
[23:59.160 --> 24:04.480]  Well I don't want to say I'm exceptional or Texas is exceptional but compared to the
[24:04.480 --> 24:08.800]  blue cities and blue states we are and they show an old lady in COVID mask and a wheelchair
[24:08.800 --> 24:13.400]  and everybody hunched over and pathetic because that's who they want you to think you are,
[24:13.400 --> 24:16.640]  that's why they do the blackouts, it's why they have the homeless everywhere, it's why
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.000]  they ship the drugs in, it's why they defund the police, it's why they demoralize us, it's
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.320]  why they have the army officers and others wear red high heels and learn how to get blow
[24:25.320 --> 24:26.960]  jobs.
[24:26.960 --> 24:33.160]  That's literally done, it's to demoralize everyone and let me just say it's not demoralizing
[24:33.160 --> 24:41.880]  me, it's trying to mean to Captain Caveman, so these arrogant Ivy League and globalist
[24:41.880 --> 24:46.960]  EU bureaucrats that run things like ERCOT, think you're an idiot and ran this whole thing
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.360]  so they can federalize the grid and bring in the scam and that's the whole next level.
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.940]  Remember me on Tuesday saying 10,000% increases in prices and people thought I saw comments
[24:56.940 --> 25:05.720]  but Jones is exaggerating, wait till I come back, so I'm going to try to control myself
[25:05.720 --> 25:14.120]  with my reporter hat on, take some deep breaths, take some deep breaths, take some, be a friendly
[25:14.120 --> 25:19.520]  nice little bunny rabbit when I come back and I'm going to show you all the documents
[25:19.520 --> 25:26.920]  and all the proof and people that were getting $100 bills are getting $3,000 bills already,
[25:26.920 --> 25:32.280]  from just a few days, so I guess the lucky people were the ones that had your power off
[25:32.280 --> 25:39.240]  because those of you that had your power on, oh lordy lordy and guess what's in the document,
[25:39.240 --> 25:44.680]  the Department of Energy told Texas under federal law you'll be prosecuted unless you
[25:44.680 --> 25:50.360]  exhaust outside power supplies first, so that was the whole reason as I told you on Monday
[25:50.360 --> 25:55.520]  because it's following the Enron plan is they made tens of billions of dollars off Texans
[25:55.520 --> 26:01.280]  alone these outside power groups by ordering ERCOT to not up power and then they had to
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.840]  under regulations pay whatever the groups wanted to charge and they ripped this off, so on
[26:05.840 --> 26:10.600]  top of killing over 50 people that froze the death including little kids and the hundreds
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.440]  of died in car wrecks and all the rest of it and all the cattle production and all the
[26:14.440 --> 26:18.520]  dead cattle and the milk cows and the hundreds of millions of gallons of milk didn't dump
[26:18.520 --> 26:22.920]  in the whatever, on top of all of that and hearing how Texas sucks and how Biden going
[26:22.920 --> 26:27.640]  to take over Texas and run it now because we don't know how to do anything, on top of
[26:27.640 --> 26:32.520]  all that they're gouging the living snot out of us because they're technocrats and we
[26:32.520 --> 26:37.440]  sit there and take it and to the governor's credit and the rest of them, I didn't know
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.920]  all this, they had meteorologists for us even on the news saying you better get the power
[26:41.920 --> 26:45.360]  grid turned on and Abbott was begging the feds to turn the power on, hey how about
[26:45.360 --> 26:51.000]  Abbott you tell them burn in hell and you turn the freaking power on, God, this is not
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.200]  a federal government, it's a chai-kong occupation force.
[26:55.200 --> 27:00.480]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left, it can be very stressful dealing
[27:00.480 --> 27:02.880]  with facts you refuse to accept.
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.600]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[27:07.600 --> 27:14.080]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com, studies have suggested that fish oils and
[27:14.080 --> 27:20.400]  fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.880]  reduce the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[27:25.880 --> 27:28.600]  in joints and the digestive system.
[27:28.600 --> 27:35.240]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[27:35.240 --> 27:39.840]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.800]  It works for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual

[29:57.960 --> 30:09.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:09.480 --> 30:18.880]  This is the end, beautiful prayer.
[30:18.880 --> 30:35.160]  This is the end, my only friend, the end of our elaborate last year, of everything that
[30:35.160 --> 30:47.440]  stands the end, no safety goes the price, the end, I'll never look again.
[30:47.440 --> 30:52.720]  I've been on air 27 years and I've never had such a smoking gun.
[30:52.720 --> 30:59.480]  I got a call Saturday from family, I didn't return the call till Monday, and they worked
[30:59.480 --> 31:02.960]  in the energy sector and they said, Alex, you need to look at federal regulations that
[31:02.960 --> 31:07.560]  Trump deactivated but that Biden's reactivated and I started interrupting like I do.
[31:07.560 --> 31:09.960]  I said, oh, oh, the Chinese are a lot in our grit.
[31:09.960 --> 31:11.840]  No, no, no, that's not it.
[31:11.840 --> 31:15.960]  It's an executive order of Obama and it's the Department of Energy, federal law that
[31:15.960 --> 31:23.640]  Congress passed 10 years ago and ERCOT was meant to come and manage this for Texas so
[31:23.640 --> 31:27.920]  the Texas didn't have liability and the Texas employees didn't have liability, that's how
[31:27.920 --> 31:33.360]  they sold it, was that you had to have an outside corporate group so you have liability
[31:33.360 --> 31:38.520]  running it and so it's ERCOT, it's like Enron that does the management and Enron is the
[31:38.520 --> 31:40.360]  model of this.
[31:40.360 --> 31:48.200]  And we're not allowed, whether it's hydroelectric or whether it is turbine, it doesn't matter.
[31:48.200 --> 31:53.560]  We have to ask authorization to turn power up, period, because power is seen as dirty
[31:53.560 --> 31:55.520]  regardless of where it came from.
[31:55.520 --> 31:58.280]  So you need to look into those federal agreements and then they were telling me the names and
[31:58.280 --> 32:01.840]  stuff and I'm like, okay, I will, I go on here and I go, I've talked to sources that
[32:01.840 --> 32:06.080]  they weren't allowed to turn the plants up and that they were asking a week before.
[32:06.080 --> 32:09.480]  So then I'm sitting here about 30 months for the show and the one producer walks up and
[32:09.480 --> 32:13.320]  says, hey, the other producer who worked all weekend, who's, you know, are all weekers
[32:13.320 --> 32:16.600]  off the day, his source in the Department of Energy sent this link.
[32:16.600 --> 32:20.960]  No one is covering this, we went to the Department of Energy, it's on their website, you can
[32:20.960 --> 32:26.360]  find it yourself, will give you the order number and when I read it, I became so angry
[32:26.360 --> 32:31.280]  that I literally, you saw what happened, that was not me letting the dog off the leash,
[32:31.280 --> 32:34.400]  that was the dog jumping over the fence.
[32:34.400 --> 32:37.040]  And you should be angry about this.
[32:37.040 --> 32:49.880]  This is insane, DOE202C emergency order ERCOT02.14.2021, you can put that in DuckDuckGo, you can
[32:49.880 --> 32:55.680]  put that in Google, put that in Microsoft BingyWingy, all of it and it comes right up
[32:55.680 --> 33:05.400]  and I mean, when you read this and you know the background, it'll make your blood boil.
[33:05.400 --> 33:10.160]  They say, okay, governor's begging a week before because they knew this Arctic vortex
[33:10.160 --> 33:13.320]  was bad and meteorologists are saying it may come down here, so I'll have to give the governor,
[33:13.320 --> 33:17.360]  I've got problems with credit, he was saying quietly, should have been on the news, making
[33:17.360 --> 33:22.520]  a political issue out of this, Abbott and others are saying, and the Department of Energy
[33:22.520 --> 33:30.040]  in Texas is saying, you need, let's call the railroad commission here, you need to turn
[33:30.040 --> 33:36.360]  these controls off because we think this is about to hit the state and they didn't do
[33:36.360 --> 33:40.800]  it until it already hit and it's all right here and they told them, according to the
[33:40.800 --> 33:47.040]  code, you've got to use outside power first and you've got to use low emission systems.
[33:47.040 --> 33:53.200]  Well, the windmills were frozen and one of the reactors went out and so, Texas always
[33:53.200 --> 33:57.240]  had more power than anybody, we used to supply before Obama came in, the states all around
[33:57.240 --> 34:00.800]  us, remember that, our grid supplied much of the country, that's what we were proud
[34:00.800 --> 34:04.920]  of it, remember the U.S. under Trump got to where it was the biggest supplier of energy
[34:04.920 --> 34:11.320]  in the world for the first time since the 50s and remember, Texas was the main supplier,
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.600]  but it's all over the news, Texas is pathetic, Texas is done, Texas are idiots, oh, Biden's
[34:16.600 --> 34:23.000]  going to federalize them, oh, what in those windmills, oh no, even Bloomberg went and
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.720]  pulled articles down from days ago admitting it was the windmills, but it wasn't the windmills,
[34:26.720 --> 34:37.480]  the windmills were just part of the scam, it was an order to not allow them to operate
[34:37.480 --> 34:46.800]  and then to only do it from quote, green sources that didn't work and couldn't supply, but
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.440]  the key is it's about embarrassing Texas, it's about power and control, it's about you
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.680]  having less, it's about you learning, I said rolling blackouts are coming nationwide, last
[34:56.680 --> 35:01.360]  few years, didn't I, that's inagent of 21, that's inagent of 23, they say we have rolling
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.240]  blackouts to train the public to not have as much and we can charge more for less, that's
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.760]  what Enron did, they created carbon credits, I mean I was on there 27 years ago, when Enron
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.960]  went down 20 years ago, I was on there every week covering every facet of it and back then
[35:16.960 --> 35:20.840]  it was liberals attacking it like Greg Powell's the BBC, but I had him on because I knew about
[35:20.840 --> 35:26.960]  the energy, I knew he was right, oh now the left loves this, so let's look at it right
[35:26.960 --> 35:29.560]  here, let's look at these headlines first, I'm going to come back, I'm going to read
[35:29.560 --> 35:39.720]  this entire Department of Energy, Washington DC order number 202211, which again they implemented
[35:39.720 --> 35:45.800]  as the storm hit and by then it takes about a week to fire these things up, so the governor
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.400]  Abbott who got an award for the windmills went along with it, so did Rick Perry, it's
[35:49.400 --> 35:53.160]  terrible it doesn't work, I was blaming him for everything, the truth is he's in here
[35:53.160 --> 35:57.320]  demanding that they do this, but he should have gone on the news, he should have been
[35:57.320 --> 36:03.000]  political and exposed him, but he didn't, did he, he's a good republican, he's a gentleman,
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.800]  he's not going to say the feds aren't letting us turn the power on, so they can then turn
[36:07.800 --> 36:14.080]  around and blame him, they act like little kids, what they are scared of the mainstream
[36:14.080 --> 36:23.040]  media, what they are is wimps, DOE, Department of Energy order number 202211, look it up,
[36:23.040 --> 36:28.600]  don't believe me, but let's hit some of these headlines first, look at this, millions of
[36:28.600 --> 36:37.080]  freezing americans trying to hold on without heat and water, voice of america, here's another
[36:37.080 --> 36:43.760]  one, Texas was second from complete disaster, yeah I told you this on monday, saturday night
[36:43.760 --> 36:47.320]  if they didn't get the power from outside states and couldn't turn up their systems,
[36:47.320 --> 36:52.040]  the whole grid almost failed and then trying to power it up is next to impossible, they
[36:52.040 --> 36:57.880]  said it would have been two to six months of no power, so this is really Texas being
[36:57.880 --> 37:02.120]  held hostage, and then instead of blaming the Department of Energy, oh we're supposed
[37:02.120 --> 37:05.640]  to all grovel to them now and then they'll come in and take over and gouge us and triple
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.520]  charges, that's why Texas has such cheap power, everybody's moving here, because Texas said
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.360]  we're not going to join your UN program and up the power prices, we're going to have our
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.080]  own power, well it's all basically already been shut off, on thursday urcott officials
[37:19.080 --> 37:24.600]  said the texas power grid was seconds and minutes away from catastrophic failure that
[37:24.600 --> 37:29.400]  could have left texans in the dark for months, that was yesterday, they should know urcott
[37:29.400 --> 37:32.840]  is the entity that operates the power grid for most of the state, they said it could
[37:32.840 --> 37:38.800]  have been months and months, zero hedge and full wars dot com, remember I covered this
[37:38.800 --> 37:43.520]  three days ago, four days ago, it was all a big joke in the media, oh sure, right, Jones
[37:43.520 --> 37:50.280]  claimed, Reuters, Texas wholesale electric prices spiked more than 10,000% amid outages,
[37:50.280 --> 37:55.040]  and what is this little sweet document show that I'll show you the print of next segment,
[37:55.040 --> 38:02.520]  they had to first only buy from outside sources, including available imports and demand response,
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.880]  you look those terms up that means demand response is a term meaning outside power when
[38:07.880 --> 38:12.880]  you don't have enough demand response in a key term means you buy from available imports,
[38:12.880 --> 38:18.400]  these are all lawyer terms, I'll show it to you here in a moment, Texas wholesale electric
[38:18.400 --> 38:26.200]  prices spiked more than 10,000% and here it is today, this is a real statement breakdown
[38:26.200 --> 38:32.600]  where people were paying $50 per megawatt in Texas, now they're getting $9,000 per megawatt,
[38:32.600 --> 38:38.280]  I can't wait to hear what our power bill will be here, my lord, as you go back from, people
[38:38.280 --> 38:49.840]  were paying $68, $50, $100, $300, now paying $3,702, the rolling blackouts that plagued
[38:49.840 --> 38:57.000]  15 million Texans in the darkness amid the historic cold snapper, diminishing by the
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.840]  end of the week, about 188k customers without power in the state on Friday morning, days
[39:02.840 --> 39:13.840]  after power prices jumped more than $50 per megawatt to 9,000, power bills to the moon,
[39:13.840 --> 39:20.480]  chaos, shock, electricity prices, it's the same playbook folks and I told you what was
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.480]  coming, you think I just sit up here and like, oh yeah, Jones really sounds like he knows
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.800]  what we're talking about, he talks really fast too, it's probably made up, how about
[39:29.800 --> 39:33.360]  that power bill you're going to get in the mail, tune in to me on Monday and Tuesday saying
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.360]  you're going to get 10, 15 times the power bill and then tune in and now that it comes
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.600]  in the mail, ask am I telling you the truth, so we're going to come right back and read
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.000]  to you the document they don't want you to see that I hope you care about and I hope
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.880]  everybody in the country covers, I don't give a rat's ass about that we broke this, I just
[39:51.880 --> 39:59.200]  want to stop these monsters, the need for storable foods are increasingly apparent with
[39:59.200 --> 40:07.120]  millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left
[40:07.120 --> 40:14.200]  without food, the lines of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most
[40:14.200 --> 40:22.160]  of the store shelves are left bare, now we know that in the most historic record freezing
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.680]  temperatures in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the
[40:28.680 --> 40:35.520]  heat and turn off the water, don't let your government dictate whether or not you're
[40:35.520 --> 40:42.720]  able to feed your family, go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable
[40:42.720 --> 40:49.640]  foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable, get your storable
[40:49.640 --> 40:52.160]  foods at infowarstore.com
[40:52.160 --> 41:03.160]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World, even
[41:03.160 --> 41:07.840]  before I had access to these shows in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought man
[41:07.840 --> 41:13.000]  that was fun, speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.600]  entertaining because you're real, well what do they say in Wayne's World?
[41:16.600 --> 41:23.040]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy, every day when I cover these huge topics I don't feel
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.960]  worthy to talk to you, because these topics are so huge are so real, but I'm trying to
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.360]  tell you the truth, I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do, the globalists
[41:30.360 --> 41:36.480]  love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity, they enjoy
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.480]  manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them, that for me is really so sad
[41:41.480 --> 41:47.520]  and disgusting, so you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.840]  will never join the globalists, we will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know
[41:51.840 --> 41:54.680]  we're all in this together
[41:54.680 --> 42:00.000]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air, about looking at
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumbed down that they
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.200]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[42:07.200 --> 42:12.360]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed, yes that's the position of the
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.960]  globalists, they play God and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do
[42:16.960 --> 42:21.560]  this to us, you know I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they try
[42:21.560 --> 42:27.720]  to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit, I'm connection
[42:27.720 --> 42:32.480]  with God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy, but I'll
[42:32.480 --> 42:37.840]  tell you at a selfish level, I get very very mad at people that go along with the system,
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.680]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power over it, whether you're just
[42:41.680 --> 42:47.800]  a steel worker or a school teacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God, and treating other
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.360]  people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe
[42:52.360 --> 43:04.440]  doesn't like, and that's a fact, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video,
[43:04.440 --> 43:15.200]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and
[43:15.200 --> 43:20.440]  hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned, that's why every month we launch
[43:20.440 --> 43:28.600]  a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the Gloveless are on our tail,
[43:28.600 --> 43:36.040]  but the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video, they're trying to block
[43:36.040 --> 43:41.240]  us because the truth is powerful and can't defeat them, so the new URL that links right
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.560]  to band.video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special
[43:45.560 --> 43:51.080]  reports, and all the suppressed information, is that the resistance.video, share the link,
[43:51.080 --> 44:19.680]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:19.680 --> 44:28.000]  All right folks, this is smoking gun political cotton nails for Obama, for the deep state,
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  for the Gloveless.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.920]  That's why they put the censorship in, ahead of the election fraud, ahead of opening the
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.200]  borders, ahead of defunding the police, ahead of defunding the dollar, ahead of their takedown
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.200]  of the nation.
[44:38.200 --> 44:40.640]  I've got all that evidence coming up next hour.
[44:40.640 --> 44:47.280]  The truth can't be on air or they will end up going to prison, and that's why this transmission
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.040]  is so key in you telling everybody about the local AM and FM station you're listening
[44:51.040 --> 44:58.280]  to, or the local TV station or cable station you're watching, or band.video, or infoawards.com.
[44:58.280 --> 45:01.720]  So let me just lay it out very quickly for new listeners, and then I'm going to get into
[45:01.720 --> 45:04.440]  the document.
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.000]  We know there's Department of Energy agreements with the power grids around the country, to
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.760]  not exceed certain greenhouse gas emissions that was put in by Obama.
[45:13.760 --> 45:18.400]  Obama just tried to buck it, was in a bunch of big lawsuits under Rick Perry, and then
[45:18.400 --> 45:23.400]  under Greg Abbott, that went on forever, trying to block some of it.
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.680]  Perry agreed to some windmills, Abbott even more, thought that would satiate the left,
[45:28.680 --> 45:33.240]  Texas spending tens of billions of dollars on these worthless things that don't supply
[45:33.240 --> 45:37.680]  good power, they're way out in West Texas, because you know, Boone Pickens, the fake
[45:37.680 --> 45:41.080]  oil guy and all that was involved.
[45:41.080 --> 45:43.240]  That wasn't enough.
[45:43.240 --> 45:48.880]  And so it turns out, days and days before the storm hits, the Texas government went
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.120]  to the Department of Energy and said, okay, federal law says, because Trump had rescinded
[45:53.120 --> 45:59.600]  it, I'll show you, Biden had just redone the executive orders where they could go to prison
[45:59.600 --> 46:07.000]  as climate criminals, if you put out CO2 without authorization, I'm going to read this to you.
[46:07.000 --> 46:13.600]  And they came to him, and they said, we have an emergency in the legislation that we can
[46:13.600 --> 46:20.600]  do this, and they waited a full three, four days until Saturday, until the power already
[46:20.600 --> 46:26.240]  went off, and Urcox called the feds and said, we won't be able to turn it on for two months
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.040]  to six months, that's in the news here.
[46:28.040 --> 46:32.720]  So I don't just believe this Department of Energy, we can follow it from researching.
[46:32.720 --> 46:35.760]  Urcox calls and goes, okay, the whole grid's going completely down, and there's not enough
[46:35.760 --> 46:40.320]  power from the outside, oh, we'll let you increase power now, we wanted to bleed you
[46:40.320 --> 46:46.520]  and sell you 10,000% more expensive power, okay, you can turn up some of your plants,
[46:46.520 --> 46:52.360]  but only enough to keep your grid up, you'll go to jail if you turn it up any higher.
[46:52.360 --> 46:55.600]  For those that don't know about coal plants and others, they have inspectors with guns
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.920]  on their hips, they fly sestas over the smokestacks, trying to find anything but carbon dioxide,
[47:00.920 --> 47:05.480]  the plants were so clean, American technology was so exceptional, that by the 90s they could
[47:05.480 --> 47:11.280]  find nothing, not sulfur, not mercury, nothing, but water vapor and carbon dioxide, so they
[47:11.280 --> 47:17.440]  passed regulations saying carbon dioxide is poison, the plants breathe.
[47:17.440 --> 47:22.040]  And so, yeah, I was saying, hey, they shut down 120 plants, hey, these windmills don't
[47:22.040 --> 47:25.040]  work, that's what caused this, and I'm like, but wait, have been Enron ran scams on the
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.040]  West Coast like this, it made billions a day by rolling blackouts to the public, would
[47:29.040 --> 47:33.400]  accept higher prices believing it was a scarce commodity, that came out in court was their
[47:33.400 --> 47:34.400]  plan.
[47:34.400 --> 47:40.520]  And I said, I bet that's the same thing again, and sure as hell, and it sure as Santa Claus
[47:40.520 --> 47:46.680]  wears a red and white outfit, and it sure as mama loves her baby, that's what they did.
[47:46.680 --> 47:52.120]  So, oh, Texas declared it's a small government paradise, now it's frozen in there, oh, Texas
[47:52.120 --> 47:58.880]  is pathetic, no, they got all their publications out saying who did this, and all Ted Cruz
[47:58.880 --> 48:05.600]  has got to do to change the subject, all Greg Abbott has to do to redeem himself, all John
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.200]  Cornyn has to do is come out and read this on air and it's game over, by the way, I've
[48:10.200 --> 48:14.600]  had my problems with Ted Cruz, I think he's a good constitutionalist, Ken Coon is like
[48:14.600 --> 48:19.360]  going out to get a cheeseburger in Texas, it's an hour and 45 minute flight, his daughters
[48:19.360 --> 48:22.560]  were going down there, why do I care if he flew down there with his daughters to get
[48:22.560 --> 48:26.640]  out of this hell when it turned out his power was off, my power was off a bunch, my water
[48:26.640 --> 48:32.120]  just came back today, most folks still don't have water, they're out of school, why not
[48:32.120 --> 48:37.080]  go, Mexico, see we live by Mexico folks, we go down there, but I'm not even defending
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.640]  that, how is that the news, how is he horrible and the Democrats are all, oh look he doesn't
[48:41.640 --> 48:46.240]  care about you, he didn't want the lockdowns, he didn't want to wear the mask, it's not
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.800]  like he's for a lockdown and he's caught getting out of one, no it's not like all the Democrats
[48:50.800 --> 48:57.480]  caught on private jets, no he was flying in coach with his daughters down there to get
[48:57.480 --> 49:02.720]  them through customs, but I'm not even defending Ted Cruz, that's not what it's about, it's
[49:02.720 --> 49:11.480]  about this Department of Energy document, order number 202211, let me start reading
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.680]  this to you and I'll go over it more in the next hour, but here it is, and again a Don
[49:15.680 --> 49:19.720]  Salazar our only rider able to get in with the frozen roads, the tier, he's doing an
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.200]  article on this right now and the document's on info wars dot com, but don't get it from
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.840]  there, Snopes will say or Newsguard run by George Soros and Bill Gates, literally they
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.200]  got a story on that next hour, they will just say it's not real, so you go to the Department
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.440]  of Energy document, you go to their website and you see it yourself, just type in Department
[49:37.440 --> 49:45.920]  of Energy, order number 20221-1 and you'll click the little linky-winky and you'll be
[49:45.920 --> 49:55.400]  on it for yourself, there is the URL for you, but let's just right now read this part,
[49:55.400 --> 50:01.680]  Pursuant to the authority vested in the Secretary of Energy by section 202C of the Federal
[50:01.680 --> 50:16.240]  Power Act FPA16USC834AC and section 301B of the Department of Energy Organization Act
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.440]  and for the reasons fourth below, I hereby determine that an emergency exists in Texas
[50:21.440 --> 50:26.240]  due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for generation of electric energy
[50:26.240 --> 50:34.480]  and other causes and that issuance of an order will meet the emergency and severity of the
[50:34.480 --> 50:41.320]  public interest and serve the public interest, now why is that so important?
[50:41.320 --> 50:48.000]  Because this is issued on Saturday when the storm has already hit, the power is already
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.920]  going out, oh so once we're already in the Atlantic Ocean freezing to death, now they
[50:51.920 --> 50:58.680]  come to help, ERCOT is the beginning stages of an unprecedented cold weather event brought
[50:58.680 --> 51:04.800]  on by rare southward exclusion of the jet stream into the south central United States,
[51:04.800 --> 51:08.280]  temperature for Sunday and Monday in many parts of Texas are forecasted to drop well
[51:08.280 --> 51:12.400]  below the lowest temperatures experienced in several decades, turns out it's an all-time
[51:12.400 --> 51:17.240]  record since we took temperatures and abnormally low temperatures are expected to persist for
[51:17.240 --> 51:23.360]  several more days, the weather event is expected to result in a record winter electricity demand
[51:23.360 --> 51:29.120]  that will exceed ERCOT's most extreme seasonal load forecast, I'm going to go to break and
[51:29.120 --> 51:32.960]  read you the rest of it but this is where it gets interesting, they say under our environmental
[51:32.960 --> 51:38.280]  orders you're not allowed to turn up your plants unless we say and you've got a first
[51:38.280 --> 51:42.120]  by power from outside the state and it goes on from there, so that just shows you who
[51:42.120 --> 51:46.680]  was in control of the Texas Energy Grid, the Governor and others days and days before it
[51:46.680 --> 51:52.080]  hit were like saying please take off the restrictions, please and they say no, that will hurt the
[51:52.080 --> 51:57.680]  environment and will release carbon that plants breathe and so you're not allowed to but we
[51:57.680 --> 52:02.280]  will allow you to buy power from outside the state so we can charge you 10,000% more but
[52:02.280 --> 52:06.720]  we're going to wait because there'd be lower bids and stuff that was on days before till
[52:06.720 --> 52:13.040]  you're in an emergency on Saturday night, how's that sound, perfect timing, oh we didn't because
[52:13.040 --> 52:17.720]  they know if they totally never allowed it the government would say the feds did it but
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.620]  see instead oh no no no once we threw you overboard into the water we threw you a life
[52:22.620 --> 52:27.480]  vest, push you off the ship in 12 foot waves, 20 foot waves, you're like help me, oh here's
[52:27.480 --> 52:35.280]  a life vest, oh you didn't get it, bye bye, I gave you a life vest, I'm a hero, wait till
[52:35.280 --> 52:40.120]  I lay this all out next hour, it's smoking gun, smoking gun, I've never seen anything
[52:40.120 --> 52:45.400]  like this, you need to get this enough to everyone you know it's so incredible but it's
[52:45.400 --> 52:49.920]  written in bureaucrat speech, all right we're going to go to break, seriously a lot of people
[52:49.920 --> 52:53.680]  noticed in the videos we were running that we shot in the dark here with generators running
[52:53.680 --> 52:57.520]  the studio said hey that's my Patriot supply remember when we were stored but why is the
[52:57.520 --> 53:02.240]  packaging tan and not black, well that's because that's food I got like four years
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.080]  ago and they changed the packaging three years ago, even thicker better internal packaging
[53:07.080 --> 53:11.960]  so see we have a warehouse literally in the building with a 10 year food supply for a
[53:11.960 --> 53:16.000]  family of four people which is enough for my crew for about a month and yeah people
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.640]  are like what's that room and it's like a room of water filters and a room of giant
[53:21.640 --> 53:28.240]  you know big water cooler deals of spring water, yeah we got safe too with guns, shotguns
[53:28.240 --> 53:33.480]  and rifles in them, 50 cows and everything because we know what we're going into see
[53:33.480 --> 53:37.480]  we don't just, I don't just go oh you need storable food right now and then like I've
[53:37.480 --> 53:41.960]  got my new packaging oh look it's a black package I'm just eating this it's not just
[53:41.960 --> 53:47.240]  an ad folks we're eating the oldest food, I've got six year old food at my house and
[53:47.240 --> 53:51.240]  three year old food and one year old food and the rest I gave to the deer hunters and
[53:51.240 --> 53:55.960]  family before it started going bad we all enjoyed it at big cookouts and I gave the
[53:55.960 --> 54:01.280]  rest of the homeless shelters, it's insurance you can eat but yeah because it lasts more
[54:01.280 --> 54:05.560]  than 10 years well my food gets 10 years old I mean I've given away food at least twice
[54:05.560 --> 54:10.280]  food I bought 20 years ago food I bought 10 years ago I gave away and it was still delicious
[54:10.280 --> 54:14.840]  but now the storeable food's gotten so much tastier even my patriot stuff from four years
[54:14.840 --> 54:20.400]  ago is good but it's not the new stuff like I was like hey why you guys got the old stuff
[54:20.400 --> 54:23.680]  we got a whole room right here with the new stuff we didn't think sir we just grabbed
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.200]  the first I'm like okay just get the black stuff it's better the brown package stuff's
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.920]  okay I got a bunch of it it's good but the black package stuff is new and even better
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.640]  and more delicious I'm just telling you and it's 10% off at infowarstore.com an emergency

[55:48.880 --> 55:55.480]  as things can be you have to understand that this is all a test this experience this life on this
[55:55.480 --> 56:04.440]  planet is a reckoning it's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.120]  decide where we want to spend eternity at what level we want to go to and it really does come
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.240]  down to that so as status things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as
[56:14.240 --> 56:20.400]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness God is the author of us having our
[56:20.400 --> 56:28.320]  own will God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.440]  look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.480]  the and the mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.040]  dirty you're ugly you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God
[56:43.040 --> 56:58.640]  the creator of the universe you're listening to the alex jones show you know i grew up especially
[56:58.640 --> 57:06.640]  my dad's mom all the canned foods the emergency preparedness defending the republic from enemies
[57:06.640 --> 57:14.000]  foreign and domestic it's alex jones the amp prepares the grasshopper dies in winter you watch
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.960]  all these fancy pants know it all trendies it's if they're make fun of us that are prepared and
[57:18.960 --> 57:23.280]  hell i wasn't totally prepared with all the lockdowns and the power being offered more than a day in
[57:23.280 --> 57:29.600]  the rest of it but when i saw the news come out and make fun of texas and attack us everywhere
[57:29.600 --> 57:33.360]  and say how pathetic we are because we didn't have power and how was our fault i've been all about
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.280]  the grid i obsessed over because i knew it was how they were going to target us in the future
[57:38.720 --> 57:43.760]  and i was right again wasn't it because they're technocrats they're going to take every fancy
[57:43.760 --> 57:49.040]  complex system that we're not in control of and they're going to rip us off with us and now
[57:49.680 --> 57:55.200]  it all came together exactly what i already knew they'd done before they did again but even bigger
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.560]  and it's so smoking gun that i i'm i'm trying to control myself right now i'm probably taking
[58:00.560 --> 58:07.120]  years off my life i'm so angry uh but it's just a forte it's a hors d'oeuvre it's a prelude it's
[58:07.120 --> 58:15.680]  a first taste it's a it's an icebreaker uh it's uh just the vanguard of what we are about to experience
[58:16.880 --> 58:22.800]  and i know this in myself and i know this intellectual and so we need to get mad like
[58:22.800 --> 58:26.400]  he says in network he goes i don't want you to write your congressman i don't want to even tell
[58:26.400 --> 58:32.160]  you to write but i just know this first you got to get mad you got to say i'm a human being my life
[58:32.880 --> 58:38.000]  has value and i'm not gonna sit here and take this globalist humanization because every elite
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.200]  throughout history wants to make their people poor and control them and tell them everything's their
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.120]  fault that's how this always works with all our robots and computers and everything the metrics
[58:45.120 --> 58:51.040]  we should be working two days a week living like kings but instead they just sabotage the whole
[58:51.040 --> 58:57.200]  system and manipulate it to keep us poor and dumbed out it's a real paradox so i'm gonna control
[58:57.200 --> 59:01.840]  myself i'm gonna take a deep breath we come back i'm gonna plunge in and read this whole document
[59:01.840 --> 59:08.080]  on air that is the smoking gun of smoking guns of smoking guns and it better go back a viral

[59:39.760 --> 59:45.840]  great i care about beating these people but i do want you to go get the info worse dot com article
[59:45.840 --> 59:50.400]  i said everyone you don't go here's bill gates paying the fact checkers and he even owns the
[59:50.400 --> 59:55.040]  fact checking groups saying his vaccine is totally safe when we have zuckerberg internal
[59:55.040 --> 1:00:01.120]  videos saying he doesn't trust it while he censors me and you and everybody else including
[1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:16.240]  tucker carlson for saying the same damn thing so the feds didn't let texas turn its power on
[1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:22.080]  and up its power output and it just shows how texas how the governor and others before him
[1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:28.720]  rick perry as well signed us over through urcott rick perry's on fox talking trash about the
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:32.800]  windmills hey buddy boy you're the one that started it and it's not about driving you into the ground
[1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:39.120]  it's about not i'm gonna sit there and watch you not take credit for what you did son
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:45.680]  and that damn governor we got over there halfway i'm glad he was at least saying hey let us turn
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:49.920]  the power on why wasn't he in a damn press conference on wednesday and thursday and friday
[1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:54.720]  and he was begging behind the scenes blaming it on the feds because he's bought and paid for he
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:59.680]  didn't want to mess with him he's gonna let him screw us he's like well just this is really gonna
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:06.080]  hurt texas you need to stop so he he got like a lawyer he sent the letter so he can't be held
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:11.200]  couple for that but then he let him f us over so now i changed my mind now i thought about it
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:18.640]  i actually hate rick out of you bar you little lawyer you little son of a you know what
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:24.240]  i was thinking oh that was nice to him try to get our power on but he didn't say a damn word
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.360]  publicly because all he was doing was covering his little ass that's why we're in this position
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:34.560]  where there's a bunch of lawyers a bunch of candy ass lawyers covering their ass so much the kines
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:38.880]  are running the tables on us get ready to nuke our ass because you little chicken net america
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:55.600]  hating bastards are taking over the damn country right back i knew trump was in battle i knew he
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:03.520]  was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy and a lot of people just
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:09.280]  couldn't believe it they're like oh no it's a 3g chest 5g chest he's invincible and i understand
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:12.880]  why people learn to believe that because this is scary what's going on the global government
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:16.400]  of the new world order and now that people hold up the fact that's real they won't somebody to
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:22.160]  come save them from well trump sure as hell tried my gosh look at how prescription drug prices just
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:26.960]  tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug wants to buy it and sign that executive order we pay the
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.520]  most of anybody in the world that's just one taste of hundreds of things the trumpet reversed and
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:36.560]  now people are going to feel the sting in the pain the energy cost everything else but what's
[1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:41.520]  really illustrated this is the trial to the senate where trumps own lawyers are attacking him and
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:46.960]  putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engage all sorts of criminal activity
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:52.240]  because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep trump fought it but it's up to us to win it
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:59.760]  oh guess what we bugged mr. Blake's down we heard him talking to his lawyer you see we took the

[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:28.080]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:47.760]  okay my friends i had intended to come in today

[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:04.960]  about what you're seeing with the covid-19 vaccine because as i suspected it's not just
[1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:08.960]  certain nursing homes and hospitals are having mass deaths from the vaccine those are the ones
[1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:13.360]  that aren't corrupted report the truth i mean we're talking about up to five percent of people dying
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:18.640]  that take it that are old and again we don't just pull that out of our rear end do we
[1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:24.880]  no we have the british ministry of defense who was administering it two months ago said uh oh

[1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:51.440]  a waitress and she was fired because she wouldn't take it even though it's not even approved for
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:56.880]  pregnant women and you know all these women have a miscarriage is when they take it that's that that
[1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.800]  that that business owner shouldn't know your medical history that business owner
[1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:05.920]  shouldn't know that you're even pregnant but see how hippos out the door all our rights
[1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:10.320]  are out the door just suddenly oh we don't do medical tests we don't do medical studies
[1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:16.480]  oh uh now your employer knows what your vaccine history is this is a stampeding of our rights
[1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:20.240]  and our freedoms info wars dot com new york city waitress fired
[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:23.920]  i've refused a couple of vaccine fearing it could cause infertility well that's just what
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:30.720]  the head of the u commission said is a top scientist and i'm going to hit that and i'm
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:37.600]  going to take your calls and i'm going to do it but
[1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:43.840]  man i just i'm i don't feel sorry for myself and i'm overloaded
[1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:48.800]  the communist chinese official government spokesperson came out and said don't criticize
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:53.520]  our death camps with a million christians a million buddhas and three million muslims in them
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:07:02.720]  the fall on gong all of it who are basically buddhas light you can't even feed your people
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:07.520]  at america's a broken state and they're making fun of texas when texas was the main energy
[1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:12.960]  supplier for much of the us until obama got in and shut our plants off and i have the smoking gun
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:18.320]  document that the department of energy was in control and not letting them up the plants but
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:25.840]  that's that's on record under the law i read you the law last hour but bloomberg and ap and
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.680]  roiders the new york times the wash and post the la times the austin america states and the
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:37.680]  houston chronicle the dallas morning news they all gang up on texas and say texas is pathetic
[1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:43.280]  it can't even keep a light bulb on they can't put a rocket in space everybody knows texas can't wipe
[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:48.880]  their butts they certainly can't find their ass with both hands
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.640]  and again i have so much knowledge just living in texas in like half my family
[1:07:56.640 --> 1:08:00.880]  working in power plants oil and gas they just rotate through and oil and gases of them
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:08.000]  they're in that when it's not they go into the power generation a whole life drive around the
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:14.640]  little kid they'll visit family oh we gotta go do a geology test with an oil field let's drive
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:20.640]  two hours or hear people talk about power plant generation all day and the epa i mean i know this
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:25.520]  stuff and i talked to family and i talked to others they said hey alex you gotta go look up
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.680]  the feds for control of our power plants it's in the federal law obama did it we're not allowed to
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:35.680]  turn the power on and i knew that and i said it sunday and monday and tuesday and wednesday and
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:41.840]  thursday but i didn't show you the document and i i'm just reading it made me so angry
[1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:48.480]  that i almost turned this desk over seriously man but you know that's a normal response
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:53.280]  to learning they're not just robbing our future they're blaming us they're starving people they're
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:57.520]  bankrupting all these communities they killed over 50 people and and then now they're gonna
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:02.720]  rape us more and they're telling us permanent blackouts because the feds put urkot in control
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:10.640]  because you can't have the state managing it it's incredible so you read the document
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:15.600]  order number 202211
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:20.320]  put out started by the department of energy
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:28.800]  and it's the governor days before begging them to turn the power on but they say well you know
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.800]  we've got these laws saying you're not allowed to turn your plants up because of because of carbon
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:41.520]  output but we have a waiver power in the federal law that allows us to do it so they waited until
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:46.640]  saturday and actually even found articles where urkot admits this but urkot doesn't
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:52.160]  miss the feds that if they didn't up power by saturday night it would have been a multi-month
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:57.200]  long power outage and we're still getting rolling blackouts here you're like well just have generators
[1:09:57.200 --> 1:10:00.880]  we've got the generators you know what happens when the power goes on and off generators it blows
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:06.480]  stuff things trip it's like a haunted house in this place right now i'm not complaining this is
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:15.040]  what it is to be third world folks so they said to preserve the reliability of the bulk electric
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:23.840]  power system urkot requests that the secretary issue an order immediately effective february 14th
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:30.080]  through february 19 2021 notice they asked days before they'd say oh now now it's this day
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:35.520]  authorizing the provision of additional energy from all generation units subject to emissions
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:41.600]  when you read the law on that not coal folks or other permit limits and i went and looked up the
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:50.800]  permit limits and sure as the devil wears a red pajamas it says they're not allowed to do it
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:58.240]  oh you can up the windmill power oh sorry they're frozen in the urkot region that's texas the generating
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:06.240]  unit specified resources that this order pertains to are listed on the order 202-21-1 resource list
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:11.360]  as described below and it's oh hydroelectric and it's oh this it takes them a week to turn a coal
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:19.280]  plant up didn't let them do that epa section 202 c2 requires the secretary of energy to ensure
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:24.560]  that a 202 c order that may result in a conflict with requirement of any environmental law
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:31.600]  limit to the hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest and to the maximum
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:40.240]  extent that is practical be consistent with the applicable environmental law and minimize any
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:46.160]  adverse environmental impacts it's all felonies okay urkot anticipates this order may result
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:52.800]  in exceedance of emissions of carbon dioxide water of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide mercury
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:57.760]  and carbon monoxide emissions as well as wastewater release limits other reason the
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:03.680]  water plants got shut down to minimize adverse environmental impacts the ordered limits operation
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:09.360]  of dispatch units if look at that definition what that means to the times and with the parameters
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:13.760]  determined by urkot with reliability purposes and that all speaks to the law and what they're
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:21.040]  allowed to turn on did let them turn the coal power points up folks part b to minimize adverse
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:25.360]  environmental we're gonna come back and read all this for you it gets really bad right here
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:30.480]  it's really really bad but the point is the feds are in control the feds wouldn't let them up the
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:35.200]  power till the power grid was going down and then limited what they could do and then sat back and
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:41.520]  said texas is a bunch of idiots a bunch of hayseeds oh i'm watching he haul right now i'm aware
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:47.200]  though joe biden gonna take me over joe biden knows how to cook a possum oh yeah

[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:28.160]  in germany and in and they're all left us by the way all this is environmental terrorism
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:34.480]  what did i post on their door notice to globalist criminals urcot chairwoman sally talberg and other
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:40.480]  accomplices whistleblowers inside your organization as well as the epa and texas government are
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:47.600]  preparing to come forward and expose your giant in ron style scam you are here by ordered by the
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:53.520]  people to cease and assist your staged blackout designed to condition americans to accept the
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:58.960]  great reset and carbon credit rationing just as governor qualmo will be sent to prison for his
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:04.000]  crimes against humanity you too will be held accountable one last time we are aware of your
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.600]  criminal enterprise to trick the public into accepting smart meters and monitoring of thermostats
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:16.000]  to jack up power prices as much as 5000 stop for criminal activity now when the people are watching
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:24.800]  now why is that so important because i showed you earlier today people with hundred dollar bills
[1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:30.400]  are getting three thousand dollar bills that had their power on during this so i guess you're lucky
[1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:35.680]  if your power was off but but they do this as a formula to train you to accept double triple
[1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:40.320]  quadruple prices and that's why they give you blackouts that's what in ron did i know i keep
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:46.000]  saying that because if we don't have power and cheap power we don't have a country this is as
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.400]  big a tax as the income tax or is your social security tax fica this is globalist war
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:03.040]  yeah the urcot board meeting last week included jokes about cowboy boats less than 40 seconds of
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:09.680]  storm talk so let's read the key parts here b to minimize adverse environmental impacts the
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:15.120]  order for the federal government the again the takeaway is the feds are in control of texas power
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:20.560]  they're acting like texas did this no they're in control to minimize adverse environmental impacts
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:26.880]  this ordered limits operation of dispatch units to the times and within parameters described by
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:33.920]  urcot for reliability purposes consist with good utility practice urcot shall exhaust all reasonably
[1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:41.040]  and practically available resources including available imports that's the 10 000 10 000 increase
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:49.600]  that's the billions they just made including available imports demand response and identify
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:57.760]  behind the meter generation resources selected to minimize an increase in emissions evil carbon
[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:04.080]  to the extent that such resources provide support to maintain grid reliability prior
[1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:11.600]  to dispatching the specified resources that's david
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:21.440]  zungar wherever you say it acting secretary energy so there it is ladies and gentlemen the smoking
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:29.360]  gun of smoking guns the feds in control of the texas energy grid ordering them to use outside
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:37.840]  power so they could charge us 10 000 percent more and this is the creature that actually physically
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:43.760]  did it there he is you know he's being taken care of you to check his swiss bank accounts
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:49.520]  so let's continue here's roiders just give you a background texas wholesale electric prices
[1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:57.680]  spike more than more than 10 000 percent mid outages oh follow the money folks outages morph
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:06.240]  into outages and outrage as texas slapped with mind-blowing power bills that go from $50 for megawatt
[1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:15.680]  to $9 000 a megawatt i'm not a mathematician off the top of my head what is $50 guys will you divide
[1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:23.920]  50 into 9 000 for me and please give me the number what is the price increase of 50 to 9 000 sounds to
[1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:32.720]  me 50 is is is is is if you if you divide it is way more than a 10 000 percent because if you're
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:42.160]  from 50 to 9 000 that sounds like just 8 18 000 times increase i'm just like because you know
[1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:46.480]  nine's not 10 it'd be very easy if it was 10 000 percent increase from 50 we would know what that
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:53.360]  was but that sounds like a 18 000 percent increase let's see how dumb i am let's see it is boom so
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:21:02.400]  just off top of my head so there you go ladies and gentlemen an 18 000 percent increase i mean here's
[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:06.400]  the deal folks these criminals can't help but steel and rob that's why they're gonna end up failing
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:10.640]  that's the good news is these people can't help themselves they're not like masterminds they just
[1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:16.160]  go we control the power grid we can rip them off do it it's like Hitler like i could attack north
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:21.360]  africa i could attack england i could attack france i could attack austria i could attack
[1:21:21.360 --> 1:21:26.880]  poland i could attack the russians i mean it's like attack attack attack attack and that's what
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:32.400]  they're gonna do until you finally say no but that's what they're doing
[1:21:34.800 --> 1:21:40.640]  so i mean they can't help it if you don't say no to them and if you're not aware of them
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.880]  you're like hey you increase prices 18 000 percent shut up racist if you play that game with them and
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:56.240]  let them be the authority they will do nothing but rape you forever so 18 000 percent increase
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:02.320]  full secret about my brain is i can't do basic math about tribe i don't worry about i know the
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:08.080]  math answers but it's easy stuff now let's sit here and let's talk about this right now because
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:12.560]  here's where we are there's still a lot of state without power people dying everywhere the cows
[1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:21.920]  dying everything it's liberal those it doesn't matter millions freeze trying to hold on without
[1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:30.160]  heat and water texas was seconds from complete disaster zero hedge info wars dot com urcott
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:34.880]  now admits would have been out for months and months if the feds hadn't signed the agreement
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:41.280]  on saturday to let them turn up the power since when did the federal government run texas because
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:48.720]  you're all hearing texas did this remember texas it's not about me and texas pride but i live around
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:54.000]  here we used to have more so much power plants we were supplying 15 states and that's why obama
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.240]  came in and cut it off because texas was his own damn country we got so much natural gas so much
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:05.040]  oil and so much coal i remember my grandma when i was about 15 years old she goes should i let them
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:11.360]  lignite mine the farm because they we sold out most the ranch property of stuff and and we're like no
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:15.920]  let's not let them bulldoze these hundreds of thousands of oak trees and pine trees and they
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:20.560]  didn't they didn't do the lignite mine there but these giant machines come in and they just scoop off
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:25.440]  the topsoil grab the lignite and then replant it and it looks even prettier after they're done
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:31.360]  the point is i know about this stuff okay is what i'm telling you and and this is the biggest
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:39.520]  screw job ever imagined texas is like the the the energy sector next to next to trotty arabia
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:45.200]  we're it baby oh trotty arabia can't keep their lights on neither can venezuela they got almost
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:50.560]  as much as oil as texas but they're run by commies and commies love to starve you cognitive dissonance
[1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:57.360]  is a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:02.720]  if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle

[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:05.280]  qualmo was in a press conference i was getting a cup of coffee about 30 minutes ago that was so
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:10.240]  angry about this i think i'm telling the crew to get it he was again blaming the internet and twitter
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:18.080]  for people mad that he killed 16 000 old people on purpose so here's the deal urkot
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.360]  and i want to be clear urkot's just a little management front company so the the state of
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:28.080]  texas goes we're not gonna run this scam he was already giving us lobbying money uh here a private
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:34.320]  group runs it and then they can charge us 10 000 times more abbot's in on it perry was in on it
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:39.600]  they're all in ron creatures the bushes were in on it the clintons are in on it it's all horrible
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:48.240]  okay but now it's here and they're gonna tell texans you're pathetic look at you wearing mask
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:54.000]  and you're starving and you're just it's oh you're not exceptional it's you just mismanaged it you
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:00.480]  dumb bastards you just got as much power as saudi arabia and a much bigger grid it's like telling
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:11.920]  mike tyson in 1989 that he couldn't fight it's a joke it's time to bury the myth of texas
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:16.800]  exceptionalism and they show an old woman in a wheelchair wearing a mask well hey those folks
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:24.560]  may be buried we're not i know about energy i know about petroleum geology i know all about it you
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:33.520]  jerks and i know but i got a phone call saturday sunday and monday st jones look into the fact
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:38.720]  that we're ordered not to produce energy and i just said all my family says in my some context
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:44.720]  say they're not allowed to increase energy instead of the document that thank god folks reached out
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:55.600]  to us and pointed out was their department of energy order number 202-21-1 that'll be on the
[1:29:55.600 --> 1:30:07.200]  political gravestone of joe biden that ought to be hung around his neck that ought to be his crown
[1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:12.960]  of thorns that he signed and i got the executive order right here i'll show it to you he signed
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:17.920]  executive order a week and a half ago saying that yeah texas couldn't override just because
[1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:23.680]  trump has rescinded it and then that big storm comes in right on time i mean wow this illustrates
[1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:31.760]  everything executive order on tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad there's another one they
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:42.480]  call re-establishing science yeah uh carbon dioxide's poison it kills plants and uh you can't have it and uh
[1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:49.440]  so uh urcott has been alerted that numerous generator units will be unable to operate
[1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:55.200]  at full capacity without violating federal air quality and other permit limitations yeah it's
[1:30:55.200 --> 1:31:01.280]  uh i folks i haven't even scratched the surface of this but here's the bottom line let's say you
[1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:06.400]  love carbon taxes you love the us not having any power europe having no power only china india and
[1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:10.800]  mexico and every other third world country where globals are invested you like it you fetishize
[1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:19.120]  that you want to be bankrupt and starving in the dark okay fair enough texas was ordered not to use
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:24.560]  its power plants even though they shut down over 120 we still had enough power and enough backup with
[1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:32.320]  like huge rail cars full of coal they could just flip switches and turn up the power and they were
[1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:42.880]  told sorry can't use that you've got to buy it from outside states at 10 000 sorry that was three days
[1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:55.840]  old 18 000 times 18 000 times the price but it's like biden increased the price of insulin seven
[1:31:55.840 --> 1:32:01.760]  times the average price of a prescription drug went up at least 100 but it's all right he's got a
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:09.040]  bunch of caps on his teeth he's an old dirty lawyer he's liberal hell yeah baby pay more for your drugs
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:17.200]  screwed up let's all freeze the death because joe biden's wearing an aviator outfit god helped me
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:23.520]  man this is so surreal the public is going to be forced to get informed the public is going to
[1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:27.200]  be forced to learn about this you think i'll learn to study these people think i want to read
[1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:38.720]  department of energy documents all day look at these other articles and i've got the documents
[1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:42.880]  i've got all these documents here i've got all the department of energy documents i've got the
[1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:48.560]  executive order on protecting public health and the environment and restoring science oh
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:56.960]  to tackle the climate crisis joe biden notice i just told you this a few minutes ago now i'm
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:33:02.240]  showing it to you i don't make any of this up okay oh here here let's look at it right here
[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:15.760]  oh this is a very important part of this executive order 3 139 13920 may 1st 2020 repealed is hereby
[1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:21.280]  suspended for 90 days the secretary of energy to this a week and a half ago as director of OMB
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:28.960]  shall jointly consider whether to recommend that a replacement is issued so they suspended
[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:32.960]  trump's order on not letting china in our grid and protecting the grid
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:40.880]  there's a really important article on info wars dot com you do not want to share with anybody
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:45.680]  the temporary collapse of texas is foreshadowing the total collapse of the odd states michael
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:50.240]  snyder uh yeah if you can collapse us you can collapse anybody
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:56.880]  people like jones how you taking it how am i taking it i'm just getting the first because
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:04.320]  i'm strong see how that works and then they can take us out they can get you and texas got
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:09.360]  its problems but it's got a spirit it's almost gone we're on the fumes of it but they know
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:15.040]  if it fires up they're done so they're hitting it as hard as they can before they um to you

[1:37:51.200 --> 1:38:00.640]  movie that came out called wanes world even before i had access to this show in the mid 1990s
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:06.320]  i wouldn't call that movie and thought man that was fun back to speak out have your own ideas and
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:10.480]  even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real well what do they say in
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:17.840]  wanes world we're not worthy we're not worthy every day when i cover these huge topics i don't feel
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:22.000]  worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real but i'm trying to tell you the
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:26.240]  truth i'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do the globalists love lying to you they
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:32.960]  love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity they enjoy manipulating ideas and
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:38.560]  using people's ignorance against them that for me is really such a discussion so you've got to

[1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:51.040]  knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together i sell supplements for two

[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:08.800]  that are highly predatory and are setting up a false famously land system of constant
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:17.200]  bombardment of propaganda drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the very dna of the human
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:24.240]  species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard the bottom
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:29.520]  line is they want to play god they are playing god and the news is only going to tighten around
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:34.480]  our necks from here on out so many other people want to be positive they want to put out fake news
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.960]  and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happened with new world order but at the end of
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:42.880]  the day it's all about the population it's all about world government it's all about the end of
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.600]  human system as we know it and on its ashes a nightmare being built only admitting it can
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:59.040]  turn around stop it you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:14.720]  you
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:18.720]  maybe i didn't know you
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:24.720]  what is often as i could
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:27.760]  i hate watching
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:35.680]  the little things i should have said and done a bunch of stuff suit ivy league people
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:41.120]  comment how dumb we are and screwing us over and lying about us they get fun of us
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:46.880]  the end of the day i just want to see them fail but more importantly i want to see you
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:50.160]  i want to see you cc
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:57.280]  okay uh here's the deal i intend to do the whole show today phone calls from medical workers
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:02.880]  about covet 19 and all the deaths that are happened to old folks and others that are taking
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:06.480]  the vaccine if we get some of those calls not even trying to get them i thought well i'll just
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:10.720]  line these suckers up and if you call in and love it you think it's as good as pumpkin pie
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:13.760]  but you're you calling too we're not censoring your call we love to hear from you we're not
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:18.800]  like the left that just pack just one idea and pushes for that my god damn me the hell that's
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:25.600]  where i am that's not who i am i believe you're you're free will but i want to do two things i
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:31.360]  want to open the phones up on two topics in the next hour ahead of max coser joining us on bitcoin
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.720]  surging and then jolce cowson on the lockdowns and the power outages and the climate lockdowns
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.600]  that are coming i want to take an hour of phone calls coming up i mean write your calls did a
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:45.680]  pretty good job yesterday took about 30 calls i won't take even more but just get ready i'm
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:51.840]  going to go to you quick or try to go to you quick it's a big show we have a lot of callers
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:58.080]  at 20 phone lines but two questions what do you make of this department of energy document
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:02.400]  admitting that we're in control of texas power we didn't let you turn your power on until saturday
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:06.240]  night once the lockdown and the power outage already happened and then it had to be quote
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:11.120]  environmentally sensitive stuff and you had to buy the power from outside states at 10 000 percent
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:18.240]  the prices i mean all of that is just incredible and the fact that they would do that and try that
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:23.600]  and that ted cruz isn't criticizing it governor abit isn't criticizing it it's like a lot of
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:27.280]  republicans will criticize big tech censorship but never do anything it's because they're really on
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:33.280]  the payroll and i'm not saying cruz is bad i'm not saying abit's totally bad i'm just saying
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:39.840]  they're not men they ain't got the wavos rancheros that i mean because there's the i'm not selling
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:43.920]  out to anything you put a damn gun to my head line my kids up if you want it's just and that's
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:49.040]  the power i've got over the enemies i don't give a damn and i'm not trying to act like a tough guy
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:55.200]  here i'm just sick of people playing both sides i mean look dumbasses hey ted cruz you ever had
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:01.120]  the new old order off of your 10 million dollars probably not buddy boy i had that 15 years ago
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:07.280]  so why are you flying coach on southwest it's because you sold out i'll put you down i'm on
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:11.920]  a fat cat saying hey dude look it you'd have the whole wealth of the universe you're a leader
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:18.640]  you're smart stop kissing the system's ass go to war cruz there is an awesome thing harassed
[1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:24.560]  cancun's like flying to dallas it's an hour and a half away big deal he went there
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.440]  he should have attacked the democrats and urcott and the department of energy and then gone there
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:36.400]  i actually i would let my daughters go to cancun unless i went with them
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:41.760]  but none of that matters he didn't call for the lockdown he wasn't like the austin mayor on
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:47.520]  a private jet during a lockdown partying with no mask on in cancun because folks folks that
[1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:52.480]  don't live in texas like cancun's like especially if you're in south texas i mean south texas is
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:59.760]  an hour away austin it's an hour and 40 minutes away i'm defending ted cruz i want ted cruz to go
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:09.040]  to war for me he's got all the cards but he's too smart didn't he but ted cruz is way better than
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:16.320]  greg avid and way better than john corner it's just that man texas wants leadership and texas is
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:21.040]  under globalist attack because everybody from joe rogan to the easter bunny is moving here
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:25.200]  look at stink uger named after a genocidal group the young turks that killed a million
[1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:31.680]  half Armenian Christians only upside of texas power outages is people like joe rogan who
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:37.520]  were so proud to leave california and move to texas freezing their asses off they said they
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:43.280]  wanted less government congrats mission accomplice i hope you're not asking the government to come
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:52.640]  help you wow i just showed you were the department of energy under obama and trump couldn't reverse
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:58.080]  it didn't reverse it shut down over 120 coal power plants and wouldn't let us turn them back on
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:04.160]  when the governor begged days before the outages to override the federal law and only once the power
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:11.120]  was off did biden say yes now i override it so he could have the cake and eat it too perfect
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:18.240]  exactly as i would do it if i was a satanist because i'm not a satanist but i can definitely
[1:46:18.240 --> 1:46:24.240]  tune into that channel that's why they hate me folks i'm not bragging i got the enemy's number

[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:40.320]  the same article and bill gates paid for it bill gates came out and said i'm a liar nobody
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:46.560]  in india banned his vaccine which he owns and runs the Pfizer vaccine so paul watch that i
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:50.960]  called paul this morning and i said please you're you're a good writer i could write this myself
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:54.640]  but you just write this you said yeah i'll do it so paul wrote an article about it i said don't
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:49:01.280]  put me in it or make about me it's just an article about they claim india has not said no to the
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:05.760]  phaser vaccine which is an admitted fact i got a whole stack of articles i'll show you coming up
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:12.800]  can we show the paul watch an article it's newsweek fact check claims india vaccine ban

[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:28.720]  untested it's banned and they go well it's banned but jones is a liar and it's banned in south africa
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:34.400]  and they've banned the government vaccine in australia and merc pulled out of their vaccine
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.040]  and oh that's true and i didn't even know i don't pay attention i mean i learned i guess three days

[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:55.360]  doing like a joke like oh you heard me so bad saying i'm satan please don't do it anymore
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:02.000]  like they think they're all just dumb what they do you just send us massive traffic you idiots but
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:06.480]  what am i getting out here what am i hitting out here
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:14.240]  they're scared and they know the truth is coming out and so they're saying india didn't ban our
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:19.200]  vaccine and the article says they won't allow it it is banned but not the way alex jones says
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:25.440]  so that's just another giant enchilada and again we built this infrastructure you supported it
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:30.400]  so i'm sitting here just thanking god every moment because i'm like my post firing the can like the
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:34.720]  enemy like it's a video game but it's real i'm just like thank you god i'm still in the game
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:38.960]  because i can't believe this and like do you do i mean do you realize how weak they are i'm not that
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:46.640]  powerful i call out that india banned it no one else was doing it it goes totally viral i mean
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:54.960]  that's a big deal but you know it was you you understood it was important you got it out
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:51:01.760]  so it had a gigantic effect and now bill gates has got crap running down the inside of his leg
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:07.680]  which is exactly what i wanted to have going on because uh i feel god getting closer to me
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:13.440]  me as bill gates takes me see it's all about god's fear not fear of god fear of god leaving
[1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:20.240]  fear of god is no no no no no i need you like a fire going away in the cold oh oh come around
[1:51:20.240 --> 1:51:23.920]  like the more danger i'm in the closer i'm to god it's like oh this is good the enemy's like
[1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:29.040]  why are you not scared god's getting real close now oh he's getting so close oh i can imagine right
[1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:32.480]  when they take that gun to my head and say to denounce christ i'll be like pull that trigger
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:43.520]  bitch i'm with jesus agenda 21 and agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:49.760]  off from energy food and medicine and with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be
[1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:55.200]  engineered to bring in federal and globalist control we have seen massive lines of people
[1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:01.600]  lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:06.640]  away after hours of freezing in the cold we've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:10.960]  because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:16.560]  energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well they're both available
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:20.640]  the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality storeable foods right now massively

[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:37.840]  that's infowarstore.com or prepare with alex.com big discounts probably a few more days
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:45.920]  as negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to understand
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:54.640]  that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning it's god
[1:52:54.640 --> 1:53:00.160]  giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:06.400]  eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so as saddest things
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:10.720]  are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize that god
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:17.040]  is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having our own will god is the
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:23.680]  author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing and when you look at mainstream
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:29.920]  media in hollywood this whole evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the and the mass cult
[1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:33.920]  it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty you're ugly
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:38.560]  you're in the bad because satan hates you because you're made in the image of god the creator of the
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:54.480]  universe you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:26.880]  yes my friends everything we talk about is epic because just as there is a false in the
[1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:34.240]  universe there is a real various plugging your soul directly into the zeitgeist and eternity
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:48.000]  and taking it on are you ready the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:56.320]  all right let's go to your phone calls brandon rad taylor carlos
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:04.560]  paul logan john trint we're taking your calls on the power shutdown and the smoking gun document
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:09.680]  the department of energy ordered texas to stay stood down we have the document burn in hell
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:14.240]  globalist we have your ass now you will pay and not destroy the rest of the country because we're
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:20.080]  the test they can take us down as texas goes goes the rest of the nation and then of course we've
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:26.480]  got medical workers calling in with your stories about the covid vaccine do you love it so you
[1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:33.440]  hate it we're not censoring you we want to hear from you 877-789-2539 carlos in the great state of
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:41.200]  texas thanks for calling go ahead hey alex how are you doing good brother thank you for calling
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:48.880]  in what is your view on this well they they are they're continuing their extermination program
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:55.360]  by continuing to target the less fortunate you know i'm i'm very fortunate to to make a all right
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:59.280]  some of money you know i could go out it'll give me a generator for whatever i need but there's a
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:04.000]  lot of people who were not as fortunate and i think the death tolls up to about 37 people now
[1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:12.000]  now i can only imagine that out of those 37 it was those less fortunate those elderly people
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.480]  they can't get out of their house they're gonna be in the hundreds and it's a beta test to train
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:23.760]  us you're right yes sir now now that to get linked together with that executive order we need
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:31.760]  we need a new powerful voice to replace to replace russia's voice now i don't know who that's
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:39.440]  going to be but i think uh i think we all know who it's going to be and and we need to link all
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:44.800]  the patrons need to link up and we need to choose and i don't think there's any more obvious choice
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:50.800]  than you alex well here's the deal we already online were bigger than rush and then they censored
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:55.600]  us and rush is great we love rush i don't want to be the quote guy his show will be turned over to
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:57:02.080]  whoever that company wants to have it done but i agree with you that listeners of rush should
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:06.480]  migrate wherever they want and decide what show they want to lead the fight against the globalist
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:10.640]  but getting back to this how big a deal is it to you because again i was really mad at myself
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:13.840]  today that's why i blew up i had family call me and go hey you know there's a federal agreement
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.080]  we can't turn these plants up unless you know and they even told me the number and i was driving
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  and i didn't look it up then i was sent the actual document today that made me so mad
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:27.200]  what is it like for you to hear and see the document where we beg to have the power turned on
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:32.400]  and the fed said no until it already got shut down and then they turn around and blame texas that's
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:39.520]  crazy well it is you know hearing it and knowing that this was was happening since last week
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:48.720]  and and getting no mainstream coverage abit not talking about it it really pisses me off
[1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:57.600]  you know it it it it angers me mind you like i said uh you know i do very good at work thankfully
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:03.280]  for now while there's still my type of work you know i work in the oil and gas industry
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.840]  and for now probably this is probably the last good year it's going to be and then
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:14.720]  everybody's going to have to migrate to their renewable sources you know and and and and after
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:21.760]  this point which by the way are unsustainable unsustainable correct unsustainable renewable
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:28.000]  sources that that that froze up during this whole ordeal they're blaming it on the gas
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.400]  pipelines that froze up well that's what happens when you shut down the freaking plant and don't
[1:58:32.400 --> 1:58:37.840]  allow the freaking gas to flow there's nothing better the train loads of coal coal is king all
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:41.840]  right god bless you brother absolutely this is the real world folks and they want you to think
[1:58:41.840 --> 1:58:49.600]  texas is a dumb is why this happened this was done to you you cannot hide a grand assault
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:57.200]  america is about to have its energy cut off its borders destroyed its dollar brought down to nothing
[1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:03.760]  all of you that have served satan believe that you are on the right team you're about to find
[1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:12.160]  out how pathetic you are so i ask all of you who are awake and who love god stop living in fear
[1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:20.640]  the enemy is about to expose itself the enemy can't help itself the enemy comes to kill steal
[1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:28.160]  and destroy we sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it we should but once
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:34.000]  it comes through once it hits us once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:40.720]  we just have to point out we try to stop it so prepare yourselves america you're going under
[1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:50.720]  judgment just like all the children that were to board it this is the truth this is the info war
[1:59:50.720 --> 2:00:02.720]  so
[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:22.720]  sticky it's alex jones
[2:00:33.680 --> 2:00:40.080]  all right i'm taking your phone calls i don't think i need to recap the incredibly epic news we
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:47.520]  just covered but man it's bone shattering to know that they cut the power off on purpose and the
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:52.560]  federal government is in control of texas and the whole media is gaslighting us to say that we're
[2:00:52.560 --> 2:00:59.120]  to blame so they can do it to your state next and communist china have an article i'll cover it later
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:05.360]  is bragging that america's pathetic and that joe biden says their death camps are okay and saying
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:10.240]  you can't even provide power for your people that's how they demoralize you that's how they shut you
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:15.920]  down and they have a dictator in that stole the election so they just are going to go full bore
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:22.880]  folks they have articles that biden goes to sleep at seven o'clock at night it's a scene in headline
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:30.160]  oh early nights and fires at the white house we're taking your phone calls on the power plants being
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:38.320]  shut down every caller is about the department of energy i hope the phone's up on medical workers
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:41.760]  about the vaccines but everybody's calling about the power plants let's just do that
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:46.720]  let's go in the order that they were received brad in illinois power plants outages in texas
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:51.680]  what's your take on it hey how you doing alex good brother yeah i was just doing some uh
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:58.080]  research on uh illinois reactors up here in uh illinois we've got 11 reactors and six plants
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:05.920]  now that's that kind of seems like a uh a planned uh you know distribution of uh energy up in illinois
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:12.240]  but looks like you guys don't get it down there in texas anymore right uh well what they did is they
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:17.520]  just they wouldn't let under federal regulations the coal plants turn up their capacity so they did
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:24.400]  it by design right now i also noticed through the nuclear regulatory commission that you had uh
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:30.800]  scheduled two plants to be uh they've been planned but they haven't uh been built and they just keep
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:37.440]  pushing back a timeline on that and they don't want to give you that uh that that uh that contract
[2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:41.280]  to go ahead and go forward with it and build it well that's right even though nuclear doesn't
[2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:47.840]  greatly carbon the uh establishment doesn't want that because the goal is shut us power off right
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:54.320]  so um we used to be a fork at the forefront of building all this technology and having all
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:03:00.880]  these power systems why by by design are we being shut down incrementally over time because the
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:05.280]  globalists have invested in china and india and other countries so they shut down our investment
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:10.880]  it guarantees their investment so money we lose is money the globalists make does that make sense
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:16.480]  yeah so it's just like mammon right everybody's greedy and at the end of the day there's they're
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:20.400]  just going to step over the bodies and watch everybody die right well that's what feudalism
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:25.120]  that every government in the past ran was make your general public poor they're so busy trying
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:30.560]  to not starve to death they won't get too uppity god bless you i appreciate your call all right
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:36.080]  we're moving quick to these calls taylor in california rolling blackouts during the crisis
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:40.720]  the model is in ron they did it in california by design once they do blackouts they learn you will
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:45.840]  agree to pay more money give us your take on the situation taylor hey alex you know that's the
[2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:50.160]  breathwork guy my property's in california and you know it's in the mountains it's uh it's trump
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:57.120]  country like much of california in reality but uh during the the 2020 wildfires or arsons rather
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:02.320]  we had uh the rolling blackouts they were constant and they were always like in patches like 10 a.m
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:09.440]  to 2 p.m and honestly if i didn't have panels and generators i would have been screwed so many times
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:13.200]  like there's no way that i can trust the government i don't know if getting rid of newsrooms going to
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:19.680]  change anything but at this point everything is just completely rogue i agree with you and you know
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:24.000]  they have this philosophy i have the article here i forget the exact term where they charge you
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.320]  according to the time they train you that oh there's not enough power we're going to charge you more
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:32.720]  and depending on what time you use it we're going to charge you more yeah and then they have different
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:36.720]  tiers as well so it's different times and then everybody based on their income is in different
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:42.480]  tiers in your location and it's such a scale i don't know how there's any oversight over it it's
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:49.120]  it's so corrupt at this point it's totally a parasitic environment yeah there's time of use
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:53.280]  systems what it's called and that's what they're putting us under oh the crisis we need to control
[2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:57.920]  your thermostat oh we need to meanwhile did you see the smoking on document the department of energy
[2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:02.960]  wouldn't let texas up its power until the grid already crashed saturday night and then said you
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:09.600]  got to buy it from outside power sources at 18 000 times what it previously cost i mean it just it
[2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:14.400]  just sounds like the total globalist left this agenda it's the same thing in california with the
[2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:18.960]  you know our gas is a dollar more than the rest of the country as far as energy goes the whole
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:24.720]  thing is parasitic in them trying to leach energy from our spiritual energy to our physical energy
[2:05:24.720 --> 2:05:30.640]  to our dollar again our dollar is basically solidified breath or we're exchanging our breath of life
[2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:36.160]  for money because no that's it tell me you said it again they are literally vampires just imagine
[2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:40.480]  like a vampire like hey vampire why don't you grow some tomatoes i want you grow some apples or
[2:05:40.480 --> 2:05:44.720]  why don't you grow some squash or you know why don't you grow some rutabagger why don't you grow

[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:03.440]  god and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will being given free will
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:11.040]  being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe an entire system and the fact
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:15.600]  that you're able to commune with god the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:20.000]  beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife your husband or the beauty of your
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.800]  child learning knowledge the beauty of music the fact that you can commune with that and
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:32.000]  resonate with that is energetic and that itself is what god teaches us is worship so don't worship
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.120]  the globalist don't worship the nfl don't worship all the things of the system but worship the things
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:42.720]  of god because we're made by god and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:47.600]  while you still have it while you still have it ladies and gentlemen owin shroyer here the host
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:54.160]  of the info wars war room and i have had a major wake-up call living in texas this last week about
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:00.960]  how important storable food is now i have plenty of storable food in my house but my notion has
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:06.880]  always been this is last-case scenario worst-case scenario like end of america apocalyptic type
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:12.080]  scenario but i'm realizing now that's not the case folks they can shut off the power they can
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:17.200]  shut off the water at any given moment now i was lucky i had plenty of food in my fridge and in my
[2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:22.880]  pantry that i didn't have to dig into my storable food but many people in texas did it don't be in
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:27.680]  that situation don't have that major wake-up call when they come to shut down your power and they
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:33.760]  shut down the stores and the food supply have the backup have the insurance and be ready to feed
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:40.080]  yourself your family your friends and your neighbors with the storable food best quality best price
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:51.040]  10 off right now at infowar store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:07.600]  i have four children only one of them is out of the nest i feel a serious responsibility
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:18.560]  so i don't want to exaggerate the threat but i must tell you the truth
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:28.480]  the united states of america is under international multinational corporate
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:38.080]  environmental cultural attack we are desperately behind we are on our knees bleeding to death
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:42.960]  now i've seen a lot of fights where folks realize they're in a fight come back from behind a wind
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:48.160]  but i'm not going to tell you we're in an invincible position and lie to you so you don't do anything
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:52.080]  we are being destroyed
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:59.040]  and all the weird mentally ill leftists are so stupid they won't even know why they're
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:01.840]  starved to death once everything goes down
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:10.560]  so as bad as all this is it's judgment on this country i believe america wakes up and
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:16.720]  repents i don't mean watching tvn or not not gonna focus it watch them you know what i mean
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:21.600]  but i mean just really getting right with god i believe we can turn this around but here's
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:27.040]  the good news we can only come up from here we are in the jaws of evil right now
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:34.080]  and so i have a lot of listeners say jones we've known you've been a christian you've
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:40.960]  talked about god for you know 20 30 years but you just harp on jesus all day and harp on i mean
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:44.800]  world government market the beast is here man that's all that's that's what that's where i
[2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:53.360]  i that's my blanket and i believe in it and i know it not some preacher but god my connection
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:58.080]  to god and so you just go ahead and cling on to whatever you want all day long i just know
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:04.880]  it gives me discernment i know what i get on my knees at three a.m i get the big transmission
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:09.600]  so you just go ahead and go with whatever you want i'm not here telling you you know what you
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:15.280]  should believe what you should do i'm just telling you the devil is as real as a heart attack and
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:20.640]  this thing's coming on like a freight train this country is under attack we're under energy shutdown
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:29.680]  cultural shutdown by god and only realizing that gives us any damn hope of course joe biden's
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:33.360]  dissolved in the border of course joe biden's killing the dollar of course joe biden shut down
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:40.080]  all the oil drilling of the country of course he shut down the pipelines we're under attack you
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:44.720]  sit there and play games all day long and try to tell yourself you're not but you're just going to
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:57.920]  wake up dead so you might as well just wake up now while you still can't and it's not about
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:02.000]  fixing the politician it's not about turning the world around yourself it's about getting right with
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:08.160]  god and opening up that channel to god because if you're not with god you're with the devil
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:12.640]  so all you got to do is open the channel up god will fix it but god knocks
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:22.560]  to see who will open see god's not like satan takes your free will conjure manipulation
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:27.600]  tells you're getting all this power lies to you no you got to open the door and then you got to
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:32.000]  be led and i'm not on some high horse folks i'm as wicked as they come but i still know god's real
[2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:38.080]  and i chose god so god with a tractor beam hold me out of hell
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:49.600]  so that he'd have somebody there's a lot of people like me that have already seen this evil
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:52.880]  and that have been it and know how real it is i can read the enemy operations
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:58.720]  because there's a lot of good people that are so innocent they can't even see the enemy
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:03.520]  i can't see the enemy and let me tell you folks you don't want to be with the enemy
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:09.440]  ever all right let's take a call or two this segment i did okay last segment took a bunch of

[2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:32.880]  topic on the energy and what's happened in texas it's worse than we think and you're right on
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:41.680]  buried in the executive order that our dictator biden did on the keystone pipeline section seven
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:47.760]  c and somebody better at researching than me could look at it but basically in one little
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:54.160]  paragraph he undid an executive order that president trump put in effect which basically says
[2:16:54.160 --> 2:17:00.320]  chinese can't get involved in our in our power system was basically in order protecting our
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:04.480]  power system from the chinese i have the executive order you're absolutely right
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:12.880]  yeah and now been suspended for 90 days so not only can you have uh it's the kind of problem
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:19.280]  jan texas but you can have the chinese and some of those transformers that weigh you know 100,000
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:26.080]  pounds 200,000 pounds you don't think they can't maybe put some sort of uh malware or an ability
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:32.480]  to come along and negatively impact oh no exactly biden is putting us under chinese show cold
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:37.920]  he's putting us in chinese tap out he is putting us because china's control of the globalist
[2:17:37.920 --> 2:17:42.400]  he is putting us into a position of total capitulation that's what my intellect tells me
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:47.840]  my gut tells me my dreams tell me uh just america is dying it's a very painful moment
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:54.320]  yeah and and unfortunately you're right on the second topic yes feedback on the the kind of
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:18:00.720]  the glue that's allowed them to to do the things including steal the election in my opinion well
[2:18:00.720 --> 2:18:08.320]  they did you know no question actually no question is this whole covid thing and the vaccines are as
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:14.480]  you've said before and it doesn't take a lot of research to find out they're dangerous they don't

[2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:13.760]  the longest you've been holding i will get to you but yeah why is biden saying they want now
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:19.040]  the 30 000 or 25 000 national guard until next year that's actually the number
[2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:24.240]  and then it'll be the next year the next year because they're planning things so horrible
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:29.360]  they know there's going to be a massive resistance i mean ladies and gentlemen

[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:51.840]  the globalist and the people bill gates controls need to know and not a threatening way they're
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:59.280]  assaulting us they need to know that we're aware of what they're doing and that god is going
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:03.600]  to hold them accountable we're going to pray for god to bring vengeance upon them and that as they
[2:20:03.600 --> 2:20:09.120]  officially assault us as they come after us that we reserve the right to defend ourselves and you

[2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:04.000]  and i understand why people learn to believe that because this is scary what's going on

[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:32.480]  everything else but what really illustrated this is the trial to the senate where trump's own lawyers
[2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:37.520]  are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts
[2:22:37.520 --> 2:22:43.760]  criminal activity because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep trump fought it but it's up to us to
[2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:49.360]  win it we told you it was coming under the united nations pilot program in singapore for eight months

[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:18.240]  who's been holding the longest here that would be travis in the great state of texas
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:22.240]  that again if texas was to blame for the power outage i'd say texas was to blame screw these
[2:24:22.240 --> 2:24:26.960]  politicians but no i have the executive orders i have the department of energy documents already
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:31.760]  shut them 50 times the last few hours they ordered texas not to produce more power and said buy it
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:37.760]  from outside states at 18 000 times roiders said 10 000 we looked at numbers it's 18 000 times

[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:08.640]  tired of the federal government you can bet your ass that they are now exactly and they
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:13.360]  thought this would make texas run to the feds this is the opposite dude if i'm part of texas
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:18.480]  national movement i'm talking to everybody down here people are fed up it's in it it don't matter
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:23.440]  bro well what are they going to do when they learn that the feds cut the power and wouldn't let texas
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:28.880]  turn the power on my question is texas needs to stop following these orders well exactly i totally
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:34.160]  agree and you know what you're asking the question tetans are going to say yes it tests it even more
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:47.200]  so you're saying when joe biden says it's your fault you're not buying it especially you have the
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:52.960]  department of energy document that he ordered the power to be kept off exactly and you know what alex
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:58.640]  i just spoke to my to my uh to my state rep district uh director here in basori county
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:02.800]  and he was calling it all when i told her the documentation that keeps it on air
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:10.480]  he's like oh my word it says that all there we have links to all the wholesale documents
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:14.240]  we were only allowed to buy it from outside the state when they had the coal power plants

[2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:27.840]  you've got to get this out to everybody you know in texas if you want to stop these people this is
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:34.400]  so key say another call here let's go ahead and talk to emily in florida emily thanks for holding
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:40.320]  you want to talk about private corporations and power outages go ahead hi alex um i'm really sorry
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:45.920]  first for what you're going through there in texas uh i'm originally from a really cold north east
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:51.840]  state of main so i understand how brutal it can be uh especially if you can't handle it so i'm
[2:26:51.840 --> 2:26:58.560]  going to go to minnesota yeah and second of all i just wanted to talk about like the corporations
[2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:03.280]  have been doing this for a very long time um i know from my experiences up in main it started
[2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:09.040]  with poland spring um nestle bought poland springs which was a wonderful company that bottled water
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:14.640]  and was very environmental and took care of like you know local issues and uh nestle came in and
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:18.960]  bought them out and they've been stripping main of water ever since they've now since moved down
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:25.680]  to florida they're attacking some uh central state springs in florida that they want to take over
[2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:32.960]  you're right i was actually involved in a uh national tv program uh true tv on what happened
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:37.280]  up in the great lakes you're exactly right about those big companies coming in and just
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:42.320]  healing on the water but then they won't let locals have a well but then the big companies just take
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:50.240]  all the water and fill up oil tankers and send it back to china exactly exactly it's being exported
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:55.840]  not imported a lot of times um and the the number one thing i wanted to say is that we never fought
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:27:58.800]  it we never fought it when it was these corporations and of course the government's
[2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:04.160]  going to see that and say hold on a second we want in on that i mean it's just not surprising
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:09.840]  the i mean i agree with you but i mean i knew that the sense were in control of our energy and i
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:14.400]  knew they shut down over 100 plants i knew the windmills failed but i kind of got distracted
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:19.680]  by the windmills so i got called by sources and they said no alex the feds won't let us turn up
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:23.920]  the power plants which is true and then we found the department of energy document that just made
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:28.880]  me so mad that they would publicly do this like we're too dumb to figure it out but they're so
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:36.240]  reliant on corporate media covering it up but there's a smoking gun order number 202-21-1
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:44.160]  i'm i mean it's it's insane i i'm lucky enough that i don't know how i had the force fight but
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:50.640]  i'm down in florida now and we have an incredible governor uh disdantis is just a champion for us
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:57.200]  here he's even better than trump he's he's absolutely incredible he's absolutely incredible
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:01.840]  and i mean he i wanted to talk to you about how it's interesting that the two states that were
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:06.960]  kind of fighting the the agenda were obviously texas when they started talking about a texas
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:14.240]  texas movement and also florida and now biden wants to do internal checkpoints and not let
[2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:20.080]  flights fly to florida exactly exactly so there's there's definitely an attack going on a counter
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:24.160]  attack and a counter punch um and it's pretty obvious so the question is how are they going
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:28.320]  to hit florida i think disdantis headed them off at the past thing how dare you we have a lower
[2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:32.480]  cover cases lock us down but i mean how do you think how do you think biden's gonna the chai
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:38.720]  coms are gonna try to hit florida i mean i really hope that that disdantis is too smart and i and
[2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:44.560]  he's ahead of the game i mean he's really been ahead of the game as far as i can i can see no
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:50.640]  one else no one else but at least part of that is people used to be kind of punch drunk and trusting
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:54.480]  the system now trumps ahead of the game now now he's out of office i can tell you if people
[2:29:54.480 --> 2:29:59.200]  to talk to him and and disdantis is it because now they know how bad it is i want ted cruising
[2:29:59.200 --> 2:30:03.360]  ahead of the game i want ran paul to get ahead of the game which means be hardcore beautiful
[2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:08.960]  call emily thank you so much all right next in order who is next in order who's been holding
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:17.200]  the longest here that would be tom tom in chicago and then and then jay and then cd tom thanks for
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:23.840]  holding go ahead hey what's going on alex how you doing man i'm just i mean i got a smoking gun
[2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:28.960]  that the state of texas was ordered by the feds and i turned coal power plants on and uh to buy
[2:30:28.960 --> 2:30:33.680]  foreign power outside the state that bankrupted people it's incredible they've gone from fifty
[2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:40.480]  dollars a megawatt to three to uh nine thousand yeah it's pretty insane going on out there i uh you
[2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:46.720]  know prayers to you guys from chicago uh strange times on and strange times but um you know the
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:52.480]  reason i'm calling was actually uh a little bit off topic for what's you know even going on
[2:30:52.480 --> 2:30:55.680]  or you know what you've been talking about today but anyways what i wanted to say was um
[2:30:56.560 --> 2:31:01.360]  you know i searched in like the search bar the other day global population at the end of 2020
[2:31:01.360 --> 2:31:06.560]  compared to the end of 2019 our population has actually gone up since this pandemic has began
[2:31:07.200 --> 2:31:12.720]  and i just yes the u.s population went up we had roughly the same number of deaths in 2020 2019
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:17.120]  it's a hoax yes sir it's a total hoax and i don't know why like you know mainstream media is not
[2:31:17.120 --> 2:31:22.640]  talking about that like oh i even hired a private actuary statistician we did it months ago nobody
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:27.760]  cared but yeah no it's all a giant hoax sir more people died in 2017 than died in 2020
[2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:33.040]  all a bunch of uh insanity i just wanted to get your uh thoughts on that no i totally agree with
[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:38.400]  you it's all the people love liberals want to like oh i'm taking care of myself i'll wear a

[2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:05.520]  immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:11.840]  line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:18.960]  planet they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:26.000]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:33.120]  but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:40.240]  been given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it

[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:12.960]  guys got hit with and and they're sitting in the cold freezing and we've got a national basketball
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:20.080]  association team called oklahoma city thunder and they had bad the whole arena uh with power you
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:23.760]  know they played their basketball game and that was all good and fun while people sat in the cold
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:30.080]  freezing that's what technocracy is is they go oh downtown austin stays open oh
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:35.840]  air cost stays open but i'm in the dark for six days with the toilets overflowing exactly yeah
[2:40:35.840 --> 2:40:42.240]  it's sick isn't it yeah it's it's disgusting and we have a republican mayor who calls himself a
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:49.680]  republican uh named uh mayor david holt who who acts like he's powerless to do anything against them
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:54.240]  and pretty much told us that the nba owns oklahoma city and they can do whatever they want it's up to
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:41:00.400]  them in their contract so yeah but yeah but he diverts to them it's in the contract that entertainment
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:04.800]  and and downtown stuff is essential so we've literally that's a technocracy it's a new class
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:09.360]  system we're all fighting over black or white or whatever and then meanwhile it's all a class system
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:15.520]  he's just that he's just another spineless rhino just and i'm not a fan of our governor either who
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:20.480]  is uh groveling and begging for hope no i agree oklahoma used to be better than texas and texas
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:27.360]  is in trouble too the last couple years oklahoma took a left turn man yeah it's getting real bad
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:33.840]  but but luckily this election cycle we stayed all red and we threw out our democrat uh uh tinder
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:39.120]  horn so no i know you're way better than texas brother i see in the oklahoma but to see oklahoma
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:43.840]  slips um you know and and it just scares the hell out of me god bless you thanks for the call

[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:26.160]  go ahead hi um i was uh wondering if you knew about clad x or clade x is clad x it was a war game
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:34.640]  that um john hopkins uh headed up with bow g in 2018 yes i've heard of it stay it again so they
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:42.640]  can pull it up on the computer is it cloud x played it's clad e it was disease x oh the u in
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:49.360]  disease x drill uh yes as part of lockstep as part of lockstep as part of it 201 yes 100%
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:53.200]  the u instead it's come in get ready for world government ready for lockdown and they use that
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:58.720]  to sell their criminal operatives what they're about to do yeah yeah they isolated smallpox one
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:04.240]  and smallpox two from this mommy and supposedly that's the only human that's ever had both at the
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:11.440]  same time and so that's apparently isolated in a lab and so they they were game that it comes out
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:18.720]  of venezuela and germany and melinda gates made a speech saying or a talk saying that um we no
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:25.360]  longer have to concentrate on fighting virus or avoiding virus but we have to um concentrate on
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:31.280]  germ war there and that was mentioned in this actually i'm glad you you you you you mentioned
[2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:36.560]  event 201 and disease x yeah they pre because they don't want to get caught by the fbi who's
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:40.640]  still corrupt but they could be blackmailed by the fbi if they openly discuss their bioweapon
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:44.720]  attack so they do it all as a drill they all sit around and go we're going to simulate this it's
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:49.280]  coming soon we'll lock down the borders maybe we'll stay in their houses and then we'll make them
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:53.760]  take shots and bring in a digital controlled currency all right all right it's only a drill
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:44:01.600]  ho ho ho ho then they do it absolutely yeah 900 million dead simulated not too pretty
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:08.480]  but yeah that's that you notice bill gates said the next bio release will kill billions
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:13.760]  so they're just gearing us up for the main attack i agree with you yeah and then they practiced um
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:20.720]  because there was um talk about over promise of vaccines in in the past which i mean which i think
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:25.600]  they're meaning what we've done in coveted um well yeah they used that to keep the lockdown going
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:28.560]  i think i have an article right there where they're saying oh if you've had the vaccine
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:32.480]  though you'll be allowed to go out in public just like israel's announced so it's a two-tiered system
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:37.520]  if you let us put in your body what we want we'll let you go to the mall oh are the grocery store
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:44.240]  aren't we lucky yeah and they practiced um having the state leaders go home and manage their states
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:50.080]  on a local level once this disease gets released and stuff it's really crazy i listened to the
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:55.440]  whole video on it and you'll notice then the pre-planning right these are conspirators planning
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:45:02.960]  against you yeah what was it like to see these matt to see these lex luther type folks planning
[2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:11.760]  against you it's evil it's so evil i mean i i pray all the time you know for protection
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:18.960]  and i have three kids you know 19 to 25 and i'm begging them don't get the vaccine you know you
[2:45:18.960 --> 2:45:25.200]  do your due diligence and and research this thing because it's what about the waitress in new york
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:30.000]  she goes it's unapproved i don't want it they go you're fired as if they're a doctor as if they
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:34.720]  get to know about her medical history since when does a woman or a man that you work with
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:39.840]  you know like since you know their medical history just think about this revolution
[2:45:39.840 --> 2:45:47.120]  of corporations doing this they are raping us oh yeah i had a lady um i work in stores
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:51.760]  and i have a clear mask because i can't handle wearing those masks and i have to wear something
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:56.720]  to do my job she and i had my hearing aids and i was listening to your podcast through my hearing
[2:45:56.720 --> 2:46:00.560]  aids so i wasn't really i didn't know she was talking to me and i turned around she's yelling
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:06.560]  something at me so i turned down the podcast and she's like put your mask on and i'm tapping on the
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:11.920]  clear thing she goes i'm in the health industry and i said well i said i have a bad heart i've

[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:03.360]  the cold we've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:08.400]  their house and then running out of gas ladies and gentlemen energy is king and food is the energy

[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:48.560]  even before i had access to the show in the mid-1990s i went and saw that movie and thought man that
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:54.160]  looks fun in fact speak out have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining
[2:49:54.160 --> 2:50:02.720]  because you're real well what do they say in Wayne's World every day when i cover these huge
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:07.440]  topics i don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge are so real but i'm trying
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:11.360]  to tell you the truth i'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do the globalists love
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:18.560]  lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity and enjoy manipulating ideas
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:24.240]  and and using people's ignorance against them that for me is really such a disgusting so you've
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:30.000]  got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew but we will never join the globalists we
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:38.240]  will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together you're listening

[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:59.120]  taking calls the order they are received matt is up next uh and then is jody matt in Utah thank you
[2:50:59.840 --> 2:51:03.360]  you're calling in about the power grid outages what is your take on this
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:08.800]  hey um alex how are you i'm all right brother talking to you so i'm good
[2:51:09.440 --> 2:51:16.640]  all righty all righty so uh you remember back during 2015 jade helm they uh had that map out
[2:51:16.640 --> 2:51:23.440]  that said texas in utah were enemy territory utah was named enemy territory because of our food
[2:51:23.440 --> 2:51:31.040]  stores now we have not gotten snow up here this year and two weeks ago we had brown snow falling
[2:51:31.040 --> 2:51:36.560]  out of the sky a couple days after that our power went out a couple days after that rocky mountain
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:44.080]  power come out and said your power outages are blamed on the brown snow explain that with harp
[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:49.520]  and everything else i think they're trying to start utah for their food stores well i do have
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:54.160]  i mean i do have the former head of the cia saying they control the weather and china's
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:57.760]  in the mainstream news saying they control the whole country's weather so for us to say that
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:03.200]  that's the possibilities completely in the realm of reality i mean i don't know greatest snow on
[2:52:03.200 --> 2:52:08.560]  earth now we have not had any snow this year we're so far behind and we're not going to be able to
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:13.360]  grow our yields are going to be weighed down how are we going to make our food stores i mean
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:17.280]  you know you're absolutely right that that a lot of hellish stuff's going on what i mean what are
[2:52:17.280 --> 2:52:20.880]  you what do you make of this department of energy document i showed where they said
[2:52:20.880 --> 2:52:26.800]  texas wasn't allowed to turn their power on i mean that's smoking gun man it is smoking gun and the
[2:52:26.800 --> 2:52:33.360]  thing is they have been lying to us forever anybody who believes anything that comes out of their
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:39.600]  government's mouth is out of their mind and the thing is it doesn't matter because my kingdom
[2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:45.760]  is not of this world period end of story i agree matt thank you so much i'm a jam in the next caller
[2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:51.040]  let's go to jody in arkansas who also had massive power outages is still ongoing jody what's your
[2:52:51.040 --> 2:52:55.840]  take on this hey alex thanks for taking my call i was afraid my call was going to be a little off
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:53:02.800]  the subject till i've heard you mention uh the national guard earlier uh i live not a mile from
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:07.600]  the back entrance of a national guard base and i can tell you over the past two or three months
[2:53:08.240 --> 2:53:16.480]  the amount of military drilling and or a gunfire from drilling uh and the intensity of the explosions
[2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:22.400]  have been nothing like i've ever heard before and i've lived there for 43 years uh i don't know what's
[2:53:22.400 --> 2:53:27.520]  going on there but there are general honoree says he's going to confiscate guns and quote arrest all
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:34.640]  white men basically that's what i i i have to reach down and think i kept reaching down thinking
[2:53:34.640 --> 2:53:40.800]  uh the national guard is is preparing to help us but i don't i don't think that's the i don't think
[2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:44.320]  they're general honoree but general honoree literally took her calls and covered him sounds
[2:53:44.320 --> 2:53:49.280]  like a complete line of things like the white person is the enemy america's bad we're gonna put
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:53.760]  we're gonna fight him right i mean he says the police are white supremacists at the capital
[2:53:53.760 --> 2:54:03.040]  they help the riders all pure crap i mean just crazy town uh let's it was january 7th i believe
[2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:10.800]  there were explosions here that were shaking houses cracking windows i was fishing 12 miles away
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:15.760]  and it was rippling the water uh they're probably testing truck bombs out they're gonna bomb and
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:21.680]  say right wingers did i was afraid of yeah so i was just wanting to let you know about that and
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:27.920]  you know the atf tested a few months for oklahoma city uh out in nevada a rider truck so yeah that's
[2:54:27.920 --> 2:54:33.040]  what i that's what you thought when you heard it oh yeah i couldn't i i mean when i saw the
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:38.080]  ripples in the water 12 i mean i thought it was just someone blasting just you know right next to
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:44.880]  the lake but no uh you know it was happening 12 miles away it was the explosions were that strong
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:51.920]  yeah there's a k8 it news 8 saying that happened uh yeah and uh i've you know i've been in health i

[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:23.120]  max is here because his predictions of 10 years ago with being on air his predictions of five
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:28.880]  years ago two years ago a year ago a month ago are coming true bitcoin has turbo charge
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:36.240]  basically doubling its value in just the last uh a few months it's insane to 55,183 dollars per
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:42.800]  bitcoin what in haze is going on it was a signify for the larger markets max kaiser international
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:50.160]  tv host and former top stock trader thanks for joining us yeah alex so bitcoin hit an important
[2:58:50.160 --> 2:58:56.720]  milestone today it's now worth over one trillion dollars when we first started talking to you
[2:58:56.720 --> 2:59:03.440]  about bitcoin about 10 years ago its market capitalization was under 20 million dollars
[2:59:03.440 --> 2:59:08.640]  can i have that 10,000 you offer me for free again absolutely alex i've been keeping it
[2:59:08.640 --> 2:59:13.440]  in uh storage for you just waiting for you to ask and i would just send it right over
[2:59:13.440 --> 2:59:21.120]  how much would that be worth now compadre uh that would be worth uh 500 million almost 600
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:29.280]  million dollars okay thank you well i mean but you do sell a lot of that testicle improving
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:36.000]  medication so that's there's that talk about missing the boat okay please continue so uh it's
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:41.760]  over a trillion dollars market cap uh which is very important because one of the uh you know
[2:59:41.760 --> 2:59:46.640]  where do you want me to start on this because let me go macro let me go big picture people are
[2:59:46.640 --> 2:59:52.480]  starting to realize that inflation is a real problem no matter what the government's telling
[2:59:52.480 --> 2:59:57.520]  us about it not being a problem it's a real in play in a problem and what bitcoin's been telling
[2:59:57.520 --> 3:00:02.080]  us is that the u.s dollar and other currencies around the world are in a hyperinflationary
[3:00:02.080 --> 3:00:07.600]  collapse against bitcoin it's the canary in the coal mine it shows how weak those are right because
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:12.960]  it's real price discovery uh they said on cnbc today something very interesting they said without
[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:18.480]  bitcoin the price of gold would be a three thousand dollars right now instead of 17 1800
[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:22.800]  it's stealing market capitalization away from gold and by the way you said that a few weeks ago on
[3:00:22.800 --> 3:00:29.520]  the show yeah i's a matter yeah i absolutely did the other problem with gold is that the price
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:34.400]  is manipulated you know jp morgan's paid many fines already for manipulating the price of gold
[3:00:35.040 --> 3:00:40.960]  but they they don't seem to want to enforce the the role the the laws about anti manipulation
[3:00:40.960 --> 3:00:46.320]  so i don't see gold or silver breaking out of their current range because they're just trapped by
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:51.920]  those folks that don't want it to go higher but they're not shorting right the naked shorting
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:58.480]  which is basically selling counterfeit in the case of uh game stop the scandal from last week
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:03.600]  you had a melvin capital was selling counterfeit shares on the open market to manipulate the stock
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:09.440]  price down it's illegal regulators don't enforce it though in the case of silver in the paper market
[3:01:09.440 --> 3:01:15.200]  on the silver futures market you've got players who sell counterfeit sell orders or naked shorting
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:19.840]  to move to bang the price down and it's been proven many many times before and the banks admit
[3:01:19.840 --> 3:01:25.120]  that they're doing it but they they claim that it's very important to be systemically key to keeping
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:30.480]  the u.s. dollar as world reserve currency but what's happening around the world is that countries
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:35.920]  are dumping their dollars like countries like china and russia iran are all dumping their dollars
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:40.080]  and they're loading up on gold and now they're starting to buy bitcoin so a lot of these countries
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:45.520]  like iran and others are actually big players in the bitcoin space because they're they it's
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:50.880]  uncensorable right so in the u.s. tries to censor around they just do deals in bitcoin but let's
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:54.480]  let me toot your horn for a moment because your first ever told me about bitcoin and you were on
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:01:58.800]  a few months ago then a few weeks ago it wasn't last week it was about two three weeks ago and you
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:03.680]  said watch it's about a big giant moves about a week later elon musk comes out and the big banks
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:09.120]  endorse it and it did the stratospheric rise so that you just sense that in the wind or what was
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:16.640]  happening it again if you start with the big picture it starts to make more sense the big
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:24.080]  picture is that the u.s. dollar is being inflated away and the value is dying and so corporations
[3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:29.440]  and really the big move started with a guy named michael sailor he's the CEO of a company called
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:34.880]  michael strategy and over the summer he announced that he had put almost a billion dollars into
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:41.040]  bitcoin and he made his case very simply he said look i don't want to put my cash into the u.s.
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:46.480]  dollar because the u.s. dollar is losing 15 to 20 percent a year in purchasing power it's stupid
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:52.000]  for me so the flight from the dollar and other major currencies is of devaluation then bitcoin's
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:57.920]  king so that's going to rise it's an easy equation right it's the fastest horse in the race as paul
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:02.560]  tutor jones he said this over a year ago and i believe we talked a little bit about that as well
[3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:07.120]  he's probably the preeminent hedge fund manager in america he came out and said look i'm buying
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:11.440]  bitcoin i've got one percent of my portfolio of bitcoin it's the fastest horse in the race because
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:15.680]  he also owns a little gold but he's looking for inflation to really break out and what are we
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:22.000]  seeing now in the commodity markets you're seeing lumber at a thousand dollars it's had a new all-time
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:28.080]  high natural gas going straight up right the commodities are entering into a secular bull
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:33.760]  market uh hinds the food company is saying we've got to start passing these price increases on to
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:39.360]  the consumer so people are going to start to see now at the store and at the petrol station actual
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:45.200]  price going up in a way that's going to be alarming for people this is another wave of
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:49.600]  disenfranchisement for folks in america the purchasing power of their dollars is really
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:54.880]  going to start to hurt so there's a mad flight into how to protect my assets and there's really
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:59.600]  only one choice at this moment where it's not manipulated and that is bitcoin so it's got a
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:03.600]  trillion dollar market cap it's about half the market well there's no doubt about it two weeks
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:10.560]  ago when you said i could have like doubled my profit it's going to go to uh i have a target
[3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:17.040]  of 2021 of 220 000 dollars per bitcoin i've said that on your show a few times i've made that public
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:22.880]  a few times 220 000 it's now 54 55 000 so you still got over four weeks ago
[3:04:22.880 --> 3:04:32.080]  yeah it was it it goes yeah back it was back at the end of last year it was under 20 000
[3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:37.680]  now it's pushing 55 000 you know when i talked to you originally 10 years ago it was 10 dollars
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:44.080]  you know and it's been it's it's been moving up 200 a year for 10 years and the expectation
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:49.920]  is that it'll improve 200 a year for the next 10 years if you go to swanbitcoin.com forward slash
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:57.040]  orange pill you get 10 dollars free of bitcoin if you register and again you're not a sponsor
[3:04:57.040 --> 3:05:02.000]  because last time you did this adam schiff or whatever his name is irwin schiff knows his dad
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:06.960]  i'm not being me peter schiff i'm having a uh a senile moment peter schiff got really mad
[3:05:06.960 --> 3:05:10.720]  thinks you're my sponsor paid me to say that you're just a big guy that told me about bitcoin
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:15.120]  that i found very very interesting and you've certainly been proven right so far yeah we're
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:19.680]  you know this is this is the way people can get 10 dollars with the free bitcoin and by the way
[3:05:19.680 --> 3:05:24.400]  peter schiff is an interesting case because i told him to buy to 10 dollars he he just admitted
[3:05:24.400 --> 3:05:28.880]  it recently on cnbc he said yeah max told me to buy to 10 dollars i told him to buy 100
[3:05:28.880 --> 3:05:33.360]  dollars and a thousand dollars and he's just been wrong about a bitcoin for 10 years you know he's
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:37.920]  somebody who looks to the market for signals about which way the economy is going why don't you
[3:05:37.920 --> 3:05:41.680]  is it true that you refuse to debate him and i didn't get his name wrong on purpose folks i'm

[3:06:34.240 --> 3:06:40.320]  facilities and their his son by the way who i told about bitcoin when i was at their house hold on

[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:09.200]  bombardment of propaganda drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the very dna of the human
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:16.240]  species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard the bottom
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:21.600]  line is they want to play god they are playing god and the news is only going to tighten around our
[3:07:21.600 --> 3:07:26.960]  next from here on out so many other people want to be positive they want to put out fake news and
[3:07:26.960 --> 3:07:31.040]  want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the world order but at the end of
[3:07:31.040 --> 3:07:34.880]  the day it's all about the population it's all about world government it's all about the end of
[3:07:35.440 --> 3:07:39.600]  human system as we know it and on its ashes a nightmare being built only admitting it can
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:48.160]  turn around and stop it the need for storable foods are increasingly apparent with millions left
[3:07:48.160 --> 3:07:57.360]  without power including most grocery stores many texas residents are left without food the lines
[3:07:57.360 --> 3:08:03.680]  of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer while most of the store shelves are left

[3:10:16.860 --> 3:10:24.100]  So Max Kaiser, Max Kaiser, investor, former stockbroker, author, international TV host,
[3:10:24.100 --> 3:10:28.300]  what do you expect next to happen in the economy, do you have any comments on the power outages
[3:10:28.300 --> 3:10:36.580]  and like Enrom that you exposed 20 years ago, coming in in 10,000, 18,000%, price increases
[3:10:36.580 --> 3:10:42.100]  on Texans, Biden ordering, Texas not to up its power output, I have the documents, this
[3:10:42.100 --> 3:10:43.100]  is crazy.
[3:10:43.100 --> 3:10:48.180]  How does that tie into all this uncertainty and this whole electronic casino gulag you
[3:10:48.180 --> 3:10:49.700]  talk about?
[3:10:49.700 --> 3:10:56.580]  Sure, this is the way I would answer that question, obviously what's going on in Texas
[3:10:56.580 --> 3:11:04.140]  right now, it's an infrastructure problem and it is in capability of rising to some
[3:11:04.140 --> 3:11:11.340]  challenges because the companies and the municipalities that are responsible for this are broke and
[3:11:11.340 --> 3:11:16.460]  they don't have the resources to respond to these problems and we see this played out
[3:11:16.460 --> 3:11:23.300]  in many factors of the economy because over the past 20 or 30 years, it's been possible
[3:11:23.300 --> 3:11:28.900]  for corporate raiders or what's called private equity to borrow an infinite amount of money
[3:11:28.900 --> 3:11:34.740]  from the central bank and take over companies, gut them, remove all the equity and leave
[3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:37.900]  a carcass and we see this happening all over the US.
[3:11:37.900 --> 3:11:43.340]  The main nuclear reactor that supplies a third of the state, one reactor went down because
[3:11:43.340 --> 3:11:48.300]  the regulators that are private decided not to winterize the nuclear reactor, it could
[3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:53.540]  have blown up, that's kind of like the deep water horizon where they said you don't need
[3:11:53.540 --> 3:11:57.100]  concrete, you don't need to fill the hole, just do it with water, the engineers said
[3:11:57.100 --> 3:12:02.340]  it will blow up, they said we order you not to fill it, so there is a psychosis in these
[3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:03.340]  executives.
[3:12:03.340 --> 3:12:08.340]  Right, same thing with Fukushima which is over in Japan, the same with the private company
[3:12:08.340 --> 3:12:12.820]  essentially was incapable of dealing with it because all the equity had been stripped
[3:12:12.820 --> 3:12:18.380]  out and this is a problem of the interest rates being too low for too long to keep the
[3:12:18.380 --> 3:12:23.980]  zombie banks going, to keep the zombie corporations going and it creates this incredible problem
[3:12:23.980 --> 3:12:29.420]  now in the US where the only way to keep the debts rolling is to keep printing more and
[3:12:29.420 --> 3:12:33.180]  more money, so the money printing is now going exponential, something like 40% of all the
[3:12:33.180 --> 3:12:36.300]  money ever been printed in the history of the United States has been printed in the
[3:12:36.300 --> 3:12:43.060]  last 12 months and that if you look at the M1 or M2 chart, you can find that on the Federal
[3:12:43.060 --> 3:12:50.220]  Reserve website, you'll see this hockey stick like incredible vertical move hyperbolic.
[3:12:50.220 --> 3:12:55.580]  So clearly everything accelerates at the end of a Zimbabwe type curve and so where are
[3:12:55.580 --> 3:13:00.420]  we on that curve or is it why my republic, I mean how long do we have?
[3:13:00.420 --> 3:13:07.300]  I think where 2021 is when you see hyperinflation completely out of control and prices start
[3:13:07.300 --> 3:13:08.300]  to get out of control.
[3:13:08.300 --> 3:13:11.460]  We already see the stock market and we see in the Bitcoin market, Bitcoin is reflecting
[3:13:11.460 --> 3:13:17.260]  the fact that people are jumping out of everything they possibly can and get into Bitcoin to
[3:13:17.260 --> 3:13:22.220]  save themselves as a store of value, they would go to gold but gold is hopelessly manipulated
[3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:27.340]  and the price doesn't move as CNBC said even today, I think eventually when Bitcoin gets
[3:13:27.340 --> 3:13:33.780]  over $100,000 or $150,000 of Bitcoin and it's really hard to get Bitcoin because it's just
[3:13:33.780 --> 3:13:38.940]  not available, I think then people in desperation will start buying gold.
[3:13:38.940 --> 3:13:41.060]  Gold is basically the poor man's Bitcoin.
[3:13:41.060 --> 3:13:45.500]  Oh and I agree with you, just at a gut level historically, I think aluminum, I think copper,
[3:13:45.500 --> 3:13:51.180]  I think silver, I think every industrial metal and every commodity is going to go straight
[3:13:51.180 --> 3:13:56.100]  up including oil once we see these world currencies go down, what do you say?
[3:13:56.100 --> 3:14:00.420]  That's happening right now because as part of the World War II agreement that was made
[3:14:00.420 --> 3:14:04.900]  at Brenton Woods, the World Reserve was based on the dollar and all commodities are priced
[3:14:04.900 --> 3:14:08.620]  in dollar, you know oil is all priced in dollars, if Japan wants to buy oil they have
[3:14:08.620 --> 3:14:13.020]  to buy dollars first and then use those dollars to buy oil and that's part of what the global
[3:14:13.020 --> 3:14:16.740]  community is rebelling against the dollar's World Reserve currency and they're breaking
[3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:22.740]  away, we see deglobalization happening right now, countries are separating from the globalized
[3:14:22.740 --> 3:14:23.740]  community.
[3:14:23.740 --> 3:14:28.860]  Does it seem like Joe Biden's policies are going to accelerate that?
[3:14:28.860 --> 3:14:36.100]  Look Joe Biden has even, you know I don't have any idea what's going on in Washington,
[3:14:36.100 --> 3:14:44.260]  I don't care because it's beyond the ability to have any, there's no comeback, we've gone
[3:14:44.260 --> 3:14:49.260]  through the event horizon, the U.S. economy is now entering a hyperinflationary collapse
[3:14:49.260 --> 3:14:54.340]  and Biden or whomever, it doesn't really matter, there's nothing he can do.
[3:14:54.340 --> 3:14:55.340]  We've gone over there.
[3:14:55.340 --> 3:15:00.260]  I'm telling you gut levels, my gut's always right intellectually I agree too, gut level,
[3:15:00.260 --> 3:15:05.780]  I mean there's, I agree, we've passed the point of our return event horizon so what's
[3:15:05.780 --> 3:15:08.180]  going to happen?
[3:15:08.180 --> 3:15:16.420]  It's going to be like the antecedents, you mentioned are correct, the Weimar Zimbabwe,
[3:15:16.420 --> 3:15:21.860]  we're going to have a major financial collapse, I mean that's what we're going to have and
[3:15:21.860 --> 3:15:24.740]  that's what's going to happen in 2021.
[3:15:24.740 --> 3:15:28.180]  And so what's the point of like general either race saying we're going to round up the gun
[3:15:28.180 --> 3:15:32.820]  owners and they've got 30,000 trips to DC, it all seems like pathetic people acting like
[3:15:32.820 --> 3:15:36.140]  they're powerful because 30,000 trips will do nothing when their families are starving
[3:15:36.140 --> 3:15:39.220]  to death.
[3:15:39.220 --> 3:15:44.700]  You know the Pentagon, let me ask you a pop quiz, Alex Jones, how much does a Pentagon
[3:15:44.700 --> 3:15:50.020]  spend every single day to gas up their vehicles, the jets, the tanks, the infrastructure?
[3:15:50.020 --> 3:15:54.140]  I mean I know their budget every year is about $800 billion.
[3:15:54.140 --> 3:15:59.180]  The budget every year is closer to $1.3, $1.4 trillion, guess how much they spend every
[3:15:59.180 --> 3:16:01.860]  single day just to fill up the tanks and the jets?
[3:16:01.860 --> 3:16:02.860]  How much?
[3:16:02.860 --> 3:16:03.860]  And gas.
[3:16:03.860 --> 3:16:04.860]  I don't know.
[3:16:04.860 --> 3:16:12.220]  $250 million every day to just keep the Pentagon's war machine gassed up.
[3:16:12.220 --> 3:16:16.380]  And now the fact is price of oil is going to go ballistic on the upside.
[3:16:16.380 --> 3:16:20.220]  The Pentagon, like the Roman Empire, will literally run out of money.
[3:16:20.220 --> 3:16:22.380]  That's the U.S. is too extended.
[3:16:22.380 --> 3:16:24.020]  They've got too many military bases.
[3:16:24.020 --> 3:16:27.580]  It's over militarized and they literally won't be able to fill up.
[3:16:27.580 --> 3:16:31.060]  And you know, Trump tried to get the troops back and tried to, but no, we didn't want
[3:16:31.060 --> 3:16:33.180]  that, did we?
[3:16:33.180 --> 3:16:37.460]  Trump was anti-war and that's why he got the boot.
[3:16:37.460 --> 3:16:38.460]  Wow.
[3:16:38.460 --> 3:16:40.460]  So how does this end, Kaiser?
[3:16:40.460 --> 3:16:41.900]  What's coming next?
[3:16:41.900 --> 3:16:46.700]  The current administration is pro-war, but they started three wars already in the first
[3:16:46.700 --> 3:16:51.260]  few months of the administration because war is the most profitable business you can be
[3:16:51.260 --> 3:16:52.260]  in.
[3:16:52.260 --> 3:16:53.260]  Same thing with the prison business.
[3:16:53.260 --> 3:16:54.700]  And it takes the least amount of work.
[3:16:54.700 --> 3:16:58.580]  You just have to drop a bomb on somebody and then the way for them to drop a bomb on
[3:16:58.580 --> 3:17:00.460]  you and then drop five more.
[3:17:00.460 --> 3:17:01.460]  So that's it.
[3:17:01.460 --> 3:17:02.460]  That's the whole foreign policy.
[3:17:02.460 --> 3:17:07.020]  And then they drop 20 and you drop 50 and then they drop 100 and you drop two.
[3:17:07.020 --> 3:17:08.020]  Right.
[3:17:08.020 --> 3:17:14.580]  So it has picked really soft targets over the past 30 years like Iraq, Afghanistan.
[3:17:14.580 --> 3:17:17.060]  They like to kill civilians where it's easy.
[3:17:17.060 --> 3:17:23.060]  But eventually what happens is you pick on somebody who fires back and it's got the capabilities
[3:17:23.060 --> 3:17:26.020]  to go to actual cost submissive.
[3:17:26.020 --> 3:17:28.660]  And then your costs suddenly skyrocket.
[3:17:28.660 --> 3:17:30.620]  Oh, and guess what?
[3:17:30.620 --> 3:17:34.820]  The commodities are also skyrocketing because we printed in the last 12 months.
[3:17:34.820 --> 3:17:36.420]  Max, you've got to join us again this week.
[3:17:36.420 --> 3:17:37.420]  We love you.
[3:17:37.420 --> 3:17:38.420]  Thank you, sir.
[3:17:38.420 --> 3:17:39.420]  Thank you so much.
[3:17:39.420 --> 3:17:40.420]  Join us again soon.
[3:17:40.420 --> 3:17:44.620]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[3:17:44.620 --> 3:17:45.620]  of the two.
[3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:46.620]  One is born of renaissance.
[3:17:46.620 --> 3:17:48.700]  The other is born of conquest.
[3:17:48.700 --> 3:17:53.740]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[3:17:53.740 --> 3:17:57.740]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[3:17:57.740 --> 3:18:02.980]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[3:18:02.980 --> 3:18:03.980]  it.
[3:18:03.980 --> 3:18:09.260]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[3:18:09.260 --> 3:18:11.660]  of total mass, high-tech slavery.
[3:18:11.660 --> 3:18:15.780]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[3:18:15.780 --> 3:18:19.540]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave
[3:18:19.540 --> 3:18:20.540]  masters.
[3:18:20.540 --> 3:18:24.780]  A global permanent lockdown is here, and it's already causing millions and millions to starve
[3:18:24.780 --> 3:18:25.780]  to death.
[3:18:25.780 --> 3:18:28.020]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[3:18:28.020 --> 3:18:31.660]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England, Antitop General, have come out
[3:18:31.660 --> 3:18:35.900]  and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[3:18:35.900 --> 3:18:36.900]  That's the facts.
[3:18:36.900 --> 3:18:39.380]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[3:18:39.380 --> 3:18:44.140]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[3:18:44.140 --> 3:18:47.660]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumb
[3:18:47.660 --> 3:18:51.500]  down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning
[3:18:51.500 --> 3:18:55.140]  them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[3:18:55.140 --> 3:18:57.620]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[3:18:57.620 --> 3:18:58.620]  They play God.
[3:18:58.620 --> 3:19:02.660]  And I think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[3:19:02.660 --> 3:19:06.660]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they've tried to get
[3:19:06.660 --> 3:19:07.660]  me to join them.
[3:19:07.660 --> 3:19:11.820]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[3:19:11.820 --> 3:19:15.860]  I'm the connection to God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the
[3:19:15.860 --> 3:19:16.860]  enemy.
[3:19:16.860 --> 3:19:21.540]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[3:19:21.540 --> 3:19:25.940]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on it.
[3:19:25.940 --> 3:19:30.020]  So you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger.
[3:19:30.020 --> 3:19:31.740]  You're not God.
[3:19:31.740 --> 3:19:36.300]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[3:19:36.300 --> 3:19:40.740]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[3:19:40.740 --> 3:19:45.780]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, and making you feel
[3:19:45.780 --> 3:19:50.420]  weak, making you play the part of a victim until you don't take your birthright as being
[3:19:50.420 --> 3:19:55.140]  made the image of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free
[3:19:55.140 --> 3:19:56.140]  will.
[3:19:56.140 --> 3:20:02.140]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[3:20:02.140 --> 3:20:06.980]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[3:20:06.980 --> 3:20:11.500]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[3:20:11.500 --> 3:20:15.820]  of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[3:20:15.820 --> 3:20:16.820]  of music.
[3:20:16.820 --> 3:20:21.620]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself
[3:20:21.620 --> 3:20:25.020]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[3:20:25.020 --> 3:20:29.100]  But don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[3:20:29.100 --> 3:20:35.100]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God, and appreciate your consciousness,
[3:20:35.100 --> 3:20:42.100]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[3:20:42.100 --> 3:21:03.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:03.780 --> 3:21:09.100]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:21:09.100 --> 3:21:14.100]  Well, I really appreciate Joel Scalzen, who I really respect, smart guy, JoelScalzen.com,
[3:21:14.100 --> 3:21:18.820]  editor of World Affairs Brief, World Affairs Brief.com, for joining us for just two segments
[3:21:18.820 --> 3:21:25.700]  before Owen Troyer takes over with the war room to get his tank on this document, Department
[3:21:25.700 --> 3:21:29.020]  of Energy Order Number 202-21-1.
[3:21:29.020 --> 3:21:34.140]  I got called from family that works at a power plant as a manager on the weekend, I didn't
[3:21:34.140 --> 3:21:36.780]  even call them back till Monday, and they're like, hey, you know there's an order, we're
[3:21:36.780 --> 3:21:37.780]  not allowed to turn the power up.
[3:21:37.780 --> 3:21:40.140]  I just said, oh, my family says they can't turn the power up.
[3:21:40.140 --> 3:21:43.220]  Well, then we got sent this document, I went to the Department of Energy and read it, and
[3:21:43.220 --> 3:21:46.820]  I got mad at myself this morning because I was being told by family how big this was,
[3:21:46.820 --> 3:21:48.140]  and here was the smoking gun.
[3:21:48.140 --> 3:21:51.980]  They're blaming Texas, they're blaming our grid, I'm blaming the windmills, which were
[3:21:51.980 --> 3:21:56.060]  part of it, and here it is, the big smoking gun.
[3:21:56.060 --> 3:21:57.580]  What is this really all about?
[3:21:57.580 --> 3:22:03.740]  I've got a good idea, they're already telling us, federalize the Texas grid, they charge
[3:22:03.740 --> 3:22:08.740]  up to 18,000%, not 10,000% more, for outside power, which this document says, you got to
[3:22:08.740 --> 3:22:10.340]  get it from there first.
[3:22:10.340 --> 3:22:15.540]  So Joel Scalson studied this, here we are, talking about this, to talk about Biden, to
[3:22:15.540 --> 3:22:18.140]  just talk about the whole waterfront in two short segments.
[3:22:18.140 --> 3:22:21.620]  Joel Scalson, thanks for coming on with us, what do you want to tackle first?
[3:22:21.620 --> 3:22:24.460]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[3:22:24.460 --> 3:22:29.380]  It's important to understand where the blame lies in the Texas grid situation.
[3:22:29.380 --> 3:22:35.460]  It's twofold, in the first place, the Texas grid situation at best is running with just
[3:22:35.460 --> 3:22:40.420]  a little bit of excess power capacity, and so it doesn't take much of an overload in
[3:22:40.420 --> 3:22:45.580]  order to bring down the grid where they have to go to reserve power resources, which were
[3:22:45.580 --> 3:22:50.460]  all fossil fuel, and the problem with the federal order to the Texas grid was that
[3:22:50.460 --> 3:22:57.940]  you shall not turn up your fossil fuel plants until you buy it otherwise, and what that delay
[3:22:57.940 --> 3:23:04.620]  did was make sure that those plants got frozen, because unlike other places, the Texas grid
[3:23:04.620 --> 3:23:08.740]  power plants are out in the open, they are not in buildings, generally, where they are
[3:23:08.740 --> 3:23:14.380]  protected from the cold, and so when you didn't start those auxiliary fossil fuel power plants
[3:23:14.380 --> 3:23:19.340]  up on time, then they were too cold to start, and it became a cascading.
[3:23:19.340 --> 3:23:23.100]  And that's why I have you on, because you're so smart, you just, they begged four days
[3:23:23.100 --> 3:23:28.140]  before, two days before, they only turned it on once the grid was going down, Sunday,
[3:23:28.140 --> 3:23:30.580]  Saturday night and Sunday, once it was too late.
[3:23:30.580 --> 3:23:34.260]  I don't think that's incompetence by the feds, that looks like that was specifically
[3:23:34.260 --> 3:23:35.260]  done.
[3:23:35.260 --> 3:23:39.900]  Well, you know, you have a lot of radicals up in the federal bureaucracy of energy that
[3:23:39.900 --> 3:23:45.620]  are just extreme climatologists who really believe in this global warning stuff, and
[3:23:45.620 --> 3:23:50.420]  they're, you know, talking, we will not put more sulfur dioxide into air, even though these
[3:23:50.420 --> 3:23:54.900]  power plants are essentially clean now, as clean as you're going to get.
[3:23:54.900 --> 3:24:00.420]  And so it was really a very extremist group of bureaucrats which did this, and I don't
[3:24:00.420 --> 3:24:06.060]  know if it was purposeful or not, but I can tell you that when you, the reason why the
[3:24:06.060 --> 3:24:12.180]  grid came cascading down is because when you get up to maximum capacity, you're one or
[3:24:12.180 --> 3:24:17.220]  two seconds away from those generators shutting down automatically, and so they started the
[3:24:17.220 --> 3:24:18.220]  rolling blackouts.
[3:24:18.220 --> 3:24:23.460]  So the problem with the rolling blackouts is shut down power to the gas pumping stations
[3:24:23.460 --> 3:24:28.420]  so that there was a lack of natural gas to run existing power plants.
[3:24:28.420 --> 3:24:29.420]  Sure.
[3:24:29.420 --> 3:24:32.700]  So there is mismanagement and they didn't even know with models what to leave on, what
[3:24:32.700 --> 3:24:33.700]  to leave off.
[3:24:33.700 --> 3:24:37.100]  They actually shut down energy producing systems.
[3:24:37.100 --> 3:24:38.100]  That's right.
[3:24:38.100 --> 3:24:41.100]  Now they did have some idea, for example, of hospitals.
[3:24:41.100 --> 3:24:45.660]  My son lives in Dallas and he said that his electricity stayed on the whole time because
[3:24:45.660 --> 3:24:50.300]  there are only a few blocks away from the hospital, so their particular block of energy
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:24:52.340]  was kept on because of the hospital.
[3:24:52.340 --> 3:24:54.940]  Same thing with Steven Crowder up in Dallas.
[3:24:54.940 --> 3:24:56.180]  Yeah.
[3:24:56.180 --> 3:24:57.500]  So there was a lot of mismanagement.
[3:24:57.500 --> 3:25:01.700]  Of course, the mainstream media is making a big deal out of the fact that, oh, you can't
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:05.780]  blame solar or wind power for this because they're such a small percentage.
[3:25:05.780 --> 3:25:11.020]  Well, the problem with solar and wind power is that because they are susceptible to lack
[3:25:11.020 --> 3:25:15.340]  of wind and when it's night time, the solar isn't producing at all, you've got to turn
[3:25:15.340 --> 3:25:18.740]  back on those thermal generating power plants.
[3:25:18.740 --> 3:25:22.900]  And when they didn't turn those back on in time, then they couldn't once they got frozen
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:25.740]  out because, as I say, those power plants are out in the open.
[3:25:25.740 --> 3:25:28.020]  Well, usually not a problem with Texas.
[3:25:28.020 --> 3:25:31.980]  You don't usually have that much cold weather, but this was a severe event.
[3:25:31.980 --> 3:25:36.660]  And frankly, the entire establishment was unprepared for this, as well as I will say
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:37.660]  the people.
[3:25:37.660 --> 3:25:39.140]  And it's been a real wake up call to people.
[3:25:39.140 --> 3:25:43.460]  No, no, I agree with you that it shows incompetence, but at the same time, you have the governor
[3:25:43.460 --> 3:25:48.460]  in other states before begging for them to override the order, which shows the federal
[3:25:48.460 --> 3:25:51.500]  government was in control of the energy policy.
[3:25:51.500 --> 3:25:55.900]  So instead of them blaming Texas, it needs to go back to who shut down the power plants
[3:25:55.900 --> 3:26:01.380]  under Obama, who set us up in this position because they want to set themselves up as
[3:26:01.380 --> 3:26:02.380]  the saviors.
[3:26:02.380 --> 3:26:06.140]  I think it's important, Joel, that you agree with me, the evidence shows that it was federal
[3:26:06.140 --> 3:26:10.420]  mismanagement and control with ERCOT, removing the state from the process that took one of
[3:26:10.420 --> 3:26:13.620]  our best power systems and made it one of our worst.
[3:26:13.620 --> 3:26:15.780]  No, I completely agree with you, Alex.
[3:26:15.780 --> 3:26:20.220]  It was the federal problem, the federal edicts, but I would have said that Governor Abbott
[3:26:20.220 --> 3:26:24.580]  should have in his state of determining overridden the federal orders to them.
[3:26:24.580 --> 3:26:27.180]  And if he even knew about it, I'm not sure he got a brief about it.
[3:26:27.180 --> 3:26:28.180]  I totally agree.
[3:26:28.180 --> 3:26:29.180]  I said that first hour.
[3:26:29.180 --> 3:26:30.180]  He should have overridden this.
[3:26:30.180 --> 3:26:31.180]  That's right.
[3:26:31.180 --> 3:26:35.780]  In a state of emergency, he should have said, you will not abide by the federal guidelines
[3:26:35.780 --> 3:26:36.780]  on emissions.
[3:26:36.780 --> 3:26:39.540]  You will turn on those power plants and keep them running.
[3:26:39.540 --> 3:26:41.700]  So he deserves some of the blame as well.
[3:26:41.700 --> 3:26:42.700]  I agree.
[3:26:42.700 --> 3:26:45.140]  Well, he got an award the week before from the big windmill people.
[3:26:45.140 --> 3:26:48.940]  Why don't you explain to your expert on this what green energy is really about?
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:52.900]  Well, of course, it's a political thing.
[3:26:52.900 --> 3:26:55.780]  Green energy is more expensive energy.
[3:26:55.780 --> 3:27:00.620]  Wind and solar power do never compare in terms of the kilowatt power of nuclear power, for
[3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:01.620]  example.
[3:27:01.620 --> 3:27:05.060]  And they can't compare by at least half to fossil fuel.
[3:27:05.060 --> 3:27:10.780]  It's not really fossil fuel, but thermal energy from carbon sources.
[3:27:10.780 --> 3:27:18.420]  And so, you know, Germany, for example, which was completely reliant on solar and wind power
[3:27:18.420 --> 3:27:25.980]  has had some devastating blackouts because of conditions when the so-called green energy
[3:27:25.980 --> 3:27:27.500]  doesn't produce.
[3:27:27.500 --> 3:27:29.460]  So it's a real problem.
[3:27:29.460 --> 3:27:35.540]  You know, you have many of these wind plants, the machinery inside could not handle the low
[3:27:35.540 --> 3:27:36.540]  temperatures.
[3:27:36.540 --> 3:27:37.700]  They needed heaters inside.
[3:27:37.700 --> 3:27:42.020]  The producers of the energy refused to put those heaters in because they're hardly ever
[3:27:42.020 --> 3:27:43.020]  used.
[3:27:43.020 --> 3:27:45.300]  They refused to put buildings around the generating plants.
[3:27:45.300 --> 3:27:50.260]  Now, solar will produce, as I said, during the day, even if it snows, the snow will generally
[3:27:50.260 --> 3:27:54.780]  melt off unless you're in sub-sub-zero temperature like we're having now, and it doesn't melt
[3:27:54.780 --> 3:27:57.940]  off the solar, and so it becomes ineffective.
[3:27:57.940 --> 3:28:02.140]  There's no way about it, Alex, we're never going to get along with just green energy.
[3:28:02.140 --> 3:28:05.540]  It's always going to require thermal energy as the main power backup.
[3:28:05.540 --> 3:28:07.540]  There's just not enough green energy to do it.
[3:28:07.540 --> 3:28:08.540]  That's right.
[3:28:08.540 --> 3:28:09.540]  You explained that.
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:13.460]  My family's not a big oil family, but my mom's not a family, had oil wells in West Texas.
[3:28:13.460 --> 3:28:16.300]  They were not yet producing anything 30 years ago.
[3:28:16.300 --> 3:28:17.820]  They've been around since the 20s.
[3:28:17.820 --> 3:28:20.900]  Now they're refilling with oil, and we have old oil wells in East Texas.
[3:28:20.900 --> 3:28:24.380]  They're refilling, and they're now learning most of this is not fossil.
[3:28:24.380 --> 3:28:25.380]  Is it?
[3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:26.380]  What is in the earth?
[3:28:26.380 --> 3:28:31.060]  I'm a petroleum geologist now, it's becoming recognized that oil is not fossil fuel.
[3:28:31.060 --> 3:28:33.060]  What is it?
[3:28:33.060 --> 3:28:36.580]  Well, I'm afraid I have to get theological here.
[3:28:36.580 --> 3:28:41.820]  This was part of the creation of the earth, where the Lord in His creation actually put
[3:28:41.820 --> 3:28:42.820]  oil deposits.
[3:28:42.820 --> 3:28:48.980]  Look, if fossil fuels exist, if you create oil from deteriorating animals, and you look
[3:28:48.980 --> 3:28:53.860]  at all of the trillions and trillions and trillions of tons of oil, which would only
[3:28:53.860 --> 3:28:59.620]  represent a tiny fraction of the decaying bodies of any dinosaurs, you would have had
[3:28:59.620 --> 3:29:05.100]  to have dinosaurs 100 feet deep all over the entire earth to produce oil, and then how
[3:29:05.100 --> 3:29:06.620]  do you explain that it gets down deep?
[3:29:06.620 --> 3:29:09.860]  Well, it does seem like God's plan, and then now we're getting in a carbon-starved area,
[3:29:09.860 --> 3:29:13.580]  then we find this, then we bring it back up, and we're like terraforming our own planet
[3:29:13.580 --> 3:29:14.580]  again.
[3:29:14.580 --> 3:29:17.380]  It seems like it was intelligently designed.
[3:29:17.380 --> 3:29:27.500]  Exactly, intelligently designed, and I'm not even sure that a lot of the fossils we
[3:29:27.500 --> 3:29:31.820]  find of those actually lived on the earth, it's very, very possible this earth was created
[3:29:31.820 --> 3:29:36.820]  by layers from other previous planets where these things are previously grown and put
[3:29:36.820 --> 3:29:38.580]  together.
[3:29:38.580 --> 3:29:44.300]  When you look at the chance of this orbit of this earth being so perfectly designed
[3:29:44.300 --> 3:29:49.940]  in the tilted earth to have the perfect seasons, and the moon is in the perfect spot.
[3:29:49.940 --> 3:29:54.580]  And the moon is in the perfect distance for the sun, there's just no way that these things
[3:29:54.580 --> 3:29:55.940]  could happen by chance.
[3:29:55.940 --> 3:30:03.420]  This earth was a design, divine creation, and most Christians believe, and they should
[3:30:03.420 --> 3:30:09.900]  all believe in the fact that the Lord has power over the elements, meaning the elements
[3:30:09.900 --> 3:30:17.580]  are intelligent enough to obey commands, and it isn't natural law that Moses smote the
[3:30:17.580 --> 3:30:22.060]  rock and water poured out, it wasn't that he cracked it in a natural spring.
[3:30:22.060 --> 3:30:27.580]  The Lord can command that elements reform and form any element necessary.
[3:30:27.580 --> 3:30:31.660]  Because God is in command of everything created and we're made the small image of God, we'll
[3:30:31.660 --> 3:30:32.660]  be right back.
[3:30:32.660 --> 3:30:42.660]  We'll stay on the other side with a final segment with Joel Scousen.
[3:30:42.660 --> 3:30:53.380]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:30:53.380 --> 3:31:04.700]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked, and threatened.
[3:31:04.700 --> 3:31:09.420]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[3:31:09.420 --> 3:31:16.140]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[3:31:16.140 --> 3:31:23.180]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:23.180 --> 3:31:34.940]  Never give up the fight.
[3:31:34.940 --> 3:31:38.860]  Infowars.com.
[3:31:38.860 --> 3:31:44.260]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to
[3:31:44.260 --> 3:31:53.140]  understand that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[3:31:53.140 --> 3:31:58.420]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[3:31:58.420 --> 3:32:02.700]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[3:32:02.700 --> 3:32:03.700]  down to that.
[3:32:03.700 --> 3:32:07.740]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[3:32:07.740 --> 3:32:12.020]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[3:32:12.020 --> 3:32:15.620]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[3:32:15.620 --> 3:32:21.300]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[3:32:21.300 --> 3:32:25.420]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[3:32:25.420 --> 3:32:30.700]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[3:32:30.700 --> 3:32:34.740]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[3:32:34.740 --> 3:32:39.980]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[3:32:39.980 --> 3:32:42.060]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[3:32:42.060 --> 3:32:48.420]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[3:32:48.420 --> 3:32:51.420]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[3:32:51.420 --> 3:32:55.700]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[3:32:55.700 --> 3:32:58.220]  And I understand why people aren't going to believe that because this is scary what's
[3:32:58.220 --> 3:32:59.220]  going on.
[3:32:59.220 --> 3:33:02.500]  The global government, the New World Order and now that people have the facts that's
[3:33:02.500 --> 3:33:04.340]  real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[3:33:04.340 --> 3:33:06.140]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[3:33:06.140 --> 3:33:10.780]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the
[3:33:10.780 --> 3:33:13.060]  drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[3:33:13.060 --> 3:33:17.700]  We pay the most maybe in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that
[3:33:17.700 --> 3:33:21.820]  Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy
[3:33:21.820 --> 3:33:22.820]  cost and everything else.
[3:33:22.820 --> 3:33:27.580]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers
[3:33:27.580 --> 3:33:32.260]  are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged
[3:33:32.260 --> 3:33:37.540]  in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep.
[3:33:37.540 --> 3:34:06.540]  He's fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[3:34:06.540 --> 3:34:19.860]  But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[3:34:19.860 --> 3:34:23.860]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[3:34:23.860 --> 3:34:29.500]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[3:34:29.500 --> 3:34:34.980]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at the resistance.video.
[3:34:34.980 --> 3:34:43.140]  Here's the link, the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[3:34:43.140 --> 3:34:48.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:48.140 --> 3:34:58.220]  All right, this is only an 11 minute segment and then I'll enjoy your text over three hours.
[3:34:58.220 --> 3:35:01.220]  I can talk to Joe Scowl who's a five hours, really smart guy.
[3:35:01.220 --> 3:35:05.780]  I just want to pick this point about a few final issues here.
[3:35:05.780 --> 3:35:12.020]  We just minutes ago during the break, Joe Biden is at the Pfizer plant, who is the main
[3:35:12.020 --> 3:35:15.700]  group with this mRNA gene therapy.
[3:35:15.700 --> 3:35:17.620]  It's not a vaccine.
[3:35:17.620 --> 3:35:21.580]  As our savior saying we'll open up once everyone's taken the shot, now they're telling pregnant
[3:35:21.580 --> 3:35:25.020]  women you got to take it even though the advisory says don't take it.
[3:35:25.020 --> 3:35:30.060]  We've got Merck pulling out of the vaccine program with Pfizer saying it just doesn't
[3:35:30.060 --> 3:35:31.060]  work.
[3:35:31.060 --> 3:35:32.060]  That was a month ago.
[3:35:32.060 --> 3:35:33.700]  We have South Africa pulling out of the vaccine.
[3:35:33.700 --> 3:35:37.220]  We have Australia pulling out of their national vaccine.
[3:35:37.220 --> 3:35:39.780]  We have India saying notifizer.
[3:35:39.780 --> 3:35:41.460]  I had a big article written last week.
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:46.580]  It trended on Twitter and Bill Gates wrote a big article countering me that was in hundreds
[3:35:46.580 --> 3:35:47.580]  of publications.
[3:35:47.580 --> 3:35:49.940]  I had 7,000 Google alerts the other day on this.
[3:35:49.940 --> 3:35:56.100]  That's how many places it was, but it was mainly just republished everywhere.
[3:35:56.100 --> 3:36:00.180]  People watched an article at infowords.com where they fact check it and no, India did
[3:36:00.180 --> 3:36:05.820]  say no to emergency authorization of it, but what's crazy is it says later they let's
[3:36:05.820 --> 3:36:09.020]  it in the Time Magazine article, excuse me, Newsweek.
[3:36:09.020 --> 3:36:11.620]  This was funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[3:36:11.620 --> 3:36:17.220]  Click here to be part of the program and yes, scroll down and show viewers.
[3:36:17.220 --> 3:36:22.180]  They later removed that so as God would have it, they even put that Bill Gates was paying
[3:36:22.180 --> 3:36:25.100]  for the Newsweek article that then got put in a bunch of other publications.
[3:36:25.100 --> 3:36:29.020]  Yes, scroll down for TV viewers, scroll faster, I want to show them because down there at
[3:36:29.020 --> 3:36:33.780]  the bottom, I got a screenshot knowing they'd remove it and sure enough, keep scrolling
[3:36:33.780 --> 3:36:34.780]  guys, please.
[3:36:34.780 --> 3:36:37.300]  Just keep going to the bottom.
[3:36:37.300 --> 3:36:38.300]  There it is.
[3:36:38.300 --> 3:36:42.620]  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended
[3:36:42.620 --> 3:36:43.620]  links.
[3:36:43.620 --> 3:36:47.100]  They changed that to a news guard link admitting it's owned by Bill Gates.
[3:36:47.100 --> 3:36:51.100]  So we got 9 minutes left, I want to try to give you the floor, but what's really going
[3:36:51.100 --> 3:36:54.660]  on with this so-called vaccine and why are so many countries pulling out?
[3:36:54.660 --> 3:36:58.700]  But we're told, don't worry about it, why did the British government say over 75 shouldn't
[3:36:58.700 --> 3:36:59.700]  take it?
[3:36:59.700 --> 3:37:03.380]  But if you try to talk about it, Mark Zuckerberg blocks you, Zuckerberg leaks a video where
[3:37:03.380 --> 3:37:05.140]  he said he doesn't trust it.
[3:37:05.140 --> 3:37:06.940]  What's going on here, Joel Scousen?
[3:37:06.940 --> 3:37:13.060]  Well, it is one of the largest conspiracies that's ever come upon the world is the so-called
[3:37:13.060 --> 3:37:15.500]  effectiveness of vaccines.
[3:37:15.500 --> 3:37:21.180]  Vaccines, you know, technically can work under very limited circumstances, but you can never
[3:37:21.180 --> 3:37:26.660]  create, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, you can never mass produce a safe vaccine because
[3:37:26.660 --> 3:37:31.740]  of all of the adjuvants and the preservatives in there to keep the so-called reactions down.
[3:37:31.740 --> 3:37:34.900]  You just can never produce a safe vaccine.
[3:37:34.900 --> 3:37:39.300]  And of course, why would they have to cover up for the autism link between the MMR and
[3:37:39.300 --> 3:37:40.660]  other vaccines?
[3:37:40.660 --> 3:37:44.780]  Why would they have to cover up or the apoplectic shock probably with major vaccines that's
[3:37:44.780 --> 3:37:51.420]  happening even with this DNA, you know, gene therapy, if in fact it were safe?
[3:37:51.420 --> 3:37:53.740]  In fact, that's the biggest lie that's ever been told.
[3:37:53.740 --> 3:37:55.860]  But here's the bottom line on vaccines.
[3:37:55.860 --> 3:37:58.300]  They cannot produce a vaccine for a virus.
[3:37:58.300 --> 3:38:02.300]  The virus continually mutates, the target keeps moving.
[3:38:02.300 --> 3:38:06.580]  Even Bill Gates came out and said this week, you're going to require the third vaccine
[3:38:06.580 --> 3:38:09.500]  or the third shot from this to be effective.
[3:38:09.500 --> 3:38:13.220]  They can keep doing this forever, just like the flu shot every year.
[3:38:13.220 --> 3:38:19.140]  And everyone who takes the flu shot knows it really doesn't work and makes your immune
[3:38:19.140 --> 3:38:21.380]  system more vulnerable to disease.
[3:38:21.380 --> 3:38:27.820]  That's one of the biggest problems with the side effects of the MMR or the mRNA so-called
[3:38:27.820 --> 3:38:32.740]  vaccine, which isn't a real vaccine, is it causes a hypersensitivity of your immune system
[3:38:32.740 --> 3:38:35.980]  to the real virus if you catch it later on.
[3:38:35.980 --> 3:38:40.340]  That's why they bypassed animal trials in this so that they didn't have to show that
[3:38:40.340 --> 3:38:46.500]  there would be a hypersensitivity to an over-immune reaction.
[3:38:46.500 --> 3:38:50.140]  And that's why you have the cytokine storm, you've got blood clotting, you've got other
[3:38:50.140 --> 3:38:53.780]  things that are involved with the disease once you've had the vaccine.
[3:38:53.780 --> 3:38:54.780]  And a lot of this stuff is-
[3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:57.940]  That's another thing I forgot to mention yesterday, my show ended.
[3:38:57.940 --> 3:39:03.820]  Even NBC News has doctors saying, if you're a woman, don't get a mammogram or a checkup
[3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:08.940]  because for six months the mRNA will make you look like you have tumors in your ovaries
[3:39:08.940 --> 3:39:11.020]  and in your uterus.
[3:39:11.020 --> 3:39:12.020]  What is-
[3:39:12.020 --> 3:39:15.620]  I mean, don't get a cancer screening because it'll look like you have cancer.
[3:39:15.620 --> 3:39:16.620]  What is that?
[3:39:16.620 --> 3:39:22.980]  Well, you know what's interesting is that they never admit that the vaccine is the blame.
[3:39:22.980 --> 3:39:27.460]  There was a major doctor on television who bragging about taking the vaccine to protect
[3:39:27.460 --> 3:39:36.100]  a newborn child and then she aborted the child where it was miscarried and the baby died.
[3:39:36.100 --> 3:39:37.380]  All to protect her child.
[3:39:37.380 --> 3:39:43.260]  But of course, it's very, very difficult to trace any of these severe reactions to disease
[3:39:43.260 --> 3:39:49.340]  just like it's hard to trace the side effects of the various drugs that they approve.
[3:39:49.340 --> 3:39:53.900]  And that's why they put hundreds of side effects on there because they can't prove anything.
[3:39:53.900 --> 3:39:58.820]  It just takes tremendous difficulty because it reacts with your body depending on what
[3:39:58.820 --> 3:39:59.820]  you're doing.
[3:39:59.820 --> 3:40:00.820]  If you've got bad-
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:04.100]  When somebody dies of their liver failing from drinking too much, they don't usually
[3:40:04.100 --> 3:40:07.580]  put alcoholism on the desperate, they say liver failure, so it's the same thing.
[3:40:07.580 --> 3:40:09.340]  Like, well, we don't know what made your kid autistic.
[3:40:09.340 --> 3:40:13.180]  We don't know why you just had your baby die, but we know statistically these vaccines
[3:40:13.180 --> 3:40:14.940]  are causing major problems.
[3:40:14.940 --> 3:40:19.620]  Well, it's a very serious problem that people I know listening to your show and reading
[3:40:19.620 --> 3:40:23.820]  my World Affairs brief will not take the vaccine, but there's going to be increasing
[3:40:23.820 --> 3:40:29.100]  pressure that keep talking about, of course, mandating the vaccine passport to get around
[3:40:29.100 --> 3:40:30.100]  and-
[3:40:30.100 --> 3:40:31.100]  Israel's doing it.
[3:40:31.100 --> 3:40:34.020]  Israel's trailblazing saying, you can't go to the movies, the mall.
[3:40:34.020 --> 3:40:36.180]  What's inside a building unless you have this pass?
[3:40:36.180 --> 3:40:37.180]  This is-
[3:40:37.180 --> 3:40:43.900]  But look, Israel gave a million-dollar prize to Dr. Fauci this past week for defending
[3:40:43.900 --> 3:40:50.740]  science, quote, against unopposed or unauthorized objections, you know, and it's only the people
[3:40:50.740 --> 3:40:53.940]  who are opposing these vaccines and have the real science.
[3:40:53.940 --> 3:40:58.500]  It's the Dr. Fauci's, clearly doesn't need another million dollars because he's gaining
[3:40:58.500 --> 3:41:03.340]  millions from the patents he's got on coronavirus and all of the other skull-duggery that he's
[3:41:03.340 --> 3:41:04.980]  been involved in.
[3:41:04.980 --> 3:41:08.820]  But you know, to give that person a million-dollar prize tells me that the Israel government
[3:41:08.820 --> 3:41:11.340]  is part of the deep state and always has been.
[3:41:11.340 --> 3:41:12.340]  Well, I agree.
[3:41:12.340 --> 3:41:13.740]  They're like rounding up.
[3:41:13.740 --> 3:41:17.980]  I was in like swat teaming Hasidic Jews because they go outside.
[3:41:17.980 --> 3:41:20.060]  I mean, that's what Hitler was doing.
[3:41:20.060 --> 3:41:21.860]  What's going on there?
[3:41:21.860 --> 3:41:27.940]  Well, it's a custom in people to being living under emergency orders permanently.
[3:41:27.940 --> 3:41:32.580]  And what I'd like to talk about in just the last few minutes that we have that I covered
[3:41:32.580 --> 3:41:37.140]  in the World Affairs Briefs this Friday, and by the way, any listeners can get a free
[3:41:37.140 --> 3:41:41.860]  copy of this simply by going to the website, worldaffairsbrief.com, and on the left, click
[3:41:41.860 --> 3:41:42.860]  on Request a Sample.
[3:41:42.860 --> 3:41:44.860]  And it's invaluable.
[3:41:44.860 --> 3:41:45.860]  Your stuff's the best there is.
[3:41:45.860 --> 3:41:50.140]  So if people get a free copy, tell them how to do it again.
[3:41:50.140 --> 3:41:53.940]  If you can see on the screen there on the left-hand side, it says Request a Sample.
[3:41:53.940 --> 3:41:55.740]  That's where you get your sample.
[3:41:55.740 --> 3:42:00.060]  Whenever I was usually on your show, Alex, I would tell people to email me to our sample
[3:42:00.060 --> 3:42:04.820]  and I'd get three or four or 500 requests that would take me all day to send out the
[3:42:04.820 --> 3:42:05.820]  samples.
[3:42:05.820 --> 3:42:06.820]  So it's automated now.
[3:42:06.820 --> 3:42:07.820]  Three minutes we got left.
[3:42:07.820 --> 3:42:11.100]  You can come back Sunday if you have time, but tell them another big story.
[3:42:11.100 --> 3:42:16.300]  The big story is that the Mike Lindell, he's very sincere, he's a good patriot, but his
[3:42:16.300 --> 3:42:22.300]  video, Absolute Proof, has several pieces of major disinformation that he's received
[3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:27.220]  that is going to get us discredited to it or make trouble for him when he goes to the
[3:42:27.220 --> 3:42:28.220]  court.
[3:42:28.220 --> 3:42:29.940]  I really expect to spike all the good info.
[3:42:29.940 --> 3:42:30.940]  That's right.
[3:42:30.940 --> 3:42:32.660]  And it's to destroy the good event.
[3:42:32.660 --> 3:42:35.500]  Part of it is the Mary Fanning stuff at the end of the video.
[3:42:35.500 --> 3:42:41.660]  It's a two-hour-long video, but she produces a screenshot from an anonymous source of every
[3:42:41.660 --> 3:42:47.260]  single Chinese and Eastern European who hacked into all of the county election officials
[3:42:47.260 --> 3:42:51.980]  in these various swing states and how many votes they turned to Joe Biden.
[3:42:51.980 --> 3:42:55.660]  But nobody, including Lindell or anybody, is asking the question,
[3:42:55.660 --> 3:42:57.020]  Yeah, that's more cute stuff.
[3:42:57.020 --> 3:43:00.340]  Come back Sunday or come back Monday, we'll do a whole hour on this, and he's a great
[3:43:00.340 --> 3:43:01.340]  guy.
[3:43:01.340 --> 3:43:02.340]  I've tried to reach out to him.
[3:43:02.340 --> 3:43:03.340]  But that's more cute stuff.
[3:43:03.340 --> 3:43:05.180]  I mean, how have we not been proven right about cute?
[3:43:05.180 --> 3:43:09.020]  They're saying martial law will continue in D.C. because the cute thing says what on March
[3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:13.380]  4th or whatever, Trump will secretly be president again.
[3:43:13.380 --> 3:43:20.500]  The point I'm making the brief is that nobody except the NSA has access to monitor every
[3:43:20.500 --> 3:43:23.700]  email, every hacker that goes into every county.
[3:43:23.700 --> 3:43:28.820]  No private whistleblower, anybody has that capability, and I'll tell you, the NSA is
[3:43:28.820 --> 3:43:29.820]  Deep State.
[3:43:29.820 --> 3:43:32.900]  They aren't going to be providing true information.
[3:43:32.900 --> 3:43:40.020]  The point is, by feeding the foreign interference false narrative to Mike Lindell, they're shielding
[3:43:40.020 --> 3:43:41.700]  the Deep State who did all of this.
[3:43:41.700 --> 3:43:45.220]  Which was done with ballots at the point through the computer.
[3:43:45.220 --> 3:43:46.220]  That's right.
[3:43:46.220 --> 3:43:48.260]  And China could not have done that.
[3:43:48.260 --> 3:43:49.860]  China could have hacked in, but they didn't.
[3:43:49.860 --> 3:43:52.700]  Why would the Deep State use China to hack in?
[3:43:52.700 --> 3:43:53.700]  And they infel me.
[3:43:53.700 --> 3:43:56.180]  They crammed the ballots at the point of access.
[3:43:56.180 --> 3:43:57.180]  That's right.
[3:43:57.180 --> 3:44:01.900]  And so, you know, our patriots have to wake up to this bogus information.
[3:44:01.900 --> 3:44:05.980]  If anybody contacts you, I'm an insider and I'm going to feed you information, don't believe
[3:44:05.980 --> 3:44:06.980]  it.
[3:44:06.980 --> 3:44:07.980]  That's right.
[3:44:07.980 --> 3:44:08.980]  We're not trying to police everybody, folks.
[3:44:08.980 --> 3:44:09.980]  We've been doing this.
[3:44:09.980 --> 3:44:10.980]  You've been doing it 50 years.
[3:44:10.980 --> 3:44:11.980]  I've been doing it 27.
[3:44:11.980 --> 3:44:12.980]  We've learned this, folks.
[3:44:12.980 --> 3:44:14.940]  Do not go with anonymous or magic bullet people.
[3:44:14.940 --> 3:44:16.260]  It doesn't exist.
[3:44:16.260 --> 3:44:17.260]  Yeah.
[3:44:17.260 --> 3:44:20.260]  If it's too good to be true, it usually is.
[3:44:20.260 --> 3:44:21.260]  That's the problem.
[3:44:21.260 --> 3:44:24.220]  You need to reach out to Lindell and just say, hey, you're a great guy.
[3:44:24.220 --> 3:44:25.220]  Just don't.
[3:44:25.220 --> 3:44:28.340]  Because I even though Gateway Pundit criticized, everybody got mad at them like, why are you
[3:44:28.340 --> 3:44:29.340]  staying?
[3:44:29.340 --> 3:44:30.340]  There's no fraud.
[3:44:30.340 --> 3:44:34.500]  Don't we're staying just like they did with the whole National Guard, Air National Guard
[3:44:34.500 --> 3:44:38.260]  story, how Carl Rowe put some fake stuff and real stuff.
[3:44:38.260 --> 3:44:40.620]  That's how they discredit.
[3:44:40.620 --> 3:44:41.620]  That's right.
[3:44:41.620 --> 3:44:44.980]  And it's important to realize, you know, how they do this, but you have to understand
[3:44:44.980 --> 3:44:50.260]  how the Deep State operates and you have to understand that the NSA controls every communication.
[3:44:50.260 --> 3:44:55.260]  There's no way any insider can talk to any of us on the conservative side and get away
[3:44:55.260 --> 3:45:00.380]  with it unless they are permitted to as disinformation people.
[3:45:00.380 --> 3:45:05.260]  And there are no military people that are willing to save us because they're all vetted
[3:45:05.260 --> 3:45:06.860]  out of the military at the higher level.
[3:45:06.860 --> 3:45:08.860]  And we're not saying that to be negative, folks.
[3:45:08.860 --> 3:45:09.980]  We're just being honest.
[3:45:09.980 --> 3:45:11.380]  We have to get with God.
[3:45:11.380 --> 3:45:13.380]  We have to change things ourselves, our local communities.
[3:45:13.380 --> 3:45:14.780]  Joe Scalsen, I totally agree with you.
[3:45:14.780 --> 3:45:15.780]  JoeScalsen.com, WorldFirstBreathe.com.
[3:45:15.780 --> 3:45:16.780]  Thank you so much.
[3:45:16.780 --> 3:45:17.780]  My pleasure, Alex.
[3:45:17.780 --> 3:45:21.500]  Come back next week if you want for a full hour.
[3:45:21.500 --> 3:45:22.500]  Okay.
[3:45:22.500 --> 3:45:23.500]  Owen Schroyer takes it over to the moment.
[3:45:23.500 --> 3:45:24.500]  Appreciate all the colors we didn't get to.
[3:45:24.500 --> 3:45:48.860]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
