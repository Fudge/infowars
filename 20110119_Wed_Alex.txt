[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:34.400]  there is no doubt I was already sure of it last week but this morning it is a
[00:34.400 --> 00:41.520]  hundred percent confirmed the federal government via homeland security is
[00:41.520 --> 00:51.880]  staging a false flag false start false identification of pipe bombs all over
[00:51.880 --> 00:59.480]  the United States right now and this is a psi-op to create an atmosphere of total
[00:59.480 --> 01:06.960]  fear and it doesn't matter if we talk about San Francisco or New York City
[01:06.960 --> 01:16.800]  today all over the country Spokane Washington you name it the feds are
[01:16.800 --> 01:20.600]  coming in through the threat fusion centers and openly announcing that
[01:20.600 --> 01:25.040]  they're federalizing the cities in the name of anti-terror and then magically
[01:25.040 --> 01:29.840]  the cities in the case of Austin millions of dollars to purchase a defense
[01:29.840 --> 01:34.680]  contractor made high-tech robots for bomb disposal we've never had a bomb in
[01:34.680 --> 01:39.480]  Austin they're gearing up and all over the country the robots are being
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.320]  purchased the SWAT teams are being expanded the police are being trained
[01:43.320 --> 01:49.480]  that right-wing groups are going to start pipe bombing them and then magically
[01:49.480 --> 01:58.560]  all over the country pipe bomb detonation stop traffic off of I-680 then
[01:58.560 --> 02:06.240]  you actually get into the news article and it says what East Bay
[02:06.240 --> 02:11.400]  investigators were forced to shut down traffic on southbound interstate 680
[02:11.400 --> 02:17.840]  multiple times yesterday evening as bomb squad detonated several possible pipe
[02:17.840 --> 02:23.080]  bombs discovered in the storage facility now I've been studying this for a long
[02:23.080 --> 02:27.200]  time and later in the hour I'm going to explain how they're operating and what
[02:27.200 --> 02:31.920]  they're doing but I have seen the Austin Police Department the state police and
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.720]  others commit crimes that are just off the charts crimes of hysteria crimes of
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.240]  yelling fire in a theater fake nuclear spills in Kyle to shut down I-35 and to
[02:43.240 --> 02:50.480]  have checkpoints fake bio releases they've done psych warfare test on the
[02:50.480 --> 02:54.840]  state police administrative building I of course jumped into the live news said
[02:54.840 --> 02:58.360]  that it was fake bluff the news and said I know this is fake and you're part of
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.520]  it because I'd actually heard them talking about how it was staged over at
[03:02.520 --> 03:05.520]  their truck right before they went live but I bluffed and said I had the proof
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.280]  I was unable to tape it they then capitulated went on the news and admitted
[03:10.280 --> 03:13.560]  it was a drill I mean I've actually fleshed these people out that's how I
[03:13.560 --> 03:17.920]  sent the director of access TV to prison I went in with a recorder and said
[03:17.920 --> 03:22.000]  you know I know you guys are taking money and they kind of just started
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.320]  flubbling and then you know admitting to it it's an it's a standard cop trick but
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.960]  cops aren't really cops anymore they're federal errand boys on average and the
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.840]  good ones are compartmentalized but I mean I watch the federal government
[03:36.840 --> 03:43.120]  Clinton Bush Obama same thing fake terror attacks fake car bombs and Belton
[03:43.120 --> 03:47.280]  fake attacks on schools you see them all the time where they go into a public
[03:47.280 --> 03:52.160]  school with elementary kids high schoolers every cross section announced
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.360]  we're the militia here to kill you and then the parents freak out when they
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.400]  find out it wasn't real and that the kids were told it was real and the kids
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.360]  are traumatized and screwed up it's mind control and it's setting the precedent
[04:05.360 --> 04:09.480]  this is a giant reeducation camp this whole country and I'm not going along
[04:09.480 --> 04:13.680]  with it and we've got their internal documents how it's to break our will
[04:13.680 --> 04:16.800]  and condition us to have learned helplessness and to teach your elementary
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.160]  kids to put their hands up and go get on the bus and be taken to a FEMA center we
[04:21.160 --> 04:26.520]  confirmed that by 1999 the confirmed internal school board documents in
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.520]  places like Missouri and so I've seen this over and over again I know what
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.480]  we're dealing with now if they stage enough fake pipe bomb attacks
[04:35.480 --> 04:41.440]  schizophrenics copycats mentally ill people are gonna start detonating pipe
[04:41.440 --> 04:46.080]  bombs in most cases that we actually catch real people with pipe bombs for
[04:46.080 --> 04:51.040]  whatever reason in the criminology it's a fire department employee or a police
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.800]  officer there are real pipe bombings in this country and generally it's it's
[04:55.800 --> 05:02.640]  government employees doing it for some reason you've heard Alex explain how the

[08:05.440 --> 08:30.440]  GCN radio network
[08:30.440 --> 08:38.960]  it is Wednesday the 19th day of January 2011 we're gonna be live here for the
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.280]  next three hours of course Lindsay Williams three months ago here on air
[08:43.280 --> 08:48.880]  talked about his two oil company exec connections one of which he's now been
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.600]  able to reveal the name of because he's a succumb and died of cancer and Lindsay
[08:53.600 --> 08:56.600]  Williams of course said that his sources who've been very accurate in the past
[08:56.600 --> 09:02.920]  said that oil would go up from $60 a barrel to 150 to 200 in the next year
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.160]  and then it would start going up almost immediately and it did of course two and
[09:08.160 --> 09:13.280]  a half three years ago back in 2008 when oil was down at $60 a barrel or so he
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.000]  said it was going to 150 it went to exactly that 149 and change then when
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.560]  it was still going up Williams came out and said now it will start going down
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.080]  with precision it went down and I noticed that when I went to Bilderberg right
[09:26.080 --> 09:30.520]  around that same time that was the intel we got from Jim Tucker who was there on
[09:30.520 --> 09:34.680]  the ground it does have moles inside the Bilderberg group organization was that
[09:34.680 --> 09:43.000]  the people were getting too angry you know over the fact that they increased
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.840]  the well prices so that they would now drop them after a time and they even
[09:46.840 --> 09:51.320]  peg the dates on that so just incredible and people have really requested that he
[09:51.320 --> 09:55.360]  come back on the broadcast so he'll be with us here I was some new information
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.680]  that he got from the other living former CEO of a big three oil company we
[10:01.680 --> 10:06.160]  cannot release his name at this time he's alive but he's well known hidden in
[10:06.160 --> 10:12.720]  plain view just like a mr. Ken from was Williams will be joining us and I'm
[10:12.720 --> 10:20.360]  really excited about having Matthias Rojas from Chile joining us he's the
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.480]  gentleman whose video and just the last two days has gotten just on one YouTube
[10:25.480 --> 10:29.840]  version a quarter million views all together about 400,000 views just in the
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.480]  videos I saw on YouTube without spending more than 30 seconds counting up the
[10:34.480 --> 10:38.640]  numbers probably a million have already seen it what an example of standing up
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.880]  and fighting for liberty going up and confronting David Rockefeller and I
[10:43.880 --> 10:51.920]  talked to mr. Rojas yesterday via video Skype from Chile and we're going to have
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.000]  him joining us via video Skype unless there's any technical problems coming up
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.080]  in about an hour and 20 minutes from now he gave me the full scoop and says he
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.560]  wants to tell the whole story on air other things that went on so we'll see
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.080]  if he wants to give you his sources and how he was there he was actually waiting
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.360]  for mr. Rockefeller very powerful confrontation and the reason these
[11:15.360 --> 11:19.120]  conversations are so important is it's not just the citizens going out to some
[11:19.120 --> 11:24.960]  big you know armored event with 30,000 National Guard and 30,000 police from all
[11:24.960 --> 11:30.120]  over the East Coast with giant black fence barricades to keep you away from
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.920]  the president the president all of that security all of that pageantry you know
[11:35.920 --> 11:42.360]  the buck stops here is sold and driven to make you believe the president
[11:42.360 --> 11:45.720]  actually is running things so the president can take the blame for the
[11:45.720 --> 11:49.600]  globalist agenda and then so the president can be politically torn down
[11:49.600 --> 11:55.240]  later and a new puppet brought in who then is crowned you know the leader and
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.360]  then they can be politically destroyed they take all the slings and arrows while
[12:00.360 --> 12:07.080]  the real owners the Queen of England the Dutch Queen Queen Beatrix people like
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.440]  the Rockefellers the Rothschilds the Bill Gates Ted Turner and all of them
[12:12.440 --> 12:17.080]  have secret meetings that even come out in mainstream news ABC News Times of
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.680]  London secret meeting of world's elite about how to set up world government to
[12:22.680 --> 12:27.040]  reduce population they want a world government to reduce population what did
[12:27.040 --> 12:30.800]  the head of the Goddard Space Center head of research for NASA number three
[12:30.800 --> 12:36.680]  guy in NASA what did Mr. Hanson say again this week we need to be authoritarian
[12:36.680 --> 12:40.520]  like China they're the model they're the future America's a joke and then he
[12:40.520 --> 12:43.960]  blames our liberty for it and says you're not gonna have an economy unless
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.480]  you give into the global government and the carbon tax and he calls for China
[12:47.480 --> 12:51.520]  and others to put tariffs on us if we don't accept carbon taxes when China is
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.320]  exempt from the stinking banks this is the treason and I'm gonna get into China
[12:56.320 --> 13:01.440]  coming up I'm only building up to that that's the big news but I want to really
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.800]  focus on that when we come back in the next segment so so for now I'm gonna
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.280]  tell you what's coming up today and cover some of it while we're at it
[13:12.320 --> 13:18.520]  later I'm gonna get into fake staged events fake
[13:19.080 --> 13:24.840]  pipe bombing events going on all over the country government run to usher in
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.360]  the FBI takeover of the streets of America via Homeland Security and I've
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.760]  caught the federal government before Homeland Security even existed under
[13:34.760 --> 13:41.280]  FEMA right here in Region 6 not once not twice not three times not four times
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.720]  not five times I have caught them so many times that I was trying to remember
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.200]  it this morning and I just more and more examples popped up more articles we
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.320]  wrote more video we shot of fake nuclear spills fake terror attacks fake
[13:54.320 --> 14:00.240]  car bombings where they announced hours or days later it was fake and I come up
[14:00.240 --> 14:03.720]  to these and I'd see press it around giggling and going oh yeah this helps
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.280]  them with the training and I go excuse me and the little you know newscasters
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.520]  on a power trip and says get away from me Jones so I just jump in front of the
[14:10.520 --> 14:14.040]  live camera when they go live and say it's completely fake I called the news
[14:14.040 --> 14:17.240]  director and I go I've got the proof this was fake and you came out here for
[14:17.240 --> 14:22.720]  the drill so they went on that night and said oh it was a drill the fake attack
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.640]  at the DPS building that they have such mind-controlled employees there were
[14:27.640 --> 14:31.240]  all these women collapsing and going to the hospital all they had to do was have
[14:31.240 --> 14:35.000]  one person say they smelled something who was part of the psyopps psychological
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.680]  test collapse and half the building was collapsing over there see these psyops
[14:40.680 --> 14:47.480]  it's it's a psychological suggestion basically a psychological implantation
[14:47.480 --> 14:52.040]  and that's what all these terror drills and this stuff are and then once they
[14:52.040 --> 14:54.880]  get you in the reeducation camp level this is what the whole country is a
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.080]  giant sports stadium reeducation camp I got a red dawn or something but the
[14:59.080 --> 15:02.240]  whole country is being turned into that with these weak-minded people that just
[15:02.240 --> 15:10.000]  receive whatever the news says is real and all over the country I see it every
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.320]  week where they go into elementary schools businesses and they announced
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.320]  we're gonna kill you we're the militia against government we're the militia
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.200]  against public schools and they're told the federal grants to say this we're
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.320]  the militia for the second amendment again to create a trauma with people
[15:28.320 --> 15:31.800]  against the second amendment they found that the weak-minded unconscious if
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.080]  they're told guys in camo are screaming I'm gonna blow your five-year-old's head
[15:35.080 --> 15:39.640]  off and then the kid comes home soiled pants everything else and they call the
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.480]  school and they go well it was you know Michigan it's happened all over it's a
[15:43.480 --> 15:46.960]  federal drill we have to follow that script and the parents usually don't
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.960]  blame most of them they go oh I understand you're preparing for the
[15:49.960 --> 15:53.480]  homeschoolers to attack you're preparing for the militia and they go those dirty
[15:53.480 --> 15:58.480]  militia because subconsciously the parents know the school's evil know the
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.320]  government's engaged in mind control in crossing boundaries TSA sticking their
[16:03.320 --> 16:08.240]  hands down your pants body scanning you it's all about pushing boundaries that's
[16:08.240 --> 16:15.360]  why Ted Turner and Hanson at NASA and Dr. Pionka at UT literally thousands of
[16:15.360 --> 16:20.640]  them I mean every day without looking I see big academics the head IPCC UN
[16:20.640 --> 16:27.000]  author scientist of the whole carbon tax takeover I mean it's every day several
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.280]  times a week Watson writes articles about it where they say we need
[16:31.280 --> 16:36.480]  authoritarianism it's good just like in the 30s when authoritarianism was being
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.880]  promoted as the solution to all the ills how great Hitler was how great
[16:40.880 --> 16:48.640]  Mussolini was how great Stalin was our news in the 20s 30s 40s right up until
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.560]  1939 1940 it was at all Hitler is good we need to save the environment be
[16:54.560 --> 17:00.840]  vegetarians he was a rock star in the US just worshipped I mean that's on record
[17:00.840 --> 17:05.920]  you're supposed to forget that Stalin was Uncle Joe admired the Communist Party
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.480]  was the third biggest party in the US we were told how good Stalin was we were
[17:10.480 --> 17:16.880]  told and George Bernard Shaw and all the top liberals Nobel Prize winners
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.520]  Bertrand Russell would get up and say Mussolini Mussolini of course later they
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.360]  all flipped against him so it's oh Hitler oh Mussolini oh sweet cupcake just
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.360]  like the CIA now admits they helped put Mao into power in 49 and David Rockefeller
[17:31.360 --> 17:35.800]  has written multiple editorials praising Mao for what he did his great
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.080]  community of purpose and that he was an example to the world and I open up the
[17:40.080 --> 17:47.560]  January issue of 2010 this is just one I saw laying around a few weeks ago and
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.080]  picked up every issue you know the latest is the 7 billion bomb how our
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.040]  world will change they're telling us we're gonna have total tyranny to save
[17:56.040 --> 18:02.800]  us from that I have another one I guess it's been taken out of the room from a
[18:02.800 --> 18:09.240]  year ago where it's the Singapore model how great it is China is adopting it
[18:09.240 --> 18:14.320]  Europe is looking to adopt the it's horrible tyranny but it's like splitting
[18:14.320 --> 18:17.760]  your wrist and getting into a hot bath it feels so good that's an actual quote
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.240]  and it's just how sexy it is oh man they have the highest level of suicide
[18:23.240 --> 18:28.800]  they have they're only having 1.2 kids they're dying this is sexy this is as
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.760]  sexy as the case for killing granny and all the creamy fetishes in Newsweek and
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.760]  and Time magazine every time I read it it's all articles about suicide and they
[18:38.760 --> 18:43.440]  got shows on MTV about aborting babies and they're writing poetry about how
[18:43.440 --> 18:49.400]  beautiful and vampiric it is oh oh oh I mean and and so they're just hyping this
[18:49.400 --> 18:54.520]  group of fad-driven airheads out there that totally being overrun by China
[18:54.520 --> 18:59.840]  Chinese flags going up China lecturing us saying we own you now your dollars
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.720]  not gonna be the currency soon Obama bowing to him again yesterday bowing
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.960]  last year this is all done on purpose sticking hands down pants calling for
[19:09.960 --> 19:13.800]  tyranny because Jack Bauer torturing kids in front of their parents the
[19:13.800 --> 19:17.760]  washing post admitting the CIA tortures kids in front of their parents and
[19:17.760 --> 19:21.680]  having a CIA section chief in it bragging how cool it is and how
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.920]  effective it is and Rumsfeld joking about taking the gloves off they're just
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.320]  getting us into an evil culture the Romans wrote why they had the
[19:30.320 --> 19:33.560]  gladiatorial events it was to train people to see their neighbors being
[19:33.560 --> 19:37.720]  killed so that next month when they were being killed in the arena arrested for
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.600]  no reason their neighbors would share while they were killed see humans are
[19:41.600 --> 19:47.160]  peer pressure driven and so again just like the Aztecs it was fashionable and
[19:47.160 --> 19:50.960]  cool women were honored to give their baby to the government they just cut the
[19:50.960 --> 19:54.640]  baby's heart out right in front of mommy and mommy would just say praise quits

[24:28.720 --> 24:36.280]  overdrive back Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m. I am Alex Jones your host many days this
[24:36.280 --> 24:42.200]  happens but I can't think of a time in recent six months or so that I have been
[24:42.200 --> 24:50.600]  this upset at my core and also not feeling even worthy to bring you this
[24:50.600 --> 24:59.120]  information it's so big it's so powerful it's so real that to say that the
[24:59.120 --> 25:05.880]  communist Chinese now own the United States isn't even the tip of the iceberg
[25:05.880 --> 25:17.000]  it is worse than that it is all publicly on record that it's been planned but
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.840]  China is only one layer of this and so I want to go through what's happening
[25:21.840 --> 25:29.000]  currently and the ways that who Jin Tao has been publicly humiliating the United
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.240]  States at the pre-agreement with this criminal government and why this is
[25:37.240 --> 25:44.880]  being done it's very nuanced but to sum it up on record Mao Zedong was put into
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.800]  power by the CIA and British intelligence that's been released that's
[25:49.800 --> 25:54.080]  even on the history channel that's admitted they put him in power the
[25:54.080 --> 25:57.840]  road the Russians wanted to nuke in the late 60s that's now been declassified
[25:57.840 --> 26:01.800]  China they were worried about them they could do the prospectus and the
[26:01.800 --> 26:07.080]  actuary on their rising power they wanted to have a joint nuke on China the
[26:07.080 --> 26:12.920]  United States said no Russia was only confirming for itself that a secret
[26:12.920 --> 26:19.320]  behind the scenes deal had indeed been made and they were cross deals with
[26:19.320 --> 26:24.840]  Russia as well these are power groups working with each other but also fighting
[26:24.840 --> 26:27.840]  with each other but they believe in the power of the state they believe in the
[26:27.840 --> 26:35.800]  power of the collectivist they believe in transhumanist social Darwinistic
[26:35.800 --> 26:42.560]  eugenics and they've all signed on to the United Nations and they're attempting
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.040]  to use it as a global vehicle where all of them tie into it attempting to
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.720]  expand their geopolitical imperiums and the corporations that profit from this
[26:53.720 --> 27:00.120]  sit above China above the US above Russia and have vastly more wealth than
[27:00.120 --> 27:04.920]  the so-called debt the United States is reportedly a little over one trillion
[27:04.920 --> 27:10.560]  dollars in debt to the Chinese 28 trillion in just the first year and a
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.520]  half of the Banker bailout was paid to undisclosed offshore banks a lot of it
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.480]  China a lot of it EU a lot of it private banks brokerage firms governmental
[27:20.480 --> 27:28.080]  central banks when I talk about China and the EU 28 trillion on their
[27:28.080 --> 27:36.240]  investments with JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and others the six mega banks so
[27:36.240 --> 27:42.080]  we're told we have to be humiliated by China Obama is publicly bowing to who
[27:42.080 --> 27:49.360]  Gentile a dictator thug by any yardstick who runs the country who's got the
[27:49.360 --> 27:56.000]  biggest kill of human skulls around their neck of any country ever
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.800]  conservatively 60 mil under Mao alone I mean they have sports stadium
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.120]  executions every week in every city every major city has 14 mobile execution
[28:06.120 --> 28:11.160]  vans for petty crimes you are just executed and you are gutted on the way
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.440]  to the airport it's iced and flown into Japan where rich Europeans and
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.480]  Westerners and Chinese and Japanese get the goods follow on gong are their
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.160]  favorite fruit because they're peaceful they're non-resistant they are
[28:25.160 --> 28:30.800]  complete vegetarians and health nuts and so they are kept blood typed and a
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.840]  kept in jail cells and fed well for when their organs are to be sold this is
[28:35.840 --> 28:42.800]  all public there's so many facets how do I even begin here Harry Reid of course
[28:42.800 --> 28:45.880]  isn't a lot of trouble for calling who Gentile a dictator he actually got a
[28:45.880 --> 28:50.240]  slip of the tongue kind of like Dick Cheney three times Rumsfeld four times
[28:50.240 --> 28:57.320]  said a missile hit the Pentagon then they talked about a many times the shoot
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.880]  down a flight 93 which the state police saw the F-16s the missiles and they have
[29:01.880 --> 29:05.880]  the aim nine recordings of Nora they've been we even know what unit the happy

[29:18.080 --> 29:23.720]  of the general they've had an award ceremony for it of course I had Colonel
[29:23.720 --> 29:28.440]  Don de Grand Prix former black ops commander on to tell you that and he was
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.760]  dead two weeks later but we interview a lot of people that die the DC madam and
[29:32.760 --> 29:38.240]  others anyway so we'll be right back with that information I'm sorry I'm
[29:38.240 --> 29:42.480]  digressing we're gonna get into China in a big way you want the full deep
[29:42.480 --> 29:45.760]  understanding and scope and exactly what's coming in the future they have

[34:34.800 --> 34:41.280]  in World War two the United States was already promoting socialism towards
[34:41.280 --> 34:45.720]  communism in the United States deals were made with China
[34:45.720 --> 34:51.920]  Shanghai Shack was given faulty armaments the right wing in America said
[34:51.920 --> 34:58.000]  that it was all staged decades later it was declassified that Mao Zedong was
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.560]  put into power by our government but in the name of fighting the red Chinese
[35:02.560 --> 35:08.320]  threat and the Russian threat a police state apparatus was built witch hunts
[35:08.320 --> 35:13.480]  were expanded attacks on free speech federal control from behind the scenes
[35:13.480 --> 35:18.800]  under the guise of national security of Hollywood all of that got cemented into
[35:18.800 --> 35:25.360]  place now it's not that our owners the robber barons are really communist as
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.640]  Carol Quigley the Georgetown political science head Bill Clinton's main mentor
[35:29.640 --> 35:35.520]  wrote he was given access to the globalist what he called the British
[35:35.520 --> 35:41.920]  Roundtable committee documents for several years to write a thousand page
[35:41.920 --> 35:49.880]  tome for the planetary controllers so that they would have a couple thousand
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.280]  copies to give to high-level State Department CIA and others he published
[35:54.280 --> 36:01.000]  it on a limited run and it was a private publishing that was done and it was
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.640]  only several thousand copies printed and given to high-level gophers in
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.640]  government so they could understand how things really work and operate the
[36:09.640 --> 36:18.520]  plates of course were surreptitiously smuggled and it was reprinted brazenly
[36:18.520 --> 36:25.960]  by patriots in the 1970s and I loaned it to a newspaper reporter about two years
[36:25.960 --> 36:30.520]  ago and he never gave it back in fact I want Aaron Dykes if you have to go over
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.040]  to that guy's house and know he lives there in Austin I want my 10 books or
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.600]  so we've loaned them back side issue let's let's just order another one online
[36:38.600 --> 36:41.680]  if you're like 50 bucks though it's a big hardcover the one I have is actually
[36:41.680 --> 36:50.400]  an original but original reprinting from the 70s it's thousands of dollars for
[36:50.400 --> 36:54.240]  one of the original think it's 2000 but see that's the problem with history I
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.520]  say I'm gonna give you to tell I'm gonna break this down this is all facts this
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.480]  is all massive knowledge proving everything I'm saying so I don't want to
[37:01.480 --> 37:04.640]  just make statements here about what China is doing and where we're going in
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.160]  the future the point is quickly said we use communism we use fascism we use
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.120]  socialism anything that collectivizes the general public to get control of them
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.160]  and then we'll use a fascist leader a dictator a communist leader socialism we
[37:18.160 --> 37:24.040]  don't care we want power centralized in very few hands so we can move towards
[37:24.040 --> 37:29.560]  this global corporate state where there will be no freedom and he went on to say
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.000]  I believe humans want to live in tyranny this is our natural state this is a good
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.280]  thing he also published publicly the Anglo-American establishment and bragged
[37:42.280 --> 37:49.760]  about that kind of a public book but watered down a bit and that's only I
[37:49.760 --> 37:55.240]  think 300 pages long I've read that about 15 years old but haven't read it
[37:55.240 --> 38:01.880]  since like I was the first book of Carol quickly I read but the plan was
[38:01.880 --> 38:11.880]  always to build up China to menace Russia while the United States was used to
[38:11.880 --> 38:16.640]  fund Russia and give it armaments and secrets and Ford and GM and all of them
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.520]  huge factories building army trucks and you know US engineers helping build the
[38:21.520 --> 38:25.400]  Russians nuclear reactors you're giving them the a bombs and then killing the
[38:25.400 --> 38:30.120]  Rosenbergs as Patsy's because again you if you look at this as Russians or
[38:30.120 --> 38:35.640]  Chinese or Americans you're blind this is the global banking cartel who funded
[38:35.640 --> 38:39.360]  both sides in World War one who funded all the sides in World War two who
[38:39.360 --> 38:47.280]  going back more than 300 years in Europe in those endless wars was constantly
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.080]  funding all the different armies all the different sides and they don't care
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.720]  they always got paid and governments would crack down the public the public
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.560]  would tend to roll over and let them take their land and let them tax them
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.760]  into poverty if after all it was a war if after all their firstborn son didn't
[39:05.760 --> 39:10.200]  come back from the front you bet they were willing to starve to death and have
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.720]  their other younger kids with their their ribs sticking out because junior got
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.440]  killed fighting Napoleon or vice versa
[39:21.680 --> 39:26.160]  meanwhile Napoleon was publicly being funded by the Rothschilds and other
[39:26.160 --> 39:30.640]  major banking houses and so were the Brits there was the Rothschild family in
[39:30.640 --> 39:34.840]  France funding Napoleon on record and when Napoleon took over the first time
[39:34.840 --> 39:40.360]  they got more land than his new royal house he set up God that's why almost
[39:40.360 --> 39:49.320]  all the good vineyards in France now are Rothschild I mean just like the big
[39:49.320 --> 39:56.200]  banks now of the 600 plus islands off Greece worth billions of peace private
[39:56.200 --> 39:59.800]  bankers are getting their own individual islands that's how Greece is paying them
[39:59.800 --> 40:05.440]  and the bankers sold Greece the derivatives and made the profit and
[40:05.440 --> 40:09.400]  now we're saying oh you can't pay this other stuff back here give me your
[40:09.400 --> 40:18.560]  islands I mean this is carpet bagging on a scale that makes the mind spin you know
[40:18.560 --> 40:22.880]  what carpet bagging was the south was completely wasted burned destroyed by
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.120]  Sherman and there's just starving people all the place and here comes people
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.640]  with money with their big carpet bags buying everything up for pennies on the
[40:32.640 --> 40:40.240]  dollar that's what carpet bagging is the globalist are wreckers you go back to
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.720]  every culture and at key straits around the world they would build fires and
[40:45.720 --> 40:51.560]  foggy bad weather to confuse ships and think that they were lighthouses to
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.040]  bring them into port to wreck them on shoals so that they could then under
[40:56.040 --> 41:01.520]  laws that all those countries England France aboriginal systems have the same
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.800]  laws that well if a ship's wrecked it's not stealing its fair game whoever can
[41:05.800 --> 41:10.480]  salvage it and if a ship runs into rocks quarter mile out to sea it's freezing
[41:10.480 --> 41:14.880]  cold almost everybody's gonna die then you go out that when the fog clears and
[41:14.880 --> 41:20.360]  get all the goods out of the wreck ship that's what corporate rating is they go
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.480]  in take control of a company they're never gonna pay the stockholders they
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.480]  just sell everything off and then bankrupt it and keep the profit for
[41:28.480 --> 41:33.680]  themselves that's what the new order is and then your homeless show you can't
[41:33.680 --> 41:38.560]  stand up to them they they they don't just not care if you become homeless or
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.600]  if you lose your job or you lose your farm or your self-sufficiency they don't
[41:42.600 --> 41:46.800]  want you to have it and a lot of folks are saying where does China come into
[41:46.800 --> 41:54.480]  this oh it's it's going to come into it so it is on record that our government
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.120]  set China up from the beginning and a hundred years before that China was
[41:59.120 --> 42:04.640]  divided into 12 parts and the US had its own sector China's already been run by
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.640]  the West for hundreds and hundreds of years how'd they do it drug trade the
[42:08.640 --> 42:18.480]  Chinese made heroin illegal opium illegal and they just came right in and
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.200]  they bought off all the police and the military and the population because the
[42:23.200 --> 42:27.160]  Chinese made it illegal it made there be huge profits and that's how British and
[42:27.160 --> 42:31.520]  US Intel the Germans got their piece the French got their piece the French
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.680]  ran to Vietnam because they had to get that opium out of there and out of
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.200]  Laos and out of Cambodia and sell it up to the Chinese and that was a way to
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.160]  control them I mean you think all these Prozac ads all these beer ads all these
[42:44.160 --> 42:54.080]  drug ads are an accident they figured all this out a long time ago so China's
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.280]  been New World Order run for several hundred years the Japanese got too big
[42:59.280 --> 43:04.160]  for their britches the government's all act the same doesn't matter if it's our
[43:04.160 --> 43:07.840]  government Ahmed Denigie doesn't matter if it's the Japanese it was
[43:07.840 --> 43:15.320]  avarice filled dominating men of power who are ruthless and who enjoy war and
[43:15.320 --> 43:21.720]  destruction and in control they rise to the top as all philosophers have noted
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.200]  throughout history because good men lay down to them good men are more
[43:25.200 --> 43:34.560]  intelligent stronger better everything but but we are have a blind spot we can't
[43:34.560 --> 43:38.760]  believe it's happening to us we can't believe other people are like that we
[43:38.760 --> 43:42.720]  want to buy into the fake little narratives of the people you know
[43:42.720 --> 43:46.680]  seeing the star-spangled banner while the flag still waves at a football game and
[43:46.680 --> 43:52.800]  all the guys crying there with their son meanwhile what America was and what that
[43:52.800 --> 43:56.800]  flag symbolizes all the blood that went into it a great idea the most noble in
[43:56.800 --> 44:04.560]  our history has been destroyed but you don't care you just want the symbol you
[44:04.560 --> 44:10.400]  want the symbol above the substance if I could have the liberty back and if the
[44:10.400 --> 44:14.160]  people could awaken from their slumber and their trance I I would rather have
[44:14.160 --> 44:20.160]  freedom in this country than that flag the only reason the flag has any positive
[44:20.160 --> 44:25.920]  meaning is because it symbolized the spirit of 1776 which the system has
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.320]  tried to defile and pull down and demonize because it wasn't perfect but
[44:30.320 --> 44:36.880]  it's the best it's ever been now this China situation China has been set up
[44:36.880 --> 44:43.680]  China has been deployed China has been built up with tariffs and taxes and
[44:43.680 --> 44:50.800]  regulations and carbon taxes and and and and all these other fines and fees and
[44:50.800 --> 44:56.320]  controls on our industries on our power plants the environmental rules the
[44:56.320 --> 45:00.320]  workers comp all of it and a lot of it is you know great on the surface but
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.480]  China and India and Mexico and 160 plus other third world countries are
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.760]  completely exempt from this global government the global government is
[45:09.760 --> 45:13.840]  run by the big mega banks and mega corporations and retail corporations
[45:13.840 --> 45:18.880]  that are their subsidiaries who openly write the international rules so they
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.800]  write the rules where it's hard to have a job here in the US it's hard to
[45:22.800 --> 45:27.040]  develop anything they big ag repat tries to pass more rules to shut down farms
[45:27.040 --> 45:30.640]  and ranches to make it nearly impossible to even provide our own food
[45:30.640 --> 45:35.040]  once the bread basket of the world now can't even supply our own food in many
[45:35.040 --> 45:40.800]  cases we're being brought down we're being made dependent we're being put
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.760]  under siege how do you make a city fall a nation full you put it under siege you
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.040]  cut its food and water off you cut its intellect its will to fight off this is
[45:50.040 --> 45:54.760]  all psychological warfare by the globalist who play the US off against
[45:54.760 --> 46:00.920]  Russia Russia off against China China off against Japan China off against South
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.360]  Korea South Korea off against North Korea the US off against China it's all
[46:06.360 --> 46:11.920]  back and forth while the bankers set up above it they've stolen more than 50
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.640]  trillion total globally and that's again an old number 28 trillion in the US
[46:16.640 --> 46:22.360]  disappeared won't say where it is but we're told on CNN in the AP all over the
[46:22.360 --> 46:28.200]  news yes it's China America's done China is the boss China is great China is the
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.000]  model China knows best it's not father knows best it's China knows best we've
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.600]  got a leaderless fatherless country we've got a a childlike nation of dumb
[46:39.600 --> 46:42.840]  down people who've been taught to being weak as cool and then you've got a
[46:42.840 --> 46:46.840]  giant mechanized slave country and I know a lot of folks that have lived in
[46:46.840 --> 46:51.680]  China and been there I mean the police will just cut your testicles off in the
[46:51.680 --> 46:54.840]  middle of the street for fun and you'll routinely just see people on the street
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.440]  corner with their pants pulled off and police walking by laughing with their
[46:58.440 --> 47:04.560]  genitals cut off I mean it is we were sent video about by a god has done
[47:04.560 --> 47:07.620]  graphics for us because his girlfriend's Chinese he stayed a few months over
[47:07.620 --> 47:13.320]  there of youth brigades marching with in the middle of cities just with red
[47:13.320 --> 47:19.800]  flags and I mean it is creepy troops marching total telescreens with troops
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.560]  announcing China's taking over we're gonna get the US their top generals are
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.960]  in the news every day saying we're preparing for war the US is our enemy
[47:28.960 --> 47:35.840]  meanwhile our media is oh China is so good by the way I'm not joking about
[47:35.840 --> 47:44.040]  that the police it's just a rain of terror over there they Paul Watson's
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.480]  wife is Chinese you know she speaks perfect English and lived in England
[47:48.480 --> 47:55.200]  her life the point is she's Chinese she has family in China he was over there
[47:55.200 --> 47:59.200]  with her and they just wrote an article about the Rand Corporation wanting to
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.360]  have war with China in the future and her family and people got questioned and
[48:04.360 --> 48:08.640]  that she got put on a list and was told you better not write for prison planet
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.760]  calm anymore that's the authoritarianism of China reaching into England reaching
[48:14.760 --> 48:20.600]  into prison planet calm reaching into my free speech and now oh Harry Reid better
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.720]  not call who Jen Tao a dictator when that's what he is he is a dictator he's
[48:25.720 --> 48:34.640]  elected by a committee of dictators so it's a dictatorship of the inner party
[48:34.640 --> 48:40.320]  and man you see films of their party conferences what a group of preening
[48:40.320 --> 48:47.480]  sycophantic devils it's not about their art their literature their inventions
[48:47.480 --> 48:52.600]  what they've done it's all that their grandparents were murderers with Mao
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.120]  Seitung and knew how to sycophantically lick his boots China is a giant North
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.560]  Korea that that the elites in the West openly saw and went and funded and
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.520]  empowered and tilted the playing field to give China everything and then when
[49:08.520 --> 49:12.600]  Americans point out how we've been deindustrialized we're told shut up fat
[49:12.600 --> 49:15.520]  dumb Americans it's your fault this has happened really if you read NAFTA and
[49:15.520 --> 49:23.760]  get have you read the WTO rules on taxes China's much lower environmental
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.920]  regulations there are nine the rivers literally catch on fire routinely
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.360]  carbon taxes harassment of power plants they built two to three a week we built
[49:33.360 --> 49:41.200]  two a year zero everything tilted for them they had to put nets up at all
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.320]  their major factories that make the apple goods and others because they were
[49:44.320 --> 49:49.720]  having suicides every lunch hour the people are chained to their systems
[49:49.720 --> 49:54.920]  around a third of the population lives in giant public prisons that are locked
[49:54.920 --> 49:58.400]  at night you're locked in your house locked in your neighborhood your
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.280]  children are taken at birth and trained and brainwashed and turned against you
[50:02.280 --> 50:14.000]  then they are sent to work half the week at factories 10 11 12 13 year olds
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.880]  what's our government's answer more regulations more taxes more carbon
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.720]  taxes now what's gonna happen with China it isn't that Americans are dumb
[50:23.720 --> 50:28.400]  idiots and by the Chinese slave goods that break by the time you get out of
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.760]  the box half the time that are covered and dripping with every poison you can
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.000]  imagine and the melamine filled milk of the poison drugs the prescription drugs
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.680]  it's that you go to a store and 95% of it is made in China oh yeah people were
[50:42.680 --> 50:50.240]  dumb 30 years ago buying Chinese goods but now see we're held by the throat the

[52:12.240 --> 52:16.520]  from underneath the Americans at home I've turned a tremendous influence on our
[52:16.520 --> 52:20.760]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's

[52:39.200 --> 52:42.760]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like

[54:34.320 --> 54:42.880]  in-game.com you constantly see you know the the head of space you know NASA
[54:42.880 --> 54:46.560]  Goddard Center saying we need to be like the Chinese we need a global tyranny
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.560]  you see all these other professors constantly saying we need the Chinese
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.880]  model we need to sterilize people we need a one-child policy Ted Turner a
[54:54.880 --> 55:00.160]  month ago in Mexico China use the model officially they have UN meetings there
[55:00.160 --> 55:04.480]  like the one in 96 the UN food program and they said we will use food as a
[55:04.480 --> 55:07.960]  weapon as chairman Mao did in the Great Leap Forward in the Cultural
[55:07.960 --> 55:14.600]  Revolution. I mean the Chinese have been chosen as the drone rock stars of the
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.600]  New World Order they are the army and the Chinese people aren't bad but they've
[55:19.600 --> 55:23.840]  got a five thousand year history of being enslaved and being killed and
[55:23.840 --> 55:27.360]  being tortured to death so they don't do what they're told and there's so many
[55:27.360 --> 55:32.200]  facets to this we have our media we have our culture now with almost no
[55:32.200 --> 55:37.200]  criticism ever of China just five ten years ago they criticized China killing
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.320]  people for organs and their secret arrest and things and now it's just oh
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.920]  China is wonderful and the Associated Press says well it is true they own our
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.120]  debt they're kind of like our landlord now I have the quotes here they're in
[55:50.120 --> 55:54.160]  Paul Watson's article today now there's two articles actually meet the new boss
[55:54.160 --> 55:58.400]  China owns the United States that's prisonplanet.com by Alex Jones and Paul
[55:58.400 --> 56:07.440]  Watson here's a curtain emote China plants flag on Constitution Avenue now on
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.440]  paper the Chinese quote own the majority of the debt but remember that's one
[56:12.440 --> 56:19.960]  trillion a hundred billion or so where the 28 trillion go that's 27 times or
[56:19.960 --> 56:27.320]  28 times what the Chinese supposedly own this is all just about if breaking our
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.560]  will if the TSA can put their hands down our pants if we can see Chinese flags
[56:31.560 --> 56:35.800]  not done for the British not done for the Russians not done for the Chileans
[56:35.800 --> 56:41.720]  not done for anybody I mean they put red Chinese dipped in blood flags you know
[56:41.720 --> 56:47.880]  blood red yellow star that banners got more dead under it than Hitler installing
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.360]  combined they put that up up and down the street and now Harry Reid is in the
[56:52.360 --> 56:58.520]  New York Daily News being escoriated and they lit up the the Empire State's
[56:58.520 --> 57:03.920]  building for China you know for their Fourth of July for their national day
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.400]  all of Times Square has been turned into a pro Chinese government event
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.360]  they're opening restaurants all over Europe in the US called mouths and I
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.800]  see kids everywhere wearing red stars oh yeah oh it's fun it's fun to be a
[57:19.800 --> 57:24.760]  slave and then I think about national organizations out there remember a few
[57:24.760 --> 57:32.680]  months ago a group against the national deficit ran a minute-long TV ad where a
[57:32.680 --> 57:38.120]  Chinese president a citizens against government waste with the Chinese
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.040]  government is is up there bragging to a group of college students about how
[57:43.040 --> 57:47.760]  America fell by being in debt to China and how they bought cheap goods and how
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.960]  they had too high a taxes and regulation that's actually what China teaches and
[57:52.960 --> 57:57.000]  he then brags that's why we took over America that's why we own America we
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.320]  have links to news articles in China to TV pieces where the Chinese government
[58:02.320 --> 58:07.400]  is actually pridefully speaking about how we are their enemy but they own us and
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.840]  we're pathetic and we're decadent and we're bad and our own media is agreeing
[58:11.840 --> 58:17.560]  again this is about just totally getting us ready to accept anything and
[58:17.560 --> 58:21.760]  everything so I want to come back and go through all the news on this and what
[58:21.760 --> 58:26.760]  this means and what it means to have Obama bowing to him in fact we'll show
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.640]  you that again on screen as we go out to break but I want to tell you the master
[58:30.640 --> 58:35.080]  plan where all of this is leading where it's gonna go then I got another report
[58:35.080 --> 58:40.000]  here a man died from breathing fluoride got a lot more coming up
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.920]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a
[58:44.920 --> 58:52.040]  decade we are the GCN radio network hey this is Alex Jones with five good
[58:52.040 --> 58:56.040]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[58:56.040 --> 58:59.840]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[58:59.840 --> 59:03.920]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:03.920 --> 59:08.000]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.360]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[59:12.360 --> 59:15.840]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.840 --> 59:19.600]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.600 --> 59:23.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.520 --> 59:34.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.240 --> 59:40.240]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.240 --> 59:44.880]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[59:51.640 --> 01:00:00.840]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:25.800]  Alex Jones coming up in the next segment I'm gonna get back into China in
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.000]  great detail and then later in the broadcast we had Lindsey Williams joining
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.760]  us with new bombshell information we are live it is the 19th day on this
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:42.080]  Wednesday 2011 19th day of January man dies after house fumigated with same
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:49.680]  fluoride compound sprayed on food and Paul Watson and I along with Steve Watson
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:55.600]  did deep research on this in the last few years and this is the same fumigation
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:02.000]  system sprayed on already harvested crops it's sprayed on wheat it's sprayed on
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.200]  corn it's sprayed on tomatoes it's sprayed on grapes in the warehouses to
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:14.000]  keep the weevils and stink bugs and all the rest of the past it was authorized
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.080]  what six years ago to be sprayed on the crops they also have a liquid spray they
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:27.640]  spray on of another variant of sodium fluoride but man dies after house
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.440]  fumigated with same fluoride compound sprayed on food I was looking at my
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.080]  fluoride video that I did last week that I do want to get Watson to add to the
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:45.640]  article he's written because it's it's a ten minute video and it really shows
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.200]  how the government is now having to admit that sodium fluoride is hurting
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.840]  people in the drinking water remember that came out the Associated Press two
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.760]  weeks ago a government press release so they're trying to start covering their
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.400]  rear ends kind of like for 20 years they denied that Prozac was causing massive
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.080]  suicides but to cover their hind in they started putting a little proviso on the
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.640]  insert hoping you don't read it oh yeah this stuff and you know folks I say a
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.400]  doubling in cancer overall when you drink one part per million sodium fluoride
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.960]  for more than ten years that's one of the big studies actually it's a tripling
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.680]  in the general public if you've average men and women together it is a seven
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:28.400]  fold increase in the US government's own studies in bone cancer in adolescence
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.920]  and and I don't know how three times in women and then you average it with men
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.920]  how it would be well point is he's got all the links to the major studies and
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.800]  all of it in that video and so I was looking at that video up on YouTube this
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.600]  morning just briefly checking it you know because I just love seeing hundreds
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.560]  of thousands see something that's gonna warn people and it only had like 50,000
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.680]  views on it and then I was reading the first comment and it said yeah I was
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.520]  watching local news here in San Jose and it said that a man broke into a house
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.240]  that had the tents up around it where they you know fumigate the house for
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:16.320]  bed bugs or roaches and I noticed that the sign said fluoride danger don't go
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.880]  in fluoride sure enough I went and found the newscast and it said fluoride and
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:28.720]  it's a type of aerosolized fluoride that is used on the crops that you eat again
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.400]  they have one they spray in the field that's in a water that goes on to it and
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.040]  if the bugs try to eat it they die of course you eat it but no big deal you're
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.360]  bigger than a bug you know you'll die a few years down the road it's not gonna
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.680]  really be noticed that way yeah well I like MSNBC said you know it's you know
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.160]  led the toys from China it's good for you you think I'm joking I can play that
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.840]  clip I you think I'm joking I have clips saying mercury's now good for your
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.080]  children injected into their blood again it's all about breaking your will just
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.480]  being out in the open yeah the CIA tortures kids in front of their parents
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.680]  yeah we're putting poison in your food but man dies at her house fumigated with
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.360]  same fluoride compound sprayed on food known insecticide toxin was approved
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.560]  for use on fruits nuts sold to Americans but what kind of nut goes up to a
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.960]  house that has danger signs all over it and looks like it has a funhouse tent
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.000]  over it and of course then it you've got to ask yourself I read about this in
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.600]  New York where they use this fluoride as the main chemical they use on cars that
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.440]  have bed bugs or out of control roaches and they use it even on apartments
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.560]  they'll do it in an apartment below you and supposedly seal the doors and windows
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.200]  you know full well it's going up into your apartment or down into your apartment
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:47.160]  just like when your neighbor's smoking cigarettes you could smell it I shouldn't
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:52.440]  laugh the guy went in and was just killed very fast but hey I bet he's got
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.440]  clean teeth huh actually they admit it causes the teeth to fracture and dental

[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:20.000]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.680]  alex jones
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.440]  China is the dominant engine of the world government it is collectivist their
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:39.320]  leaders are bloodthirsty eugenicists who are anti-family anti-Christianity they
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:45.080]  are embraced by the eugenicist elites out of England the United States and
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:49.520]  Europe they if you go back 30 years ago the council on farm relations said the
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.920]  21st century with the Chinese century we will be deindustrialized we'll have a
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.120]  currency war which will really be a currency devaluation then we'll come
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.360]  out with a global bandcore they also called it the phoenix and now the imf
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.200]  last year officially announced they want the bandcore that will be partially
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.040]  backed by gold issued by the private central banks and also partially backed
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.920]  by the Chinese currency and we would cover this 15 years ago on air and
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.000]  people would laugh at us oh China they could know this is the most important
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.560]  point I'm coming to it now China they can never take over America China they
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:38.320]  can't do anything to us China has no power why we got 20,000 nukes you know
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.480]  the Chinese they can't even get a rocket into space right and so Bill
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.200]  Clinton and Laurel and Hughes give them the ICBM technologies to get their long
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.400]  march into orbit and be able to hit anywhere in the US but that's not
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.600]  enough to get one ICBM up with only one warhead that'll only destroy Chicago
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.120]  or Dallas or Los Angeles you've got to have it when it pops open it's got to
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:05.920]  have Merv it's launched from its launch pads in northern China up over the polls
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.040]  that's the shortest route it's coming down over Chicago or New York back into
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:17.400]  the atmosphere the nose comb blows off and there are 12 to 24 warheads but you
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:22.680]  want some dummies too so that any ground-based lasers or missile-to-missile
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.240]  systems or rail gun anti-missile systems who those are highly classified
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:34.160]  that'll get the NSA humming right there if they're trying to shoot down the the
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.000]  warheads not gonna be able to get them all okay so they give them everything oh
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.680]  we'll put more taxes more regulations more environmental stuff on the US China
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.480]  you get none of it then we have all our politicians lecturing us you need to be
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.280]  more like China the head of the Goddard Space Center yesterday the America's
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.360]  going down we don't accept carbon taxes China's smart they're authoritarian
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.360]  China's exempt he knows that they're giving us a false narrative of why
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.160]  we're about to collapse we're being told that that oh anything a cyber attack
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.600]  could collapse the whole economy and cause bank runs and a shutdown of the
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.240]  currency anytime now and 9,000 telescreens are going in now announcing
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.160]  the cyber attacks coming get ready the whole web could be shut down homeland
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.880]  security's trying to keep it safe see they're getting everybody ready for this
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:29.440]  to happen and then there'll be pipe bomb attacks all over the country blamed on
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.960]  domestic groups as they're collapsing it so that anyone saying no to the collapse
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.960]  of the US under the corporate global government backed up by their attack dog
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:43.360]  the murderous all-time killer Chinese the record killers no one Hitler stall and
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:47.800]  combined could not touch them and now our media they're good there are leader
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.800]  their moral just all these leaders constantly Ted Turner just on and on
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:58.040]  praising China praising I got a giant stack of news here today praising China
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.680]  just how they are so wonderful and I've talked to a lot of friends and family
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:08.480]  that have been there China is hellish and the cops are just completely arrogant
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:13.000]  walk around like ring rates just beat or kill whoever they want it is just lawless
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.880]  evil but I run into businessmen all the time that are in business with China and
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.960]  I'll be sitting there just a few weeks ago to get some Mexican food and I go
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.840]  to the bar to pick it up my wife says hey I don't want to cook to put food up
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.840]  I'm coming home at 530 I go sure I go in to get the food I'm waiting at the bar
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.280]  and there's a guy going yeah looks I've seen your show do you know how great
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.680]  China is you know how wonderful how they get things done America's pathetic they
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.080]  get a problem with an executive there they just execute them in a week that's
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.960]  how we need to be soon and I didn't even argue with a guy I didn't say oh
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.000]  really that's why their lakes catch on fire and their rivers oh that's why the
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.800]  Communist Party so filthy rich and they keep the people down and forcibly
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.920]  sterilize the women oh that's really beautiful but see it's the sycophantic
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.680]  thing as long as you go over and grovel to the Chinese Communist then oh you're
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.720]  all part of the sickness of it same thing in the 30s when Hitler was a rock
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.960]  star in the US my grandfather grew up in Dallas and the Dallas radio stations
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:20.560]  would play Hitler speeches and say how great he was with English over it that
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:28.960]  covering time magazine just he is a lot you know life books Stalin's great
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.440]  Mussolini's great there's this love affair and of course it's not that the
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.280]  elites are stupid and got fooled by Hitler they were building him up to
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.600]  destroy him and that could be the case with China this is very sophisticated
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.120]  here but if you think of it as America against China or America against Russia
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.600]  or Russia against China or Russia against the US or vice versa that is in
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.400]  two-dimensional like playing checkers this is an advanced game of chess this
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:00.760]  is geopolitical strategy where you've got the globalist the robber barons the
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:07.080]  banks that sit above the two-dimensional players of China Russia and the
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.000]  United States all deeply in debt all their infrastructures financed through
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  fraud by the banksters the banksters wealth is in the quadrillions of
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.280]  fraudulent made-up digits and their entire global police state is about
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.440]  forcing you to accept those quadrillions as legitimate their mega Ponzi scheme
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.840]  their pyramid of total pyramids you understand that they know exactly what
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.040]  they're doing and so it's a balancing act through the UN through the IMF
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.920]  through the World Bank through all these regional boards where they're always
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.480]  jockeying with each other playing the nations off against each other the race
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.200]  to the bottom the destruction of the middle class the destruction of the
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.200]  infrastructure always competing with the authoritarian China who takes their
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.600]  ten-year-olds and puts them in slave factories they're now openly saying they
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.000]  may drug the water supply in China to stop the epidemic of suicide see it's
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.640]  not that the society sick it's that you're sick because you don't like
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:16.160]  working 18 hours a day in in in fumes in the iPad factory so that our kids can
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.000]  be in the matrix not communicating with friends and family just staring into
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.840]  their iPad or their iPhone not saying an iPhone or iPad is evil of itself how
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.560]  it's being built as evil what it's doing to us what we're allowing to happen is
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.380]  evil now there's also a war on being able to recognize evil they tell us
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:38.000]  there is no evil let the government do whatever it wants but then it moralizes
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.360]  to you all day about how you should feel guilty and give up your rights so
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.800]  that's the key to understanding this China we're being told as the owner of
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.640]  America we're seeing the Chinese flags the AP says that's to let American
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.080]  suspicious of China know they shouldn't be suspicious no it's meant to throw it
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.960]  in our face it's meant to get us ready for more outrageous we're being drug
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.520]  through the mud we're being conditioned to accept all of this that's what
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.560]  Richard Nixon was about that's what Bill Clinton was about that's why all of it
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:19.200]  came out that he was doing all these things with cigars and lying and raping
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.280]  women and selling things out to communist Chinese and murdering Ron Brown and
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.360]  blowing up Oklahoma City it's meant to just get you to where you totally just
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.720]  accept that they do that and they get away with that just like the TSA is
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.240]  going to put their hands down your pants to train you and now it's in the news
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.840]  that even if you refuse the naked body scanners they make you walk through them
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:44.640]  though see it's just that little act of submission okay I'll arrest you if you
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.560]  don't do exactly as I say you're allowed to opt out just a regulation all made up
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.560]  but I want you to go ahead and walk through anyways in front of the people
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.280]  and they admit that's the condition everybody else watching that it's safe
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.720]  they don't want to see a nut one of the sheep not going into the slaughter pin
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.360]  even if you're not gonna slaughter that Judas goat you know the goat that leads
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.600]  in the other sheep and but then goes out on the other side they're making you
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.440]  become a Judas goat it's all animal psychology the minute you use your higher
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.320]  order thinking the minute you start scanning their scams the minute you
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.080]  start analyzing what they're doing the minute you decide to not just receive
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:35.240]  it like a chump it's all over but it's up to you so here we are and they're
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:39.640]  humiliating us with these announcements about China runs our country and they're
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.360]  overrunning the nation and in filling all the new people that are brought into
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.640]  the country that could be helpful parts of the nation to empower the country
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.360]  with their own nationalism to hate the United States so they can vulcanize us
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.560]  and all control us and it's that same strategy globally the global government
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.240]  is a global corporate empire that has all the wealth and then now they're
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:09.240]  basically scapegoating China as our owner and but they're scapegoating them
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.400]  by saying how powerful they are by saying how great they are by saying they
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.320]  run America remember how they did that in the 80s with the Japanese and
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.920]  Americans were all upset the Japanese are buying up America the Japanese done
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.040]  goddess that the Japanese were being taken over by the central banks the
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.400]  central banks were the ones doing it and they got Japan suckered in to the fast
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:38.440]  money and so that incredibly productive country has been in a 15-year depression
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:46.520]  and is never coming out of it that's the same thing China is a horrible hellhole
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:51.640]  and by the globalist praising it and giving it pride in China that makes the
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.040]  people not rebel against their government the good people of China who
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.440]  have been rebelling with pickaxes and hose and shovels and beating the police
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.080]  and military in provinces all over the country I've seen the videos on YouTube
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.400]  that are snatched down quickly of just farmers who are sick of having their
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.880]  family land taken who were starving to death just run in with hose and attack
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:14.200]  and police who then start shooting them and then you just see the farmers
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.520]  overrun everyone and then the tape cuts out and our government don't pull that
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.800]  off YouTube don't people see that that'll embarrass our Chinese friends so
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.280]  this is meant to make the American people hate the Chinese people the Chinese
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.880]  media is always demonizing the US that's what they have their people hate us
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.040]  while it's just the corrupt bloodthirsty elite of China with the corrupt
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.880]  bloodthirsty elite of America and Europe and the UN they're all teamed up
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.080]  building this global government that's designed to actually cull out most of
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:47.280]  the population because we're not just cheap life isn't just cheap it's seen
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:53.000]  as negative so the big issue here is that the global government is a
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.840]  corporate fraud government that sits above all the countries and they're
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:02.280]  playing us off against each other the right back is it really possible to get

[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.240]  investing firms I get it you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.040]  government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.960]  dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you that's
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.120]  not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.000]  wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.480]  retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.520]  buy gold or the realist there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.200]  with gold since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen

[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.280]  power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.280]  oppressive world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.760]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system global
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.880]  governance with the establishment of a G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling

[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.240]  one hundred million population India is now over one billion both countries are
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.920]  firmly under globalist control and they will just play the nations off against
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:34.200]  each other and will export Chinese authoritarianism worldwide you know it
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.920]  just came out yesterday that China is now giving more money to the third world
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:43.440]  than the IMF every year and when you hear about the IMF that means our money
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.800]  they take our money that we back up with taxpayers and the private bankers
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.480]  openly go in and say here's the money now you got to spend it with this private
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.720]  company that's on record that's all been leaked the BBC's covered it and it was
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.520]  IMF World Bank loans that started China and now Americans buying cheap Chinese
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:06.280]  slave goods have financed what's happened and like a deal like a dealer and
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.360]  that's what China is selling us crack the American people cannot stop buying the
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.760]  Chinese slave goods they have sold their liberty their freedom their future
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.960]  they've deindustrialized us in the name of the Xbox in the name of connect that
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.760]  face scans you and tracks everything you do in your house and has a microphone and
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.360]  a camera that watches you in your home and the government admittedly is dialing
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.200]  in to these systems and watching you and the on-star I mean and selling us that
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.520]  authoritarianism is good there's this conversion into tyranny happening and
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.080]  China is there to lead the way and when they quote give countries you know who
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.440]  minds the majority of the minerals rare earth minerals now out of Australia
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.240]  it's not even the British government it's the Chinese and the Australians are
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.720]  freaking out I mean the Chinese are coming in taken over almost every
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.840]  mining city and they're demanding stakes in the you know in the domestic
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.960]  minerals themselves and actually taking the country over and they control over
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.880]  90% of rare earth minerals that go into all the gadgets as well they have a
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.080]  strategic plan because they're the collectivist model and where does David
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:17.400]  Rockefeller spend a lot of time who was involved in creating the system David
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:23.000]  Rockefeller who admittedly set up the modern UN as we know it that's how
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.440]  powerful these people are and so they're going to use China to muscle out what's
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:33.040]  left of Western industry and everything else and force that giant sucking sound
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.160]  that complete implosion of the economy that will render us subservient and
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.040]  dependent on them but we must not hate the Chinese people they are fighting back
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:47.640]  they want freedom you know our media back in Tiananmen Square halfway praised
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.680]  them today they're decried the Dalai Lama has kicked out the back of the White
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.520]  House he's called a feudal dictator by the news and he's certainly not perfect
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.080]  but compared to the you know Chinese Communists I mean they did take over to
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.480]  bet they do force Tibetan women to marry Chinese males of course they're all
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.080]  Asian but the point is forcing you to marry ending the culture the globalist
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:16.840]  want to end all cultures there again they sell the communist Chinese murderers
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.400]  like their rock stars and that's what this is about but it'll also create at a
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.320]  subconscious level envy Americans love thinking they're number one they're
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.240]  real into that when America that was has been dead a long time I'm trying to
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.160]  resurrect it we could do it with your help so it's having the other effect of
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.400]  people calling for more defense spending and feeling incredibly threatened
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.640]  which is what the Rothschilds would always do they'd sell one arm into the
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.680]  Austrians and then the French had to have the better one and then the
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.720]  Austrians had to have the better then the British had to have and always one
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.040]  upping each other so this is the perfect way to enrage Americans coming out and
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.480]  saying China owns America and putting Chinese flags up everywhere in Washington
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.600]  now let's go to this clip put out by citizens against government waste that
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.760]  was banned on history channel ABC Discovery Channel and dozens of other
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.440]  channels this is not allowed to air in America because you can't be critical of
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.800]  our new owners who themselves are owned by the bankers that make them look like
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:21.600]  poppers here's the clip of the Chinese professor Beijing China 20 30 why do
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:31.320]  great nations fail the ancient Greeks a Roman Empire British Empire and the
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:37.440]  United States of America all make the same mistake turning their backs on the
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:44.880]  principles that made them great America trying to spend in tax itself out of a
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:52.240]  great recession huge enormous so-called stimulus spending massive changes to
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.840]  health care government takeovers of private industries and crushing debt
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:07.880]  of course we own most of their debt so now they work for us and that is
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.960]  actually what is taught in China you have to join citizens that is actually
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.120]  what is taught in China and that is what is in their news Chinese general says
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.200]  ready to nuke us you know that's sub-launching the missile in our
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.320]  military is just busy training to take our guns and you know fighting Muslim
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.160]  terrorists publicly funded by the CIA again the globalists fund the
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:33.520]  communist they fund the Nazis they fund the Muslim extremists a lot of them
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.520]  don't even know they're being funded from you know upline downline this is
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.640]  geopolitical master's strategy and it's not my opinion I didn't just figure this

[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.680]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.720]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:28.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.280]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:05.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.840]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.880]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.160]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.680]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:33.320]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:37.040]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.520]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:45.760]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:51.440]  have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of full of the Republic on DVD
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.840]  at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:08.640]  prisonplanet.tv
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:16.000]  well I won't back down reducing tensions economic ties and we hope this
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.080]  progress continues because it's in the interest of both sides the region and the
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:26.200]  United States indeed I reaffirmed our commitment to a one China policy based
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:32.720]  on the three U.S.-China communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act I told president
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.200]  who that we appreciated China there is a very sitar the indonesian
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:42.200]  citizen that North Korea must avoid further provocations up there with who
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:49.000]  gentle the communist Chinese dictator he is elected by the communist committee
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.520]  that is a group of dictators so the appointed frontman of a committee of
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:59.760]  filthy rich corrupt dictators who wallow with the wealthy robber barons of the
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:05.360]  West to destroy the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and of course he bowed
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.600]  to him again yesterday he bowed to him again a year ago Obama hasn't ever
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:16.760]  found anybody that he didn't want to bow down to and I was watching some of the
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.480]  press conference it was about how China is committed in helping the U.S. force
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.280]  through the Copenhagen Treaty really that China is exempt from and they build
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.520]  two to three new reactors a week new power plants they're also building a
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.720]  lot of nuclear reactors and we build two power plants a year on average because
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:38.080]  that's all the government allows us to have and now the feds have come into
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.960]  Texas that's supplying power to five surrounding states the biggest power
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:47.160]  generator in the U.S. and has told us we've got to shut down and then pay
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:53.720]  more no judge no jury Congress didn't pass this Copenhagen but what's the head
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.640]  of NASA and others call for they said China's gonna put tariffs on us if we
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:04.440]  don't accept the carbon tax and oh whatever China says we better do this is
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.000]  about groveling to China it's been armed it's been positioned it's been put into
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.880]  place and it's involved expanding worldwide as the New World Order's main
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:21.320]  Hydra of tyranny because it is a complete nightmare high-tech tyranny over
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:26.560]  there on record and you notice it's a total embracing of it covertly the
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.040]  bankers that run our country that set up the UN have funded and created this
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.840]  monster and backed it up and the oppression of its people and now there's
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:37.640]  a total embrace of it here are some of the headlines we're going to our guest
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:43.200]  meet the new boss China owns the United States but again only through the
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.160]  bankers who sit above them continuing China plants a flag on Constitution
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.520]  Avenue never before done hundreds of flags all over Pennsylvania Avenue just
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:02.120]  flaunting it so that when his lordship drove in on the red carpet and walked
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:09.520]  over the red carpet and drove in he would see the capital turned into a
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.600]  worship fest for authoritarianism what does this tell you what does this say
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.600]  here our government grovels to tyranny well of course we're setting a tyranny
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.760]  up here our government has exported tyranny and tried to put dictators in
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.600]  and death squads all over the world if the governments didn't serve them here's
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.160]  the London Guardian China on equal footing with us as who Gentile visits
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:39.280]  Washington the US has been taken over by the banks that got 28 trillion dollars
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.320]  in just the last two years that they won't say where it went but we're told
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:49.160]  we're owned by China and there are bosses they own one trillion China's
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:55.880]  owned by the very same banking cartel China's inferiority and hard powers
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.360]  turned Beijing's advantage and sites on its growing soft power abroad see the
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.360]  US plays the part of the devil as I've told you for years taking over the
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.680]  world torturing people the CIA releases the torture internationally wanting to
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:14.400]  destroy our name but then domestically telling us it's good so that we are now
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.600]  the new Hitler and when we collapse the world will rejoice and then China will
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.000]  rise up with the EU and that's the planetary regime then the US will be
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:32.480]  rebuilt as a troop supplying mercenary backwater that's all been written about
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:38.200]  all been planned by the globalist China logs double digit growth in the US the
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.640]  US has 2% so-called growth that's with cook numbers that's what slavery does
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.280]  for you China got stealth tech from Russia US lawmaker says analyst what is
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:53.240]  the plan if what's plan B of China dumps its US debt I mean what what did who
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.720]  Gentile say two days before coming here he said the dollar is over America's
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.760]  over he knows full well all we've got's the dollar he knows the decisions been
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:06.160]  made to devalue it he knows the decisions been made to make the Chinese
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.480]  currency part of the New World Reserve currency 30 years ago by the
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.480]  trilateral Commission and David Rockefeller it's all been written about
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:23.240]  how did I know exactly what would happen because we understand the globalist and
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:29.240]  it just continues here with what's happening we have traders within our
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:36.240]  government who can pass laws to shut down our industry to boost the stock in
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.080]  their companies that are overseas in Mexico in India in China and again a
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:45.200]  hundred and sixty plus other countries it's very cold-blooded it allows them
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.620]  to destroy freedom it allows them to collectivize here as people lose their
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:53.040]  jobs and now fall onto the social safety net that was just for the poorest that
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.000]  now is going to be for more than half the public that's on some form of
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.880]  government assistance you can see where this is going and the
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.800]  authoritarians are confident because they know having half the public on some
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.760]  type of government paycheck those people will do and vote for whatever they're
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.840]  told to do by this corrupt system and that's why we're in deep trouble they
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.920]  are coming after the free speech they are coming after the guns they are
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.440]  coming after your farms and ranches and your homes and they are going to have
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.400]  unlimited armies of people who wouldn't couldn't get jobs at McDonald's in
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:29.080]  uniforms trained to beat your brains out so you better take your counties and
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.040]  your cities over you better get good cops in there and good sheriffs you
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.320]  better understand they're putting the federalized goons in right now and
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:39.680]  that we're in a horrible situation the CIA is now operating in every major US
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:47.680]  city all illegal face-scanning cameras total surveillance all illegal
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:54.560]  satellites with infrared biometric IDs I told people about this eight years ago
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.680]  and got laughed at when I had the Department of Defense reports
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.200]  Alexander Hague was making the money off of it says Utah City may use blimp as
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:06.160]  anti-crime spy on the sky the blimps are already up there well stubborn over
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:10.200]  a hundred thousand feet on the clearest days there's like a little silver dot the
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:14.560]  news points cameras at it ABC news in Utah a few years ago and said is it a
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.360]  flying saucer and it looked like the Hindenburg with two black propellers on
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.320]  it with solar panels on the side with with with with infrared cameras hanging
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:28.680]  off the bottom and I know the name of the airship company I know about the
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.120]  billion-dollar contracts but it but people couldn't believe there was a
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:38.000]  surveillance blimp at 125,000 feet so they wanted to believe it was aliens
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.160]  instead remember when I ran it about that and then I go on big syndicated
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.920]  shows they make fun of me and go what's this about imaginary blimps here it is
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.200]  in Reuters okay they got Homeland Security blimps over every major city
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.780]  Alexander Hague got the money they're they're they're scanning you they're
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:41:01.920]  following you their license plate reading okay there's unlimited money to
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.520]  enslave you it's a criminal government they can face scan everything but they
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.480]  can't stop 500 billion a year of drugs coming in now I want to play this video
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.200]  and go to this young man we'll keep him five minutes to the next hour then we
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:21.240]  got Lindsay Williams coming on he's Mattias Rojas he's 17 years old when I
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.480]  heard his voice he sounded you know very strong like he was you know 30 40 years
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.600]  old but he is strong he's got that liberty in his chest in his heart his soul
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.960]  and that's what's so exciting about standing up to tyrants and hearing that
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.200]  humanity in his voice you know somebody else in the background in Spanish
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:41.000]  saying you will fail you will fail repeatedly and it's it's gonna get
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.760]  millions of views it's already got on the different versions I saw four hundred
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:49.640]  five hundred I forget thousand views one video alone a quarter million this just
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:54.720]  got posted two days ago and he's got breaking news he's got an intelligent
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.680]  source and obviously the Rockefeller funded Henry Kissinger coup with
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.480]  Pinochet where they had prisoned over the years hundreds of thousands killed
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:08.760]  tens of thousands obviously it's more of a free country now but not as much he
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.840]  wants to use his name he's got a bunch of sources I would advise him not to give
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.680]  these sources out of this bombshell info he's got how he knew where Rockefeller
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.720]  was coming in on the airport the intel he's about to give you I don't know if
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:25.360]  he wants to actually give that source out or they may shut that source down but
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:33.920]  I'll just say I mean obviously this young man is is in a dangerous situation and
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.840]  I'm gonna tell him that now I'm not trying to scare him but we need to that's
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.440]  why it's good that he's going public and that's why it's good that he's getting a
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.920]  lot of attention because David Rockefeller we already know the globalists
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.800]  are all basically moving to South America and that's the breaking news and
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:52.800]  you know they believe territorial the that Shelley is theirs and if they're
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.240]  able to take it back over you will be put on a death squad list I mean that's
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.840]  their main enjoyment and so just like here in the US as they get their
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:05.000]  tyranny in I'm on a death squad list I mean that's part of that seem to be
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.360]  classified under infraguard they have a list of people they want killed
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.280]  immediately not even arrested so we're gonna play him confronting David
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.920]  Rockefeller and then go to him with some very powerful breaking news joining us
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:23.920]  from Chile 17-year-old man who people are just marveling at at at at at at the
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:30.320]  way he rebuked Emperor Palpatine known as David Rockefeller here it is

[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.200]  David Rockefeller's minion that he was responsible for much of the social
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.240]  engineering down there in Chile and and it and of course so many other evils
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:02.880]  worldwide mr. Rojas great to have you on with us via video Skype from Chile how

[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:18.560]  you're my hero we're all together anybody that stands up against these mass
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:22.160]  murderers and I've got the documents on David Rockefeller with his eugenics and
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.960]  the sterilants and the vaccines anybody that stands up against this family that
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:31.520]  openly financed Hitler is a hero well a lot of people in Chile are waking up
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:37.680]  right now to this truth that you spilled out and well I knew that Rockefeller was
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.120]  coming to Chile because I I received an information from a source that as you
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:48.600]  said I cannot really reveal right now but I knew this a day before David
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:54.040]  Rockefeller arrived to the airport I was in Santiago the Chile because I I had
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.520]  some documents that I had to submit to make something I don't live in Santiago
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:05.640]  I live in Antenno and a countryside and the countryside of Chile so I was there
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:09.840]  with my friends who is also an info warrior his name is Pedro Reyes and I
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.560]  want to also to thank him for being there you can hear him like in the second
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:21.960]  46 saying you will fail you will fail that's the background boys but we got
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:27.240]  there like at the 1 10 p.m. something like that and Rockefeller's plane was
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:33.880]  going to land at the 1 15 p.m. we saw the screen with the flights coming in and
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:39.760]  coming out and I think that the plane was already there so we lost a lot of
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.760]  hope at that time and we didn't know what to do we were searching all over the
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:50.120]  airport there was a lot of people we think that famous people famous person
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:55.320]  like Mr. Rockefeller has to arrive to Chile in some kind of a special way you
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:03.840]  know we got well we began to search for the VPI VIP section or something like
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:10.760]  that and we asked a lot of people where does a person comes from the import be
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:15.320]  from the airport being a millionaire being an international banker no one
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:21.520]  knew about him arriving to Chile and not even the press reported it I forced to
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.680]  the press that Rockefeller was going to be here also with Mr. Augustine Ellwars
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:31.680]  who is the owner of El Mercurio but we had a lot of responses but nothing clear
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:37.800]  then we when we turned around to to almost leave the place we were losing a
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:44.440]  lot of old hope we found out that David Rockefeller was there in front of us and
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:50.560]  waiting for some man to to put him on the on the on the vehicle where Augustine
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.880]  Ellwars where was was that yeah he's now in a wheelchair yes he's now in a
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.440]  wheelchair well he's normally get happy about seeing a person become decrepit
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:05.680]  but I tell you I'm not crying any tears for him he's one more step towards the
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.280]  mouth of hell opening up for him he can probably see old scratch they're waiting
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.680]  on him right now yes many people say that well how can you scream at an old
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.400]  person I say well physically he looks like an old person but in his mind he
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.640]  still has the same ideas so does you see him leering at you vampirically act
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.440]  little kind of laughing at you like a devil he seems really like a devil
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:32.880]  literally and his eyes were like red and you know now he looks like Emperor
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.640]  Palpatine yeah yeah at the beginning he apparently thought that I was a fan of
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:44.000]  his because he smiles and he salute me with his hands but after that after he
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.080]  heard that I was telling him to leave Chile his face changed and then he laughed
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.120]  again when I accused him of killing a lot of people meaning the eugenics
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.600]  programs he funds the genocide in China as you mentioned that he prays he
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:04.280]  prays now the take the dictatorships in South America when I saw him laugh I
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.160]  lose control you know I start to scream even more it's a scream even more even
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:15.880]  more so I heard a man sitting from the from inside a vehicle I didn't know
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:21.720]  who was he saying don't scream don't scream I even went went a little bit
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:27.520]  inside the vehicle and he found out that I was in other words Eastman's was
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.720]  there as you covered yesterday I was in alert Eastman is the sentence of I was
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:36.600]  in other words my clover who was president of the League of Nations
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.600]  they go way back with the Rockefellers and of course Eastman's a huge media
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:47.200]  magnet so here is Rockefeller again with the power elite of South America
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:52.120]  please continue well that was a big surprise for me I didn't know that he
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:58.840]  was going to be there you know well I I thought I think that he wasn't prepared
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:02.680]  Mr. Rockefeller for this I mean and maybe he believes that chili's like the
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:06.600]  cook Iceland or something like that where where he can come and leave and
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.720]  no one tells anything because the bodyguards didn't do anything even one
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.160]  one of them was it was even laughing when I was was there confronting him well
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:18.920]  that's what they do it's a cover to make you feel powerless you know I was
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.160]  played a tape of Rockefeller at Bilderberg that I was not allowed to
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:27.640]  put on air and the person called his hotel room and it was Rockefeller
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.560]  because they knew what hotel he was at and then he said please call back this
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.520]  was in 2008 Obama was there and the person called back got him had a
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.200]  discussion about world government with him but the fellow who was down there

[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:12.160]  Matthias Rojas is our guest joining us from Chile he and his friend got intel
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.040]  from other patriots to understand the globalist agenda about mr. David
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:21.960]  Rockefeller who if you had to say one person knows where the bodies are buried
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:29.400]  one person who was at all the Bilderberg meetings from 46 on one person
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.120]  they were really having them since 46 they didn't really start in 54 like they
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.520]  say one guy who was you know in US intelligence before World War two a
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.680]  guy that his family you know gave the UN the land developed the idea of the
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.960]  League of Nations they were the ones along with Cecil Rhodes and the Queen
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.720]  of England at the time and that's why there he is with the son of the founder
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:57.320]  of the League of Nations and here comes a great patriot for Chile confronting
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.880]  someone who was involved in the overthrow of Chile on September 11th by
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:08.000]  Pinochet now I want to get into your new bombshell info because we've got the
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.480]  bushes you know running down to South America buying hundreds of thousands of
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.440]  acres we've got so many of the elites leaving the US because they know what
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.680]  they've done they're getting ready to stage a civil war here at least that's
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:26.920]  the word you've got some bombshell info for us Mr. Rojas so drop it on us well
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.800]  I find out that many elites are buying land in the south of Chile both in
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.760]  Argentina and Chile Ted Turner for instance who was a founder of CNN he has
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:43.920]  a lot of land in Argentina even Henry Paulson has bought a lot of land in
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:48.640]  Tierra del Fuego instead in the south of Chile under the Patagonia conservation
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:54.520]  land trust the most important here that I want to talk about that is also
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.160]  connected to the Rockefeller Foundation is Mr. Douglas Tomkins so-called
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.880]  ecologist and global warming believer and overpopulation believer these people
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.960]  are crazy these people believe that the world is overpopulated but they have a
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.960]  best lens and you know that's like well that's their admitted plan they say
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:18.200]  they're gonna get rid of us and live on giant plantations exactly he has more
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:23.920]  than two million acres both in Chile and Argentina Puma in Park Concurbado Park
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:30.600]  and others and I have here a copy of a newspaper from 2001 where the lawyer of
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:37.240]  Douglas Tomkins admits that to buy that land they use money from the Ford
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:42.600]  Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation through grants some years ago
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:48.080]  and I can send you this links Alex to this Chile news articles a newspaper
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:54.760]  called Leather Sarah covered that the cover the fact that a Rockefeller is
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:00.600]  one of the most important people that gives us grants to the ecologist here
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:04.800]  Latin America so they can buy a land and give it to UNESCO as you covered in
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:09.320]  your film your first film and then they personally and then they personally move
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.920]  in on to it same thing in Mexico we wonder why we're being overwhelmed all
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:16.840]  these poor people God bless them it's because in the 70s and 80s they kicked
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:21.400]  the people off their ancient land made them go to Mexico City and then to the
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:30.240]  US this is so cold-blooded exactly well so you have that mr. Rockefeller and
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.480]  the Rockefeller family and the Rockefeller Foundation has a very
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:37.960]  special interest in the south of Chile and you can see that right now because
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:43.640]  David Rockefeller is moving to the south of Chile now on vacations with this guy
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:49.160]  Augustine Edwards to an Iceland and stop you there because you have this
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:53.480]  internally from a media source we're gonna leave that alone same source that
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:57.840]  told you where he was going to be David Rockefeller is exiting the United
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:03.960]  States I'm not sure about that but right now here's and he's here in Chile
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:09.240]  according to my source he will be here at least for 10 days but you can see how
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.520]  the blueprints for the takeover of Chile is happening in the south buying all
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.040]  of this to be clear that I misheard you so David Rockefeller is not moving to
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:23.280]  Chile no no nothing confirmed and now well the word I've got is is that when

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:30.080]  Alex Jones just the shape of Chile geographically it's a long country all
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:36.960]  the way across the western side of South America running from almost up at the
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:40.720]  top all the way down to the bottom so close to Antarctica down at the bottom
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:45.280]  just amazing I've always wanted to go there I know a lot of patriots you know
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.080]  folks like Dave hunk less than others have moved down there and I've thought
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.880]  about when I've been looking at areas in the world it's one of the safer places
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.840]  in South America if you go to the countryside it's very beautiful nice
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:59.200]  people but I mean I mean they start arresting everybody putting everybody
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.640]  in death camps and if I can get my family out I will but it'll just be out
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.160]  of the fire into the frying pan but a lot of the leaders are moving to Chile
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:13.360]  and they're pulling out of Costa Rica and Central America what do you make of
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.000]  that overall Matthias Rojas are the great patriot who confronted David
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.120]  Rockefeller so handily I think that we have to let know to these people that
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:31.640]  they are not safe anywhere these leaders what I mean just let them know that
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:38.960]  we're fully aware of their activities yes yes I wanted to make that to I wanted
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:43.640]  to let know to mr. Rockefeller that we are not his slaves I mean they have
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.320]  done an incredible job of destroying the values of family system everything
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:02:00.160]  across the world I want the people of Chile also to know that they need to
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:06.520]  find out about this man CNN even covered the video of my confrontation and some
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.040]  the media are now asking why is this guy David Rockefeller meeting with
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:16.560]  Augustine Edwards here in Chile we know that at least Sebastian Piena who is a
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:20.720]  current president of Chile called for a world government literally a world
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.520]  government during meeting epic last year and we know that vaccines are
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.360]  damaging little kids here we had a little case of a little child called a max
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:39.080]  from talca in the south of Chile who was paralyzed by the H1N1 a flu shot so
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.560]  it sounds like folks are waking up in Chile but your politicians are just
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.440]  flaunting in your face are folks aware in Chile that David Rockefeller over
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:53.840]  Kissinger was involved in haunch yelling some of the Pinochet activities yes
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.400]  yes they're very involved in that there's a lot of documentaries made in
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.360]  Chile about that about what happened but they are still they are still trapped
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.960]  by the left-right paradigm I uploaded this video and they say that oh I am a
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.680]  communist because this takeover of Chile was a right-wing way I would say to
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:17.080]  them that Rockefeller was also involved praising now or praising a
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:21.840]  federal Castro in Cuba oh yeah no they play both sides of the authoritarian
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.480]  right and left and they try to keep us frozen in that yes well Rockefeller was
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:31.640]  also involved giving rewards to Ricardo Lagos a former Chilean president who is
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.280]  called who has called for world governance to fight a global warming you
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:42.720]  can find his videos he was a special envoy from the United Nations to South
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:49.240]  America about this previous to common hanging the meeting in Chile we have
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.880]  something called Council of Americas of the Americas has derived from the
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:56.640]  Council of Foreign Relations and the Trialado Commission and was founded by
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:02.040]  David Rockefeller is no no he's founded more than 60 globalist groups and they
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:07.160]  like praise him at the UN admit he's the one single-handedly you know if you had
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:11.960]  to pick one person who's been at the center of the of traveling the world
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.960]  to set up this world government and praising now the biggest mass murder in

[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:08.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.280]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:16.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:20.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:25.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:33.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:37.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:41.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:44.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:09.560]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:14.080]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:28.120]  Latias Rojas down in Chile confronts Rockefeller brings up real issues I knew
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:32.000]  when I saw it two days ago we posted it on info wars.com and had about 200 views
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:38.400]  it was gonna go big and now yeah CNN media outlets all over the world are
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:43.280]  carrying it it's big news in South America and people are asking why was
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.720]  this young man saying he's a killer and they're talking and debating the eugenics
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:56.000]  see if we lay down we know they win but if we stand up we're going to win we
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.600]  have the truth they're telling us communist China is good and that they're
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:05.680]  the good guys when this group that runs it is killed more people than Hitler
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:11.760]  ever thought about see they're trying to just get us to accept tyranny and death
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:20.280]  and desensitize us and I just salute mr. Rojas with what he's done and talking
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.160]  about how they want to destroy the family and sterilize us that is so
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.080]  wonderful to see a 17 year old man having this effect just like when I
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:32.360]  saw Luke Radowski going to the CFR and confronting people he was getting
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:36.480]  almost no attention and we had him on the show to give him a platform and
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:41.240]  that's why this show is so valuable is that so many times we're able to put
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:46.080]  people on air and turbo charge the incredible work they're doing so they
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:49.720]  can then be an example to others and now look at that how Luke has been an
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:53.640]  example to countless others and I go to that young man 17 years old's website
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.560]  and he's got our films uploaded in Spanish he's working hard he's reaching
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.840]  hundreds of thousands of people a week if you look at the hit counters before
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:08.240]  he did this one guy using the enemy system of YouTube reaching hundreds of
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:13.320]  thousands a week now he's reaching millions this week you got to have that
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.360]  fight in you and you got to recognize who the enemy is China's corrupt and
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.840]  murderous the Chinese people are not bad they're fighting back our government
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:25.000]  supporting China is propping that up the people of Mexico were great hard work
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.560]  and smart people their government tries to scapegoat them against the US in
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:33.320]  nationalism so that they don't take their own government back and our corrupt
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:37.080]  government the big banks keeps the corrupt government in place and every
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.720]  time they try to have a real election the election experts from the US go down
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:47.400]  there and help people cheat that's on record with Calderon right now it's the
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:50.800]  people against the globalists so the globalists try to divide us into the
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:55.400]  camps of communist or conservative when we were given a fake conservative
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:01.240]  police state and a fake communist liberal system and by fake they're not real
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:10.720]  they're false choices all financed by that piece of trash David Rockefeller we
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.640]  want the globalists to stop what they're doing we want the out of control
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:22.600]  corruption to end now joining us within with incredible information is Lindsay
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.600]  Williams and we will we will do 20 minutes of overdrive in the next hour
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:30.240]  because I need to have him at least for an hour and 10 minutes or so I wasn't
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:34.240]  even do two hours but I have meetings I have to go to so I apologize to Lindsay
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.840]  for that but I'm sure he doesn't want to do two hours to begin with we're gonna
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:42.200]  go to him in just a moment but there's major breaking news remember a month ago
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:47.360]  we had Attorney Phil Berg and Tarpley and Madson and everybody else on liberal
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:52.780]  conservative doesn't matter investigators and it's clear Obama is an
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:55.920]  Indonesian citizen that's not debated his real names Barry Sataro he gave up
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:59.480]  his US citizenship he's ineligible to be US president under federal law at that
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:05.200]  time and it's retroactive he's probably born in Kenya the evidence is about 90
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.040]  percent that direction we know he worked for the CIA and so did his mommy and all
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.480]  the rest of them and his daddy and Ford Foundation along with Geithner's dad they
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:20.360]  came up together now the Democratic governor Neil Abercrombie and we're
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.640]  going to Lindsay Williams but I want to get Lindsay's take on this first Neil
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:31.400]  Abercrombie he came out a month ago when he was about to get sworn in you know in
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.680]  December he said when I get in in January which he's now done I'm gonna go
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:40.720]  get the birth certificate and I'm gonna put it out but he said I need
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:44.760]  permission from Obama so please let me and the White House was mum and even
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:54.040]  Chris Slimeball Matthews on the same channel as Mr. Maddow said that why
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:56.960]  don't you just release the original birth certificate they went from denying
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.640]  that his real birth certificate hadn't been given out and saying that receipt
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:05.360]  that computer printed receipt was it no no that wasn't the blueprint copy that
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:12.200]  wasn't the you know the sign one by the doctor with the baby feet on it and now
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:16.600]  the governor is saying it's not there I don't know what to do this is on World
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:20.360]  Net Daily we're got it linked up on info wars.com and prisonbunna.com
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.840]  Hawaiian governor can't find Obama's birth certificate suggest controversy
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.560]  could hurt presidents reelection chances maybe there's a reason Obama bows to the
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.880]  British royalty to the communist Chinese to the Saudi royalty to anybody
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:37.680]  and everybody he bows and they don't even tip their head he bows and then they
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.040]  don't even you know because sometimes I shake hands and tend to you know like
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:45.760]  friendly high you know it's like a huh but no he's a mo and then and then he
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:52.800]  lies and says he's picking something up this guy's blackmailed period and we
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:56.960]  know he is Hawaiian governor Neil Abercrombie suggested an interview
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.360]  published today that a long-form hospital generated birth certificate for
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.080]  Barack Obama and and Marley let's link through to that actual Hawaiian
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.720]  article and post a blurb on that and then link to it it's the first link in
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.960]  the World Net Daily let's get that on info wars as well. Hawaii governor can't
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:15.520]  find Obama's birth certificate suggest controversy could hurt presidents
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:19.160]  reelection chances. Governor Neil Abercrombie suggested in an interview
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:23.000]  published today that a long-form hospital generated birth certificate for Barack
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  Obama may not exist within the vital records maintained by the Hawaiian
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:31.880]  Department of Health. I mean I remember like a decade ago my grandmother for
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.520]  some reason had to get her birth certificate from the 1920s and got it.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:43.960]  I mean they've got all those. Oh sorry not on a guy born in 63 sorry Abercrombie
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:48.320]  spokeswoman Honolulu ignored again today another series of repeated requests
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:51.200]  made by World Net Daily for an interview with the governor. We're gonna get
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:55.280]  Dr. Jerome Corsi who's been to Africa to cover this in Kenya and got arrested
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:59.080]  not allowed to go talk to Obama's grandma who says oh he was born here
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.080]  they got statues in Kenya saying he was born there. His wife and speeches in 97
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:07.600]  and 98 said my husband from Kenya went back to his homeland of Kenya where he
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.360]  was born. For the end of the interview the newspaper Assad Abercrombie you
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:15.240]  stirred up quite a controversy with your comments regarding birthers and your
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:18.320]  plan to release more information regarding Barack Obama's president
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:22.680]  Obama's birth certificate. How's that going? In response Abercrombie acknowledged
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:25.680]  the bursting of an issue will have political implications for the next
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:32.120]  presidential elections that we simply cannot have. And he went on to say that
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:38.960]  they are unable to find it. Sorry to interrupt part of the interview with
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.520]  that Lindsey Williams but this is a pretty big piece of news here that the
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:46.480]  governor's now saying he said I'm gonna release it and now he's saying we can't
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:54.080]  find it. What does that sound like to you? Do we have Lindsey? Lindsey are you
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.040]  there? Right here Alex, thank you. Lindsey, sorry to get you a little bit late. What's
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:03.040]  your take on the governor Abercrombie who promised to release Obama's birth
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:08.240]  certificate now saying they can't find it? Every bill that Mr. Obama has signed
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:12.520]  since he went into office will be null and void if it can be proven that he was
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:17.080]  not a born citizen of the United States of America. I think this is big news and
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:23.680]  Alex I'm so glad that you're bringing it out. Well talking to your elitist friends
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:27.760]  Ken Fromm who now passed in December and then the other Mr. X who I know who he
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.440]  is we're not gonna say his name he's living. What is their view of Obama?
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.600]  Because everything they've told you over the years you know about oil prices are
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:38.720]  gonna go up this much then they're gonna go down now they're gonna go up it's
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:43.280]  been very accurate and tied into similar info I've gotten from Bilderberg
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:48.560]  moles but there was in the 2008 election your sources didn't they tell you though
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.160]  that they thought Obama was gonna lose or were they or I mean what's the story
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:57.640]  on that? One expression that Mr. Fromm gave me one day when we were talking was
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:08.200]  he said that our man from Arizona here he said he is our man that's what they
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:12.240]  wanted but they have been able to very well control Mr. Obama but they're in
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:17.040]  real trouble now because if this birth certificate issue comes up everything
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:23.600]  this man is done is null and void. The healthcare bill if he said he signed it
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:29.800]  it has no power whatsoever if he's an illegal president. Well that's gonna
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.720]  cause a constitutional crisis we're gonna go to break and come back and get
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.440]  into the new information you've been given how the information we're given
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:40.400]  three months ago and it was September we had you on you said it's gonna go up to
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:44.880]  150 then we had you on again in December you said 150 to 200 from your source
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:49.240]  you've got new information on the food going up on the rest of it and we're
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:54.320]  going to we're going to get to all that but what is your view of them putting
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:57.840]  up Chinese flags on Pennsylvania Avenue that's not done for the British or
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:03.040]  anybody else and the media talking about how America's done and China is the new
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:08.200]  global power and just look and then the Chinese president talking bad about the
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:13.360]  US and saying the dollar is a thing of the past I mean I mean what's going on
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:18.240]  here from your inside sources. We have been betrayed now Mr. Trump said before
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:21.480]  he passed away he made the statement to me one day he heard me give it on your
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:26.040]  program back about a year and a half ago he said China is the big one watch
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:30.760]  China and Russia he said never mind what's happening over the Middle East he
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:34.520]  said don't pay any attention to North and South Korea he said the important
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:40.200]  thing is China and Russia watch them literally are being sold out by
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:45.560]  Washington DC right now and Mr. Trump warned me about this back a year and a
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:48.960]  half ago that this was part of their plan and I told it right here on your
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:53.640]  program. No that's right you put videos. I must inform your listening audience of what I am
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:57.400]  hearing in the last few days and you know on Sunday when I was with you I
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.960]  tried my best to give some of the things that I've been hearing just late like I
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:07.400]  had I think five communicators from my other elitist friend last week or my
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:11.600]  gracious the things that are out there are exciting. Okay well I'm going to try
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:17.360]  to then shut my mouth when we come back and you just give us the bombshell
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:20.240]  points up front and then we'll come back in the next segment after that and get
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:23.520]  into each one in detail well then backtrack to the previous predictions
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.520]  that are coming true but then you also you talked about them maybe taking a
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:33.160]  back step I want to quantify that but and then later before you leave us I want
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:37.680]  to get back into where they see China going obviously the muscle the de
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.280]  industrialized the US the muscle to own our debt we've been put into this
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:46.480]  subservient position just like China was occupied by foreign colonial powers
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:51.360]  we're being occupied by the modern colonial bankers who have worked this
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:55.320]  mischief upon us but it's all based in fraud we can stand up any day and say
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.880]  no but our government's compromise that's why China's a danger because they
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:03.320]  work for the globalists as well. Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.240]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults for the
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:11.000]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.680]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.960]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:22.040]  again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect

[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.560]  into the past very accurate info with this former oil company major oil
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:18.400]  company CEO the former director of operations for Atlantic Ridgefield that
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:22.440]  Ken Fromm as other big source died this guy again he's talked about both of them
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:25.480]  in his book written 20-something years ago this other guy's even more high
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:28.800]  powered and I was asking Lindsay what else he wanted to cover and he wanted to
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:32.400]  basically warn me during the break so the I like all this to be out in the
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.160]  public here and I am aware that we're starting to really reach more people
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:43.240]  tell folks what this high-powered elitist and his wife told you and then
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.960]  let's get into a boil down of some of the key points you're gonna be covering
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:52.480]  Lindsay a lot of you making an impact I mean he's only good an impact to the point that they're beginning to sit up and take the
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:55.880]  take notice of what you're doing you know I've been on the firing line now for
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:25:00.360]  35 years and two different times I've been threatened one time with my life and
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:04.480]  another time my family was threatened and then of course I had to back off on a
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.600]  few things but I didn't back off on telling all the things I've been given
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:15.040]  but you Alex Jones and in front of my goodness you know sometimes a person's
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:19.800]  wife will say things that the man won't say and as a result I've been getting
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:24.120]  to communicate here lately about some things that you you definitely are
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.080]  doing now there's some other big names out there also that have been there for a
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:31.080]  long time but you've stepped up to the plate now to the point that they're
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:34.680]  beginning to take notice of what Alex Jones is doing and folks I want you to
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:38.320]  know out there an Alex listening audience right now I'm getting from the
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:43.080]  elite the fact that Alex Jones is making an impact and they're beginning to
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.520]  watch him real close as they've been doing me for many years and such people
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:53.760]  as Russian Shalom and two others but now Alex Jones has stepped up to the plate
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:57.400]  and Alex you are getting major attention now folks there's one thing you must
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.280]  watch you probably noticed that gasoline has gone up six cents a gallon in the
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:07.440]  past week's time watch crude oil prices and you will know the progression of the
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:12.280]  elite I can't stress enough you must hear some of the things that I've been
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:17.720]  hearing lately and that is the elite are life on time with their timeline the
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.920]  new Congress has not changed their timeline they do not have any intentions
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:28.920]  in changing it the end of 2012 is their timeline and I can't stress enough to
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:33.160]  watch the crude oil prices and you will know the progression of the elite's
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:38.000]  program this is what was told to me back two years ago I gave it on Alex Jones
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.880]  show I said that crude oil prices would stay somewhere around 70 to 80 dollars
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:48.880]  a barrel for two and one-half years folks it's not that Lindsay Williams is a
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:52.520]  profit it's just that I have been talking with the elite because of their
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:56.200]  respect for me of giving two years three years of my life to be their
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:00.920]  chaplain on the trans-alaskan oil pipeline now you must watch what they're
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:06.440]  saying crude oil prices is the key to noticing it just started up back about
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:11.600]  two months ago through six sets in one week's time and you every person out
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:16.000]  then Alex Jones show listening audience you can watch the price of crude oil
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.280]  this doesn't take even going to the computer for just watching at the local
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:25.040]  gas station and this is the sign that Mr. Farm gave to me that you will know the
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:29.840]  progression of what they're doing now last weekend my wife my son and I went
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:34.880]  to the grocery store oh my goodness you bound to know what's happening there I
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:40.600]  would again you predicted through them Lindsay all of this you said two and a
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:45.560]  half years ago now three years ago when oil was at 60 it's gonna go to 150 it
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:50.760]  did then when it was at the peak you said now it's going down to to below 60
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:56.560]  probably 40 went below 40 then you said now it's gonna run up to 70 for the
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.560]  next two and a half years but then when it starts up look out everybody go out
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:05.320]  have a good time now enjoy your trips your rides because when it starts going
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.880]  up to and this is what the former head of operations Atlantic richfield and the
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:14.720]  others guy even higher level we're telling you please continue you are
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:19.840]  going to see 150 to $200 about they want it to go to 200 you want to see at
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:25.240]  least $150 about at the gas pump if they have their way within the next six to
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:30.280]  nine months crude oil prices you're going to see gasoline at the gas pump go up
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:34.000]  to three to four dollars a gallon now this is going to show up and it's
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.320]  already beginning to show up at the grocery store last weekend the family
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:41.360]  and I went to the grocery store I try to keep stocked up at least six months to a
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:45.560]  year on certain things and I noticed that my bathroom tissue was down a little
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:49.440]  ways that's the thing you better have it's kind of hard to use your citizen
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:53.080]  robot gallery I'll get done but they don't have many more and I noticed that
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:58.960]  bathroom tissue now a very well-known brand I won't name it that bad going up
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:04.800]  three dollars in one week it went from six to nine dollars for the big pack a
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:11.600]  bathroom tissue in one week now there it is not that the bathroom tissue went up
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:15.640]  in price the bathroom tissue did not increase in price at all folks are you
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:19.480]  hearing this real interest rates not the fake ones they have on the news are
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:24.400]  skyrocketing right now yes the bathroom tissue did not go up in price but
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:30.280]  dollar decreased in purchasing value and that's exactly what Mr. Fromm told me
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:34.800]  back two years ago I came on Alex Jones show and said it he said you're going to
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.600]  be so poor in two years you won't be able to do anything about it you are

[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:18.680]  okay Lindsay Williams has talked a lot about China's new order for ten years on
[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:23.800]  my show or more but last two and a half he's saying watch China watch China we're
[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:27.320]  being sold out to them they're the rising power this is the takeover and
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:31.280]  certainly there it is I mean they have planned this whole thing the de-industrialization
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:36.400]  Walmart getting the exclusive deals the slave labor to shut down US factories
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:39.960]  and business consolidate power now Walmart admits they're under homeland
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:43.040]  security they're putting in the telescreen saying watch your neighbor
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:48.520]  they've got the force inoculation plans that we've seen bits and pieces of under
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:51.960]  the model states of the emergency powers act for walmart's to be forced
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:56.840]  inoculation centers and Walmart distribution centers to be FEMA command
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:01.600]  bases I mean these are cold-blooded folks this is all using economy and
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:06.160]  business to destroy the free market to build it up to consolidate to knock their
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:12.280]  competition out and then shut off the free market and it is just unspeakably
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:16.120]  wicked then they will convert to the quote green economy that's actually a
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:21.880]  neofutilistic prison city economy and I showed you the British government funded
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:26.640]  London Guardian sponsored cartoons last week that are shown to children in
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:31.120]  England and now in the US where they said it's wonderful you only get meet
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:35.040]  once a year you're only allowed to travel by bicycle unless you get a travel
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:39.640]  permit everything you do is surveilled you live in these giant high-tech cities
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:44.080]  but those that don't are allowed to go to ghettos oh it's too bad my sister's in
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:48.360]  that ghetto and it looks like it's a dystopic nightmare but they're saying
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:54.880]  it's good and they meet it to be dystopic but but then they dress it as
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.680]  it's good so that you're shocked and then just go well I guess I'm acclimated
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:01.840]  this is psychological warfare all right I'm sorry let's go back to Lindsey
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.560]  Williams Lindsey please continue I want to get more to China later but the
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:10.440]  latest communicates the stuff that he has told you and how that ties in with
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:15.240]  what Ken Fromm was telling you on his deathbed and then integrating that in
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:18.720]  with your statement to me off air that that that that that this other oil
[02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:21.960]  company executive even more high-powered who you've been interviewing and talking
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:25.360]  to for years now he's really spilling his guts to you because we're getting so
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:30.440]  close to it and the fact that he quote he comes from a little different
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:35.760]  perspective or angle quantify that you've got the floor the positive is a group
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:39.600]  people on the face of the earth who control the world folks I beg of you
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:44.040]  listen to everything Alex Jones says he's been trying to tell you this for
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:49.840]  years and I I verify everything he said there and it's by the providence of God
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:54.000]  I must give him the glory Alex please bear with me a second I gotta give the
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:58.320]  God the glory for all of these things that I have been allowed to know over the
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:03.520]  years and it's by the providence of God that I had the privilege of having the
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:08.800]  confidence of some of these people two different ones especially and as a result
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.800]  and able to tell you what I'm telling you today now
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:18.000]  product qualify yes the other individual who has been willing to give me
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.800]  information I guess sometimes families are pretty close and oftentimes you get
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:26.720]  more for life you do from their husbands and some of them are very
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:30.760]  concerned you'd be surprised about what even they did are doing most of them
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:35.520]  running the third world without me some things that please notice the expression
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:40.480]  and then I got a qualified no shortage on the grocery store ships you're
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:45.080]  finally beginning to see this I know a lot of you've been saying all we're
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:49.080]  gonna have a shortage of food and food and food no no no you remember that I
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:52.520]  was told a year and a half ago that we'll shortage on the grocery store
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:57.240]  ships but you will go hungry why because you won't be able to buy it now
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:03.640]  listen to these things you can see them for yourself number one listen to the
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:08.080]  grocery store ships and the prices as they go up and you're again
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:13.920]  secondly listen at the gas pump please listen to that gas pump next time you
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:20.320]  fill up your vehicle it went up six sets in one week yes did not go up did you
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:26.800]  catch that yes did not go up the purchasing power of the dollar went down
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:33.840]  and they're still giving OPEC $50 a barrel in purchasing power because the
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:39.240]  dollar is deteriorating and that's exactly what this the head of state of
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:44.320]  China has said to us why he looked again out of the bag he said the dollar is
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.240]  going to be not the world currency anymore and you're hearing it again
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:53.960]  listen to gold and silver prices folks if there's any way that there's some buzz
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:58.840]  words you've got to listen to the national global media is our mouthpiece
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:04.200]  Hollywood is that perversion and then there's Alex Jones out there who is
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:08.520]  telling everything exactly what they're doing along with some of the other
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:12.600]  talk show hosts now beginning to say things that I said 20 years ago they're
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:18.280]  finally beginning to come around and and say it listen to my elitist friends I
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:22.800]  beg of you you know there are a few people on the face of the earth who by
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:26.280]  the providence of God have been given the privilege of knowing some of these
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:32.640]  people as personally as I have over these 35 years please listen to my elitist
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:35.840]  friends and what they're saying because they're telling you one in two and three
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:40.320]  years in advance everything that they're going to do and Alex is bold enough to
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:44.320]  allow me to come on his program and tell you you have to listen to the three
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:50.880]  hours of information by just recorded on two CDs please do and by the way Alex
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.960]  I am increasing it one I do remember last time I was on your program I said you
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:02.960]  must do 12 things immediately yes I'm increasing that to 13 you must do 13
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:11.120]  things I have had to add this last one here it is you positively must take
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:16.760]  care of the fiscal needs of your household for what I've been given by my
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:21.520]  elitist friend just in the past week or two I've added this one you've got to
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:29.440]  to find a way to take care of yourself medically in your home and this is the
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.920]  first time I've ever given this on the Alex you on show today listen to the
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:39.720]  verses of the elite and you will know why you positively must begin to take
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:42.960]  care of your own house Lindsay this is sounding let me stop it for me because I
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:46.720]  want you to go on this is sounding you know I talked about I ran into a lady
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:52.440]  who I'm not gonna go too far into it but one of the richest women reportedly in
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:55.400]  the US which isn't really true the people they advertise as the richest or
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:59.480]  mid-level but I looked into who she was found out that it was she was indeed
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:04.360]  one of the richest women in the country you know owned a defense company I mean
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:08.400]  the list goes on and on and she said this was three and a half years ago she
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.880]  said within four years there will not be she said within three to four years
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:17.880]  there will not be a United States and I said what does that mean and she's and
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.760]  you know maybe she got spooked maybe maybe maybe if she got scared but she
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:26.520]  was running off to the Cook Islands and leaving and then I saw the news articles
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:30.320]  after that about elites and rich leaving and you know the bushes and
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:34.840]  everybody moving to South America and all the rest of it and a lot of the
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:38.600]  richest Jews in Israel are leaving Israel by the way and going to London for
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:42.800]  some reason and and and so what you're saying is I mean having to have your own
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:47.520]  medical care at home that sounds like road warrior level collapse or something
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:53.760]  30% of America's doctors plan to quit if Obamacare it goes through I was I was
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.240]  into the dentist I was that my wife was at the dentist the other day he's
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:00.560]  probably one of the most leading dentist of the Phoenix Valley and
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.040]  Scottsdale area and he had just been he gave me this personally said I was just
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:11.280]  with the most prominent dentist specialized in dental work in his area
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:16.280]  he's been in the business now for some over 50 years he's not a young comer and
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:21.720]  he said that this dentist friend of his and he had been together and he said
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:26.120]  this is doesn't pick up now people don't have to have their work done they can
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:30.160]  have that tooth hurt they don't have to have cosmetic surgery because of the
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.160]  economy being in such bad shape people are not going to the the dentist as they
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:39.320]  did he's this most prominent dentist of the Phoenix Valley said to my dentist
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:44.440]  friend just the other day he said if my business doesn't pick up by June of
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:48.800]  2011 that's this year by June he said I'll have to close my office I can't
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:52.880]  stay in business table if Obamacare goes in they're going to give them much
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:56.960]  less than what they're getting right now 30% of America's doctors plan to quit
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:01.520]  if it goes through folks you must begin to take some action to take care of
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:08.480]  yourself as well we told people four years ago that day we told mine he was
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:13.000]  playing racket ball and after he got through he passed out he he rushed him
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.760]  to the hospital he didn't have any choice because that's what the automatic
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:21.560]  we do call 9-1-1 when they got through with three dollars I mean three days I'm
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:28.720]  sorry of strenuous examinations they had a new bill for $33,000
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:33.560]  because he passed out at the Wrecked Court because he had taken too much of a
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:39.200]  health drink prior to it and it cost his heart to do something funny but listen
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:42.640]  to the rest of this they brought him in and they said we noticed you don't have
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:50.440]  insurance and they said rather than take a chance they said this is in your
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:56.800]  area this happened in Dallas Texas by the way Alex and the doctors and
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:02.080]  the hospital said to him okay if you will pay us $5,000 right now in the
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:07.400]  checker cash before you leave the hospital we will count that as paid and
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:13.360]  here's your bill for $34,000 pay five right now and we'll take it or $34,000
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:17.720]  if you don't pay before you leave the hospital folks you can't depend on
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:23.560]  public hospitals any longer there are things in the wind you've got to prepare
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:28.200]  yourself for your family's medical needs Alex well I mean did your source say
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:46.440]  that or is that just from your own research yes I'm saying I'm saying the
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:51.120]  medical system the medical system falling apart I mean I mean was that
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:58.600]  warning coming from your mr. X yes I have been warned by this new elitist
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:02.960]  trend of mine as to what's happening as far as the medical system is concerned
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:08.840]  he has talked to me at length about the medical system and of course the
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.320]  business that I mentioned just a moment ago is Dr. Hoskins here in the Phoenix
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:19.040]  Valley these people are saying we have bubbles in the medical system and if
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:24.120]  Obamacare goes through Lord have mercy on us you definitely I have put down
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.560]  his number 13 now in the list of things that you positively must improve within
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:32.520]  the next few days I mean you can't wait any longer all right I want to expand on
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:37.320]  that told me there are 13 things that you must do immediately if you're going
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:41.040]  to spare your house politics and one of them the one I've just added you've got
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:45.160]  to begin to take care of your own medical needs Alex all right I want to
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:48.400]  just back up and and point out we know what the globalists do in third world
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:54.080]  countries they implode we have the 112 part IMF World Bank shock therapy order
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:58.480]  that they internally give countries that was leaked in 2002 such a key point I
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:03.880]  talk about routinely and they they then give them economic orders that they know
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:08.160]  will further implode the economy you could cut all government services and
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:12.760]  never pay the foreign debt off that's made up on the derivatives because you
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:17.400]  don't really owe it but they implode the economy raise the taxes all the money
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:22.600]  goes offshore to enrich the globalists and our new Chinese owners teamed up
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:27.480]  with the private fellow reserve so all of that goes on but we're already seeing
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:31.040]  it Detroit they're announcing they're gonna get rid of hat their schools but
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:35.760]  you say well that's just Detroit all over the country Iowa Ohio California
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:40.800]  you're hearing about 30% 40% 60% of the sheriff's deputies are police laid off
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:45.320]  and the cops say we're not gonna respond to crime now all we're gonna do is raise
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:50.240]  revenue for ourselves by and some are honest they say buy guns to protect
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:53.760]  yourself others say and don't let us catch you with a gun to protect yourself
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.200]  in your house but some are honest and say get guns and then when citizens go
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:01.880]  out and buy guns the media comes out I've actually seen this on MSNBC it's up
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:07.920]  on a prison planet and says it's racism to buy guns it's secretly for black
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:11.920]  people well black folks are buying guns too I mean this is crazy you don't want
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:16.200]  government health carrier racist they just throw these buzzwords out that have

[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:28.160]  mile an hour trains we haven't repaired our rail lines in over a hundred years
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:33.640]  when my grandmother was going to college she would take the train from East Texas
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:38.840]  getting her masters she went to Baylor for under you know her regular four-year
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:43.720]  degree when she was getting her masters in education shooting down to Houston you
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:48.480]  know part of the week she took a bullet train from dig Texas that went over 100
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:52.240]  miles an hour so she'd get down to Houston in like an hour and get back in an
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:57.480]  hour now the trains can't go above about 45 miles an hour because the because the
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:03.520]  tracks are so bad I mean America is like in reverse here go ahead listen to
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:09.040]  congressman Alan Grayson he's from the House of Representatives now I'm trying
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:11.400]  to give you things that you've got to listen to according to what my
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:15.280]  leaders are telling me you've got to listen to what Alan Grayson said about
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:21.040]  MBS mortgage back securities you know I was told and please folks I don't
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:25.720]  remember to keep to my own but these things were told to me by my elitist
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:31.640]  friends back a year two years ago they said that if they have that way when
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:35.360]  they have that way that the elitist of the world are going to own every piece
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:39.000]  of mortgage real estate in the United States of America those commercial and
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:42.880]  residential and I gave that on Alex Jones show back a year year and a half
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:47.720]  ago when the MBS mortgage back security thing had not even come up as a major
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.240]  issue now Alan Grayson came out these amendment the House of Representatives in
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:56.200]  Washington and you've got to watch him on YouTube he came out and said the
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:01.000]  identical same thing that I was told back a year and a half to two years ago
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  that they will take over by way of the Federal Reserve and ask you as the
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.040]  American people through the Treasury to give it to bail out mortgage back
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:15.400]  securities and when they do they that the through the Federal Reserve you be
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:19.320]  making your house payment to the Federal Reserve and that's because I was
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:24.360]  amazed I sat here in all as I watched Alan Grayson say this for the House of
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:28.840]  Representatives he said exactly what Mr. Fromm said to me back a year and a half
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:33.760]  two years ago I was only a part you will be making your house payment when they
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:37.520]  have their way and all this is settled in you'll be making your house payment
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:41.560]  to the Federal Reserve there's great piece of mortgage real estate in the
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:46.240]  United States of America will be taken over and if this is a part of that plan
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:50.040]  and now even some Congressmen of old enough come out and say these things
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:54.320]  again yeah too big to fail is their program to purposefully implode
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.040]  everything and then come in as the saviors and collectivize it even more
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:03.080]  and then tell us that China is our owner it's just absolute high treason and the
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:08.600]  media is telling us we're lazy it's our fault I've studied it this country a
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:13.760]  small part of the debt is the chicken feed entitlements the real 1.5
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:17.320]  quadrillion it's one of the first things I learned when I lived with these
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.960]  elitists of the world for three years time the money is not that question some
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:24.440]  of these people were so wealthy they could have written to check for a
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:27.960]  million dollars a day the rest of their life and never spent their wealth the
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:32.520]  name of the game is controlled and people say to me so often on talk shows
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.440]  why would these elitists of the world destroy their own country where they
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:42.040]  live they aren't destroying their country they are bringing the country to its
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:46.840]  knees they bankrupt everything from the airlines to the railroads to what Alan
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.800]  Grayson talked about on the floor of the House of Representatives the other day
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:54.840]  they bring it to its knees so they can buy it on top it is on the dollar and
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:59.640]  they let you as taxpayers finance it through the Federal Reserve which is a
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:03.360]  total sham no more than the Federal Reserve no more part of the federal
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:08.000]  government than Federal Express is and in the end whether they're going to own
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.560]  every bit of this this this is their end goal is to bring the entire system in
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:18.920]  America and much of Europe also to its knees so that they can own it control it
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.200]  and then over a period of many years and maybe a few lifetimes they'll turn
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:26.640]  around and bring it back to the position it is right now under their
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.960]  control they aren't destroying their own country they are buying their own
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:33.760]  country through the Treasury of the United States of America through the
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:38.200]  Federal Reserve and you are going to give it to them if you sit down much
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:42.200]  longer you and your children are going to be slaves to the elitists of the
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:46.520]  world and these people have been wanting me of this now for the past number of

[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:01.320]  you up and said they know you're having a big effect me a leader watching you
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:06.200]  they brought you up I didn't I didn't bring you up to them Alex that it is
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:09.960]  creepy because I've got to do what I'm doing and you know I'm not perfect I'm
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:13.640]  a worldly guy you know I pray every day that God keep me on the straight and
[03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:18.840]  narrow but I don't willfully join in evil I don't like what the globalists are
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.240]  doing and it's so ruthless what they're doing and Lindsay were also saying that
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:27.240]  the elitist you talked to her a little bit freaked out as well because I it's
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:31.800]  one thing to be part of this corrupt system but as it nears its its its
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:36.920]  fruition and as this world satanic government is about to be openly born
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:41.480]  this eugenics government in their words of mass death and evil I've talked to
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:46.320]  major I've talked to a medical doctor I know the head of state she's treated
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:50.440]  and this head of state said I'm freaked out about what's about to happen
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:56.760]  Lindsay I mean repeat to the listeners what you just told me you want me to
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:03.880]  say this over the air this is interesting Alex I guess the best way to
[03:02:03.880 --> 03:02:10.680]  to punctuate this is to say misery loves company of course I've known these
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:15.320]  people for a number of years and they've never brought you up but all of a
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:20.320]  sudden you seem to be coming up in some of the emails I'm getting and I know as
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:23.520]  a result that you make you such a major impact out there right now the whole
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:29.600]  nation you know the year while back we traveled across the country and I would
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:34.280]  pick up no on the other part of all my pick up your radio program from here
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:39.280]  and yonder I mean you really are impact the nation no I understand but I mean
[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:44.040]  specifically it's creepy it's creepy to have them talking about you know they're
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:47.520]  examining me and you you yourself have gotten death threats I've gotten those
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:50.760]  as well but not death threats from these guys you got death threats from the
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:56.080]  other fella but I mean specifically here I mean well I know you're holding
[03:02:56.080 --> 03:02:59.720]  something back on me I mean you say they're bringing me up I mean in what
[03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:05.240]  context they're bringing you up in the fact that you're making such a okay I
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.440]  don't know where it would be millions that you're reaching or whether it would
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:12.440]  be the impact that you're making they didn't necessarily talk about the
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:16.480]  things that you're saying even though I'm sure that that's the bottom line of
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:22.040]  the whole thing but as I say misery loves company I'm glad you out there now so
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:27.080]  that we can all keep company together in in them knowing who we are and listening
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:32.560]  to what was it they're listening to your program they're monitoring you and I'm
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:37.160]  getting it next time okay the next time I get one of these emails in which you
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:42.000]  are alluded to I'll chip it off to you and have your produce to give it to you
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.600]  I'd like you to see what they're thinking about you well I appreciate
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:50.200]  you doing that I look look I'm not look I don't like having to confront David
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:54.800]  Rockefeller or have others on that do it I don't like having to talk about the
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:58.960]  Pentagon and Halliburton and Dinecore caught running child kidnapping rings
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:03.840]  but I mean you if you don't speak out against them it's approval and I can't
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:09.120]  have that on my soul on my on who I am I couldn't sleep at night I mean I do
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:15.000]  little things and later my conscience eats me up and I just can't help it and
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:18.920]  I you know I don't like that I get death threats I don't like that my family's
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:22.680]  in danger and all the stuff that I've had happen but I don't really talk about
[03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:26.720]  it on air but I mean I've I've got to be against these people I mean I don't know
[03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:31.800]  any other way you it's just what they're doing is fundamentally wrong Lindsay
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:40.040]  well it sure is and 35 years ago when I had been a pastor for church for 12 years and then I went to Alaska as an aviation
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:43.640]  missionary I've been brought up in a wonderful Christian home with godly
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:49.320]  parents never exposed to anything like the that's to do in this all these
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:52.760]  elitist and I sat in that board meetings for three years time and listen to what
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:56.800]  they had to say and now it's when I got through I felt such a moral obligation

[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:12.880]  alex jones show
[03:08:20.560 --> 03:08:26.560]  you know you read the Bible and it talks about the spirit of certain cities
[03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:31.280]  how cities had a wicked spirit or they felt bad the prophets would feel
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:35.320]  oppressed upon entering them and I remember in Sunday school not really
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:39.840]  understanding that and I was just talking during the break about jaren's like
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:45.120]  yeah I don't like going to the zoo it has a bad vibe and you go to Los the
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:50.640]  animals aren't happy you go to Los Angeles and everybody talks to I mean
[03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:55.160]  it has a I know we're actually on in Los Angeles not not bashing you know I
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:09:00.280]  love Malibu and the beautiful coast but there is a oppressive vibe some people
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:04.000]  like it that I've run into but very few I mean that there's like a spirit of
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:09.040]  evil and when I look at China and I see the things they do and I watch their
[03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:14.360]  party meetings on YouTube I mean this is and I know their works are so wicked
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:19.840]  and I and I and I see the works of cotton also DC has a horrible vibe I
[03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:23.800]  mean these are evil cities because they have evil in them and of course at a
[03:09:23.800 --> 03:09:28.260]  spiritual level how would you quantify that from a Christian perspective
[03:09:28.260 --> 03:09:33.120]  pastor Williams what I'm talking about about nations being turned over to evil
[03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:37.640]  cities being turned over to evil you know as a Christian you would say and I
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:42.600]  would say this isn't just that there is a feeling in the city from the you know
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:46.880]  group consciousness the group collective the the group subconscious as
[03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:50.160]  psychologists believe because you know they certainly pick it up as well they
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:54.080]  try to quantify it scientifically you would say there's actually a demon over
[03:09:54.080 --> 03:10:01.360]  that city wouldn't you turn his mouth murder more people installing it and
[03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:04.280]  we want to go and trade with them today and bring that spirit back to the
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:08.840]  United States of America I mean we're cutting our own throat they don't want
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:12.600]  to trade with us for the sake of being able to necessarily just sell us things
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:16.920]  now I don't know this is so strange but they want our technology every single
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:20.960]  time counterpillar general mortars anybody else goes on and builds a plant
[03:10:20.960 --> 03:10:25.960]  they say give us all off your patents give us all of your technology or we
[03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:29.840]  will not let you build a plant it's not the trade with America that they're
[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:34.400]  interested in they're interested in the technology and once they get it they'll
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:38.160]  turn around and throw it right back in our face just like the Japanese did we
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:42.960]  gave more of all steel prior to the last war and they turned around and shot it
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:46.760]  right back at all soldiers we're gonna have the same thing out of China mark my
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:51.920]  words and mr. farm said to me back nearly two years ago he said chaplain
[03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:55.160]  don't pay any attention to all of these other countries of the world he said
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:10:58.840]  even when there's a conflict over then the Middle East which of course by the
[03:10:58.840 --> 03:11:02.120]  way you've heard me say they want it in the next few months time if they can get
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:05.960]  it to take the attention off things he said don't pay attention to that he
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:09.880]  said that's not the real issue he said the real place you want to watch and
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:15.640]  these are his exact words he said China is the good one folks watch what's
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:21.040]  happening in China and Russia and we are improving that evil right to America
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:26.520]  Alex what did he specifically say dealing with China I mean just that
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:31.040]  they're gonna take us over or be used as the muscle or a war basically they're
[03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:35.320]  gonna take us over I don't think could be necessary he never okay I'll put it
[03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:38.400]  this way you know why they're taking over in war with the United States of
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:43.440]  America they're taking us over career is concerned he did mention the fact that
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:47.080]  they basically won't take us over they will get all of our technology they'll
[03:11:47.080 --> 03:11:52.880]  get everything from Boeing they'll learn I was still a bomber secrets they'll
[03:11:52.880 --> 03:11:56.640]  learn all the things they can by getting caterpillar and general murders and
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:00.920]  everybody else to go over there they'll get our computer technology and then
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:05.720]  once they've gotten it they'll say to me with you we don't need you around after
[03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:09.440]  I was my own murder murdered that many people years ago more than Stalin they
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:12.680]  wouldn't take a thing in the world about stealing all of our technology and then
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:17.440]  dropping us like a hot potato and turning those plants I watched them
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:22.800]  nationalize things many years ago when I was faster I watched the Bahamas
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:32.280]  nationalize our industry I mean Owens Corning had a huge farming adventure
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:37.880]  out there it was worth billions probably I used to see him fly out in the 707s
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:42.040]  on a regular basis when I was out there for seminars and then the Bahamas turned
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:45.440]  right around one day out of a clear blue sky for no known reason and said ah
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:49.600]  Americans you don't own this we never gave you the right to have it they took
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:53.880]  over every single bit of it and ran the Americans out the Chinese will do the
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:56.720]  identical same thing you want they've gotten all of our patents and our
[03:12:56.720 --> 03:13:01.280]  technology they will nationalize everything including out the industry
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:06.600]  that we've said over that in total bankruptcy by the time they've finished
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:13.240]  mark my words you cannot do business with a nation that has the background and
[03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:16.200]  history that this is but there again you've got to realize where all this
[03:13:16.200 --> 03:13:23.240]  started George Bush senior daddy Bush was the ambassador to China many years
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:28.240]  ago when China was a totally closed society nobody got in and out except him
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:33.240]  and George Bush started every bit of this his son finished it up when he was in
[03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:40.640]  there and now today we are seeing new world order global trade all of these
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:44.520]  agreements and it every bit started with daddy Bush many years I agree with you
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:48.720]  but he was the he was the admitted he was known as the Rockefeller Republican
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:53.640]  he was the direct legged or gopher of David Rockefeller who praises Malin the
[03:13:53.640 --> 03:13:56.720]  New York Times many other publications even after it's known that he's the
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:00.360]  greatest mass murderer in history and he was dispatched there they signed the
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:03.640]  eugenics agreement for the one-child policy they were then given unlimited
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:10.320]  funding and the CFR said you will now be given all the power and they they are
[03:14:10.320 --> 03:14:13.400]  going to use China to bring the United States down and people are like well we
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:18.840]  have this big military they can't the criminals run America the criminals run
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:24.840]  this country and and the Republicans and all of them have been bought off just
[03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:27.920]  like with Ron Brown was going to get in trouble Commerce Secretary for taking
[03:14:27.920 --> 03:14:31.920]  Chinese bribes and he was going to go public and they just you know blew his
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:35.320]  head off on board that airplane and then remote-controlled it into a mountain
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:38.720]  side and the coroner even went public at the Air Force and they said we don't
[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:45.440]  care I mean this country and and and and go back to 1979 when they gave up the
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:49.360]  Panama Canal and then Republicans went ahead with it why would we give them
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:54.760]  something we built because America isn't run by America okay that's what you

[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:39.680]  that's all being composed. Alex you're exactly right I want to punctuate what
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:42.560]  you said just a moment ago after I finished up with what I said about the
[03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:47.360]  Chinese they have talked with me over the years about what they're going to do
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:51.480]  little pieces here and little pieces yonder and the conclusion you've just
[03:15:51.480 --> 03:15:56.840]  come to is exactly right everything you just said and in my six DVD set please
[03:15:56.840 --> 03:16:02.600]  I beg you to get the latest CDs but my six DVD set by going to this in detail
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:06.920]  as to what these people have told me over a two-year period. Just to
[03:16:06.920 --> 03:16:10.920]  condense it about China is exactly right. Just to condense it though eugenics
[03:16:10.920 --> 03:16:15.840]  sterilization China is the beta test they submitted to the eugenics plan the
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:21.280]  Chinese leaders for 50 60 years talk about please nuke us we hate our people
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:25.000]  I mean they hate their population they're at war with them they're just big
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:30.040]  fat bloated ticks that just suck off their people and use them as slaves and
[03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:35.680]  the globalists are using the Chinese slaves to destroy our industry and now
[03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:39.960]  we're gonna find out all you yuppies that laugh and sent me thousands of
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:44.760]  emails over the years about how great China is enjoy it enjoy it you're gonna
[03:16:44.760 --> 03:16:49.480]  be just like the IBM engineers 15 years ago that would laugh at me when I'd be
[03:16:49.480 --> 03:16:55.040]  at the local pool you know community pool or the or the Dell engineers I'd say
[03:16:55.040 --> 03:16:57.840]  you know they're moving to China you know the plans to get rid of you and
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:00.600]  then they'd laugh and then years later they go I'm not laughing now my
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:05.000]  replacements are here I got six months and I'm gone at half pay and people say
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:08.640]  oh that's free market it's not free market when you went taxpayer funded
[03:17:08.640 --> 03:17:13.880]  Chinese or trained in engineering at our universities and then sent over there
[03:17:13.880 --> 03:17:20.320]  to work in slave wages it's a giant tariff on us I'm done talking about that
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:24.280]  let's cram in some calls I'm gonna skip this break here and then at the end I
[03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:27.880]  want to get into the gold predictions from Lindsay Williams Alicia in New York
[03:17:27.880 --> 03:17:31.960]  you're on the air go ahead can you hear me yes I can okay thank you very much
[03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:35.200]  Alex and Lindsay for taking my call thank you for everything you do and fighting
[03:17:35.200 --> 03:17:40.320]  the New World Order Berkey customer and prison-printed subscriber I have two
[03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:45.320]  quick questions one question is are you gonna say all 13 of those items online
[03:17:45.320 --> 03:17:52.120]  and on the phone and another one is there a way that the elite had given you
[03:17:52.120 --> 03:17:58.360]  any way to help us prove that he's not a natural born citizen his father was
[03:17:58.360 --> 03:18:03.720]  British is there any yeah I did this former oil company CEO say anything
[03:18:03.720 --> 03:18:09.160]  about Obama's providence where he really came from Mr. Farmer himself never
[03:18:09.160 --> 03:18:15.240]  mentioned that subject at all he did say that Obama was not necessarily that man
[03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:18.600]  and I kind of dropped off with that because then he became president so they
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:22.440]  didn't get their way now this new elitist friend of mine has been given me
[03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:28.320]  information lately yes he has gone into this in fact he's sent me up a number of
[03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:35.800]  emails relating to Mr. Obama and if you listen Obama is not necessarily doing
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:41.200]  everything they want and they didn't want upset at him and I was told that he
[03:18:41.200 --> 03:18:47.160]  better watch his step by Mr. Farmer but yet on this latest communication that
[03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:53.280]  I'm getting I don't know what might happen you know I just hope to goodness
[03:18:53.280 --> 03:18:56.600]  that nothing happens to Obama because they don't want to make a hero out of it
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:19:00.160]  and the last thing in the world that anybody should ever do is touch this
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:05.520]  man that is a wrong thing to do the elite a little upset over some of the
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:10.880]  things he's doing well they asked a human rights question during the press
[03:19:10.880 --> 03:19:14.360]  conference and the media acted like that was wrong and how dare that reporter
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:19.600]  asked about and it was a whitewash question anyways you know hey what why
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:23.360]  do you murder political dissidents and sell their organs to us companies you
[03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:26.560]  know wasn't a real question it's like how dare they ask something of the
[03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:32.440]  gracious bloodthirsty dictator it's just it tells you about our government
[03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:36.280]  that they don't criticize mass murder anymore I mean literally a Hitler is in
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:40.280]  America a Stalin is in America I mean they are just murdering people by the
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:44.000]  hundreds of thousands every year still over there they have giant slave camps
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:47.760]  everywhere they locked a third of their population up every night in giant
[03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:51.840]  prison cities I mean that's mainline news and our media says that might be a
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:55.440]  good idea at least you're good to hear from you George in Connecticut you're
[03:19:55.440 --> 03:20:02.240]  on the air yeah God bless you both I have a idea I mean why shouldn't we use
[03:20:02.240 --> 03:20:05.960]  the Alexandrian principle instead of going after the body go after the head
[03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:10.120]  as he did in his arm and when he went when he attacked people when I go after
[03:20:10.120 --> 03:20:13.440]  the elite is that they want communism let's confiscate the one percenters
[03:20:13.440 --> 03:20:17.080]  everything they have confiscate all the oil properties in the United States and
[03:20:17.080 --> 03:20:20.160]  only can be used within the United States oil and gas yeah well that's not
[03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:25.160]  the communism they want but I agree if we took the you know top 10th of that top
[03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:29.640]  percent the billionaires money and start going okay we want communism instead of
[03:20:29.640 --> 03:20:33.840]  like like WikiLeaks CIA run clearly it's about to release 2000 Swiss bank
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:38.240]  accounts of people that got 50 million 100 million no let's not burn mid-level
[03:20:38.240 --> 03:20:42.040]  low-level folks at the globalist want to gobble up into the tax thing and then
[03:20:42.040 --> 03:20:47.040]  and then and then give it to themselves by burning new vorice let's take the
[03:20:47.040 --> 03:20:50.560]  wealth of the Rockefellers let's take the wealth of Ted Turner let's take the
[03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:54.880]  wealth of Bill Gates let's see them actually go for that no no no that's
[03:20:54.880 --> 03:20:57.560]  not what they want and that's not going to happen Lindsey Williams what's your
[03:20:57.560 --> 03:21:02.760]  view on that well yes and look at what China is buying they're buying all the
[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:08.160]  gold all the gold mines all the silver all the silver mines they have okay
[03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:13.080]  people oftentimes ask me the elite as you knew them do they control China in
[03:21:13.080 --> 03:21:18.120]  Russia and countries like that positively they do let me say them
[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:21.600]  fatically they do it a little bit different way over there than what they
[03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:25.600]  do it here but you can see that the elite are importing all this gold and
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:30.280]  silver right into China because they know whose hands is falling into absolutely
[03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:34.360]  and they finance China to then go in and grab up 90 plus percent of rare earth
[03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:38.520]  minerals this is being done strategically and then quote US companies
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:42.280]  don't do it because they've moved to China and just like all the other big
[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:45.800]  companies are moving to the Middle East where there's no extradition what
[03:21:45.800 --> 03:21:51.720]  they've done is so dangerous that they are all bunkering down okay I mean folks
[03:21:51.720 --> 03:21:56.280]  I cannot stress that enough that Lindsey's absolutely right anything else
[03:21:56.280 --> 03:22:01.920]  George yeah then demand that the greenback come back and also demand that
[03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:06.960]  all these free energy devices hydrogen fuel for cars I've seen is all over the
[03:22:06.960 --> 03:22:10.800]  thing and also the Tesla rough things come out we we burgeon into a new
[03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:15.280]  society we would just bloom if we just did this we get exactly the elite spin
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:21.040]  all their time trying to suppress the total wealth generation of the modern
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:24.880]  industrialized society that's what Karl Marx admitted he said there'll be so much
[03:22:24.880 --> 03:22:28.760]  wealth and so much goods people will work like one hour a day but that but
[03:22:28.760 --> 03:22:34.000]  that's what communism was created by the bankers to block that because because
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:37.760]  they have to restrict wealth with artificial scarcity and restrict
[03:22:37.760 --> 03:22:43.680]  technology they are monopoly men they thrive on poverty and disease and death
[03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:48.480]  great points George quick comment on that Lindsey Williams yes exactly and
[03:22:48.480 --> 03:22:52.440]  watch China all they'll do is turn every take every move to this and turn
[03:22:52.440 --> 03:22:56.520]  around and gobble us up all we're waiting is to get all of our technology so
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:22:59.880]  they can do what they want to they're getting our gold and silver now how much
[03:22:59.880 --> 03:23:03.160]  is they buying I'll give you that in a few minutes be sure and take notes
[03:23:03.160 --> 03:23:06.640]  whenever I get the part about gold and silver and what just break it down now
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:09.840]  because we're almost out of time and I want to get to Nancy Angela and Lee and
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:18.120]  others go ahead break down the gold now yeah Lindsey is your phone cut now go
[03:23:18.120 --> 03:23:22.840]  ahead and cover the gold briefly now okay this is so important because back
[03:23:22.840 --> 03:23:28.040]  over two years ago I was on Alex Jones show and I was frustrated I was
[03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:31.840]  utterly flabbergasted one day when I was on the phone with one of these
[03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:37.040]  individuals and I said how am I going to be able to protect my family in light
[03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:40.840]  of our little things that you just told me that are going to happen and he said
[03:23:40.840 --> 03:23:44.680]  Chaplin it is only one way you can do it he said you can't do it with real
[03:23:44.680 --> 03:23:47.520]  estate you can't do it with stocks and bonds you can't do it with anything
[03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:51.040]  written on paper he said you can do it with our currency he said it's the one
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:55.360]  thing that'll never be touched and I said what is your currency and they said
[03:23:55.360 --> 03:24:00.960]  gold and silver I said what do you mean they said we don't trust paper if it's
[03:24:00.960 --> 03:24:05.640]  and this was expression if it's if it's written on a piece of papers worth the
[03:24:05.640 --> 03:24:09.960]  paper it's written on and I said do you mean by go I begged you back then when
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:13.680]  you could buy it for $700 an ounce for gold and you could buy silver for $10
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:17.920]  $12 an ounce I begged you to go and buy every piece you could get on getting
[03:24:17.920 --> 03:24:22.080]  your hands I'm sure you wish back then you had listened to my elitist friend not
[03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:27.720]  to me but to them okay here is what is happening right now this week comic
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:33.040]  silver exchange they were fullest into admitting just a few weeks ago now
[03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:37.440]  they're the ones that hold the silver for the super wealthy either China Russia
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:41.200]  super well-fielded world and they give them a piece of paper sling we have it
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:46.440]  in our vaults they were forced to admit that they have on hand only a hundred
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:51.120]  seven million ounces of silver if they have contractual obligations for
[03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:57.640]  720 million ounces of silver and some of the people who had them holding that
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:25:02.880]  silver for them got wind of this found out that it is true and on Friday the
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:11.120]  7th of December 7th of November it was wait a minute I'm sorry it was the 7th
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:18.440]  of December three individuals or four individuals not dealers demanded delivery
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:24.560]  of a million ounces of silver and it put the silver comic silver exchange into a
[03:25:24.560 --> 03:25:30.080]  tailspin as a result here is what has happened listen to these figures folks if
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:36.520]  you think $30 an ounce is high for silver you haven't seen anything listen to
[03:25:36.520 --> 03:25:43.800]  what just happened during the month of December the U.S. Mint sold that please
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:47.600]  note these figures right about during the month of December the U.S. Mint sold
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:54.720]  two million two hundred twenty-one thousand ounces of silver this is this
[03:25:54.720 --> 03:25:58.800]  has never happened before at an all-time record for the men of the United
[03:25:58.800 --> 03:26:02.920]  States from America something very scary is happening because in January that's
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:10.040]  right now the first 12 days of January that number surged by 50% and the
[03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:15.440]  United States Mint sold for the first 12 days of January three million four
[03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:19.600]  hundred and seven thousand ounces of silver more than sold during the entire
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:24.120]  month of December because everybody's buying it they're doing everything
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:29.280]  the Chinese they're getting the hands on all of it again why they see what's
[03:26:29.280 --> 03:26:36.960]  about to happen this isn't perfect with this Chinese dictators presence here in
[03:26:36.960 --> 03:26:40.480]  the United States of America didn't tell him what kind of deals he's cutting out
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:46.080]  there that we don't hear a thing about folks I asked this gentleman I said what
[03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:49.960]  can I do to protect my family he said there's only one thing you can do he
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:53.800]  said you've got to get gold and silver because when the new currency comes out
[03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:58.120]  you can take that golden silver and exchange it for the new currency and he
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:01.520]  said the old currency is going to be devaluated to the point you're going to
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:05.120]  lose most and by the way Lindsay to interrupt the stress to you if it's
[03:27:05.120 --> 03:27:09.640]  written on a piece of paper it's worth the paper it's written on and he said to
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:13.960]  me if you want to protect your family you've got to use a golden so that is
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:19.440]  golden silver Alex Lindsay you know the interesting thing is who Jen Tao would
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:25.440]  not be saying the dollars a thing of the past here's the AP headline who US China
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:30.400]  must respect sovereignty that means letting them take over in the east they're
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:33.480]  getting bases right off our coast I mean they're moving into Africa South
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:36.840]  America Central America Mexico now they're they're gonna build the higher
[03:27:36.840 --> 03:27:44.040]  speed rail in the West Coast I mean it's just incredible that China has been
[03:27:44.040 --> 03:27:48.000]  empowered and invested in by the globalist no regulations no nothing
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:53.080]  more regulations on us and then Obama plays this little shell game like Bush
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:56.720]  and Reagan and all of them did where they are always talking about China's
[03:27:56.720 --> 03:28:01.600]  got to fix its trade imbalance when our countries run by the main corporations
[03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:04.840]  that have moved over there they're not gonna get rid of that trade and balance
[03:28:04.840 --> 03:28:08.440]  it only gets bigger every month this was their plan this was their stated
[03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:13.760]  modern mercantilism which of course the French invented the British used for
[03:28:13.760 --> 03:28:17.480]  those don't know what mercantilism is is you don't let your colonies produce
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:20.600]  finished goods you only let them produce raw goods so you can keep the price
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:24.840]  real low rip them off not let them ever accumulate wealth and then take it to a
[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:29.520]  central country that you choose to have value added put into it or finished
[03:28:29.520 --> 03:28:34.640]  good and then that keeps your enemies deindustrialized one reason for 1776 is
[03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:38.200]  you weren't allowed to have a factory weren't allowed to put the metal end on
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:42.520]  a wood you know piece for a shovel that had to be done in England and they had
[03:28:42.520 --> 03:28:47.320]  taxes on everything look this is all old they do this over and over again and
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:52.520]  China's been chosen as as the main factory to shut everybody else down and
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:55.640]  we're gonna keep Lindsay Williams are gonna keep going because I want to go
[03:28:55.640 --> 03:29:00.880]  to break come back and take a few final phone calls with Lindsay but the you

[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:22.240]  the Americans train them break their will we're sticking our hands down their
[03:29:22.240 --> 03:29:26.400]  pants we're putting telescreens in we're transferring over to authoritarianism
[03:29:26.400 --> 03:29:30.720]  we're gonna grovel and say your tyranny is good you know literally get up on top

[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:20.800]  Nancy Angela Lee and Felix that'll be it Nancy you're on the air worldwide go
[03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:27.240]  ahead hi Alex hi Lindsey I just have a question for you Lindsey if your elite
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:31.560]  friends are giving you all this information then they must want it to be
[03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:38.520]  made public is that correct and if they do which side are they on are they on
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:43.480]  the elite side or are they on the people side you are correct in your
[03:35:43.480 --> 03:35:47.640]  supposition one of the things I learned when I live with the elite was that
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:51.120]  they have code of ethics and one of the facets of that code of ethics is they
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:54.520]  must tell the world everything they're going to do before they do it they know
[03:35:54.520 --> 03:35:58.480]  the coverage that Alex Jones has they know I'm on Alex Jones show on a regular
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:36:02.480]  basis they listen to Alex it's voodoo let me just interrupt Lindsey I'm saying
[03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:07.880]  much of this they feel I'm all obligated according to that moral code they feel an
[03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:12.360]  obligation to get this out to the world is the only thing I can understand and
[03:36:12.360 --> 03:36:15.920]  then they'll turn around later and say we told you so why didn't you listen no
[03:36:15.920 --> 03:36:23.760]  exactly that's why eight years ago the outgoing head of the Federal Reserve I
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:29.600]  am well he he wasn't even outgoing then Greenspan kept talking about irrational
[03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:33.960]  exuberance Iraq when he'd gotten rid of Glass-Steagall when he was the author of
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:37.600]  so much that happened he was an anti-new-world order pro-golden silver
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:42.880]  guy in the 70s and was very popular and hung out with Ayn Rand and you know the
[03:36:42.880 --> 03:36:49.080]  Ron Paul type crew and he sold out to the dark side and here's the deal it's
[03:36:49.080 --> 03:36:54.360]  the vampire code I'm not saying they're literal vampires they're psychic vampires
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:37:00.000]  a vampire must trick you to invite them into your house so they'll show up not
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:04.840]  bearing their fangs at night and knock and say ma I'm a neighbor mind if I come
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:10.400]  in and you've got to say you are welcome or the vampire in mythology all over the
[03:37:10.400 --> 03:37:16.400]  world this archetypal and they use you know allegories for these archetypal
[03:37:16.400 --> 03:37:20.720]  things to explain it to people but whether it was Greece or Japan or the
[03:37:20.720 --> 03:37:26.480]  Mesoamerican Mayan culture the vampires always came and said do you invite me
[03:37:26.480 --> 03:37:32.920]  into your home am I invited and it's a trick and but they've got to do it it's
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:36.400]  like their religion and you've got to say yes you are invited once you've let
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:40.160]  them in and it's a spiritual thing it's like Lindsay said we've let the spirit
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:45.120]  of China in we've underwritten it we've confirmed it we will now go under it we
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:51.480]  will now live as they do once you submit to something once you join with it you
[03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:55.400]  know it's kind of like a Sauriman and Lord of the Rings is saying you know we
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:38:00.960]  must join Gandalf with Mordor it is you know the new ages upon us and he says
[03:38:00.960 --> 03:38:05.200]  you know since when did Sauriman the wise you know give up reason for madness
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:09.800]  and that's what this is they are all over the news we must join with
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:15.440]  authoritarianism we must it's good we must join with the torture and so a lot
[03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:18.200]  of these people to you even though they've been high-powered they still
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:22.160]  like our duel you know they don't like what's happening but they like the power
[03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:26.320]  plus they're in it to survive and win I'm sorry I'm going wild here but I mean
[03:38:26.320 --> 03:38:31.400]  explaining their psychology and so they just they enjoy it's it's it's an
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:35.880]  entertainment for them like a cat has a mouse playing with it before it eats it
[03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:41.080]  but they also believe almost in like a demonic chivalry and what do they do in
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:47.280]  chivalry they say on guard on guard on guard on guard I'm about to attack you
[03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:51.320]  on guard and so they're saying on guard I'm we're going to set up world
[03:38:51.320 --> 03:38:54.680]  government and kill you on guard here's all the Rockefeller foundations we're
[03:38:54.680 --> 03:38:58.120]  putting poisons in your vaccines on guard and then they say look at these
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:01.040]  idiots we tell them we're killing them and they still won't stand up and fight
[03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:05.440]  they want to die they are profane and then elitist call me and say off record
[03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:09.640]  can we talk and I'm a journalist a person I don't you know you know betray
[03:39:09.640 --> 03:39:15.240]  confidence was a look of a specific crime then I would have to and and they
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:19.280]  say Alex the general public wants to be slaves don't you understand you have to
[03:39:19.280 --> 03:39:23.720]  join with the New World Order because we understand that you know we're moral we
[03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:28.520]  actually work together the profane they don't this is all Illuminati type stuff
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:33.760]  folks Alex you're exactly right I live for these people for three years and it
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:37.280]  took me three years time to even comprehend the mindset of these people
[03:39:37.280 --> 03:39:41.400]  and I wrote three books trying my best to help the American people understand
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:45.240]  the mindset of the elite is very difficult for the average person to
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:48.880]  understand that that could be somebody so diabolically wicked that they would
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:52.800]  control nations and currencies and tell the effect what to do and tell the
[03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:57.360]  president what bills to put through in Congress but they do people please
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:40:01.240]  believe what you're hearing Alex say right now I live with these people
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:04.960]  stay in the dorms with them set across the dinner table from them and
[03:40:04.960 --> 03:40:12.200]  everything you just heard Alex Jones say is true well Lindsay we better get to a
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:16.800]  few more calls I wish it wasn't true but it is reality is reality thank you
[03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:19.920]  Nancy hope that answers the question Angela and Louisiana you're on the air
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:24.840]  go ahead hi yes I'm calling with a couple of questions my first one is for
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:30.680]  the currency when the currency is going to crash before the New World currency
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:36.920]  comes in will our currency any way to devalue we will be able to purchase this
[03:40:36.920 --> 03:40:41.240]  new currency with our dollar they're going to continue to slowly devalue it
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:45.880]  over and over again until they offer a new currency as a way to get out of the
[03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:48.720]  old currency that's been wrecked and they're starting to say they're going
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:52.360]  to blame it on a false flag internet attack as if it all happened overnight
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:56.600]  and tyranny will protect us from this ever happening again and we'll still
[03:40:56.600 --> 03:41:02.080]  have dollars they'll just be denominated and controlled by the IMF World Bank OECD
[03:41:02.080 --> 03:41:07.280]  as the new band core which is a digital currency transcending the nation now
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:11.360]  we'll be fully beholden to the offshore central banks Lindsey Williams you
[03:41:11.360 --> 03:41:14.320]  heard that you can maintain the purchasing power of your present
[03:41:14.320 --> 03:41:18.280]  currency is to buy gold and silver today immediately you should have bought it two
[03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:22.120]  years ago but if you didn't you've got to go down and get it I mean right this
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:26.560]  minute listen to who advertises on Alex programs and buy from a block because
[03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:31.520]  I have been turned and I'm telling it to you you can take that golden silver
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:37.000]  he'll have the same purchasing power the same value even though golden silver is
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:39.880]  going to go up three four thousand dollars an ounce it was going to go up to
[03:41:39.880 --> 03:41:43.400]  forty fifty dollars sixty dollars an ounce but yet you can turn around and
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:48.200]  and treat that for the new currency whatever it may be world or whatever it
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:52.040]  may be and maintain your same purchasing power and that is the only thing you
[03:41:52.040 --> 03:41:56.720]  can do it with your dollar is going to devalue you so rapidly from this point on
[03:41:56.720 --> 03:42:00.200]  you are going to be spot all well Lindsey that's what's so frustrating
[03:42:00.200 --> 03:42:05.720]  about this is that I get emails every day going why do you want me to go to
[03:42:05.720 --> 03:42:10.800]  Midas Resources and buy gold and silver if if my fellow reserves or notes are so
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:17.520]  worthless and then they giggle like they've made some big point it's like a
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:22.640]  two-year-old you know being able to the letter a and being proud of it but it's
[03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:25.600]  not cute because they're even wrong it's like a two-year-old looking at the
[03:42:25.600 --> 03:42:30.520]  letter a and saying it's the letter c or the letter z they don't understand
[03:42:30.520 --> 03:42:38.560]  obviously the currency as it's devalued is that's then manifested by the golden
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:44.080]  silver going up in the overall price not because it's gone up but because the
[03:42:44.080 --> 03:42:54.200]  currency has now gone down and so and so by week out of every dollar at the
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:43:00.120]  gas pump you lost three dollars last week on toilet tissue at the grocery
[03:43:00.120 --> 03:43:04.560]  store I know I went to buy it he did go to the inflation's accelerating the only
[03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:08.440]  thing to change was the purchasing power of the currency you lost three cents at
[03:43:08.440 --> 03:43:12.040]  the gas pump you lost three dollars in the grocery store no I know but Lindsey
[03:43:12.040 --> 03:43:15.160]  it's like they're under a trance just finishing this simple point you just
[03:43:15.160 --> 03:43:19.280]  made it beautifully but to quantify it because I see this so much and I'll see
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:23.440]  it on YouTube and people try to explain it to them and they just don't get it we
[03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:28.560]  take the fellow reserve notes minus resources does buys gold whatever price
[03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:33.280]  it is and then with any little meager product profits run the network or with
[03:43:33.280 --> 03:43:36.720]  with profits buy gold for ourselves and silver I mean that's what I do you know
[03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:40.360]  it's my emergency backup that's what I only promote what I believe in and but
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:42.960]  these people think why do you want my fellow reserve notes if they're not
[03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:47.440]  worth anything that's still the global currency so you take that and you buy
[03:43:47.440 --> 03:43:51.920]  gold and silver for yourself and then as the currencies devalued your gold and
[03:43:51.920 --> 03:43:56.320]  silver will reflect whatever the new currencies value is and so it freezes
[03:43:56.320 --> 03:44:01.560]  the value of the labor you put in to get the energy credit symbols that of
[03:44:01.560 --> 03:44:05.320]  those fellow reserve notes now you're putting it into a real commodity that
[03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:10.960]  transcends the fractional reserve banking system so that now you are freezing
[03:44:10.960 --> 03:44:16.120]  your wealth against inflation it may actually go up may go down a little but
[03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:20.760]  overall it's freezing it and I don't understand how people that can't
[03:44:20.760 --> 03:44:23.760]  understand this Lindsey I mean it's almost like you're under a spell I have
[03:44:23.760 --> 03:44:29.120]  family I have family right I have family that and I want you to comment on this
[03:44:29.120 --> 03:44:34.480]  who I told ten years ago buy gold and silver they laughed at me you know when
[03:44:34.480 --> 03:44:38.880]  gold when silver was five dollars gold was 260 I have family that when it was
[03:44:38.880 --> 03:44:42.920]  500 they laughed at me when it was 800 they laughed when it was a thousand when
[03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:48.960]  it's 1400 they cannot buy it they must do what the stockbroker says they must
[03:44:48.960 --> 03:44:54.400]  lose money it's like being an idiot they see it as a as a cloak of power a
[03:44:54.400 --> 03:44:58.880]  being conned is the smart thing to do can you I mean I mean is that just given
[03:44:58.880 --> 03:45:05.000]  over to delusion no let me they are obsessed with the stockbroker and with
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:10.640]  and what the national media says to them listen to me Abraham trusted in
[03:45:10.640 --> 03:45:15.200]  golden silver Moses trusted in golden silver if you're a Christian go to your
[03:45:15.200 --> 03:45:20.320]  Bible and see what the streets of heaven are paid with for goodness sakes look
[03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:25.080]  where God's value is it's definitely not in federal reserve notes and pieces of
[03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:29.320]  paper now spread over and over and over every time Alex let me show I'll
[03:45:29.320 --> 03:45:33.080]  probably say it if it's worth it if it's written on a piece of paper it's worth
[03:45:33.080 --> 03:45:36.880]  the paper it's written on all right anything else Angela we got to go here
[03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:39.880]  in just a minute and I appreciate you calling anything else I just wanted to
[03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:43.560]  know if Lindsay had any new information I live on the Gulf Coast in South
[03:45:43.560 --> 03:45:47.800]  Louisiana if he heard anything more about the Gulf okay don't it's still
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:51.520]  spilling okay there's all sorts of leaks still down there they fractured the
[03:45:51.520 --> 03:45:55.720]  ocean floor correct Lindsay they're just covering it up the facts of the ocean
[03:45:55.720 --> 03:46:01.760]  floor and the core exit is the most dangerous part and in a lifetime we'll
[03:46:01.760 --> 03:46:05.240]  never get away from the danger that's been done by it and yes there's still a
[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:08.280]  lot of information coming out is yesterday have shut up on the media
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:12.720]  talking about it whatsoever but yes still there all right gotta move quick
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:17.080]  here real fast Lee in Kentucky thanks for holding go ahead brother how you
[03:46:17.080 --> 03:46:22.600]  doing good quick I got a quick statement and a quick question my statement is as
[03:46:22.600 --> 03:46:26.920]  a veteran myself I just want to say that I feel very betrayed by my country it's
[03:46:26.920 --> 03:46:31.480]  first-time caller been listened to your program for about two years Lee it's not
[03:46:31.480 --> 03:46:35.400]  your country it's been taken over by foreign banks and the Chinese or their
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:40.760]  muscle men that they've brought in to be our owners well you're exactly right and
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:44.880]  I want to salute you for serving on the frontline and fighting this battle for
[03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:48.960]  us for so for so long and my prayers will be with you and your family my
[03:46:48.960 --> 03:46:54.480]  question is for a pastor Williams does he have any a matter of fact for both of
[03:46:54.480 --> 03:46:59.000]  you do you have any time frame as far as when you think this new currency will be
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:02.760]  issued will it be through a banking holiday and one other question for the
[03:47:02.760 --> 03:47:07.200]  pastor is with a one-world government and a one-world currency we also will have
[03:47:07.200 --> 03:47:11.080]  a one-world religion or church and does he have any news or information as far
[03:47:11.080 --> 03:47:18.680]  as that goes I've been given a date I was given it back two years ago and I gave
[03:47:18.680 --> 03:47:22.560]  it again every time I've been on Alex Sean show the dollar will be dead by the
[03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:26.880]  end of 2012 if the elite have their way please I beg you to put that down
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:31.160]  besides your calendar the dollar will be dead by the end of 2012 as far as the
[03:47:31.160 --> 03:47:36.040]  world religion is concerned I covered that in about a 20-minute segment on my
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:41.360]  DVD set and when I talked about the devil must I or my goodness Alex you
[03:47:41.360 --> 03:47:44.440]  were fascinated by this one day on your program back about a year and a half
[03:47:44.440 --> 03:47:49.200]  ago when we talked about that they had used an expression to me one day the
[03:47:49.200 --> 03:47:55.000]  devil's Messiah now this goes all the way to Europe the European Union so many
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  preachers have been tricked into believing that's the ten-toe kingdom of
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:03.680]  the Antichrist and as a result it went up to 11 12 13 and 14 the countries that
[03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:06.920]  joined it and then the preachers were totally embarrassed this is what the
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:11.200]  elitist left to do over a period of time watch the European Union the euro will
[03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:15.320]  eventually crash and from the time that the euro crashes you've got three weeks
[03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:20.560]  please hear this you've got a timetable here I'm giving you a buzzword or a
[03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:24.800]  warning within three weeks at the time you see the euro crash you've got to get
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:27.800]  out of paper if you don't more than likely you'll lose it all right let me
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:31.200]  comment on what Lisa we're gonna go to Felix come back into a few more
[03:48:31.200 --> 03:48:34.680]  minutes and I will play the ultimate red pill to end the hour because I promise
[03:48:34.680 --> 03:48:38.600]  to play it and we've been getting requests for it and again password
[03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:44.360]  Lindsay Williams is our guest we are live it is January 19th Wednesday January
[03:48:44.360 --> 03:48:52.040]  19th 2011 to answer that question folks they're not going to get rid of the
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:56.800]  dollar you're not gonna go to the bank one day and get you know silver money
[03:48:56.800 --> 03:49:00.520]  or something or blue money though they are changing the colors to get you and
[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:06.040]  they admit to get you ready for changes down the road the dollar will no
[03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:10.360]  longer be the global currency just like the peso never was never will be in
[03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:15.240]  Mexico just like the ruble never was never you know it's probably going to
[03:49:15.240 --> 03:49:22.040]  be the dollar has been the only global currency in history before that it was
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:27.360]  silver and gold didn't matter if you were in Japan or in Russia or in England or
[03:49:27.360 --> 03:49:34.680]  the US you know 235 years ago everybody knew what a silver or gold coin was
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:39.120]  worth globally okay and everything was denominated in that and if you were
[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:43.760]  buying little cheap goods it'd be denominated in copper or other metals
[03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:49.120]  you know a penny you go in 230 years ago with you know two pennies and get a
[03:49:49.120 --> 03:49:53.360]  you know decent you know bowl of soup with your beer or whatever I've you know
[03:49:53.360 --> 03:49:58.160]  with the local pub in England so all of that's going on you're gonna have a
[03:49:58.160 --> 03:50:03.800]  global cashless system where you the post office is already denominated in
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:10.400]  international freight because we ship worldwide here it says SDRs okay and
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:15.280]  that is the new global currency it's already in operation and the basket of
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:22.280]  the SDR is IMF World Bank receivership collateral and now they're saying the
[03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:25.680]  Chinese currency and they're saying we're gonna completely abandon the dollar
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:29.960]  so they're not just saying it's gonna be a basket that's been the transition the
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:36.720]  dollars gone so then it devalues like a peso then we go to a new dollar that's
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:40.000]  SDR backed but instead of being controlled by the Federal Reserve it's
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:44.840]  only a regional arm of the banking cartel it's directly controlled by the OECD
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:51.440]  at Brussels okay directly by Europe who controls and finances China who controls
[03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:55.840]  and finances Russia the whole system and they've always hated America because
[03:50:55.840 --> 03:51:00.440]  we got liberty here they want to destroy us and hang up patriots by our necks and

[03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:13.840]  finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[03:52:13.840 --> 03:52:18.000]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:23.080]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[03:52:23.080 --> 03:52:28.120]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full the Republic identifies the
[03:52:28.120 --> 03:52:32.920]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[03:52:32.920 --> 03:52:37.640]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke
[03:52:37.640 --> 03:52:41.640]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do
[03:52:41.640 --> 03:52:45.400]  we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[03:54:16.040 --> 03:54:19.520]  I want to say great job to the crew today. We only got about two minutes left and
[03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:23.880]  I'm going to this powerful video slash audio the ultimate red pill. I want to
[03:54:23.880 --> 03:54:27.100]  thank Patrick Lindsey Williams for being with us as well. Leigh I heard the
[03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:30.960]  pannier voice saying I feel betrayed by my government. It's our government was
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:34.840]  taken over. I mean we don't have the Republic. It's not the government doing
[03:54:34.840 --> 03:54:39.160]  this. It's hijacking criminals who are up in the government saying if you're a
[03:54:39.160 --> 03:54:42.880]  conservative, a libertarian, if you don't like torture, if you don't like tyranny,
[03:54:42.880 --> 03:54:47.880]  if you don't like open borders, you're an enemy. And these terrorists are gonna
[03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:50.960]  stage terror attacks and blame it on us and they're gonna try to come after us.
[03:54:50.960 --> 03:54:54.960]  The good news is we've woke up too many people. They're not gonna they may have
[03:54:54.960 --> 03:54:58.840]  most the public watching porn 24 hours a day and getting drunk and acting like
[03:54:58.840 --> 03:55:02.480]  little kids. A lot of us aren't little kids and aren't a bunch of decadent
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:06.720]  slobs. That doesn't mean I'm perfect but you know want to eat a big steak and
[03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:10.200]  watch a football game and drink a bunch of beer. The point is we got to get
[03:55:10.200 --> 03:55:14.600]  focused all of us. We got to get serious real fast. Felix in Texas you know what
[03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:17.040]  I'm out of time. I can't even get to Felix because I've got to get to this
[03:55:17.040 --> 03:55:20.760]  video. Felix I promise next time Lindsey's here you'll be front of the line.
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:26.400]  Lindsey Williams, I've got to go now but I will talk to you very, very soon.
[03:55:26.400 --> 03:55:30.080]  ProphecyClub.com with all your great material and information. Our books and
[03:55:30.080 --> 03:55:35.000]  films and materials, infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv. We've only got about 20
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:39.160]  seconds Lindsey but I just want to hear your voice and say bye. I appreciate
[03:55:39.160 --> 03:55:40.480]  you joining us today.
[03:55:40.480 --> 03:55:45.360]  Touch your spiritual house in order if you don't remember anything that I said

[03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:56.240]  your relationship with Jesus Christ before you do anything else. Know you
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:56:00.960]  are born again. Absolutely we're out of time. Lindsey we'll talk to you soon.
[03:56:00.960 --> 03:56:04.400]  Absolutely we'll talk to you soon. Look what happened to Israel over and over again
[03:56:04.400 --> 03:56:07.360]  when they became decadent. They were conquered and went into bondage. It
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:17.360]  happens to every country. God bless you Lindsey. Here's the ultimate red pill.
[03:56:18.360 --> 03:56:23.360]  No talk about politics or religion. This is all the influence of enemy propaganda
[03:56:23.360 --> 03:56:28.800]  rolling across the picket line. Lay down GI, lay down GI. We saw it all through the
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:33.400]  20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize that we
[03:56:33.400 --> 03:56:36.800]  should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze. We should not
[03:56:36.800 --> 03:56:41.280]  submit to dehumanization. I don't know about you but I'm concerned with what's
[03:56:41.280 --> 03:56:45.200]  happening in this world. I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:49.600]  the systems of control. Those that control my life and those that seek to control me.
[03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:54.800]  Even more. I want freedom. That's what I want and that's what you should want.
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:57:02.800]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn this into just some of the greedy, the hatred, the envy, and yes the insecurities because that is the central mode of control.
[03:57:02.800 --> 03:57:09.800]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:14.800]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale. Start
[03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:19.800]  challenging this corporate slave state. The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[03:57:19.800 --> 03:57:24.800]  Not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and you do the notion of giving it
[03:57:24.800 --> 03:57:30.800]  classism, statism, and all the rest of the modes of control. It's going to be the age of human crime
[03:57:30.800 --> 03:57:35.800]  standing up for something pure and something right. What a bunch of garbage, liberal,
[03:57:35.800 --> 03:57:40.800]  democratic, conservative, Republican. It's all there to control you two sides of the same coin.
[03:57:40.800 --> 03:57:46.800]  Two management teams getting for control, the CEO job of slavery and
[03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:50.800]  calculated. The truth is out there in front of you but they lay out this buffet of lies.
[03:57:50.800 --> 03:57:54.800]  I'm sick of it and I'm not going to take a bite out of it. Do you got me?
[03:57:54.800 --> 03:58:01.800]  The resistance is back. Human kind is too good. We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[03:58:01.800 --> 03:58:06.800]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings. We're going to be real things.
[03:58:06.800 --> 03:58:12.800]  The things that matter. Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[03:58:12.800 --> 03:58:15.800]  Well that's it. That's all I got to say. Continue your coin.
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:22.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the ultimate red pill. If you're a radio
[03:58:22.800 --> 03:58:27.800]  listener and want to see it, just type the ultimate red pill into YouTube or
[03:58:27.800 --> 03:58:34.800]  anywhere else and you will find it. And I'll also get Marley, one of our great web
[03:58:34.800 --> 03:58:39.800]  masters and my darling sister, to post it up at infowars.com on the front page.
[03:58:39.800 --> 03:58:50.800]  Tomorrow live, 11 a.m. Central on air, online and on demand. We are the GCN Radio Network.
