[00:00.000 --> 00:10.520]  It's Danger Zone, alright? Hard to believe. August 7th, crashing through the lies and
[00:10.520 --> 00:21.200]  disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Sunday, August 7th, 2016 will
[00:21.200 --> 00:26.640]  be here for the next two hours. I want to start out with a four minute report that just
[00:26.640 --> 00:31.520]  co-lates admissions of how they stole the election from Sanders, how they stole other
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.680]  elections, and then Obama responding to Info Wars and Trump in a press conference he gave
[00:36.680 --> 00:42.440]  late Thursday before going to Martha's Vineyard. And then when we come back, as promised, starting
[00:42.440 --> 00:49.000]  to burrow into the actual data, we're going to prove to you about the private secret consortium
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.800]  that decides who wins elections and has been the same group since the 1960s. This is all
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.120]  coming up. This is what President Obama doesn't want you to know about. He slipped up big time
[01:00.120 --> 01:04.160]  in his press conference. This is a huge opportunity. Here's the report.
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.600]  Mr. President, repeatedly now Donald Trump has said that this election will be rigged
[01:08.600 --> 01:16.480]  against him, challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system. Can you promise
[01:16.480 --> 01:21.480]  the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way? And are you worried
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.520]  that comments like his could erode the President's faith in the outcome of the election? And
[01:26.520 --> 01:30.680]  if he does win, given that you've just declared him unfit, what will you say to the American
[01:30.680 --> 01:31.680]  people?
[01:31.680 --> 01:39.880]  Well, at the end of the day, it's the American people's decision. I have one vote. I have
[01:39.880 --> 01:46.640]  the same vote you do. I have the same vote that all the voters who are eligible all across
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.800]  the country have. I've offered my opinion, but ultimately it's the American people's
[01:51.800 --> 01:57.840]  decision to make collectively. And if somebody wins the election and they are President,
[01:57.840 --> 02:03.320]  then my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual
[02:03.320 --> 02:15.360]  and do everything I can to help them succeed. It is... I don't even really know where to
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.720]  start on answering this question. Of course, the elections will not be rigged. What does
[02:20.720 --> 02:31.400]  that mean? The federal government doesn't run the election process. States and cities
[02:31.400 --> 02:37.440]  and communities all across the country, they're the ones who set up the voting systems and
[02:37.440 --> 02:45.320]  the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is
[02:45.320 --> 03:00.120]  being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's
[03:00.120 --> 03:06.480]  not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make
[03:06.480 --> 03:12.480]  any sense. And I don't think anybody would take that seriously. Now, we do take seriously,
[03:12.480 --> 03:19.720]  as we always do, our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process.
[03:19.720 --> 03:28.160]  If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, then we inform those
[03:28.160 --> 03:35.680]  local authorities who are running the elections that they need to be careful. If we see jurisdictions
[03:35.680 --> 03:46.520]  that are violating federal laws in terms of equal access and aren't providing ramps
[03:46.520 --> 03:53.000]  for disabled voters, or are discriminating in some fashion, or are otherwise violating
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.880]  civil rights laws, then the Justice Department will come in and take care of that. But this
[03:58.880 --> 04:09.720]  will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our
[04:09.720 --> 04:16.760]  lives have played sports, or maybe just played in a school yard or a sandbox. And sometimes
[04:16.760 --> 04:21.800]  folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated. But I've never heard
[04:21.800 --> 04:29.400]  of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over, or before the score
[04:29.400 --> 04:38.560]  is even tally. So my suggestion would be, you know, go out there and try to win the
[04:38.560 --> 04:49.000]  election. If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and ends up losing, then maybe
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.520]  he can raise some questions. Okay, we're going to leave it right there because you just
[04:53.520 --> 04:56.640]  stepped in it with that statement about maybe then he could raise some questions, didn't
[04:56.640 --> 04:58.680]  you, Lord Obama?

[06:10.560 --> 06:29.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:29.080 --> 06:34.280]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday worldwide broadcast, the 7th day of August
[06:34.280 --> 06:42.360]  2016. Now I'm going to be completely open with everyone as I always am. The evidence
[06:42.360 --> 06:49.400]  of total orchestrated fraud against the American people and against our voting process is so
[06:49.400 --> 06:57.680]  completely butt naked and so incredibly overwhelming that when I came up here today and did basically
[06:57.680 --> 07:04.120]  hours of research last night and this morning and hours of work here today to present to
[07:04.120 --> 07:10.280]  you what I'm about to cover, I started having an anxiety attack about 30 minutes ago and
[07:10.280 --> 07:16.400]  by the way I've never had anxiety attacks in my whole life, but shortness of breath almost
[07:16.400 --> 07:20.960]  panicking. And the reason I tell you that is because this is what you're supposed to
[07:20.960 --> 07:27.920]  do when you come face to face with total criminality. Your body has a response that it wants to
[07:27.920 --> 07:34.560]  do something about it and that's been described by police officers no matter how seasoned
[07:34.560 --> 07:39.040]  they are. They open a trunk up and there's a dead kid with maggots all over them. You
[07:39.040 --> 07:42.480]  know they have an anxiety attack, they start throwing up right there on the spot. That
[07:42.480 --> 07:48.680]  is a normal response when you go down in somebody's basement and you pull up the floorboards
[07:48.680 --> 07:56.680]  and there's 15 dead bodies and it's the instinct, it's the will to not just take corruption
[07:56.680 --> 08:04.160]  like it's no big deal and accept it that separates three societies from enslaved societies because
[08:04.160 --> 08:09.760]  you can say what you want about the United States and its history, but we strove and
[08:09.760 --> 08:16.360]  led the world along with England on ending slavery. We strove and created the most patents,
[08:16.360 --> 08:22.280]  the most inventions, the lowest taxes, the most innovation. That's why we were so special
[08:22.280 --> 08:28.280]  and people wanted to come here. And we're seeing that reverse, we're seeing that being
[08:28.280 --> 08:38.960]  dismantled today. Now I already knew all the information I'm about to present, but it's
[08:38.960 --> 08:48.240]  kind of like having an old dusty photo album in your closet up on the top shelf and every
[08:48.240 --> 08:53.280]  few months you're digging around the closet and you see it up there on the shelf, but
[08:53.280 --> 08:59.160]  why don't you pull down the old photo album? Because you know you're going to be crying
[08:59.160 --> 09:05.040]  when you see grandma and grandpa or maybe a brother or sister you lost or you see photos
[09:05.040 --> 09:10.400]  of the family at the beach back in happier times and that's really what my job's like
[09:10.400 --> 09:15.720]  and I'm not complaining about it. I knew all this in the last 21 years on air, 25 years
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.640]  politically involved. When I first got politically involved, witnessing election fraud that was
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.960]  even in the newspapers and confirmed here in Travis County, Austin, Texas. Oh yeah,
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.840]  even then I caught election fraud with my cohorts and we challenged at the state level
[09:30.840 --> 09:35.080]  and they admitted fraud but still certified it. Still certified the Republican primary
[09:35.080 --> 09:43.440]  against Pat Buchanan. I witnessed it. And when I sat there in the last few weeks, recolating
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.560]  all the election fraud data, recolating who runs the elections, recolating how they stole
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.440]  it from Bernie Sanders and tried with Trump. Some of it was just flashbacks from six months
[09:53.440 --> 09:58.840]  ago. Other stuff was 20 years ago and I was up here today shooting special reports that
[09:58.840 --> 10:03.200]  we're going to be putting out that I know have a giant effect. I mean the White House
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.240]  Media Matters came out and said 48 hours after Jones comes out with his measures to Trump,
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.360]  Trump comes out word for word and says I only won because of landslides. They tried to steal
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.480]  the primary from me. They did from Sanders. They're going to try to do it again. We're
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.200]  going to be exposing it and we are going to be exposing it. We're going to be putting
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.880]  the reports out and the research out and then you're going to see that push the American
[10:25.880 --> 10:33.400]  people and I'm not going to get into inside baseball here but I think it tells you everything
[10:33.400 --> 10:40.000]  you need to know about Donald Trump that he's getting his research and info from the grass
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.960]  roots and proven sources and not from multinational globalist organizations that are basically
[10:45.960 --> 10:56.840]  advising Hillary Clinton and the facts we roll out, the facts we expose are incontrovertible.
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.560]  So I'm not again tooting our horn here. I am just making the announcement to all the
[11:00.560 --> 11:04.880]  new viewers and radio listeners that info wars isn't playing games and when you are
[11:04.880 --> 11:13.800]  hearing this information, you are getting next level absolute cutting edge intel. Now
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.240]  I want to just play this short mashup because we played with the president said earlier.
[11:17.240 --> 11:21.400]  I want to play the short mashup dealing with election fraud just with the current stuff
[11:21.400 --> 11:25.680]  that happened the last few months interspersed with Obama's speech Thursday where he said
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.880]  now listen, this stuff comes out of Texas, this conspiracy theory. Texas runs its elections
[11:32.880 --> 11:39.720]  and they're republicans. So why are you saying there's fraud as if we're not talking about
[11:39.720 --> 11:46.480]  the national election in Ohio and Florida and other battleground states where we know
[11:46.480 --> 11:51.360]  the democrats have been engaged in massive fraud and republicans have to remember exposing
[11:51.360 --> 12:02.240]  that we just cover it like we see it. But in front of the whole world you saw Bernie Sanders
[12:02.240 --> 12:08.480]  win more than 10 states like New Hampshire and like California and they said, sorry,
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.040]  it doesn't matter. You won. The super delegates aren't going to be for you. We even interviewed
[12:13.040 --> 12:16.320]  some of the super delegates who go, yeah, it doesn't matter if he wins the popular vote.
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.680]  We're putting Hillary in and you saw the republicans try that. So see they've miscalculated
[12:22.680 --> 12:27.960]  and tried to hide this in plain view. Obama has come out and said, don't worry if he's
[12:27.960 --> 12:34.040]  15 points ahead in polls but he loses then he's got a case of fraud. The same people
[12:34.040 --> 12:43.880]  that run the polls are the same ones that will be calling it and I'm going to prove
[12:43.880 --> 12:56.640]  that in one moment. You understand AP and Reuters and CNN and CBS and ABC and NBC run
[12:56.640 --> 13:04.040]  the private secret organization that announces the winners. And I knew all this but I was
[13:04.040 --> 13:09.280]  going back over just how real it is and I was for the same groups in 64 and how they
[13:09.280 --> 13:14.240]  keep changing the name to confuse the public. It is amazing. So you're going to discover
[13:14.240 --> 13:19.920]  that coming up in the next segment. But first here's Obama. Mr. Trump, I'm not going to
[13:19.920 --> 13:24.120]  lay things out here that you don't already know. It's last Saturday. But I am going to
[13:24.120 --> 13:30.800]  ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.600]  primaries and one of the central issues to defeating her in November. And I'm telling
[13:36.600 --> 13:40.400]  you November 8th we better be careful because that election is going to be rigged. First
[13:40.400 --> 13:44.760]  of all it's rigged and I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.
[13:44.760 --> 13:49.000]  And I hope the republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us. America
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.400]  teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy. But what? You actually believe
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.040]  that they have democratic elections there? If Hillary steals the nomination and then
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.280]  she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it
[14:04.280 --> 14:11.400]  must be thrown out. Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.120]  from the very beginning by this democratic party. It has been rigged. The political party
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.240]  has chosen their nominee, not the general public. That's very popular belief. Then why
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.160]  about holding the primaries? That's a very good question. It is clearly the case that
[14:26.160 --> 14:31.520]  when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly proposed Hillary Clinton to be the
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.840]  nominee obviously and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.960]  and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done. When did the press see
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.960]  it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful? Actually I think that's part
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.680]  of it. And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud and guess
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.840]  what there is, she stole the nomination. Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[14:54.840 --> 14:59.800]  What does that mean? How would the party pick a new nominee? Today is the day. They're
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.560]  really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket. He now looks increasingly
[15:04.560 --> 15:10.080]  like the kamikaze kid, an implosion, the likes of which I have never seen. The biggest
[15:10.080 --> 15:14.940]  problem we have is we have a very dishonest media. If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there
[15:14.940 --> 15:26.920]  is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like
[15:26.920 --> 15:33.120]  Texas, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense and I don't think anybody would
[15:33.120 --> 15:41.040]  take that seriously. There you go folks. Now when we come back we're going to tell you
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.240]  who announced all those states that Bernie won for Hillary. It's the same group that's
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.840]  going to announce the winner coming up in November. They don't want you to know the
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.640]  name of this group. And what you're about to hear, if you get the info out, we'll destroy
[15:55.640 --> 15:56.640]  them.
[15:56.640 --> 16:20.200]  Welcome to the Info War. It's so easy to get these incredible

[17:07.360 --> 17:12.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.680]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[17:17.680 --> 17:23.200]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees
[17:23.200 --> 17:27.800]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[17:27.800 --> 17:28.800]  parasites.

[20:02.000 --> 20:18.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.880 --> 20:26.000]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas. We're broadcasting worldwide. This is the
[20:26.000 --> 20:35.840]  info war and you are the resistance.
[20:35.840 --> 20:42.520]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[20:42.520 --> 20:43.520]  the info war.
[20:43.520 --> 20:50.920]  All right, Dave McStain. The threat is real is the song of his new album dealing with
[20:50.920 --> 20:57.480]  deep love was bringing ISIS into the country. He asked me to co-write the album with it.
[20:57.480 --> 21:03.680]  I was too busy. I'm not name dropping. But I don't think you needed my help. I wish I
[21:03.680 --> 21:07.760]  would have done that because this is the guy that wrote most Metallica's earlier stuff
[21:07.760 --> 21:14.040]  like the Four Horsemen. Oh my gosh. One last breath. The four wind blows. Better raise your
[21:14.040 --> 21:20.560]  ears. The sound of hooves knock at your door. Lock up your wife and children now. It's time
[21:20.560 --> 21:27.200]  to wheel the blade because now you've got some company. Horsemen are drawing nearer. Let
[21:27.200 --> 21:29.200]  us DJ ride.
[21:29.200 --> 21:36.200]  I don't know why I just gave that fact to it. A little secret fact to it. Not bragging
[21:36.200 --> 21:37.200]  just fact.
[21:37.200 --> 21:42.520]  It's fun to be in the fight against the globalist. I thought I was even too busy. It's like,
[21:42.520 --> 21:47.040]  how am I going to help Dave Mustaine write his next album? I mean, I think you can handle
[21:47.040 --> 21:53.200]  it, Dave. He didn't name an album. Two albums before that end game. And did talk about my
[21:53.200 --> 21:55.920]  film Endgame, Blueprint for Global and Slave is what the album is based on. But it's not
[21:55.920 --> 22:02.640]  about bragging. It's about realizing that culturally we are having the biggest effect
[22:02.640 --> 22:06.600]  out there as a counter narrative of the New World Order. Because we understand history
[22:06.600 --> 22:11.440]  and sociology and anthropology and who the New World Order are, what they're doing, what
[22:11.440 --> 22:19.000]  their plan is. But as I basically got into it earlier, it's like, because I did this
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.360]  actually Friday, you pull down some of those old family albums. And man, when you see your
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.800]  old grandma that's been gone for a decade, you see your old grandpa that's been gone
[22:28.800 --> 22:32.920]  20 years, and you think about how sweet they were, you think about the things they said
[22:32.920 --> 22:38.600]  to you, how amazing it would have been to know them as a grown up man or a grown up
[22:38.600 --> 22:43.880]  woman. I don't mean 20 something years old. I mean, there's a 40, 50 year old man. They're
[22:43.880 --> 22:49.080]  just so cool. My dad's dad, my mom's dad too, as well. My dad's dad was so, so manly without
[22:49.080 --> 22:52.960]  even trying to be. It was just like walking the room. Everybody would just turn around.
[22:52.960 --> 22:58.640]  It was just like the presence. And what would men like that do today? Probably nothing because
[22:58.640 --> 23:07.160]  they're so humble. They don't think of themselves as fighting a tyranny that's their own government.
[23:07.160 --> 23:11.360]  I mean, sure, my dad's dad was a B17 pilot decorated in World War Two. But again, that
[23:11.360 --> 23:14.600]  was directed by the government to go off and fight. And sure, he ran as a Republican and
[23:14.600 --> 23:20.760]  won for local state office, you know, for part of the Civil Rights Act. But so I guess
[23:20.760 --> 23:25.600]  he would have been politically involved and was. But what would the greatest generation
[23:25.600 --> 23:32.400]  do today face with what we see? I don't know. They were the greatest generation. I think
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.560]  1776 might have been that. But I tell you, they're a hell of a lot better than what
[23:35.560 --> 23:40.200]  we become. And I'm not knocking the average person, but on average, we become a bunch
[23:40.200 --> 23:46.600]  of slovenly people culturally. We don't appreciate our heritage. We don't stand up for our birthright.
[23:46.600 --> 23:55.440]  We've been overrun by tyrants, by multinationals, by globalists. And so the last couple of weeks
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.200]  because I knew I had to do this, I had to make elections for the central issue. I had
[23:59.200 --> 24:06.280]  to push with my contacts to get that done. I had to put the evidence together. We've
[24:06.280 --> 24:11.160]  already put out more than 10 articles, seven or eight big videos, special reports, and
[24:11.160 --> 24:18.280]  more is coming. And the good news is all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that
[24:18.280 --> 24:24.720]  good men and women do nothing. We've been standing up. We've been speaking out and it's
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.680]  become the number one election issue now is election fraud. And will they steal it from
[24:29.680 --> 24:37.240]  Trump? And that's a debate they can't win because we have the internal polling numbers.
[24:37.240 --> 24:41.800]  We have the fake polls they're putting out and the methodology of them. It's public.
[24:41.800 --> 24:46.940]  And we have the social media numbers. And we know Trump is conservatively 10 points
[24:46.940 --> 24:54.560]  ahead nationally. You add to that the closeted factor of a lot of people being scared to
[24:54.560 --> 24:58.640]  vote for him or admit they're voting for him because of political correctness. We're
[24:58.640 --> 25:05.160]  talking seven points with most experts agree. We're talking 17 points super whopper wins.
[25:05.160 --> 25:08.520]  Now there's electoral college obviously in battleground states are more democratic in
[25:08.520 --> 25:15.080]  some areas like California and Pennsylvania. But if he doesn't win Florida, you know the
[25:15.080 --> 25:21.640]  fix is in. And we're not just gonna sit here and let election fraud take place. And that's
[25:21.640 --> 25:28.120]  the main message that I've been getting at here. Now next segment is I want to have plenty
[25:28.120 --> 25:34.000]  of time is when I'm going to come in with a focused live report to you. And I'm going
[25:34.000 --> 25:45.360]  to lay out who really puts out the fake polls and who is announcing the election because
[25:45.360 --> 25:53.360]  Obama really screwed the pooch when he said this at the end of his answer at the press
[25:53.360 --> 25:58.760]  conference at the Pentagon. When he said, oh, you know, election fraud, what's that?
[25:58.760 --> 26:04.600]  And then, oh, well, if he's got 15 points ahead and then loses, then oh, oh, the polls
[26:04.600 --> 26:12.760]  are what exactly. And we know your polls are as valuable as use toilet paper. Obama here
[26:12.760 --> 26:21.840]  is. If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and ends up losing, then, you
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.640]  know, maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn't seem to be the case at the moment.
[26:27.640 --> 26:39.400]  I have you now. I talked to someone close to Donald Trump two weeks ago, a source, a
[26:39.400 --> 26:50.880]  Trump source that cannot be argued with. And this individual told me he was very concerned
[26:50.880 --> 26:56.960]  about election fraud and we had a long discussion about it. And he concurred with my analysis
[26:56.960 --> 27:01.880]  and what should be done about. And I said, we're going to put together the data, which
[27:01.880 --> 27:07.680]  I know they're already aware of. Just as an augmented file, a humet briefing here in
[27:07.680 --> 27:14.520]  the resistance. And that's what this is. See, you don't go out and join some agency to be
[27:14.520 --> 27:18.920]  part of the Cloak and Dagger. You don't, you go there to be controlled and subjugated.
[27:18.920 --> 27:23.480]  When you join the Republic and the truth and take action, there isn't a uniform. There
[27:23.480 --> 27:30.840]  isn't a little gold stars. There isn't, there's the fact you've actually joined a real fraternity
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.040]  of people. They're going to fight for this Republic to the end. And people know in that
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.320]  fraternity, I'm real. I'll never backed off. I've never given in not to threats on anything.
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.720]  And that's nothing really special, except at this day and age, I guess it is. But I
[27:43.720 --> 27:48.960]  want viewers and listeners to know something. If you want to join this fraternity, if you
[27:48.960 --> 27:53.440]  want to be part of this, all you got to do is start telling the truth and take an action.
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.280]  And whether it's at a very small level at your local level or in a big way at the national
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.000]  level, it doesn't matter. All of it together will bring the new world order down. You want
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.680]  to go up against the globalists. You want to fight their tyranny. You want to experience
[28:07.680 --> 28:14.960]  it. They're waiting for you right now. And what's crazy is they don't have the spirit
[28:14.960 --> 28:21.280]  of liberty with them. They're afraid of us. And when we actually take the field, it's
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.640]  incredible. You will experience providence when they just fall down in front of you.
[28:25.640 --> 28:29.840]  The problem is good men never stand up as Thomas Jefferson said, all that evil men in
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.520]  tyranny, the flourishes, the good men and women do nothing. And that's why they're panicking
[28:35.520 --> 28:43.120]  and putting out fake polls. Obama screwed up big time and hung his hat on the polls
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.960]  and said, oh, as long as they say Hillary's going to win, you don't question things. Well,
[28:47.960 --> 28:53.320]  guess what? We have the polls and they're admitted frauds. They admit they're fraudulent.
[28:53.320 --> 29:00.920]  Now the big secret, who runs the elections coming up? Harry Reid wants CIA to give Trump
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.160]  fake intelligence briefings. The Democratic Senate Minority Leader, Harry Reid, said
[29:06.160 --> 29:12.840]  he would rather see the CIA and other intelligence agencies give GOP nominee Donald Trump fake
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.840]  briefings than to make sure he's informed before potentially becoming president. Reid
[29:17.840 --> 29:22.880]  suggested that it would be risky to divulge classified information pertaining to national
[29:22.880 --> 29:28.360]  security to Trump so it should just be faked. Even more incredulous is the fact that Reid
[29:28.360 --> 29:34.200]  is the one accusing Trump of being, quote, dangerous. Trump is due to receive intelligence
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.160]  briefings in the coming weeks as is Clinton. It is standard procedure for both candidates
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.480]  to have limited updates so they're somewhat prepared to take office when the time comes.

[33:47.560 --> 33:54.560]  in the next 30 minutes with Breaking News from All Things Election 2016 and Planet Trump.
[33:54.560 --> 34:00.360]  We have a special report that has all the documentation. I'm going to go over a lot
[34:00.360 --> 34:06.560]  of it here. It's going to be up by tonight at infowarsteam.com and prisonplanet.com exposing
[34:06.560 --> 34:14.800]  the private corporate consortium that announces who wins the elections nationwide because Obama
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.960]  in his press conference said two different things that were key. He said local governments
[34:19.960 --> 34:27.360]  announced who the winners are and the media. And it's ridiculous why Republicans run places
[34:27.360 --> 34:35.440]  like Texas but not battleground states. See, total deception. Then he says, look, if he's
[34:35.440 --> 34:39.600]  won about 15 points in polls, Freudian slips because our numbers are he's about 15 points
[34:39.600 --> 34:47.760]  ahead. And then he loses. Well, then he's got a point to make the polls in AP and Reuters,
[34:47.760 --> 34:58.480]  Thompson Reuters and NBC and CBS and CNN are all run by the same consortium that announces
[34:58.480 --> 35:06.840]  who the winner is. It's unbelievable. And I sit there when I was at the RNC. I'd be
[35:06.840 --> 35:12.560]  talking to senators, congressmen, you name it. And they were like, how does that work?
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.560]  Yeah, the media, they lie. They announced another winner when it's not. I'm like, it's
[35:17.560 --> 35:21.880]  voter news services. And then it was changed to this. And they're like, oh, okay, son,
[35:21.880 --> 35:28.000]  I like your show. I mean, I would sit there at the restaurant waiting for my plane with
[35:28.000 --> 35:37.240]  congresspeople. And they just didn't get it. And they weren't playing dumb. They didn't
[35:37.240 --> 35:42.360]  know. And so I'm not excited about the fact that, wow, info wars knows this and no one
[35:42.360 --> 35:48.600]  else seems to. It freaks me out. So before I get into the fraudulent polls, let's get
[35:48.600 --> 35:54.680]  in first. And then I've got some really exciting news dealing with landslide evidence for Trump.
[35:54.680 --> 35:58.840]  Let's start with voter news services. Okay, now I learned about this from the Collier brothers.
[35:58.840 --> 36:05.040]  They both mysteriously died right after I started interviewing him in the mid nineties. And
[36:05.040 --> 36:07.520]  of course, I've interviewed their daughter many times. We should get back on. She's one
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.920]  of the top election products experts out there. And I've interviewed Bev Harris, who had the
[36:11.920 --> 36:18.080]  hacking democracy documentary on on HBO. She's a Democrat, but she'll admit both parties
[36:18.080 --> 36:23.240]  do it. And we're getting her back on. And remember, though, Obama said this doesn't
[36:23.240 --> 36:28.520]  last. Well, let me tell you what does exist. Okay. The sun that came up this morning. Now
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.360]  this is from Wikipedia. You say, we're competing to have fake entries, whatever. This info
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.200]  I know from own research is accurate. And it has links to a bibliography where you can
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.160]  go see it for yourself. And there's other places where you can research voter news services.
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.760]  Films and books have been made, but it's so foggy and secretive. Most people don't even
[36:44.760 --> 36:48.360]  know it exists. Kind of like the Federal Reserve is not federal. Most folks don't know it's
[36:48.360 --> 36:56.280]  a consortium of six banks. Okay, so let's go ahead and go over this for everybody. Voter
[36:56.280 --> 37:03.000]  News Services was an exit polling consortium formed in 1990 by six major US news media
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.040]  organizations. Its mission was to provide results for the United States presidential
[37:06.040 --> 37:10.640]  election so that individual organizations and networks would not have to do exit polling
[37:10.640 --> 37:16.400]  and vote tallying in parallel. Yeah, I don't have everybody check. Just have it magically
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.400]  announced by guys at the top of a building guarded by the CIA in New York. That's what
[37:21.400 --> 37:26.960]  happens. And then even Wikipedia with mainstream news links goes through every election being
[37:26.960 --> 37:33.000]  a fraud and computer glitches. And so it gets disbanded over and over again in a new group
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.720]  gets formed basically every election, but it's the same group. Let me read this to you.
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.280]  And it goes through each election. Why they get disbanded 2000 2004 goes right through
[37:45.280 --> 37:52.240]  it. It says in 2002, V&S intended to make calls in the November US Congressional and
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.600]  Senate elections. It attempted to use a computer designed by V&S by an outside contractor to
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.480]  do this. A system failure always happens occurred in the computer on election night, making
[38:01.480 --> 38:05.520]  quick delivery of data impossible. In fact, collecting and delivery, the data took 10
[38:05.520 --> 38:10.000]  months. So no one knows why it got announced, but it turned out to be a fraud. In January
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.880]  2003, the voter service was disbanded largely because of failures in 2002. V&S editor director
[38:17.880 --> 38:23.960]  criticized the decision as making V&S escape. Go. Then it goes on in 2004 presidential election,
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.200]  a new organization called National Election Pool. Guess what? They just changed the name
[38:29.200 --> 38:44.880]  again. Raise that a moment was set up by the same organizations in 1963. JFK was not cold.
[38:44.880 --> 38:53.320]  And within a month, they had created this AP polling service that would have now sued
[38:53.320 --> 38:58.480]  one. That got a bunch of heat for election fraud. So then they created other groups and
[38:58.480 --> 39:11.040]  names always run by the same people. In 1990, it's voter news services. By 2003, it's national
[39:11.040 --> 39:16.880]  election pool and then the same group. We don't know when, but the last few years changed
[39:16.880 --> 39:25.840]  the name again to Edison Research. So you want to know when they said the AP met the
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.160]  day before the California primary, the key final primary and decided Bernie Sanders,
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.440]  you know, AP, why AP says it goes to Sanders as the headline AP. And they said, oh, we
[39:35.440 --> 39:38.880]  went to a super delegate meeting in a rich guy's house and they just said they weren't
[39:38.880 --> 39:42.840]  going to go for Sanders. So it didn't matter. So we asked who was for Sanders, who wasn't
[39:42.840 --> 39:48.360]  and then collated and it was Hillary winning by 67%. And then that was in the New York Daily
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.160]  News. In fact, I covered it Friday. Maybe you guys can grab it on the pile. But I mean,
[39:53.160 --> 40:00.920]  it's crazy. It's the same group. Now, when I say Reuters is involved, Thompson Reuters
[40:00.920 --> 40:07.040]  has this contract to do polling with AP and then that's the Brits that are basically running
[40:07.040 --> 40:13.960]  that. You know how against Trump, they are British government. So Obama, we played the
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.720]  clip earlier. Maybe I'm putting you guys on the spot, but can you like, it's the three
[40:17.720 --> 40:21.680]  minute clip. It's like in the middle there where he next table will play it where he
[40:21.680 --> 40:26.720]  says, well, I mean, we got local governments are announcing who's the winner. And every
[40:26.720 --> 40:31.440]  time it comes out a month later, oh, really, this person went Ohio, but VNS said it was
[40:31.440 --> 40:37.600]  this or or whatever the Anderson said it was this or voter pool said it was this. And it's
[40:37.600 --> 40:43.400]  just like, it's all just magicians distracting you with the pretty lady in the lingerie.
[40:43.400 --> 40:46.340]  And then you're like, wow, where'd the rabbit come from out of the hat? Well, there's a
[40:46.340 --> 40:50.960]  table with a trap door in it. And I'm just here going, look, here's the trap door. Here's
[40:50.960 --> 40:57.920]  the rabbit. Here's how they work. Here's how they do it. And then it gets worse. There
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.960]  does AP count. Clinton has delegates to win Democratic nomination day before, then they
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.640]  just give it to her and then match the numbers up even though Sanders won because that'd
[41:07.640 --> 41:15.280]  be embarrassing. The AP met the night before to announce the winner. And then Trump dares
[41:15.280 --> 41:20.880]  talk about it. So he's the big cook. Now let's continue here. Let's go over this.
[41:20.880 --> 41:27.100]  This is the goodness. I'm going to cover this in the next segment. Shock poll. Reuters radically
[41:27.100 --> 41:34.360]  changes methodology to favor Clinton. And the polls showed a 17 point swing. And you
[41:34.360 --> 41:41.640]  know why it did? Because I've got a copy of it right here. Let me let me show TV viewers.
[41:41.640 --> 41:50.480]  This is from Reuters and AP. They're all doing the same crap. They sampled 650 Democrats
[41:50.480 --> 41:55.960]  that they knew were Democrats when they called them versus 496 Republicans. So that's a hundred
[41:55.960 --> 42:09.680]  and 54 more Democrats were polled to then give her that lead from her behind to her ahead.
[42:09.680 --> 42:14.680]  I mean, and they put it down. So used to they hide it and get caught. So now they just put
[42:14.680 --> 42:20.320]  it there like it's no big deal. This is how con artists operate and it's poll after poll
[42:20.320 --> 42:27.360]  after poll. Shock poll. Pat Cadell blast Reuters back rigging polls to show Clinton up. Oh,
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.600]  yeah, they're also going back to old polls and change this. But now, despite all the
[42:31.600 --> 42:40.240]  fraud, Reuters baffled as Clinton's lead over Trump suddenly evaporates using the same methodology.
[42:40.240 --> 42:47.160]  He's only three points ahead of Trump, meaning he's like 15 ahead of it right now. Wow. Wow.
[42:47.160 --> 42:52.240]  We're going to come back and give you the biggest news yet that shows a landslide for
[42:52.240 --> 42:58.640]  Donald Trump. Now that's in the real world, though, in fantasy land. If you ever wanted
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.040]  a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low
[43:03.040 --> 43:07.360]  price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,

[43:17.760 --> 43:22.760]  run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.600]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[43:27.600 --> 43:31.000]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.400]  this week. Solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.880]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.200]  to the low price for info wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to

[47:03.200 --> 47:30.480]  to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones. I'm not kidding. In the
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.400]  last week I've seen comments on info wars dot com in the comment sections I've seen
[47:34.400 --> 47:40.800]  on YouTube. I've seen emails that come in and you think it's a joke and it's like Alex,
[47:40.800 --> 47:46.160]  why aren't you talking about the cross human animal clones that they've just legalized
[47:46.160 --> 47:51.320]  this week? It's like when people stopped me on the street and go, why aren't you talking
[47:51.320 --> 47:58.160]  about the private federal reserve? It'd be like calling in today and saying, why aren't
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.360]  you talking about election fraud? Or why aren't you wearing a navy blue sports jacket? I am
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.920]  wearing a navy blue sports jacket. It's like the more you expose stuff, there's like this
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.720]  weird mind control where you're not exposing it. And then I've had family and friends and
[48:12.720 --> 48:20.800]  people on the street go, Alex, have you heard human animal clones are being made? And I'm
[48:20.800 --> 48:25.800]  like, oh my God, they've put the dosage of that out on the news to the point where people
[48:25.800 --> 48:32.920]  that are in a sleep state are now being told they've been had human animal clones for 30
[48:32.920 --> 48:38.880]  years. They're just getting ready to show everybody. I was talking to one engineer about
[48:38.880 --> 48:43.880]  how they have doors on the sides of the cows and they just open them up and just put the
[48:43.880 --> 48:49.840]  seedling humanoids in, but they have no rights because they're part cow. So the cow doesn't
[48:49.840 --> 48:56.080]  reject it, part human, and they can grow them up to like 20, 30 pounds and then they harvest
[48:56.080 --> 49:00.640]  them. And I've been harping on this for like 18 years since I learned of it. And yeah,
[49:00.640 --> 49:05.760]  it was in the AP this week. That's why everybody's talking about it. You know, US government legalizes
[49:05.760 --> 49:13.240]  human animal hybrids. So it's like, oh my gosh, did you hear? Alex, it's called, it's
[49:13.240 --> 49:18.480]  called, it's some voter news service that announces, I mean, it's crazy. Yes, I know
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.320]  the Federal Reserve is private. Yes, I know they're creating human animal clones. Yes,
[49:23.320 --> 49:28.480]  I know they're geoengineering and spraying aluminum dioxide on us and radioactive isotopes.
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.360]  I don't know the full program. I don't know exactly why they're doing it. I know the trees
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.200]  are dying all over the planet. Okay, I don't know who these people are. I don't understand
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.240]  it, but I've reverse engineered it. And yes, I know. And let me tell you, they're bad news.
[49:42.240 --> 49:49.520]  Yeah, it's the NIH moves to lift moratorium on animal human chimera research. Maybe they'll
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.480]  lift the ban on building automobiles. I mean, it's like, my point is this stuff's going
[49:53.480 --> 50:02.720]  on everywhere. And I'm not tuning my horn. I don't get the cognitive dissidents where
[50:02.720 --> 50:09.680]  we do exit polls in Democrat areas at eight out of 10. And I'm, it's more than that sometimes.
[50:09.680 --> 50:16.440]  You can't find Hillary supports. She has like 500 people on average at her rallies. Trump
[50:16.440 --> 50:22.280]  has 30,000. Sanders has 20,000. I don't need to know they're fixing polls to know this
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.840]  woman's not popular. You go, look, and they admittedly are fixing it. They think we're
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.280]  so dumb. They go, yeah, we pull 15% more Democrats than Republicans and then say who's going to
[50:30.280 --> 50:43.360]  win the election? What? And then I harp for at least 18 years because I read one BBC news
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.640]  article on air about how they've been cloning humans and animals, splicing them for decades.
[50:48.640 --> 50:51.680]  And then all these white papers got milled to me by listeners, you know, that was in,
[50:51.680 --> 50:58.040]  you know, genetic research firms and stuff. Then I just realized, stop talking about it.
[50:58.040 --> 51:05.920]  The public doesn't believe you. 25 years ago, they had part spider, part goats at US facilities
[51:05.920 --> 51:10.960]  all over the United States creating body armor. And still, if I talk about it, they have
[51:10.960 --> 51:17.240]  national news saying I'm insane. So I can't even people admit the federal reserves private.
[51:17.240 --> 51:20.880]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I mean, the election is admittedly staged. They have
[51:20.880 --> 51:25.280]  this private consortium that announces who the winners are, the same folks that announced
[51:25.280 --> 51:29.400]  who the winners were in the primaries. The difference was Trump didn't buy it. People
[51:29.400 --> 51:33.240]  knew he was winning. They had to back off. Wow. Somebody stands up and they've got to
[51:33.240 --> 51:39.960]  back off. Wow. That's incredible. But let's play Obama where he really stepped in and
[51:39.960 --> 51:50.680]  then the big news when he says, Hey, locals tabulate who the winners are. No, they don't.
[51:50.680 --> 51:58.800]  Other news services does. The county send it to them at a coordinator at the state level
[51:58.800 --> 52:04.640]  and then no one challenges it. And voter services again was the old name. Then they changed
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.240]  it's a national election pool and now they've changed the name to Edison Research. It'll
[52:09.240 --> 52:18.240]  be a new name tomorrow. Trying to hide this. But let's play Obama. Here it is.
[52:18.240 --> 52:25.240]  Of course, the elections will not be raked. What does that mean? The federal government
[52:25.240 --> 52:34.720]  doesn't run the election process. States and cities and communities all across the country.
[52:34.720 --> 52:40.680]  They're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is
[52:40.680 --> 52:52.440]  suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[52:52.440 --> 53:03.280]  including in places like Texas where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting
[53:03.280 --> 53:07.880]  booths. That's ridiculous. That doesn't make it. Let's stop there. I don't think anybody
[53:07.880 --> 53:11.560]  knows. And he goes on to say if he loses by, you know, he's winning by 15 and polls that
[53:11.560 --> 53:15.040]  loses, then there's an issue. The polls are run by the same people that announce who wins
[53:15.040 --> 53:20.520]  and they're admittedly giving a 15 point lead. See, he gives it away. He knows the methodology,
[53:20.520 --> 53:25.640]  the orders that have gone out. Hillary's emails have been public for a month, a little less
[53:25.640 --> 53:30.840]  like 25 days. And they admit those are her emails. They change the subject and say it's
[53:30.840 --> 53:35.000]  the Russians. So, you know, oh, it's bad. But no, they go, yeah, okay, that's our emails.
[53:35.000 --> 53:42.040]  It's Wasserman Schultz, Debbie Wasserman Schultz saying to AP and Reuters and CNN and everybody
[53:42.040 --> 53:50.120]  else how to engage in deception, how to shut everybody down. And how to have Bernie Sanders
[53:50.120 --> 53:54.040]  blame for Trump rallies because they have Hillary people dressed up like Bernie Sanders supporters
[53:54.040 --> 53:57.440]  and then go start a riot. Why do you do that? You can blame it on Trump. You can blame it
[53:57.440 --> 54:01.980]  on Sanders. Hillary's outside of it to make sure those two groups don't get together after
[54:01.980 --> 54:07.480]  Hillary stills the nomination. This is called chess, folks. It's called Machiavelli. It's
[54:07.480 --> 54:11.640]  not hard to think three moves ahead. I can think 50 moves. I don't understand. You can
[54:11.640 --> 54:15.480]  do it too. If you just start trying, you can do it. It's actually your brain's designed
[54:15.480 --> 54:21.640]  to do it. But you have to want to do it and then you'll be no longer blind. But the globalists
[54:21.640 --> 54:26.800]  want to keep you in the dark so they can control you. I don't think if humanity is like mushrooms,
[54:26.800 --> 54:31.680]  you keep in the dark and you feed them horse manure. But you have to decide to not act
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.840]  like a mushroom. And I'm not condescending to our audience. I mean all the new listeners
[54:35.840 --> 54:39.760]  and the media people and all these illusion folks in the establishment that think you're
[54:39.760 --> 54:44.040]  going along with a system that's screwing over humanity that you're going to get ahead
[54:44.040 --> 54:55.640]  that way. That's why society's getting so bad. So in his answer, he tells you everything.
[54:55.640 --> 55:00.360]  They're going to try to steal the election with 15-point skewed numbers for Hillary.
[55:00.360 --> 55:07.680]  They've been caught. And he just told you how they're doing. Trump's at least 10 points
[55:07.680 --> 55:15.000]  ahead, folks. At least. People are so sick of the establishment they would elect a turnip
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.800]  other than Hillary. Everybody knows that. Now, I haven't gotten to this yet, but I'm
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.620]  going to get to it in the next segment. And when I saw this, I'm like, why wasn't I thinking
[55:25.620 --> 55:28.920]  of that? Because that's totally true. Gateway pundit edited. It's a bite bar article up
[55:28.920 --> 55:34.440]  on drudgeport.com. Social media patterns show Trump is looking at a landslide victory.
[55:34.440 --> 55:40.800]  And you know, we have 3 million followers on Facebook alone on our channels. 150 million.
[55:40.800 --> 55:46.160]  It seems to be a billion views on just one channel on YouTube. 1.5 million subscribers
[55:46.160 --> 55:49.840]  on one channel. And the point is, is that I know social media. And this is absolutely
[55:49.840 --> 55:52.840]  true. In fact, these numbers they get aren't even the best ones to get. I'm going to have
[55:52.840 --> 55:55.480]  Paul Watson or somebody actually go to the other social media and show you the real
[55:55.480 --> 56:01.280]  numbers. I'm not knocking this article. It's just much worse than this. Hillary on her
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.200]  live streams has a few thousand people watching. She has less likes on Facebook with Trump,
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.800]  with them gaming Facebook, blocking everything, admitting they're blocking it, blocking Google.
[56:09.800 --> 56:15.800]  Won't even list him as a presidential candidate on Google. And he still has in many cases
[56:15.800 --> 56:21.880]  5 to 10 times more than Hillary does. And if you add that together from past elections
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.320]  or other countries, that's an indicator of popularity. Kind of like you go to TripAdvisor.
[56:26.320 --> 56:32.480]  Something's got 3,005 star reviews and everyone hands down says it's the best. It is the best.
[56:32.480 --> 56:37.200]  TripAdvisor is known to have real reviews. It's humane. It's the knowledge of the crowd.
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.880]  It's just like if you go to Yelp and it has 0 stars, boy, you better not go there. You're
[56:41.880 --> 56:44.960]  going to get food poisoning every time. If something's got 5 stars, it's going to be
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.280]  incredibly delicious. If you've got a bunch of reviews, one or two, you can't trust it.
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.480]  That's the same thing. Donald Trump in social media has four and a half stars. Hillary has
[56:55.480 --> 57:02.080]  one star. Who's the winner? You pull into a town. You don't know the restaurants. Your
[57:02.080 --> 57:05.400]  internet's not working. Remember the old days? You're going to try to decide where you're
[57:05.400 --> 57:11.240]  going to go eat. Which restaurant has overflowed cars? The other one has nobody parked. That's
[57:11.240 --> 57:14.000]  food poisoning over there. I'm going to go stand in line to get the best food. And you
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.560]  get there. It's all incredible. It's humane. Just like M4s that explode it because it's
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.080]  the real deal. By the way, we've got free shipping that ends tomorrow on everything

[57:41.760 --> 57:49.240]  tune in to the second hour. It's 70 seconds away. It's not just our water we need to
[57:49.240 --> 57:53.040]  filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing,
[57:53.040 --> 57:58.760]  especially for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.440]  weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought
[58:03.440 --> 58:09.920]  you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[58:09.920 --> 58:14.120]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family,
[58:14.120 --> 58:19.160]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning
[58:19.160 --> 58:24.520]  our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects
[58:24.520 --> 58:31.560]  for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300-400-500.
[58:31.560 --> 58:36.400]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally
[58:36.400 --> 58:40.760]  putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do
[58:40.760 --> 59:08.760]  as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in M4warStore.com.
[59:08.760 --> 59:32.360]  You can
[59:32.360 --> 59:34.160]  pull these studies up for yourself.
[59:34.160 --> 59:38.800]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any
[59:38.800 --> 59:45.200]  optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at M4WarsLife.com or by calling

[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:22.360]  877-789-ALEX. 877-789-2539. The phones are now open in the next segment in Roger Stone
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:48.360]  Rogers. 877-789-ALEX. Coming up. What a poet. Because the sands of time.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:58.520]  It's such a good feeling not to be afraid of death and to know that your soul's secure.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:06.920]  To know you did sell out to anti-human evil. Running low. All these evil cowards that are
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:12.040]  afraid of death, thank God, will not be marked among them. Those that crouch down and lick
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:21.280]  the hand that feeds them. It's an epic song right here. A little bit more of it.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.920]  Running low. Sands of time for the New World Order are running low as well. And as they
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.640]  march us towards the gallows, they now discover Lucifer's trick. They're marching themselves
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]  with us.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:52.200]  What a joke. They didn't ever know that. They'll be with our God. They'll be with theirs. Everything
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:02:13.400]  they did to us, they did to themselves.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:22.320]  Think about these evil people. They're dishonored. Look at Henry Kissinger. Look at Obama. Look
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.840]  at Hillary Clinton. Look at Michael Moore. Solace Trash. Give him power for a second.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.480]  Only to test us. Actually feel sorry for him. Playing a part.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:41.560]  You get into philosophy. You ask yourself, is the Calvinistic doctrine true of predestination?
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.080]  But they're still free will. I never agree with that when I was younger, but now I see
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.360]  it. They had free will, but they're still predestined to destroy themselves.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:59.560]  All right. Well, this part, listen to this guitar right here. You know the, I'm not bragging.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.720]  I just want you to know the kinship out there. The drummer and the lead singer of Iron Maiden
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.760]  and Big Luster. Just let you know that. I've known that for about six years and we're
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.880]  told by that as he has to meet him. It's just anybody out there that's awake. I didn't
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.160]  need anybody to tell me that Trent Russell was a patriot. Anybody to tell me Clint Eastwood
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.560]  is a patriot. Anybody that I like always turns out to be a patriot because it's a spiritual
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:44.880]  connection. The truth. 877-789-2539. Your calls are coming up as soon as we come out of the
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:52.240]  next segment. That's right. The big illusion. Gateway pundits. Social media patterns show
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.920]  Trump is looking at a landslide victory. Absolutely. It's crazy to sit there and watch the listeners
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:04.960]  come across and we get ratings from our AM and FM stations around the country. The last
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.920]  time we got from a ad agency because we don't buy the book as they call it. We don't subscribe
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.440]  to our stations that, you know, are getting the ratings and even our local affiliates
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.800]  get the raise. I'm supposed to share it with us. We can go to a consortium and actually
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.520]  get the numbers that the ad agencies have. And it was 385,000 people every 15 minutes
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:28.440]  listening on terrestrial radio. Now that is only, I'd say terrestrial radio now is maybe
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.200]  half our audience on a daily basis. Maybe. I'm not bragging. It's what you know, the
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:42.000]  success of Enforce. On our, it was over 600,000 original listeners. I mean, the top CNN shows
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.540]  don't even have that. It's all just smoke. What's the word they use in Wolf of Wall
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.880]  Street? Fugazi. Fugazi. It's all just like farts in the wind or something. It's a total
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.800]  illusion. I'll be back. Stay with us. Your call is straight ahead.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.840]  An article up at the Washington Post wearing, don't tread on me. Insignia could be punishable.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.880]  Racial harassment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also known as F-A-G, among its
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.440]  other functions, decides hostile work environment. Harassment claims brought against federal
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.760]  agencies. On January 8th, 2014, a complaint filed that the agency subjected him to discrimination
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:26.200]  on the basis of race in the fall of 2013. A coworker repeatedly wore a cap to work with
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.440]  insignia of the Getson flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake in the face. Don't tread
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.600]  on me. Complaintants say that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.720]  because the flag was designed by Christopher Gatson, a slave trader and owner of slaves.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.280]  Although a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gatson flag originated
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:52.680]  in a revolutionary war in a non-racial context. Boom! Facts! Boom! Liberals down! This has
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:06:05.000]  been Joe Bigg, serving you some information at Infowars.com. Enjoy.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:18.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Two years, they haven't let the Navy fly the
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:24.360]  Getson flag or have special forces soldiers that take a fancy to it for a long time wear
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:29.840]  it, especially in the Navy Seals. It has nothing to do with race. John Paul Jones first hauled
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:36.320]  it up. It had been a flag used in the militia early on as just as a rattlesnake saying don't
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:43.120]  tread on me. The original one is a rattlesnake across the flag. And they just, the Obama
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.720]  people said it was racist and evil and they said you couldn't have it. And then finally
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:53.840]  the head of the Navy came out and said, no, you can have the flag. It's a Navy flag. But
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.200]  that just shows how the globalists are out to get this country. They're out to demonize
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.560]  every symbol we've got because they want to fully capture this nation and use it to exploit
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.640]  it against the world. And the United States is falling to world government. It's been
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:12.040]  a long coup, long-term program to fully get the country under their control. They're very
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:17.920]  close. If Hillary gets in, four to five more Supreme Court justices. And they know people
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.120]  are waking up, folks. They want to get this job done now. They'll ship 400 million illegally
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.080]  to Iran. They'll make deals where Iran can have atomic weapons basically. They will do
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.640]  all sorts of scams. They will engage in all sorts of corruption. And they won't try to
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:40.720]  steal an election while they are stealing it. The good news is Trump is ignoring most
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.560]  of his advisors and listening to other people. That's second what he already knows. And people
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.000]  say, oh, Trump used to be nice to Democrats. He lived in New York. Doesn't matter. I'm
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.320]  not a Republican either. I'm a patriot. He is a populist. And now everything's clear
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:03.680]  to me. Trump is either George Washington part two or he's the devil because if he ends
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.320]  up getting into office and betraying us, globalists don't act like he does. Globalists don't
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.080]  reach out to Liberty Movement. Globalists don't say the things he said because it puts the
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:18.920]  ideas out there that can't be put back in a box. We go to your phone calls. Just remember

[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.720]  punch up the calls. Let me punch those up so I can take some calls. There they are.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:09.200]  We've got O'Brien in Maryland and Chris and Brad and Bobby and Robin and Dylan and Kevin
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.120]  and a bunch of others coming in. Kevin says he has no idea how to beat Hillary and Dylan
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.560]  wants to talk about how Trump can get through to millennials. Oh, millennials have to decide
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.040]  they don't know it all. I mean, if they really think Hillary cares about them, just let them
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.080]  have her. That's why he gets rid of millennials slapping upside their snot nose heads. A lot
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.560]  of millennials are either super awake. I don't need to slap them upside their head, but the
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.720]  ones that are trendies, they got daddy and mommy issues. So just let them just enjoy
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.920]  themselves. They want to worship that old war criminal, Hillary, let them do it. Doesn't
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.040]  matter. They're going to try to rig the election. We've already got the election. The question
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.200]  is now, will they be able to steal it? We need to get through to those snot noses. I found
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.000]  not kissing people's ass is the way to get them to wake up. I mean, you can lead a horse
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.840]  to water. You can't make them drink. We got Chris and Georgia, Trump voter fraud, civil
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.640]  emergency after the election. Yeah, they really got a lot of preparations for that. I'm not
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.440]  saying that's coming, but they're definitely activating their red brigades or cop killer
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.080]  grapes and all the rest of it. And then I get one more email going, Oh, yeah, you wish
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.640]  it to police. I've never supported police state or bad cops. I don't support civil war
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.400]  funded by George Soros and shooting anybody in the back is innocent.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.440]  And we've got again, a Brian and Marilyn, Trump and election fraud. Let's talk to Chris
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.760]  first in Georgia. Thanks for holding Christian on the ear. Yes. Hello, I was for you. Good
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:41.120]  brother. Go ahead. Yes. Well, saying about the voter fraud is he Obama knows is that
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.480]  we're aware of it. And he is aware that the people know about civil emergency. So my question
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.680]  you is, what do they have now? They don't have many weapons to deploy?
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:59.040]  Well, look, our military has been trained the last seven, eight years to go after gun owners,
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.760]  veterans, patriots. We first got the secret documents. No one believed it for a week. Ron
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.680]  Paul called me and said, is that really real? And I said, you've known me like 15 years.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.080]  You think it's real? I said, I, the FBI is actually trying to interview me over how I
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.040]  got it. And of course it came out later. They said, okay, those documents are real. And then
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:21.160]  now that's household known fact. Again, other media got the documents. No one had the will
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.440]  to put it out. I mean, I feel pretty insecure over the fact that I'm like up there at the
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.160]  top when it comes to WAVOs and other people aren't that actually scares me. But the good
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.000]  news is trying to train the military to attack the American people has actually woken the
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.400]  military up. But I mean, there are troops here for civil unrest. Are you saying there
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]  aren't?
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:49.560]  No, not that that was what I'm saying is there are troops. But what I'm saying is the people
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.120]  are more powerful than the military. We have more guns than the government. That's what
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.680]  I'm trying to say is so he knows it's going to backfire.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.480]  No, I hear you. I appreciate your call. Listen, it won't. It's not about who has the most
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:07.760]  guns. It's who has right on their side who has the will to fight and not listen to propaganda
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:15.240]  and to sustain the mission. So yes, we have more guns in the military. And yes, if we
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.240]  fought back against a military takeover long term, we'd win. But we don't need to because
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.880]  on average, no one is more awake than the military. That's why they tried to purge
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:31.160]  the leadership. So I'm glad you brought that up. It was really very, very deep question.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.360]  Obama is going to count on the military to do this. They're going to stage watch watch
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.320]  for it false flags against the military with a narrative that makes the liberty movement
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:46.440]  look bad. Thus then turning the public who supports the military against the liberty
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:52.040]  movement. See in military, you don't just have two mass forces that go together. You
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.480]  look at the angles of that. I can teach a 50 year course on this. So I'm not going to
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.280]  try to answer here today, but we are winning in the info war. We don't want to get physical
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.560]  offensively and we will only help the global is showing up the military in a civil war
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.680]  or the police for that matter. Look who's pushing for a physical confrontation is George
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.080]  Sorrelson Obama because that's one of the only hopes they've got. Let's go ahead and
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:24.080]  talk to O'Brien in Maryland. You're on the air. Yes. Hi. Uh, I think that basically
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:31.200]  basically Obama knows that basically everybody else is going is basically waking up to what
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:38.440]  they're doing. And basically they're going to try and do something about the before the
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:46.120]  before the election happened. He create something. I can't remember the word, but civil emergency
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:53.200]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, all their preparations point towards that. Now, they may back off
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.240]  of it, but they've been trying to start a civil war. They've been trying to start movements
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.720]  to burn down local cities so the feds can come in as angels with an already set up UN
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:09.080]  force called strong cities as the good cop. Uh, the good news is the police and military
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.080]  have been eating up what I say like it's mother's milk, not because they are stupid and just
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.600]  love me, but because they already match everything I say with what they've got. They take it
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.560]  next level with their inside info and then feed us back the information. And it's just
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:30.400]  an incredible human loop here where I mean, of Obama and Sorrelson want to make this move.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.440]  I'm your huckleberry, baby. I appreciate your call. And that doesn't mean myself physically
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.200]  will do great during the first wave of this. I'm not worried about it. I just if I was
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:44.600]  the globalist, I'd really be backing off right now. Uh, let's go ahead and take another
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.720]  call here. Let's talk to Kevin in West Virginia. Kevin, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex,
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:55.640]  how are you doing? Good, brother? Go ahead. Here's my thought. We all vote absentee and
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:02.680]  we all, um, we, we take a photocopy of our, of our absentee ballot, mail it in to that
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:08.000]  way. They can't rig it at the machines and we all have a copy of who we voted for when
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  we vote absentee. And then if they try to, I agree, I agree. It's moral authority. That's
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  a great idea, but they can still absentee early on, but let me tell you what you need
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.040]  it. This is my view. Everyone should start their own YouTube channel now. Don't wait
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.560]  till the week of, you know, three months from now, 90 days from now, start now, go out with
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:32.080]  a camera, 50 feet away or whatever the laws, your state, do exit polls there to show what
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.840]  the real number was at precincts. And then when they steal that precinct, just a few
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.320]  of those stories will blow up in their face and give us the moral authority for a recount
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.720]  a Supreme court thing. Of course, the Supreme court would have gone for Trump, but now Scalia
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.920]  died. So now it's split. Oh, stay there. I'm going to come back to you with a response
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:58.000]  back to that than Roger Stone and Moore stay with us.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.600]  Rain force. It's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob do joins us. You worked,
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.800]  I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force get. I've been working all day.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.720]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of run down.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.480]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.760]  job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. Pop two of them. And about
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.360]  20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up. Got four and a half
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.240]  stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why. Third party. Neutraceutical
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.280]  sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.960]  that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while, but
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.280]  I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this morning.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.680]  I took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:57.800]  find brain force and other game changing products at info wars life.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.520]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.280]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.640]  shocking statistics despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.360]  man, woman and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.440]  illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.720]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.640]  are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.560]  and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.040]  into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.080]  the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids it needs to do its healing
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.360]  work, you need to check out infowarsteam.com. Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:58.840]  Get over to infowarsteam.com. Your body will be very grateful.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.040]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.760]  is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:12.120]  scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.680]  water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.280]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:28.480]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.440]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.560]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.400]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.160]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.000]  Living Defense, infowarsleif.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.520]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast infowarsleif.com. Thank you, Dr.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.640]  Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.640]  great product.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.040]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:09.120]  produce. Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us. It's been something
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.000]  that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.640]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.240]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.960]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:30.800]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.160]  substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.160]  factor.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.120]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many

[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:23.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:34.800]  The heart. Rallying Patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:41.320]  He's with us for the battle for the hour via phone, picking his wife from the airport
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.800]  on this live Sunday evening transmission. Roger Stone, former Trump campaign head, the
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:52.520]  guy that for decades has been urging Trump to run longtime confidant, lobbyist and friend
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.520]  for Trump, his former business partner, current business partner, obviously is the head of
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.960]  the campaign.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:04.560]  And it's an amazing time to be alive to see Trump come out against election fraud and
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:11.560]  to come out and point out that it's going on. And to see Reuters caught sampling 15%
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:16.200]  more Democrats than Republicans in their own methodology. I'm going to show that to TV
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.800]  viewers here in a minute, the graph from their own website. And then to say Hillary's 15
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.400]  points ahead. Incredible. But now with that same methodology with a new Reuters poll, she's
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:32.280]  only three points ahead. I'm telling you, I can't find anybody that supports Hillary.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:38.120]  I can't find her. I can't find them. Even in California, we did exit polls with Hillary
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:45.840]  supporters two out of 10. They were all for Sanders, 80%. So it's an epic time to be alive.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:53.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, shock poll Reuters radically changes methodology to favor Clinton. Here's
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:22:00.080]  another one. Pat Cadel blast Reuters back-rigging polls to show Clinton up. And then we've got
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:07.600]  a shot of the poll methodology they're using 650 Democrats, the 496 Republicans. And then
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.240]  they've been caught saying the independence 196. Most of those are Democrats. So it's
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.800]  even above 15 points. I mean, this is desperate. And then Obama comes out Thursday as he is
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.440]  ready to leave and play golf for 300 rounds. He's been in seven and a half years at Martha's
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:30.280]  Vineyard. And he says, don't worry. Look, no such thing as election fraud. What is that?
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.120]  Doesn't exist. It's like Hillary and the Senate Armed Services Committee when they
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.040]  said, what about the Turkish ambassador Benghazi? She goes, turkeys, what are turkeys thinking?
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:45.240]  You don't know there's a country called Turkey. They're just betting you're an idiot. And
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.680]  then it's not just Reuters, it's AP, you name it, doing the same methodologies. And then
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:57.360]  we went and dug it up. Kennedy's killed. They set up this AP election bureau. Then by 1990,
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:03.920]  they call it voter news services. And it gets caught in every election in stealing it. And
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.040]  now it's called national election pool until this year. Now it's got a new name, Edison
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:16.400]  Research. And that's the same group that met the night before Sanders had the nomination
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.920]  taken from and said, oh, it doesn't matter if he wins the California election, we're
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.400]  going to give it to Hillary. And we have a super delegate on video bragging. Does it
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.960]  matter if he wins the popular vote? We're going to give it away. We have them jumping
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:35.360]  the shark in my view, nakedly stealing elections, nakedly trying to just hide it in plain view.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.440]  Now I want to get into all the other big issues where he really is, where he sees Trump going,
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.280]  the latest dirty tricks, what's going on, what's going to happen next? When are we going
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:49.440]  to see the WikiLeaks emails that supposedly Assange, Julian Assange says will have her
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.200]  indicted? I mean, she looks like a, again, a dead person up there, a corpsicle when she
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:01.480]  gives speeches. This is ridiculous. Roger Stone, thank you for joining us. Alex, delighted
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.280]  to be with you. Well, as you hurdle down the highway via cell phone, you just heard my
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:09.920]  three, four minute intro. I like you because I saw you in a quote in the nineties in some
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.680]  article. You said, listen, I only give out accurately info because the first time you
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.120]  give out this info, you'll never be, you know, picked up by the press again. Everything
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.560]  you've told me turned out to be a hundred percent, I mean, just dead on, unlike other
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.880]  pundits. I mean, that's why I love you. That's why they say you're dishonest and a dirty
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.480]  trickster because it's the opposite. The real synopsis, you heard what I just said. Is that
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:36.680]  wrong? No, I think it's essentially correct. I mean, it's just like the, the, when I had
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:42.600]  dinner with Nigel Farage during the Republican National Convention, he told me that the manipulation
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:49.680]  of the polls in Britain to make Brexit look less popular, less viable was manifest, and
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.960]  they were doing it constantly. And that it was a tactic that we needed to be prepared
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:25:00.280]  for here. And lo and behold, we've seen this trend. And it's not just Pat Kedell at Fox,
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:08.120]  but it's Cliff Zucan with the Rutgers Institute, hardly a conservative, a number of these liberal
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:16.800]  academics have pointed out the over-sampling of Democrats in these polls.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:23.000]  And just to quantify what you said for Layman out there, some polls two years ago when Brexit
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.120]  started were 75% wanted out of the unelected EU. England never voted to be part of it.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.640]  And by the time it happened, only one by a few percentage points creating that illusion
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.360]  that everybody's voting to stay, to make people feel like they're wrong.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:44.200]  Yeah, it's, this is like a mass psychology. It's just like, as you know, the term conspiracy
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:49.400]  theory, conspiracy theorist was actually invented by the Central Intelligence Agency. We have
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:58.760]  a memo dated to about 1965, which instructs the public relations people. And the, presumably
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.480]  the plants at the Central Intelligence Agency had throughout the press on their payroll
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:11.360]  to utilize that exact phrase to try to discredit anyone who was questioning the results of the
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:18.320]  investigation of the Kennedy assassination. And it's hurled at us constantly. I don't
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:24.760]  believe in conspiracies. I believe in the truth. And I also don't think the government
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.480]  ever tells us the truth. So why should they start now?
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.280]  Well, exactly. I mean, it's now it's almost like a medal to be called that. And so there's
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.840]  some cooks that make stuff up, but a lot of real journalists are called that it doesn't
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.360]  work anywhere. There it is 1967. The CIA created a liberal conspiracy theorist. So like anyone
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.800]  who challenges the truth on the narrative, you can link right through that zero hedge
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.400]  article to the declassification by Congress. As you said, from the early 1960s, right after
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.400]  Kennedy was killed, if you questioned all the witnesses and what they saw, you were
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.400]  a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:59.880]  Exactly right. So it is a, you know, look, we've also seen disinformation taken to extraordinary
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.720]  levels this week. Let me give you several examples, saying Trump's dropping out, total
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.720]  horseman.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.200]  ABC, ABC, the New York Times speculating about it. This really came out of the Republican
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:17.000]  National Committee. It really didn't come out of the, of the, and then I think the Clinton
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.880]  people picked it up to Clinton spin machine, didn't come out of Hillary's bowels. It came
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.680]  out of Ren's premises, but exactly because previous is a, is a Paul Ryan guy and he was
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:33.840]  very, very upset when Trump declined to endorse Ryan prior to the primary. Like Ronald Reagan,
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.840]  you know, Donald, the policy was not to get involved in primaries. He can support all
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:45.280]  these candidates for the Senate and New Hampshire, pardon me, in Arizona or New Hampshire after
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:51.920]  the primary, but as of this moment, Ryan, McCain and I are not the nominees of the Republican
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]  Party.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.920]  Well, let's talk about what you want to cover because I always end up asking the questions.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.120]  You've always got such a great background inside baseball. And by the way, Roger, when
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.440]  I say you're so accurate, I mean, really, it's scary how accurate you are. You said
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:08.520]  four or five months ago when the whole Chicago thing happened that they were Hillary people
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:12.920]  dressed up like Bernie, she'd sent them. That's in the emails. You said, well, I have sources,
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.000]  but man, I mean, it's hundreds of things that you have literally been the first to say,
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.040]  like the Koch brothers are going to get money to Hillary and they did it. I mean, the Koch
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:26.120]  brothers are giving money to, uh, you know, to the fake Texan and they did it. I mean,
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:28.120]  you've got some amazing sources.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.800]  Well, at this point, Alex, I've got to tell you, I think we're looking at a very close
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.920]  election. Uh, Trump is, uh, is now, I think back salvage the on message. And this next
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:44.920]  week is his economic policy speaks. This is the single most important speech of the campaign.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:51.040]  Uh, heavily shaped by Larry Cudwell at stonezone.com. You've got the floor. Roger, we come back.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.640]  I'm turning the show over to you via cell phones. You drive down the highway in Florida.

[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:07.920]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:12.680]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:18.360]  generators really do provide life saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:23.400]  run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:28.240]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.600]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:37.040]  this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.520]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.360]  to the low price for infowars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:54.560]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:17.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:27.880]  Alex Jones, the trooper fire musket, but I'll run you through. He's got a go because his
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.120]  wife just landed and she's coming in 10 minutes. I'll come back in the final segment, take
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.480]  your calls and hit some other news. But we're talking during the break. We don't pre script
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.440]  these interviews. I was saying, what's on your radar? And he was saying, well, look at Iran
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.040]  how our emails have now gotten this guy executed. This is an example of how bad she is. Plus
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.240]  they've said in 400 million to Iran they lied about. Now we've got Hillary basically falling
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:55.040]  down having to be helped upstairs. Look, I don't hype stuff. Okay. I've got plenty of
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.600]  real stuff to cover. I'm not saying she looks like a lunatic on the campaign trail because
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.040]  I want to act like she's got a problem. They're saying Trump's got mental problems. They're
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.480]  saying he's got health problems. They're saying his wife's a prostitute, an illegal alien,
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:13.120]  all this crap. The point is Hillary looks like a dying woman. And now drudgerport.com, we
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:17.560]  can put it up because he has the big double photo of the panoramic with her basically
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.840]  falling down having to be held up. This just broke. We're going to put it up on info wars.com
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.200]  as well. But I mean, what's really going on, Roger? She looks like she's in bad shape.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.080]  She's got holes in her tongue. She looks like she's got, I'm sorry, Down syndrome whenever
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.800]  she's out there with the balloons falling like she's a three year old, a little botany.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:41.280]  What's going on with Hillary? What's the inside intel, Roger? Yeah, New York Democrats who
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:49.200]  move in those social circles were very surprised even when she ran because her health is not
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:55.880]  good. Bill's health is also not good. But I think she has had, she either had a small
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:02.760]  stroke or she has had some other disorder. Those strange glasses she was wearing for
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:11.200]  a while, kind of a tip off. She seems to have no stamina whatsoever. So I think it is probable
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.640]  that she's gotten very serious health problems. Remember in the debate when she was gone for
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.000]  10 minutes? Yeah, very strange. Very, very strange. I think this is a liability. This
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:28.200]  is typical of what happened. I mean, why Bill and Hillary can't ride off into the sunset
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:34.520]  with their stolen hundreds of millions and their fame and be happy? I don't know. They're
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.480]  going back to the table one time too many and I think it's all going to catch up with
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.760]  them. They were able to suppress the major scandals that they have survived. Now those
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.640]  all get a nice healthy review like they never happened. But I mean, it's not like we're
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.760]  cherry picking videos. I randomly watch her. In fact, I want to do this so we get more
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.640]  clips. Don't always pay attention to. She asks freaking nuts everywhere. She like stomps
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:03.120]  around like she's crazed on a power trip. I mean, I mean, quite frankly, this is what
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:07.840]  you see in mental institutions. Well, if you go to the Clinton's war on women, I spent
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.640]  a lot of time talking about what I think are her dual personalities. On the one hand, she
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:20.640]  poses as this friendly grandmother with the phony smile, but then her real person. How
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:32.320]  do you, she's a short tempered, foul mouth, abusive, volcanic, angry, greedy cycle path.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.320]  By the way, you never brag about this, but I did some research this weekend because I'm
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.880]  a Roger Stone fingers. You're just an interesting guy. And I went and read a bunch of old news
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.040]  articles online from you in the seventies, eighties, nineties. I didn't know. You wrote
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:48.600]  a book about Nixon. I didn't read it. I was bestseller, but I didn't know you were like
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.220]  his confidant for like 20 years and his best buddy and that you're the guy that helped
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:55.960]  bring him back out and get him on the news and get him to have these press meetings
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.840]  and stuff. That's, I want to interview you just about Nixon sometime, but comparing Nixon
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.840]  to Hillary, correct me if I'm wrong, but Nixon had issues, had problems, but wasn't
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.520]  out to get America. But with Hillary, she really is out to get us.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:14.040]  Well, when it comes to criminality, Nixon would be rolling in his grave. The Clinton
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.520]  and the Obama's have gotten away with things he could never have gotten away with. You
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:27.160]  may recall that the abuse of the IRS was one of the counts in the impeachment against him.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.640]  Also another count using the FBI to block an investigation. We'll help the Clintons
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:42.480]  use the FBI to block the travel gate investigation and the Clintons, as you know, were pardoning.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:49.920]  The Clintons had the IRS harassed Kathleen Lilly, why need a broad rest?
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:56.480]  Obama's persecuted this whole scale industrial. So it's a bottom line. Nixon, was he a good
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:59.720]  guy overall or in like one sentence? Who was Nixon?
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:06.240]  Well, he was very complicated. He was an introvert in an extrovert business. He was very disciplined.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:12.400]  He was very buttoned down. He was very formal. He was brilliant. He understood the geopolitical
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:18.640]  game like nobody else, both American politics and international politics. He also played
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:26.200]  the accordion saxophone, the clarinet, the piano, and the violin.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:34.720]  Was Nixon out to get America? No. He was out for peace. He wanted a peaceful, prosperous
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:40.160]  America. He was not a globalist. That's why they got rid of him. Who is Hillary then,
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:47.960]  boiling her down? She's a psychopathic criminal. Where do we get the idea that someone becomes
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:51.920]  qualified to become President of the United States because they married some Bill Billey,
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.880]  who was successful in Arkansas politics and then became President in two three-way races?
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:03.840]  Let me remind you, no Ross Perot, no Bill Clinton. So you can say that's brilliant, but in both
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.800]  cases he won with the minority of the vote.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.320]  All right. We've got four minutes left and your wife's about to pull up there at the
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.800]  curb. You know, they're at the airport in Florida. Other points that haven't been made.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.040]  Where do you think Trump really is? What do you make of all these polls? What do you make
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:22.640]  of all the attacks? You say Trump is reorganized. Get ready. Roger Stone, four minutes. Give
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.240]  us the intel.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:33.760]  I think next week's economic speech is absolutely vital and that I know that it's a very well-crafted
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:39.640]  speech. It includes Trump's proposal for a corporate tax rate, cutting the rate of corporate
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:45.480]  taxes in the United States below that of China, which would bring millions of dollars, billions
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.760]  of billions of business back home. Also in version, taking this almost two trillion dollars
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:40:01.920]  that is off, which is offshore and not being taxed. That is a major feather in our cap.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:07.400]  He also would do something that every president until Obama has done and that is sweep the
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.600]  federal accounts. There's over a billion dollars sitting in the federal accounts that
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:17.280]  is unbudgeted and unused. It just sits there. Every other president has swept it at one
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.360]  point. Obama was the first to never do so.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]  Wow.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:29.440]  So before you go cut Social Security or Medicare or so on, you ought to sweep these available
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.560]  funds to begin with.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.080]  I love how Hillary spends it that he wants to... I saw her speech a few days ago in her
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.200]  press conference. He wants to give tax cuts to rich people. No, the rich people wrote
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.640]  it so they could move their money offshore. Trump's going to cut it so they bring the
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.080]  damn money back. I love how she spends that.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:52.000]  Yeah, Trump is certainly not the errand boy for Wall Street. Every hedge fund manager
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.240]  in the world is upset about the fact that he could become president because as you know,
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.960]  he wants the hedge fund managers to be taxed the same as everybody else on Wall Street
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.280]  without the special tax treatment they have, which they make billions, but they pay almost
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.280]  nothing.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.240]  Sure, but also globalists set it up where they can move offshore and pay no corporate
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:18.120]  tax because it's so high here, no tax overseas. Trump cutting it incentivizes them to come
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.040]  back. Don't people get that?
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:25.840]  No, I'm afraid that they don't because they don't want to give his plan an adequate hearing.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:30.120]  I mean, it's the chicken and egg problem. The media says his ideas are simple and he's
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:35.200]  never specific, but then when he is specific, it gets very little coverage. It's a terrific
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:41.960]  plan. As I said earlier, Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore, two of the supply-side pioneers
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:48.320]  were deeply involved in formulating the policy, worked very closely with Donald himself. This
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.360]  is going to be the centerpiece of the campaign because if he does not put forward an aspirational
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.960]  message, then he won't be able to win.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:04.360]  You're right. 60 seconds left. Other news, Roger. We're going to let you go.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:11.040]  More and more evidence of cheating by the Clintons and the Bernie Sanders hoax the take
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.000]  down of Bernie. And the reason that's significant is quite simply, if the Clintons will steal
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.280]  the election from Bernie, why wouldn't they steal it from Donald?
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.080]  Is Obama not, I mean, Obama having to come out and respond to it. He doesn't like that.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:32.680]  No, I don't think so. I think that that made me certain. When he said it's ridiculous,
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:37.120]  I immediately began to fear that that's exactly what we were going to have.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.760]  Absolutely. RogerStoneStoneZone.com. You've designed the new Clinton rake shirt available
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.840]  at infowarstore.com exclusively. Thank you so much. Also, there are war on women there
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:50.800]  to give a liberal. That's available at infowarstore.com. Roger, thanks for the time. We'll talk
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]  to you this week.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.800]  Wow, there goes a real patriot. Your phone calls are three minutes away.
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:11.040]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.280]  at 8 30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.800]  it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:22.800]  right there. Pop two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.440]  just kind of clears up.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.000]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why. Third
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.320]  party. Neutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:37.160]  best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.960]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.960]  done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.440]  got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:57.440]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:01.240]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.000]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.360]  shocking statistics despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.080]  man, woman and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.120]  illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.320]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.040]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.000]  your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.680]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.400]  is this so good?
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.680]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:18.400]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:24.000]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.560]  spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.560]  parasites.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.800]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.760]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.440]  doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.600]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.640]  just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarsteam.com. And folks, you can't lose
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:52.680]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast infowarsteam.com.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.960]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work,
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:01.920]  sir, on this great product.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:14.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:27.880]  Final segment. About to go to your phone calls.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:33.680]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Look, it'd be easy to sit on the fence, let Hillary get in, audience
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.880]  would explode, but I'd watch my country decline.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.320]  Trump gets in. He's not going to be able to fix everything. People say, oh, look, Trump
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:47.400]  got in. World depression. World depression is already coming. But I have to bet on who
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.800]  I think and who I've researched as the best person. I don't play politics. I don't sit
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.760]  around and say, oh, the smartest thing for me to do is this. I sit around and think,
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:06.560]  what is the best, most honest thing to do? Oh, I can be more Machiavelli than anybody.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:13.080]  But I want to try to make the world a better place, not sit there and like play all the
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:19.800]  corruption and the weaknesses of humanity and then direct it the way I want it to go.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.560]  I'm just not a parasite, not a hero, but not a parasite. And I'm asking other people, do
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.520]  you think the world's got a future? Has a chance if we continue down this road? I think
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:33.240]  the answer is no. Briefly, we've got a special that helps fund the operation, free shipping
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:38.080]  on all the thousands of amazing items and info or store.com that ends tomorrow. And

[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:48.680]  go research that. We have a vitamin mineral fusion fruit punch with amino acids that is
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:53.440]  the best out there that we have personally worked with the biggest top organic producer
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.800]  in the world to put out. That's 30% off and free shipping. Sign up for auto ship and
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:04.760]  additional 10% and info or store.com or enforce life.com. Okay, let's go back to the phone
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:10.440]  calls. Kevin Stone was picking his wife up. So we obviously had to let him go. But you
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.280]  were making a point about ideas of how to defeat Hillary. Go ahead. Yeah, I was thinking
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:22.120]  we all vote absentee and copy, you know, photocopy, go to where just a photocopier and photocopy
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.640]  it. And that way we have a hard copy of who we voted for. I agree. But how do we communicate
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:33.120]  with each other to then match those up with each other? I don't know. I mean, listen,
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:38.440]  your idea is really good. But they classically stuffed the ballot box at the absentee because
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:43.000]  they've got a month or two to monkey with it, depending on the state. The real answer
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.520]  is exit polls everywhere to show that the numbers don't match up. If you got a 3% to
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:53.160]  5% discrepancy and others are fraud, but great points. Appreciate your call. I'm not shooting
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.520]  you down. We've got a war game every angle. The answer is a landslide and Trump's already
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:03.280]  got a landslide. They're scared. That's why they're saying he's dropping out. He's dying.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:09.920]  He murdered people. He's a demon because they're scared. Brad in Pennsylvania, you're on the
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:15.120]  air. Go ahead. Thanks, Alex. You're exactly right. And you're doing an excellent job of
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.720]  hitting home on what he needs to do to win. It's got to be a landslide so they can't rig
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:24.600]  it or they can't lie. And that's what happened in the RNC because they stole it from Ron
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:30.120]  Paul eight years in a row, in my belief. They got that pervert Kasich running around saying
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:34.560]  Trump came to him and said, I'll make you the king. All lies. Kasich saying Ohio won't
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:39.080]  go for Trump. Everyone I talked to, everyone. I mean, I'm literally, it was like everyone
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:44.320]  in Ohio loved Trump. Black, white, old, young, Muslim, Christian. I mean, it was all Trump,
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.840]  Trump, Trump. It's crazy. I had Muslim cab drivers. I'd say you're a Muslim. Yes, I
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:52.480]  like Trump. They were all for Trump. They hate it. They hate Hillary. The point is,
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.720]  he says he's going to lose Ohio. Yeah, because you're going to try to steal it, you little
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:02.000]  arrogant narcissistic mental patient. I mean, look at Kasich. He is a literal lunatic. They're
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.720]  all establishment hacks and Hillary is floundering. You're exactly right. You pulled back the
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.800]  curtain. It's like the Wizard of Oz. She's got nothing. She's weak. She's spineless.
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:15.800]  They've got nothing. Listen, listen, listen, listen. Leigh Ann's out there doing days of
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.920]  interviews going, I can't find a Hillary. And I go, what, is it one out of 10? She goes,
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:23.120]  no, I can't find it. So I'm looking at hours of raw footage. I go, do a report. She's like,
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:27.800]  well, there's just hundreds. She probably had exit polls. It was eight out of 10. But
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:34.120]  no one supports her. It's, it's an epic time. Like you always say, Alex, it's, it's, this
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:40.000]  is globalism, Hillary and globalism against nationalism, Americana and Trump and patriotism.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.480]  And this, and people don't see the big picture. That's exactly what it is. And we got to stand
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.320]  up against, against it now or we're going to lose it forever.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.840]  Absolutely. Anything else, sir? I love you, man. Keep up the great work.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.240]  Well, we love you. We're all in this together. It's just so good to talk to somebody that
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:59.040]  wants to fight this. So do you think me? I'm thinking you were all, this is just crazy.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.800]  People go, well, why aren't you for killing the cops? And I'm like, well, there's some
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:06.000]  bad cops, but I want to just randomly kill people. Really? You're for the establishment.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.520]  Now the establishment, isn't the cop down the street. It's the foreign banks, people.
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:16.600]  Now there was an organization randomly talking about going after globalists. I still would
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:24.920]  say that deserve a trial, but maybe I would be so upset and I'm not so sick of these people.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:29.520]  So sick of them just getting away with everything. It's so obvious what dirtbags they are. They
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:33.960]  have no morals. They have no compass. Don't wonder they run things because they just don't
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:39.760]  do anything. And those of us that don't want power, I don't want to go bitch in a neighbor
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.680]  because they're dogs doing something in my yard. Much less go fight some politician.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:49.000]  But that's the problem. I'm more of a man than these people, but I don't want to exercise
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.800]  power over them. Well, you know what? You put too far. The sleeping giant is when real
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:58.240]  men say and real women say, game over, you want to fight, now you're going to get one.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:02.120]  They go, oh, give up, be scared. It's like, oh, you understand, I'm not scared. I didn't
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:07.640]  fight you because I was asleep. I'm awake now. You want to go? Let's go. And we are
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:12.240]  going now, aren't we? And you can metaphysically feel me getting my hands around your little
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:17.760]  neck. Madeline Albright, when you said 500,000 dead Iraqi kids is a good price to pay for
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:21.640]  security of the Gulf as you took down one of the only non-radical Muslim groups so you
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:29.120]  could push for Saudi Arabia. Metaphysically. I'll tell you a story about her. We're at
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.880]  Bilderberg 2008. Hillary and Obama are inside. The media is always Obama. Where's Obama?
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.240]  They disappeared. Remember that in Virginia? And we're there. And she pulls him. That's
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:45.240]  about an Albright. She's driving a little car convertible Porsche. We heard she panic
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:49.320]  from the Marines that were inside later and runs out screaming, wouldn't even speak because
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:55.240]  she saw a few protesters. That's who rules over us. A blood drinking, I mean culturally,
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:54:02.600]  spiritually. Yeah, dead children are good. Bob and Belgrade. And meanwhile, she can't
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:08.480]  handle 50 protesters when she drives by, panicking in fear. That's who we're fighting is this
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:15.640]  bucket of pus. Thank you, Brad. Let's talk to Bobby in California here on the air.
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:20.640]  Yeah, nobody likes Hillary. Nobody's excited for, you can't find anyone. Even the people
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:28.400]  that are voting for over Trump say it will admit that she's a phony. So I have an idea.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.760]  Hillary phony is a $3 bill contest. Whoever designs the best $3 bill and it can be passed
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.800]  around everywhere. That's a great idea. We should have another one of the Lambs Armstrong
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.560]  of politics. But Lance isn't that bad. He isn't Missouri compared to her. But people
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:48.480]  know who he is. She is the fraud. She is the fixer. We should have a contest for the contest,
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:57.000]  like a $1,000 prize in a week to decide the best contest that's $100,000 to the mega viral
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:04.200]  campaign. What do you think we should do? I think whoever designs the best $3 bill or
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:08.040]  the best ones and people print them out in stacks, they can hand them everywhere. Because
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:13.160]  even the people that are voting for Hillary, they admit that she's a big phony. So if you
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:17.720]  get that meme everywhere and just anyone that sees a $3 bill, that's Hillary phony.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:21.360]  And even get them, not to try to pass them, but just hand them out everywhere where it's
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.560]  like there's $3 bills everywhere. Hillary's on it. That's a great point. We should do
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.160]  it. Again, I'm sitting there with a camera and a bullhorn and they go, that's about
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:33.440]  one Albright and I watch her drive by. She showed up not knowing anyone would be there.
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:43.220]  She's like, this is our secret meeting. We're ruled over by a toad creature that literally
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:50.600]  brags about killing a half million kids. It's like, oh my God, you have such courage to
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:56.120]  stand up against her. Courage? I'm going to just lay down while this demon sucks the blood
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.280]  out of the country. I'm not doing it. Robin in the Virgin Islands. Thanks for holding
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:05.400]  here on the air worldwide. Thanks so much, Alex. Love you. Listen, a couple of things
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:11.480]  I would love to see with the Trump campaign. I remember when it was very evident that Trump
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:18.080]  was going to be the one with the most votes and immediately Saudi Arabia and China came
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:23.480]  out and said, oh no, we can't have this. We can't trust him. The economy will go to,
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.480]  you know, down the toilet, blah, blah, blah. And then of course a bunch of other people
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:35.120]  jumped on. But I would love for him to point out that on October the 1st, Chinese Yuan
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:41.880]  is coming on the market, the Goldback, Remnipi, and they already have 60% of the world's economy
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.800]  signed up for that with another dozen plus countries saying, yes, they will stop using
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:51.760]  the dollar. And my concern is that they're going to use Trump, you know, so they're going
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:54.880]  to have some of these countries come out and… Absolutely. They could put him in and then
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.760]  claim the global collapse happened because of him. But people aren't that stupid and
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.120]  just be dumb if they haven't fall. I appreciate your call. It's a great point. Thanks for
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.480]  calling, ma'am. I wish I could talk to you for an hour. I'll be back tomorrow at 11
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.160]  a.m. at 3 p.m. Lord willing for the big weekday show. But let's put up on screen from Rogerport.com.
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:14.320]  It's also on Infowars.com. Hillary Clinton basically collapsing as she goes upstairs having
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:18.360]  to be helped in. This is happening more and more. This is indicative. This is our title.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:26.080]  This is our logo. This is a symbol of the collapsing elite trying to put another corpse
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.200]  into power. And, you know, trying to shove this down our throat one more time. As Roger
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.240]  Stone said, go into the well one more time. We only lose by not resisting and speaking
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:41.280]  out. We win by taking action. I'm going to say great job to the crew, the listeners,
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:44.320]  the sponsors, the affiliates, and the good Lord above. I'll see you back tomorrow at
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:50.480]  11 a.m. Central. Infowars.com.
