[00:00.000 --> 00:07.320]  mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:07.320 --> 00:16.440]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.560 --> 00:29.440]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome already the 10th day of April 2008. We're gonna be
[00:29.440 --> 00:39.120]  live here for the next three hours, then in the fourth hour, for radio listeners at infowars.com,
[00:39.120 --> 00:46.360]  where people that listen audibly to the radio transmission, you're gonna hear sneak peak,
[00:46.360 --> 00:53.760]  the audio from a sneak peak about 15 minutes of the new JFK film that I'm working on,
[00:53.760 --> 00:57.840]  which we know the title now, but I'm not gonna release that at this point. We're gonna play
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.520]  that, and then some other unseen footage, and then some new video that we posted the last week
[01:03.520 --> 01:09.480]  for PrisonPlanet.tv. Members, that is coming up. Introduced by me, I'll be playing the different
[01:09.480 --> 01:16.400]  clips in here in studio, so it will be live in the fourth hour today. Everybody's chomping at the
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.160]  bit. I am an FM affiliates to here, and I'm very honored that we've gotten now more than ten
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.000]  stations have called. Ted was telling me last night it was a three Monday and then five or six
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.560]  by Wednesday, and then by today, a whole bunch of stations that have called wanting to pick up the
[01:33.560 --> 01:37.320]  fourth hour, and so that'll be worked out. I promise in the next week and a half, two weeks,
[01:37.320 --> 01:43.920]  up on the Star Guide, up on the Global Shortwave, WWCR. I keep forgetting every day. I haven't
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.360]  called them yet. Well, somebody remind me during a break or to have one of our limited staff,
[01:48.360 --> 01:54.880]  and I'm taking the trash out around here, folks. I'm chief cook, bottle washer, everything. I
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.440]  had a call WWCR get that fourth hour as well. Yesterday, I went into overdrive again and
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.000]  basically did five and a half hours. No, I did four and a half hours yesterday. I did five and a
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.480]  half hours the day before that, but I am settling in today to only do four hours of live radio.
[02:12.480 --> 02:20.440]  Now, I learned a few weeks ago that Selle Castillo, the highly decorated Vietnam sniper veteran in
[02:20.440 --> 02:27.280]  the Army, his father, highly decorated World War II Hispanic member of the Army, in fact,
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.160]  a war hero, both of them. He then became a police officer in the Valley here in Texas,
[02:32.160 --> 02:41.840]  South Texas, Southwest Texas. He then, after that, went into the Border Patrol, then he was
[02:41.840 --> 02:46.920]  recruited into the DEA and ended up being the head DEA officer. It was only about two dozen of them,
[02:46.920 --> 02:52.800]  but he was the head guy in all of Southern North America, Central America, and South America,
[02:52.800 --> 02:57.200]  and he witnessed the government loading cocaine every day on the aircraft and flying it back into
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.960]  the U.S. And he has now been in a national film. He's been given death threats when he was on
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.440]  Dateline decades ago and Nightline and a bunch of other news programs. He got death threats then,
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.600]  had his place broken into other things happened, and he was told, you're going to be killed.
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.840]  He's talked about this on air if you don't shut up. Well, he was in a film I consulted for and
[03:18.840 --> 03:23.880]  worked on, I'm in the extras, because part two of the film is mainly the more conspiratorial angle.
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.600]  This was just about how destructive drugs aren't a little bit on government drug dealing. It's
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.680]  award-winning. It's won a bunch of film festivals, and Sally's one of the main characters in it.
[03:31.680 --> 03:38.280]  And for weeks, he's called me back. We played Phone Tag, haven't been able to hold up,
[03:38.280 --> 03:44.800]  he was in jail. And finally, we called yesterday because I had Kevin Booth on the filmmaker,
[03:44.800 --> 03:52.520]  and it reminded me. It reminded me about Sally, so we called, we got him. And yes,
[03:52.520 --> 04:00.240]  this is a guy who's a Vietnam sniper, police officer, border patrol, highly decorated DEA.
[04:00.240 --> 04:07.120]  He got out of the DEA because he wouldn't be part of it. He quit. Great record. And they
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.560]  raided his little trailer. He's a high school teacher. They raided his little trailer,
[04:12.560 --> 04:19.000]  and they came in on him, and they slammed him up against the wall, and they said,
[04:19.000 --> 04:27.360]  saw you on TV. Saw you on, and laughed. The police, it's real funny. And let him know,
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.200]  you shouldn't have done that TV show about us dealing drugs, you punk. The drugs will be shipped
[04:33.200 --> 04:38.480]  in. Your children will use them, and if cops talk about it, they'll pull a serpico in you.
[04:38.480 --> 04:42.840]  They'll shoot you in the face, or they'll set you up. That's what the laws are for,
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.680]  is to protect criminals. So the criminals can rule over us, and have their way with us.
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.720]  So the Castillo joins us on the second hour. There's a lot more coming up.
[04:51.720 --> 05:02.480]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[05:02.480 --> 05:08.640]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group. Could their objective be world domination?
[05:08.640 --> 05:15.160]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[05:15.160 --> 05:24.240]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history,
[05:24.240 --> 05:29.800]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives
[05:29.800 --> 05:34.600]  the entire new world order agenda. Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.080]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're
[05:38.080 --> 05:44.520]  after power. That's their app. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com,

[08:24.560 --> 08:33.400]  Think about how evil the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are. Think
[08:33.400 --> 08:40.960]  about how wicked they are. There have been gun shop owners, one in Tucson that I remember
[08:40.960 --> 08:47.840]  the best we interviewed, who had for thieves a hidden camera system on a 24-hour VHS slow
[08:47.840 --> 08:54.520]  play system, but it got all the audio, and then every second it takes a photo, basically.
[08:54.520 --> 09:00.160]  They went in and turned off his main security system, but they didn't see the hidden camera
[09:00.160 --> 09:07.120]  and the VCR behind the wall. They take him to jail, they rough him up, they laugh at him,
[09:07.120 --> 09:10.840]  and then they start openly talking about which guns they're going to steal, which guns they're
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.920]  going to keep. You have to understand that they are known as the regulators. They were
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.560]  the first feds. Going back to the whiskey rebellion, there were several whiskey rebellions,
[09:21.560 --> 09:27.680]  but they're, it's over 150 years old, what they grew into. And the feds, they would basically
[09:27.680 --> 09:31.280]  hire criminals. That's the only person you could hire back then when everybody hated
[09:31.280 --> 09:35.080]  the government. Nobody trusted the government. Common sense was, don't trust the government.
[09:35.080 --> 09:39.360]  Taxes are bad. We've got freedom. A man should be able to make whiskey if he wants and sell
[09:39.360 --> 09:43.680]  it. And it was about the tax. The government, depending on the different decade, put between
[09:43.680 --> 09:50.040]  a 10 and 20% sin tax on whiskey, and you had a lot of subsistence farmers. It was especially
[09:50.040 --> 09:57.080]  the poor farmers that could grow corn and make sour mash whiskey and things or do it
[09:57.080 --> 10:02.800]  with wheat and make hundreds of times the profits selling whiskey or selling moonshine
[10:02.800 --> 10:10.760]  locally, instead of paying the tax and going through the system. And of course, the big
[10:10.760 --> 10:15.080]  whiskey makers would use regulators and pay off regulators and the government wouldn't
[10:15.080 --> 10:25.960]  sell local taxes, the tax stamps. So it was also a way to control the market. And so they
[10:25.960 --> 10:31.000]  created the regulators and the regulators, they would also hire private companies to
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.160]  enforce as regulators. Pinkerton was a whiskey enforcement tax regulators and they famously
[10:38.160 --> 10:46.720]  in Illinois and of course, in Colorado and Texas and New York and New Jersey, they'd
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.680]  go into strikers and just pull out a gatling gun and just start shooting men, women and
[10:51.680 --> 10:57.200]  children in shantytowns. They would ride in on horseback in Colorado and kill hundreds
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.360]  and just shoot children right in the head and burn them. I mean, these are famous cases,
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.240]  just Google Pinkerton massacres for the Rockefellers in one famous case. People own their land
[11:07.240 --> 11:10.880]  on the gold and doesn't matter. You send in Pinkerton, they'll kill. Now, this isn't the
[11:10.880 --> 11:16.040]  first time you see those Clint Eastwood movies where the railroad brings in 10 or 15 regulators
[11:16.040 --> 11:20.960]  and calls them regulators. Those are off the Pinkerton men. And that's all BATF is, is
[11:20.960 --> 11:26.000]  they're Pinkerton men. But the government then institutionalized that itself and they
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.400]  had other companies, but the Pinkertons were the most famous and they hired the best gunslingers.
[11:30.400 --> 11:34.160]  They hired people out of prison. They, I mean, that's what Stalin did. He opened the prisons
[11:34.160 --> 11:37.920]  up. That's what Hitler did. That's what criminal governments do. You're not going to find an
[11:37.920 --> 11:42.480]  average guy, even if he was a tough guy, who's going to send other innocent cops to jail
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.360]  or ride down children or murdered people or do any of this. You've got to hire crooks
[11:47.360 --> 11:52.800]  or people that are crooks who haven't been busted yet, but have the criminal mentality.
[11:52.800 --> 12:00.280]  And so Pinkerton security amongst others, and then of course the federal regulators,
[12:00.280 --> 12:05.400]  the whiskey regulators, they would come onto your land. They would raise you more often
[12:05.400 --> 12:09.880]  than not. They would just shoot you in the back, take any gold. They'd tie you down
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.800]  torture. You ask, where's the gold? Where's the silver buried? Because every farm basically
[12:13.800 --> 12:16.940]  would, you know, hide their money. They didn't trust banks. This is going back hundreds
[12:16.940 --> 12:21.560]  of years and they rape your women. I mean, this was, I mean, they were incredible because
[12:21.560 --> 12:27.520]  they, they couldn't get in trouble because they had federal badges. The worst criminals
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.800]  were the federal badge men. And of course they got, they operated mainly in the frontier
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.760]  areas because in the more settled areas in the south, the locals would just rise up and
[12:36.760 --> 12:41.160]  kill them. And there were hundreds of cases of that where they'd take regulators, grab
[12:41.160 --> 12:46.560]  them, hang them. Most your lynchings were regulators being run down and rode over because, you
[12:46.560 --> 12:52.080]  know, back then people were tribal. They were aggressive. They knew what survival was about.
[12:52.080 --> 12:58.000]  If some of the Pinkerton boys or some of the BATF, as they're known today, got out of control,
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.160]  the locals just dealt with them. So there were certain areas they'd feed on where, where
[13:02.160 --> 13:06.800]  it was isolated groups or in the main cities or areas where they had corrupt strong men
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.280]  mayors that would go along with them. But they would come in and shake you down and
[13:12.280 --> 13:17.240]  a lot of times just steal your moonshine, break your still laugh at you. That's what
[13:17.240 --> 13:24.360]  they did. And so that's what the BATF is and, and you know, formerly founded what in the
[13:24.360 --> 13:28.440]  last 110 years or so, and they've changed names several times each time they get their
[13:28.440 --> 13:39.840]  name burned. And you see BATF today. Roy heads driving brand new Cadillacs Corvettes Lamborghinis.
[13:39.840 --> 13:46.760]  They normally have shaved heads, devil goatees, you know, they, a lot of times run prostitutes
[13:46.760 --> 13:51.880]  on the side. And I know they're listening right now wanting to set me up or something.
[13:51.880 --> 13:56.080]  Just, you know, everybody expects it. Hey, I'm here. I'm ready. You understand? You
[13:56.080 --> 14:01.360]  don't win. I know. You see, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm ready to be repped apart. You will be
[14:01.360 --> 14:07.120]  defeated by doing that. You see, that's what makes the tree of liberty grow. I'm committed.
[14:07.120 --> 14:13.760]  You understand? And I'm going to expose who you are. And so Celica Stillo, Vietnam sniper
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.720]  veteran, police officer, border patrol, high level DEA agent who said, I'm not going to
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.040]  be part of drug dealing. He went on national television and told his story and they came
[14:23.040 --> 14:28.600]  and busted him and said, keep your mouth shut. Boy, I saw you on TV. Real funny. This is
[14:28.600 --> 14:35.840]  your country, ladies and gentlemen. This is what we are. This is who we are. But it isn't
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.240]  just, you know, BATF running around now, though they're one of the worst groups because they
[14:39.240 --> 14:46.120]  are the oldest and most corrupt. I've told the story many times. I was 19. I was in college.
[14:46.120 --> 14:53.120]  I was taking a history courses. I was taking RTF, radio, television, film courses. And
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.240]  I was bouncing back and forth. I'd even looked into the military. My dad's like, no, don't
[14:57.240 --> 15:02.800]  do that. And the recruiter was so seedy and so gangster-ish. I was like, man, this isn't
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.840]  good. So I didn't go with that. Remember going down to the Doby Mall and visiting one of
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.880]  the recruiters down there a couple of times. And I was saying, maybe I'll be a cop. You
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.240]  know, I want to fight criminals. And my dad said, hmm, you got to talk to one of my patients
[15:16.240 --> 15:22.520]  who, at the time, was the head marshal in this sector for all of Texas and I think in
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.600]  other states included. And my dad said, in a few months, he scheduled for his regular
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.200]  checkup. Why don't you come in? I got a meeting for you. So I come into the office and the
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.840]  guy's there and he goes, hi, he goes, you're really handsome, smart, good-looking guy. He
[15:35.840 --> 15:42.560]  said, Alex, are you a criminal? And I said, what do you mean? Am I a criminal? No. He
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.320]  goes, well, your dad tells me you like to fight and you're tough. And that's always
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.200]  a good thing. But that's not what they really look for anymore. He said, if you're not a
[15:51.200 --> 15:57.160]  criminal, he said, 20, 30 years ago, you know, I would have said, maybe go ahead and get
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.000]  into law enforcement. But he said, if you're not a criminal, don't do it. And he looked
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.440]  real sad. And I thought it was some kind of joke. And you have this big old six foot
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.600]  five guy with gray hair, looks like something out of a movie. It's like an FBI agent out
[16:07.600 --> 16:11.120]  of a movie telling me, you're not a criminal, are you? I was like, is this some kind of
[16:11.120 --> 16:17.920]  test? And he goes, no, he just said, I wouldn't do it. And shook his head. Because that's
[16:17.920 --> 16:23.080]  a guy guaranteed who got in and sees the drug dealing, the corruption, all the rest of it.
[16:23.080 --> 16:30.120]  And wants to tell a young man, don't get involved in this. I mean, this is despicable. But it
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.560]  isn't just that they deal drugs and run the prostitutes. Now they want our guns. And now
[16:35.560 --> 16:42.320]  they are one 10th of the one in 10 graduating colleges joining their ranks to mind our lives.
[16:42.320 --> 16:45.120]  And they're going to find crimes. They're going to find terrorists. They're going to
[16:45.120 --> 16:51.840]  find something to do. It's all over, folks. The country's gone. A highly decorated veteran
[16:51.840 --> 16:57.320]  police officer, border patrol agent, DEA agent gets raided and they just basically telling
[16:57.320 --> 17:03.640]  him, Hey, shouldn't have gone on TV, boy. Because they are scared. They don't want you
[17:03.640 --> 17:11.360]  to find out they bring the drugs in 20 something states past laws, decriminalizing marijuana
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.120]  feds come in and say, we don't care what you say states, we're going to continue because
[17:15.120 --> 17:21.400]  87% of people that use drugs only use marijuana. And their whole business would be over real
[17:21.400 --> 17:28.640]  fast. It's disgusting. And don't send me an email saying, Oh, you just smoke pot. I hate
[17:28.640 --> 17:37.880]  pot. I've tried almost every illegal drug one time. And I hated it every time. Thank
[17:37.880 --> 17:46.240]  God. I do not like anything illegal for some reason. I like the stuff that's legal. I
[17:46.240 --> 17:51.720]  like alcohol. I like caffeine and I like nicotine and I only use caffeine now and they'll probably
[17:51.720 --> 17:55.080]  make that illegal soon. We're talking about restricting it or something. So I better get
[17:55.080 --> 18:06.200]  off that quick. Taking me to jail for a bag of coffee beans, you know, I blew up yesterday
[18:06.200 --> 18:14.000]  and it's because I feel desperate. I feel impotent. I feel weak. I just know evils closing
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.120]  in on everybody and I know they're persecuting and hurting innocent good people and evil
[18:18.120 --> 18:22.240]  just keeps winning and winning and winning and winning and winning and winning and that's
[18:22.240 --> 18:28.720]  why yelling scream and yell because it makes me feel better. It's literally a steam valve
[18:28.720 --> 18:37.960]  as violent energy, you know, kind of comes out my ears and my mouth because I realize
[18:37.960 --> 18:41.640]  violence doesn't even hurt these people. You think they care about their scumbag BATF or
[18:41.640 --> 18:46.320]  their dumb down cops or their or their power tripping FBI people. The new order is shutting
[18:46.320 --> 18:50.320]  up a system where they're all going to get slaughtered basically. By the way, I don't
[18:50.320 --> 18:54.120]  just say this stuff. I have broke it down. I understand the system. I understand history.
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.480]  I have you seen everything I talk about come true so far? That's why I'm freaking out is
[18:58.480 --> 19:03.000]  I keep hoping the next step won't happen. The next thing won't happen. I won't be validated.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.480]  I won't be proven right and it just it's all confirmed and it's worse than I even thought
[19:07.480 --> 19:11.600]  and I'm telling you they built death camps and they plan to line you and your family
[19:11.600 --> 19:18.120]  up most of you and put bullets in the backs of your heads. And I want this picturesque
[19:18.120 --> 19:27.080]  life to go on. I want to have time to go. Water skiing or fishing or camping and I can't
[19:27.080 --> 19:35.800]  because it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.280]  you got these thugs in the government. It's all about them showing you they're the boss.
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.200]  Them showing you they're in charge and all their propaganda on TV and billboards and
[19:44.200 --> 19:50.040]  radio to worship them. I'm just sick of it. I'm sick of lawlessness. I'm sick of corruption.
[19:50.040 --> 19:58.320]  I'm tired of innocents being persecuted. Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?

[25:06.800 --> 25:12.400]  and to know that he's just been persecuted for going on TV and I mean I've
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.160]  had Terry Reid on who was a CIA operative and but a lot of them are just
[25:17.160 --> 25:21.240]  technical people he was meant to set up airfields run training and he was told
[25:21.240 --> 25:28.300]  they were flying arms down to the anti-communist and he'd be there at the
[25:28.300 --> 25:32.420]  Mina and Ollie North was there and Bill Clinton would drop by so much cash and
[25:32.420 --> 25:36.120]  he'd get his cash payments and he'd watch him with giant containers full of
[25:36.120 --> 25:42.260]  cocaine he said we can't do this and he went public there've been hundreds of
[25:42.260 --> 25:46.380]  others I mean you always hear about Miami a plane stops local cops busted and
[25:46.380 --> 25:51.900]  CIA officers with cocaine or 18 wheelers get caught with cocaine and the FBI
[25:51.900 --> 25:57.920]  comes to the DEA and and you know takes it away and or actually the state
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.440]  police found it and then the DEA and the FBI came and took it and gave it to the
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.720]  CIA and just said that's our cocaine shipment stand down it's just all over
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.080]  folks I mean it you've got to admit that we've fallen apart before we're gonna
[26:11.080 --> 26:16.880]  get anything back I just can't believe they bust people all day and put them in
[26:16.880 --> 26:21.440]  jail when the government ships the majority of the drugs in they have
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.040]  licensed cartels that bring it in and then they have large banks that are
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.220]  certified and laundered mainly federal reserve banks other banks try it they
[26:30.220 --> 26:35.440]  get rated it's all a rigged game
[26:35.440 --> 26:41.680]  you know if you're on drugs out there it's a mind trick just just decide you're
[26:41.680 --> 26:52.600]  getting off of it decide you hate it and you know ask God to heal you and just
[26:52.600 --> 26:59.240]  stop using their trash just stop it's such a joke to them they love how they
[26:59.240 --> 27:04.840]  hurt you these are bad people they enjoy hurting people they enjoy the power
[27:04.840 --> 27:12.240]  they enjoy the raw exercise of it just don't use the drugs it's simple it's
[27:12.240 --> 27:15.960]  like a rat trap it's a piece of cheese people go I can't believe they ship it
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.200]  and then bust us it's the trap it's how you it's like a bass saying I can't
[27:20.200 --> 27:25.200]  believe you put a purple worm on that hook they put the worm on the hook they
[27:25.200 --> 27:28.680]  drop it down to the water they drag it along the bottom and you see it and you
[27:28.680 --> 27:36.240]  run up and by it on it Hollywood makes all these movies glorifying drugs they

[27:57.720 --> 28:01.600]  was mixed together a public-private partnership on the new Freedom Commission
[28:01.600 --> 28:06.840]  that Orwellian term came out one executive Ohio and said look I can't be
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.440]  part of this and that he released the internal memos and it said we've got
[28:10.440 --> 28:17.960]  18% of the kids on psychotropic drugs now under this plan by 2010 we project 50%
[28:17.960 --> 28:22.000]  or more and it said we've written the guidelines that will be with the in
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.320]  school psychologist and psychiatrist everyone will be screened by law and we
[28:26.320 --> 28:32.000]  project half of them will be put on drugs remember what's the national
[28:32.000 --> 28:40.280]  average more than two-thirds 67% it's 68% in Texas when WO AI TV to report two
[28:40.280 --> 28:43.680]  years ago they did a study with the social worker numbers of Texas even higher
[28:43.680 --> 28:49.240]  but the average is 67% of foster children are on psychotropic drugs on
[28:49.240 --> 28:56.040]  average of seven and boy does it kill a lot of
[28:56.040 --> 29:00.120]  them a lot of them die they give you the drugs and within two years most of them

[35:33.160 --> 35:37.720]  hard to stay focused like a laser beam it's hard to be serious all the time
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.160]  it's hard to not blow up but I do the best job I can and I I attempt to tell
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.600]  the truth the best I can I don't always know the exact truth or every fast of
[35:46.600 --> 35:50.600]  the truth but I I always reach for it and we are pure of heart and pure of
[35:50.600 --> 35:55.560]  spirit and we love you okay I got a bunch of news and something is still a coming
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.520]  up but I Google Jesse Ventura's name every day and there's a lot of news
[36:00.520 --> 36:05.960]  articles the last couple days bashing him for his appearance here last week
[36:06.760 --> 36:10.080]  seems like a hundred years ago so much has happened but it was just last
[36:10.080 --> 36:17.320]  Wednesday AP TV stations hundreds of newspapers now it's broken now that he's
[36:17.320 --> 36:20.400]  being asked about it on hundreds of other shows as he's on the talk circuit
[36:20.400 --> 36:24.280]  perfect I did it here first that issue broke out mainstream was the show was
[36:24.280 --> 36:27.480]  big enough to get it out because of you spreading the word now these fools are
[36:27.480 --> 36:30.920]  attacking him on shows everywhere the audience is calling in an agreeing with
[36:30.920 --> 36:35.120]  him they're panicking it's magnifying as the fact that the emperor has no clothes
[36:35.120 --> 36:41.120]  is being revealed it's fate it's destiny we couldn't have planned it this way it
[36:41.120 --> 36:47.640]  couldn't have happened this good to continue to get the YouTube videos of my
[36:47.640 --> 36:50.120]  interview with Jesse Ventura the one I did a year and a half ago and the big
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.440]  one that broke last week get those out everybody redouble your efforts know
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.240]  that it is the planting season for the great harvest of liberty and then and
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.040]  bringing tyranny to justice not to that fight will even be over but we have to
[37:03.040 --> 37:07.440]  resist if we don't have victories we're gonna be going backwards if we can just
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.520]  hold them still it's a victory which we're not doing we've slowed them down so
[37:13.520 --> 37:18.000]  they've panicked gone into convulsions of angry rage putting everything they've
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.840]  got against us and we are still even slowing them down even more and so
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.360]  they were more enraged frothing and flailing which only wakes up more of
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.600]  the cattle more of the sheep who cease to be sheep unlock their minds realize
[37:33.600 --> 37:39.800]  they're being manipulated and their journey towards liberty and wholesomeness
[37:39.800 --> 37:49.200]  and honor and beauty is begun so this twit on one of Canada's biggest stations
[37:49.200 --> 37:55.760]  77 a.m. 770 a.m. the world tonight with Rob Breckenridge syndicated
[37:55.760 --> 38:01.200]  transmission he basically copied a bunch of Pentagon disinfo that's on the quote
[38:01.200 --> 38:05.960]  debunking sites and out of the Pentagon run hers publishing popular mechanics
[38:05.960 --> 38:11.560]  all lies and joining us to the bottom of the until the end of the hour top of the
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.640]  hour is Paul Joseph Watson yeah you won't hear him here for six months and
[38:15.640 --> 38:18.840]  you might hear him three days in a row that's how we do it here Paul excellent
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.240]  story up on prisonplanet.com I saw this last night sending the story at about 1
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.640]  a.m. when I was working he got up early England time Greenwich meantime and put
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.000]  his own info into it and expanded it and I just pointed out that everything he
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.560]  claims in this Jesse the Truth or Ventura story is a fraud in the line now
[38:38.560 --> 38:41.760]  he may believe the fraud the line but nevertheless the info he puts out is
[38:41.760 --> 38:48.760]  bull and so every time they counter us with fraud and straw men we always have
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.840]  to counter back that's how you defeat the enemy you give fight each time Paul
[38:53.840 --> 39:01.240]  Watson break it down all right good to be back yeah this guy he's up there in
[39:01.240 --> 39:05.880]  Calgary Canada he's been a from what I can see he's been a hardcore debunker
[39:05.880 --> 39:12.560]  for at least a year after writing the article that's on prisonplanet.com
[39:12.560 --> 39:19.760]  about his ridiculous debunking tactics against Ventura actually went and
[39:19.760 --> 39:25.840]  listened to some interviews that he did that are on Google video and the claims
[39:25.840 --> 39:29.760]  that he makes in those that just as ludicrous as the claims he makes in this
[39:29.760 --> 39:37.920]  article for one he says that WTC 7 building 7 collapsed not in seven
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.800]  seconds as every single video from every single angle shows but he claims it's at
[39:42.800 --> 39:48.920]  18 seconds to collapse which is an outright lie anyone with two eyes that
[39:48.920 --> 39:54.800]  has watched any of the videos can see that he also says that WTC 7 did not
[39:54.800 --> 40:01.360]  collapse in its own footprint which if you take that you know the demolitions
[40:01.360 --> 40:07.080]  industry definition of what constitutes collapsing in its own footprint then it
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.120]  doesn't significantly damage any of the buildings around it which building 7
[40:11.120 --> 40:16.480]  did not it fell straight down in its own footprint we got the high resolution
[40:16.480 --> 40:23.720]  photographs the rubble of WTC 7 around what was it 18 months ago right up
[40:23.720 --> 40:27.840]  close to the rubble and you could see that it was just piled on top of itself
[40:27.840 --> 40:34.720]  it was in its own footprint so I listen to the watch the videos on Google
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.760]  video listen to the radio show and basically this guy Breckenridge likes
[40:39.760 --> 40:44.040]  the sound of his own voice he had a debate about it with Nathan Malton of
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.480]  Calgary 9-11 truth who basically couldn't get a word in edgewise because
[40:49.480 --> 40:54.640]  this guy just ran on and on talking over him and that's what he does spewing
[40:54.640 --> 41:01.200]  these lies so if you read the article that I pulled there today Breckenridge is
[41:01.200 --> 41:07.760]  basically making the point that the collapse of building 7 was not suspicious
[41:07.760 --> 41:13.400]  because other buildings around the twin towers were destroyed when the twin
[41:13.400 --> 41:19.280]  towers collapsed which for a start yeah they were destroyed they were scooped
[41:19.280 --> 41:25.040]  out but not one completely collapsed and certainly none of them collapsed until
[41:25.040 --> 41:28.800]  weeks after when they were deliberately demolished the foundations were still
[41:28.800 --> 41:37.960]  standing but the most bizarre example he points to is St. Nicholas Church which
[41:37.960 --> 41:43.240]  if you look at the picture that I've posted of it on PrisonPlanet.com is
[41:43.240 --> 41:49.240]  basically a four-story church building it's not much bigger than a lot of
[41:49.240 --> 41:54.720]  people's houses but by the way it's one of those old-fashioned churches in New
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.640]  York it only looks like with all four floors that it might be five thousand
[41:59.640 --> 42:05.720]  square feet it's tiny one rooms on top of each other you've got a tiny 60
[42:05.720 --> 42:09.640]  person sanctuary in the bottom then you've got where the church mission is
[42:09.640 --> 42:14.960]  and then you've got two floors for the pastors to live in it's a classic
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.000]  mission church it's an old antique that's why they didn't destroy it I mean
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.600]  it literally in fact I looked it up online it it it's it's the size of a
[42:24.600 --> 42:31.440]  small house it's tiny and it's right it's right in the shadow of the South Tower
[42:31.440 --> 42:37.440]  giant 1300 feet tower is right next to it you could literally throw a stone and
[42:37.440 --> 42:43.920]  hit the South Tower if you stand in there but he can't he says obviously this
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.080]  building was destroyed on 9-11 because it is basically an ant compared to a
[42:49.080 --> 42:54.240]  giant wooly mammoth in comparison to the South Tower of the World Trade Center
[42:54.240 --> 43:01.080]  of course it was destroyed but WTC7 was a 47-story skyscraper that will be the
[43:01.080 --> 43:05.720]  biggest building in most major cities and by the way the church is an old
[43:05.720 --> 43:11.280]  stucco brick building about a hundred and fifty years old so you've got a
[43:11.280 --> 43:14.600]  little bitty brick building but he doesn't show photos he says the huge
[43:14.600 --> 43:20.160]  church was destroyed no he did he careful not to show any photos of it
[43:20.160 --> 43:26.240]  because it looks absolutely ridiculous in comparison to a 576 feet tall
[43:26.240 --> 43:31.560]  skyscraper which was you know nearly 400 feet away from the North Tower which
[43:31.560 --> 43:37.000]  was it's the biggest building in 33 states exactly so that is that's his
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.800]  big example of how these other buildings were destroyed so why why is it
[43:42.800 --> 43:48.800]  inconceivable to say that WTC7 was destroyed the other ones the sites are
[43:48.800 --> 43:57.480]  WTC3 which is otherwise known as the Marriott Hotel now the picture that he
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.600]  links to is from a different angle the one I've got which is after both towers
[44:02.600 --> 44:08.960]  have collapsed and bear in mind that this is WTC3 and you'll see on the map
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.080]  that's posted there is sandwiched right in between the towers I mean obviously
[44:14.080 --> 44:20.080]  both towers fell on it and none of the main superstructure collapsed only some
[44:20.080 --> 44:25.040]  of the roof where the whole building fell on yeah it's got a big slice it's
[44:25.040 --> 44:30.040]  basically sliced in half but it's still not the foundations have not collapsed
[44:30.040 --> 44:36.000]  and certainly not a freefall speed in seven seconds not 18 I could building
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.760]  seven did it's a smaller building that had fires that burned for six for six
[44:40.760 --> 44:46.080]  weeks it's less than half the height of the building seven as well and it was
[44:46.080 --> 44:51.000]  right in between the twin towers it took the full brunt of both collapses yeah it
[44:51.000 --> 44:57.200]  did not implode into its own footprint within seven seconds so that's his
[44:57.200 --> 45:04.360]  second big example and his other he's done site some reports peer-reviewed
[45:04.360 --> 45:08.320]  papers that supposedly back up his claims one of which is the NIST report
[45:08.320 --> 45:13.240]  which as we know did not properly address the collapse of WTC7 at all
[45:13.240 --> 45:18.520]  and in fact NIST themselves admit that debris from the twin towers did not
[45:18.520 --> 45:22.000]  cause the collapse of building seven that's right it was barely in the debris
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.360]  field a few small pieces of debris knocked out some windows dust field hit
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.000]  it they admit all of that but he just says NIST gives all the reasons and
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.640]  disproves it but if you actually read the ten thousand page report as scholars
[45:37.640 --> 45:41.800]  and many others have done it says we believe bombs could have been in the
[45:41.800 --> 45:48.080]  building well yeah then it then it says the the original report concluded that
[45:48.080 --> 45:53.000]  fires go at the building well all the reports say the fires were confined to
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.520]  just eight floors and you can see from the images right before it collapsed the
[45:57.520 --> 46:05.080]  fires at minimal so NIST has retracted five different reasons they said it
[46:05.080 --> 46:14.280]  now all right and his other his other big citation is this Cambridge University
[46:14.280 --> 46:21.120]  report which the BBC reported already being published in September 2007 it
[46:21.120 --> 46:24.360]  seems like they were quite eager to get it out there because it wasn't actually
[46:24.360 --> 46:31.520]  published until five months later in February of this year and I mean it's
[46:31.520 --> 46:38.320]  being completely debunked it claims that the path of least resistance the path
[46:38.320 --> 46:44.240]  of most resistance sorry did not exist so it completely contradicts the very
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.360]  laws of physics in saying that the building the twin towers fell in a
[46:50.360 --> 46:57.000]  vacuum basically and there was no resistance whatsoever now I mean
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.120]  Breckenridge's article is supposed to be about building seven and then he just
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.960]  suddenly switches to a report about the twin towers so he's all over the place
[47:06.960 --> 47:14.360]  and it amounts to something laughable and ridiculous but for the general public
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.600]  that can't find the US on a map or Canada on a map or doesn't know you know
[47:18.600 --> 47:23.440]  the basic continents can't find Asia people who think Vietnam is in the
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.320]  Middle East and that's the general public they're gonna just see oh look he
[47:27.320 --> 47:34.160]  says it's not true he put some links up here exactly I mean see if you listen
[47:34.160 --> 47:39.640]  to those interviews on Google video it's even worse he just sounds like some
[47:39.640 --> 47:44.920]  kind of demented chipmunk just running on at the mouth I mean no nobody can get
[47:44.920 --> 47:49.240]  a word in because he just will continue to repeat and now it collapsed in 18
[47:49.240 --> 47:53.000]  seconds it didn't fall in his own footprint and then he goes into this
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.440]  thing where he blames the firemen he says that 9-11 truth is a blaming the
[47:57.440 --> 48:01.920]  firemen for being in on the conspiracy which is a classic you know
[48:01.920 --> 48:07.560]  extrapolation of the it's harmful to the victims line which is regularly used
[48:07.560 --> 48:11.280]  they got fans down at ground zero every day we've been tracked them they use
[48:11.280 --> 48:15.280]  fake names there if they've got official passes by the city to be down there so
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.560]  the cops worship them to bow down and that's what they always say they always
[48:19.560 --> 48:23.640]  say you're saying the firemen blew it up how dare you how dare you and just like
[48:23.640 --> 48:27.440]  the communist in martial law where I walk up politely and they say he just
[48:27.440 --> 48:31.880]  said something nasty to this woman they make something up they start yelling he
[48:31.880 --> 48:37.320]  said the fireman did it this guy get him and so they're using classic this
[48:37.320 --> 48:43.080]  info so he's going off a script exactly and now that you've got all kind of
[48:43.080 --> 48:49.960]  kooks down there trying to blame we are changed the stuff is ridiculous but I mean
[48:49.960 --> 48:56.000]  our efforts are having a positive effect because you had the Japanese member of
[48:56.000 --> 49:04.000]  parliament forget his name was it Fuji to Vegeta yeah Vegeta you had him on a
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.160]  week or two ago and he was talking about the possible United Nations or European
[49:11.160 --> 49:15.840]  parliamentary investigation into 911 and I want to be clear we're not saying they
[49:15.840 --> 49:20.480]  have jurisdiction the fact is though if we bring attention to this through any
[49:20.480 --> 49:26.120]  means necessary this will seriously damage the new world order right and
[49:26.120 --> 49:34.080]  the story today out of the New York Sun is that an official in the newly formed
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.760]  UN Human Rights Council Richard Fork who has been in the news recently where he
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.200]  called Israel's government he said their behavior was like the Nazis which of
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.440]  course meant he's an anti-Semite according to the ADL he has come out and
[49:50.440 --> 49:57.160]  said that he wants a UN-led investigation into the possibility that the
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.360]  neocons were involved in 911 not that that's the New York Sun headline today
[50:02.360 --> 50:05.920]  see I didn't know about that that is massive news Paul is that up on

[50:28.480 --> 50:36.680]  exactly why we voted against the new Human Rights Council this is just fabulous

[56:08.680 --> 56:14.680]  level and one more damn break well the next level after this is just total

[56:20.080 --> 56:25.960]  info yes the New York Sun headline you an official call for study of neocons
[56:25.960 --> 56:32.880]  roll in 9-11 by Eli Lake staff report for the New York Sun and it's Richard

[56:59.400 --> 57:03.200]  there was a situation in the country and in the world where something had to
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.160]  happen to wake up the American people whether they are innocent about the
[57:07.160 --> 57:11.520]  contention that they made that something happened or not I don't think we can
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.440]  answer death definitively at this point all we can say is that there is a lot
[57:16.440 --> 57:20.880]  grounds for suspicion there should be an official investigation of the sort the
[57:20.880 --> 57:25.320]  9-11 Commission did not engage in and that the failure to do these things is
[57:25.320 --> 57:29.720]  cheating the American people and in some sense the other the people of the world

[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:44.780]  selling two or three rifles just mainline rifles they don't care it's over

[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:54.080]  it you know it's not funny that's why I get mad making jokes well Alex didn't
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:59.840]  for real they hadn't killed him yet well they didn't kill the you know the DA who
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:03.200]  went after the Kennedy assassination and he said and it's a true story in the
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:08.200]  movie and Jim Mars got that directly from Jim Garrison that he was told by the
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:12.120]  FBI that were some of the good guys you better stay in the light stay noisy stay
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:16.200]  loud or it's over you're dead or they're gonna set you up and they tried to set
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:19.400]  him up with every time you go into public bathroom there'd be some guy with his
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:23.280]  pants down running at him saying have sex with me with FBI guys outside trying
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:26.880]  to say he was doing that I mean I mean they tried to set him up for for for
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:32.880]  bills and money and everything else take the able danger Colonel who talked
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:36.160]  about how they were ordered not to stop whoever these hijackers were being
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:40.640]  trained at US bases they were decoys we know that he tried to testify he did then
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:44.800]  they said he had $68 of unauthorized cell phone calls to his wife we're
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:48.800]  indicting him for $68 I mean that's all they could find when you're allowed to
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:52.800]  use your cell phone to call your wife from the base from the Pentagon saying
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:57.920]  you're coming home late I mean this is what they do and the mob that's how
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:02.520]  they operate always gets you later if you're a big fish unless you've never
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:06.320]  done business with them and they have weird little rules I've never worked
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.640]  with them never made deals with them never been in their system they see
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:14.800]  sell the Costello as theirs because he was in the military a police officer a
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:20.120]  board patrol agent a DE agent he really triggered a lot of what's coming out now
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:25.720]  and they want to send a message right now now it hit the zeitgeist this isn't
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:29.880]  some 10-minute report on Dateline NBC this isn't some 10 minute report on
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:35.120]  Nightline this isn't him he's been on them all this is a two-hour show time
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:39.920]  that's aired more than 50 times and has gone supernova on the street at the gym
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:44.040]  I've had callers calling and said yeah everybody's talking about it this film
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:47.320]  that I consulted on I'm proud of that fact I mean I told you four years ago
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:51.360]  and I told Kevin take me out of it because he had me voicing it just like
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:54.640]  my two new films don't have me in it even then I realized get me out of this
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:59.920]  film but that's why I've got an arrangement to get him super cheap from
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:02.560]  Kevin that's why I'm selling him even four bucks cheaper than he is at info
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:06.720]  wars.com because I worked on this thing for four years with Kev or a lot in the
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:09.240]  first two years and you know my footage is in all the extras and a lot of my
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:13.480]  footage is in the film I should add that but but my point is I'm in the same lot
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:17.960]  with Selly and Selly kept saying this was going to happen and now these
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:23.680]  bastards have done it it's so disgusting and so evil that and we've got to pray
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:27.560]  for this man he is a school teacher he doesn't have any money he lives in a
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:34.760]  trailer we need to support Selly we need to get him a legal defense fund right
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:38.800]  now he has a appointed attorney they're trying to pressure him to plea bargain
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.040]  if he does then they're going to keep setting him up from there so when they
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:46.800]  kill him they can say oh he was just a felon that's how they work just like I
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:50.920]  tried to discredit web then they double tapped him in the head and I'm telling
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.760]  you if we don't get him out of this I think we're gonna end up here in the
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:57.880]  Selly committed suicide so we've got him here to tell us that he's not ever
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:01.920]  gonna commit suicide Selly God bless you my friend well thank you for having me
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:05.880]  Alex appreciate the effort what do you think of that introduction I mean is
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:10.760]  that accurate yeah you know I wasn't a voter patrol but I was DEA I was a
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:14.520]  police officer detective sergeant and so forth okay somehow I got it mixed up
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:17.640]  with border patrol in there yeah that's okay I know what it was you were in a
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:21.760]  sheriff's department on the border or I was with the police department on the
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:27.600]  border okay my memory had that yeah detective sergeant but the reason I'm
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  going out on the air with you as we speak right now it's because the ATF has
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:38.680]  been going around calling the media saying that I'm in prison already that
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:44.520]  I'm on my way to prison because of gun violations and so forth and and I think
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:48.720]  let me stop you let me stop you for us this is key two weeks ago when I first
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:52.360]  heard that's what I heard so they put out that's what they do you've already
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:55.840]  been beaten you're already in jail you're already a convict that's how these
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:01.000]  people operate go ahead exactly and and basically what happened was I had a fire
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.880]  the public defender because he said he there was no way he could help me out
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:11.400]  I really didn't have a defense and that he wanted me to plea out and I said that
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:18.360]  when I saw the plea agreement that I said man they're there just incredible
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:23.400]  what they're asking me to do and I told him that no and I fired him I said you
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:29.000]  know what you're not gonna help me I have a hearing next week a Raymond
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.960]  hearing I do not have an attorney at three speak I cannot afford one so that's
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.440]  it we're gonna look look look we're gonna get you on if I have to pay for at
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:41.440]  least the first part of the proceeding the question is we need to probably
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:46.280]  bring somebody in from outside even the area because they'll kill good lawyers
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.960]  or they'll shut them down or they'll set them up that's why you can't get a
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:53.800]  lawyer in these good old boy areas tell everybody the story how it happened
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:58.720]  where you are and then we're gonna put the call out to try to bring somebody in
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:03.280]  for you and try to get people to send you money right now Sally tell everybody
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:10.640]  what happened well basically what happened was that the guy that that
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:16.200]  was selling the guns to me there were there were ten guns and shot guns and
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:21.600]  so forth we both worked the gun shows and we're actually we're buying and
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:28.800]  selling guns and they got me on what this call is 30 counts of or 35 counts of
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:33.360]  stroke purchases which means the guy gave the guy the money to buy guns and we
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:38.040]  would sell them for a profit and and and do that well bottom line is I got
[1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:42.720]  charged with everything there is to be charged with and the guy was never
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:47.920]  been charged with anything so basically they used them as a snitch to to set me
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:52.440]  up oh there's no doubt let me stop you right there let me stop because this is
[1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:57.640]  the most important things Alex is the fact that I at no time did I know that
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:03.200]  I did I know that I was back in the law and and and and I didn't hide I didn't do
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:08.040]  anything I was just doing what I thought that was so let me stop you I gotta stop
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:12.640]  you selling sure you did not break the law this is a misinterpretation of the
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:16.040]  straw purchase the straw purchase and that's their favorite setup they tried
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:22.200]  to do this to me I believe their favorite straw purchase set up is to
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:26.640]  somebody who doesn't know the law say hey but will you go to the store and buy
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:31.160]  me a shotgun and then you go sure you go buy on the shotgun a straw purchase is
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:35.480]  generally doing it for someone who's a felon and can't own a gun it is not
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:40.280]  people in business who are wholesale buying selling trading and the guy
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:45.560]  comes you and says I got 30 guns that you can then wholesale and and and and
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.160]  you're just you know buying some guns to then sell them you see that's that's how
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:56.080]  they work this and it's it's the gun laws are written to go after citizens so
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:00.200]  I'm gonna try to shut up now and let you tell the story it's just that selly you
[1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:05.320]  didn't break the law and now let's expand to this they've thrown the book at
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:09.920]  you what are they saying well first of all what they're saying is that I
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:15.640]  conspire with the guy to buy guns for the past two years and and secondly you
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:19.520]  know I got arrested the living San Antonio after that gave me two shotguns
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:26.760]  double Nelly shotguns and a couple of handguns and ATF arrested me and and so
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:33.360]  forth and charged me with that basically what they're charging me is with
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:37.960]  everybody does at the gun show so have other people that sell guns without a
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:42.920]  license at the gun shows and now they're trying to say that every almost every
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:50.120]  gun this guy first is I had something to do with it and they're citing 35 guns
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:57.080]  going back to two or maybe three years and and basically what it is is that I
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:04.360]  try to run a sting operation on ATF a few months back with a local channel
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:11.480]  real will Ripley from from channel 5 and ATF found out that we were run that
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:16.680]  sting operation and pulled out on the pull out of the show but what the ATF is
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:21.120]  doing they're going in and they're filming show they got a key to the
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:25.600]  building and then they're profiling people and they're arresting people
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:31.760]  in dropping people at the gun show yeah what they do is what they do is is they
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:35.840]  sell in some cases guns that are automatic people don't even know it
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:40.520]  and they're waiting down the street for them or I mean they just pull all sorts
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:44.760]  they're trying to shut down gun shops they are just doing so much they've
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:48.800]  tripled the size of the BATF a rain of terror is going and sell he's always
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:51.800]  working with the media fighting corruption I think if you get a jury
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:56.400]  trial and go in there and explain that that that they're not following the
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:18:59.760]  spirit of the law and that they're fudging it and and with your great
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:05.120]  record your impeccable record as school teacher police officer DEA Vietnam vet I
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:10.320]  think that you're gonna get me I think it'll get thrown out of court well I'm
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:15.000]  gonna use my my poster panic stress disorder as the reason I've been that's
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:20.680]  the reason I left the DEA I got involved in so much shit with the DEA that I
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:27.320]  reported it to just carry community and other people and so and so tell me stay
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:31.720]  there stay there my friend I want to come back and try to get you some support
[1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:34.880]  of course that they convict you that he won't be able to be a school teacher and
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:42.880]  this just will destroy his life and try to support you sell it just the BATF the

[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:17.000]  be a political activist laughing at him shoving him around and I'll saw you on
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:23.080]  TV saw you on Showtime he had protested the war there he'd organized the
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:29.080]  community he had just exposed so much corruption government drug dealing and
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:33.880]  they are sick and tired of selling Castillo and I remember selling a year
[1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:37.920]  ago on the phone talking about how the BATF was creeping around then you said
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:42.600]  you were going after them and I guess they've gone after you how they try to
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:47.520]  set people up and frame them dangerous business but I guess you keep calling it
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.240]  your post-traumatic stress what I found with post-traumatic stress people I've
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:53.360]  studied is that because you were a sniper and then you were a police officer
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:58.080]  and then you were DEA you know in in helicopters doing raids that was you
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:02.720]  said you've gotten addicted to the excitement and now you're fighting for
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:05.840]  America really on the right side you know I'm repeating your words from years
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.200]  ago and it seems like it is the post-traumatic stress that's leading you
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:14.360]  down chasing the bullet as you've said and I've not want to say I've been in
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:18.400]  combat but just fighting the new old order doing this so much it's like I'm
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:23.680]  addicted to fighting them too and more and more risk I mean does what I'm
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.040]  saying make sense Sally absolutely and and the thing about it is that you know
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:33.400]  nobody attacked the ATF of what the illegal stuff that they were doing the
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:38.640]  Gestapo taxes that were used in an American fear and and I I called the
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:44.760]  local paper they did a story I've been on on the news television where I talk
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:50.800]  about what's happening with that with the ATF and how they're well that's
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:54.800]  exhibit A and B you show that to the jury showing that they were prejudiced
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:58.640]  towards you this is a political persecution go ahead well not only that
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:03.720]  on a drug case where I worked as an expert witness I had one of the assistant
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:09.240]  United States attorney tell the defense attorney that to warn me that I was
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:13.800]  gonna be arrested some way shape or form and they were gonna be coming after me
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:17.520]  I remember last time you were on last time you run and I'm now remembering all
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:22.560]  this is true folks Shelly is an expert witness in gun cases drug cases this is
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:29.080]  pure persecution and and the thing about it when I got arrested I had my my
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:36.760]  medication and they they gave it to the people where I went was incarcerated
[1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:40.160]  knowing the fact that they were not going to be able to give me the medication
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:44.440]  because the doctor didn't know what it was so I went for a day and a half without
[1:26:44.440 --> 1:26:49.920]  my medication and you know I do have a major heart problem I do have diabetes
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.680]  and I have hypertension and and and so forth and they threw me in with the
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:01.320]  population with 100 of the most criminals in Texas worst criminals in
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:07.000]  Texas and after after ATF knew that I had 20 years in law enforcement they
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  threw me with the with the population and put in my life on on as risk as
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.280]  I could have been killed because I was law enforcement but let me guess a lot
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:21.680]  of people in population know about this show in the New World Order did any of
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:26.440]  them know you and then did the word get out that it was a set up well no at the
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:32.520]  time period that time a lot of people didn't know until ATF started contacting
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:36.640]  the news media there's an agent in charge of the Brownsville office Aguirre
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:41.720]  who's going around calling the the the news media telling them that I'm in
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:47.640]  prison already the same guy that he's on channel 5 with the with the with the
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:52.160]  drug trafficking and and and the gun running and stuff like that that I was
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.920]  interviewed for and oh you have exposed him specifically tell us about oh yeah
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:03.160]  I exposed the ATF what they were doing here at the far gun show they were they
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:06.640]  had a key to the building and they were coming early in the morning and they
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:11.360]  would set up on the second floor and they would film the whole show and they
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.560]  would let people know when they're leaving the gun show so they could be
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:22.640]  stopped and entrapped or or arrested or whatever and well but that's that we're
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:26.760]  living a country where this is shouldn't be happening this is in my opinion
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:31.040]  illegal I mean how could it's the Stasi it's guilty into bourbon innocent and
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:35.400]  triple the size of the BATF is Bush's reign of terror exactly and that what
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:39.400]  they were doing and people that actually bought guns legally with paper and
[1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:43.800]  everything else two hours later the ATF was at the house knocking at the door
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:47.600]  saying where's the gun you just bought and the guy said well I have it right
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:51.520]  here so well we just want to make sure it's not going into Mexico yeah right
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:56.040]  like Mexico doesn't have guns America do we live in that they have the the right
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:01.000]  to do this and when they came to my house they they told my wife that if you
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:05.400]  don't give us consent to search your house we're gonna call the media we're
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:09.680]  gonna call the police and we're gonna wait for your grandkids to come home so

[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:54.000]  trying to shut down a gun shop I talked to the gun shop owner this morning he
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.400]  said listen they told me if I just leave him alone and don't talk about it
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:33:59.680]  everything will be all right no they wanted you to shut up while there's
[1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:03.200]  publicity so they can have their way with you it's all about winning it's all

[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:12.480]  going back to you my friend let's talk about the raid itself go back to them
[1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:16.240]  what they said to your wife when you got there what you witnessed well what
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:21.440]  happened Alex was the fact that at the same time I got arrested in San Antonio
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:30.120]  they sent a gun squad into my mom's house she's 83 years old and he lives with
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:35.080]  my sister my sister who's got down syndrome and they walked in there asking
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:39.600]  to search the residence that they were looking for guns and my mom says look
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:47.040]  Felix Castillo does not live here has not lived here ever and why are you here
[1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:50.720]  at the house and just what we're looking for guns we understand that he's got a
[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:56.240]  storage room full of weapons and she's well there is nobody he doesn't live
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:00.960]  here I don't know why you're here and she's welcome we check the the rooms I
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:06.080]  just my daughter's asleep in in one of the rooms and they opened the door and
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:10.520]  they looked and then they went to the other rooms and when they saw the
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:17.120]  picture of President Bush and myself on the wall and Jimmy Carter and myself they
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:23.880]  they realized that they they were actually messing around with somebody
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:29.280]  that there was not a criminal somebody that was let's be clear the the the the
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:33.480]  wicked shell at the top of the BATF sends out their minions who have no idea
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:37.800]  even what's going on exactly so they they left and at the same time that they
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:42.920]  went to my mom's house they went to my wall my house appearing in a mobile
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:48.920]  home that I did I live in and the guy they're 18 in charge of the other
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:55.160]  third's Daniel Casey threatened my after they walked in there and they looked
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:58.200]  around and they were looking for guns and they're looking for receipts and all
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:04.080]  kinds of stuff they found the storage room attached to the house or outside
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:10.560]  the house and they said that that they had received information well they had
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:14.760]  received it because nobody comes to my house number one and number two I says
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:19.240]  you know they asked to search the I don't have a key Sally has a key and I
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:23.320]  don't know what he's got in there so well you know and be honest with you my
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:28.840]  wife has no idea what I was doing at the gun shows he knew I went to the gun
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:33.600]  show he knows all my bows but the thing about it was that they threatened her
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:38.680]  Casey threatened her by saying look if you don't let us search sign the consent
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:42.600]  to search we're going to call the cops then use media and it goes be an
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.800]  embarrassment for you all and and and if that if you still don't then we're
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:52.040]  gonna wait for your grandkids to come home from school so we can because my
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:56.440]  my wife won't my daughter live here with her grandkids and so you need to
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:00.400]  find this consent so they you know she signed a consent out of that's that's
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:04.400]  terrorism right there that's that's as jack booze it gets out of fear so they
[1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:10.240]  took the hinges off the door and they found an AR and AK 200 rifles and and a
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:16.800]  shotgun well let's be clear they'll spin that you mean semi-automatic Mac 90 AR

[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:26.240]  name they'll probably convert those over to follow nothing at all they're all
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:29.960]  they'll probably convert them and they've been caught doing that yeah so you
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:35.500]  know it's it's something that they're trying to and they're using that to
[1:37:35.500 --> 1:37:40.760]  those guns that they were seized as part of the the star purchases or whatever
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:44.880]  the heck they want to charge me with but it's actually to count and I'm looking
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:52.920]  at maybe 10 to 15 years under federal guidelines I'm going to prison for we're
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:57.440]  doing what I did but you know it's just a I mean I don't have a lot I mean I've
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:00.560]  been at the gun show with you you'll you'll be there selling your books and

[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:07.960]  mean they want to shut down gun shows they haven't been able to so they just

[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:44.880]  I want to be clear about this because you told me on the phone when did they make
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:48.480]  the comments about always seen you on Showtime you know you shouldn't be
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:51.640]  politically active when did they say all that and repeat exactly what they said
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:56.920]  well what happened was when I was the when I got picked up they took me to the
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:02.080]  ATO office and they brought a big book with my picture and all the guns that
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:07.200]  I've bought and with my name and you know saying just yeah yeah one of the guy
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:11.200]  that works for Homeland Security it was in the military for ten years says yeah
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:15.840]  you've got a very interesting website and this man he says well I'm glad you
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:20.880]  liked it and he just smiled at me and and then we're known about you for a long
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:25.600]  and doing this and doing that and you know I know you have a lot of
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:29.480]  intelligence and which I do it because a lot of people came and talked to me at
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:34.440]  the gun show the good the bad and the ugly and this is well you know what I
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:38.880]  need I need they read me my rights but at no time did they tell me that do you
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:42.480]  want to speak to us they just kept asking me questions and I was just trying
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:47.600]  to with my my myself around it and it says well if you talk to us we'll let
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:52.040]  we'll we'll ask the the judge to leave you out on a PR bar and they said look I
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:56.880]  talked to an attorney before I before I talked to you guys so he called the use
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:00.880]  attorney said well he's gonna cooperate and he's going so that I went before the
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:05.440]  judge the following day you know shackle like an animal and and and the judge
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:08.320]  says well you know we're letting you out on your PR body cuz you don't have a
[1:43:08.320 --> 1:43:12.840]  criminal history you don't do this and the only thing we asked you to do the
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:16.840]  judge says was for you to get a psychological help I've been doing that
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:23.000]  for years and I'm taking my medication for it but yet it didn't matter to ATF
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:28.360]  because they went ahead and just threw me into the population without taking my
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:33.240]  medication without but when did they this is the key now shaking your book in
[1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:36.720]  your face because you witnessed the alapango drug dealing all that which is
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:41.000]  all admitted I mean that idiot cop that idiot state trooper should be made to
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:46.120]  sit down and watch the 50-something hours of c-span hearings with the solicitor
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:50.760]  general inspector general the CIA admitting the CIA shipped in cocaine and
[1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:55.480]  created the crack I mean it's admitted he's so dumb I mean you know the low
[1:43:55.480 --> 1:43:59.000]  level cops don't deal drugs so they get real mad hearing about it they don't
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:02.520]  know that all over the country there have been tens of thousands of convictions
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:06.440]  of top detectives they're just idiots man yeah well not only that hearing
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:09.600]  hearing South Texas we've got more federal agents getting arrested for
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:14.440]  percoration oh it's been all over the news and and basically you know I was a
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:18.800]  target for them and I was for warm but what did you say to this state trooper
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:23.880]  I said how dare you be so anti-american to shake a book in my face I said how
[1:44:23.880 --> 1:44:27.920]  do you know it's a conspiracy terrorist book you haven't even read it well I
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:32.280]  don't need to read it it's talking about how US government ran drugs well they
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:35.920]  did you know there's a couple of bipartisan investigations by the
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:40.800]  Senate and the congressional hearings that say that they did and he was just
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:45.840]  making fun of me and you know shaking the book in my face you know and and
[1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:51.240]  going very unprofessional I mean very the other guy that was with him was a
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:56.560]  non Latino guy and he was very very professional and it's as you know we we
[1:44:56.560 --> 1:45:00.040]  have to arrest because we have one for your ass you're saying it was a Latino
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:05.800]  that was screaming at you oh yeah yeah guys you know it's a Latino and why is
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.840]  that because I've seen a lot of arrests been a lot of places it was a black cop
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:13.920]  they'll be even meaner to blacks and Mexicans it seems like a meaner than you
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:19.440]  know in Texas to Mexicans what is that well I don't know if I think that they
[1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:23.880]  think that they're doing a favor to the fed that there's a possibility maybe
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:27.480]  that they'll get fired by them that's the only logical thing I can think about
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.360]  because you know why be that way I mean why not be a professional about it
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:37.800]  why why go off and and you know he's showing off in front of the ATF look
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:40.760]  he felt bad because he knows the government brings the drugs in and it
[1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:44.960]  makes his whole job sending zit face kids to prison for marijuana he just
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:49.680]  they're guilty and you should be guilty it's evil it is against the law to
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:54.080]  to profile you know they stopped me not not because of the traffic violation and
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:57.680]  then I was gonna get a warning and this man they stopped me because ATL was in
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:01.760]  the backseat of the car oh I know and they had to like you're stupid like you
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:04.960]  don't know that it was all a setup that's so you don't think it was a sting
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:11.160]  yeah I mean give me one of the worst things that kept saying to me Alex was
[1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:14.920]  the fact that the guy that told me the gun was also arrested was also arrested
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:20.600]  well a week later that I went to see the public defender he says you know this
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:23.720]  guy has not been arrested he's not in the system he was never arrested they
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:27.880]  always do stage arrest yeah well they keep busting top Alcada people and then
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:31.720]  they'll two years later you'll hear oh they were CIA and that was a fake arrest
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:35.560]  just to protect them yeah well you know and and that's what they did to me and
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:39.800]  now I got a court hearing next week and I don't have an attorney and I'm trying
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:45.760]  to get some funds to to hire one because I yeah let me just tell the BATF
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:48.960]  something all the rest of them you think you keep winning hurting all these
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:53.400]  innocent people the the eugenicists running this at the level way above you

[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:07.280]  new order hates you just as much as they hate selling me and you ought to
[1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:11.520]  realize that you think you're evil you think you're tough stuff the people

[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:27.480]  collapsing everything and screwing you to so they're above all of us and you need
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:31.440]  to know you are with us whether you know it or not and let me tell evil cops
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:34.720]  something to in the Bible there's nothing more evil than people in power
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:40.320]  positions bearing false witness and abusing good men good women widows
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:44.080]  veterans people like that and you may not believe in God but I know I don't
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.800]  believe I know I know there's a power in this universe let me tell you something
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.280]  when you do evil stuff like this you're getting the worst karma you could call it
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:56.080]  you can imagine you don't wait till you die or any of that you are gonna have
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.200]  hellish lives you're miserable because you're evil and no amount of money and

[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:17.600]  with that statement absolutely you know because you know I've always been I
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:21.800]  now would say this generation of law enforcement guys are they're coming up
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:25.680]  that they think that they're about the law that they can break every law there
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:31.400]  is all law enforcement we did it the hard way we did it the right way we did
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:35.840]  it with with evidence and so forth you don't manufacture evidence you don't go
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:41.200]  out and and and and you don't have the public cost to get a search warrant you
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:46.600]  don't go to a house and and just threaten people to search the house you
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:49.840]  know this is the new generation of law enforcement that we have that they think
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:56.440]  that they're about the law and they're not I call John Kerry's office the other

[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:10.720]  target of probably the FBI and the DEA and and especially DEA because I got
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:16.440]  them to perjury on a case where they perjured themselves and nothing
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:20.200]  happened to the agents I called them on on corruption from one of the agents
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:26.120]  and you said the DEA told you I'm gonna get you that's right the AUSA's
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:31.280]  office the assistant attorney's office warned me that they were gonna get me
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:37.240]  well God's gonna get to him not us and they don't believe but they will they

[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:27.080]  political guy yeah saw you on TV yeah shouldn't be political I think that's
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:31.280]  key testimony and the fact that the cop was waving your book in your face that's
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:35.920]  your first minute right you've testified before Congress they've had the CIA
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:41.760]  Inspector General admit that the CIA brought drugs in and and still these cops
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:45.920]  they could see legal to say it it's kind of like Kelly rushing in Lyon County
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.320]  Kentucky one of my listeners on one VHS tape had Ron Paul's congressional speech
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:54.960]  called neocond on the eve of the war and then and then part of my film the road
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:59.040]  to tyranny on it and the police in court I mean I talked to the judge on the phone
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:01.840]  I called him at home I said worry he's a moment I'm not about the case but yeah
[1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:05.120]  it's going forward it was in the newspaper and they tried to send him to
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:09.320]  jail they said this film talks bad about police this congressman does it's
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:14.480]  illegal to have these videos I mean the cops think folks I'm not joking here
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:20.600]  the police a lot of them think videos of Ron Paul are illegal I mean they don't
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:24.240]  know what America is they think free speech is illegal they think Selly how
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:31.040]  do we how do we fall this far well education I think these people that
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:35.200]  are coming into law enforcement have no concept of what law enforcement is all
[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:38.200]  about they think that they carry a gun in a bag that they can do whatever they
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:42.520]  want to do and that's why you have a lot of them a big number of them being
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:48.960]  arrested for civil rights violations what Mr. Casey did here he violated the
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:53.120]  constitutional laws of my wife she violated those laws I mean she violated
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:56.280]  the Fourth Amendment right unfair to see your according to your report which
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:55:59.360]  everything you've ever told me has been true in fact usually even watered
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:03.960]  things down against yourself in the name of being honest Selly I frankly a lot
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:07.160]  of people do that they beat themselves up but according to what you've said
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:12.560]  there's no doubt that he terroristically with terroristic threats engaged in
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:16.640]  extortion and racketeering because when you racketeer that's what racketeering
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:20.880]  is in its purest forms when the mob says bad stuff's gonna happen if you don't
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:26.240]  do this exactly and and you know there's guy court cases where it's been thrown
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:30.560]  out of court because whatever was seized it was it was obtained illegally and
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:33.860]  that's why I'm an expert on this I'm an expert witness well you are an expert
[1:56:33.860 --> 1:56:38.120]  witness and am I right that it's racketeering absolutely it's an expert
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:43.240]  witness you know you you violate the law and you fight the law what they did
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:48.320]  illegally I mean that that's ground to throw out the case not only throw out
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:53.600]  the case but you know you have guns when appeal and and what it is is that at
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:58.560]  this time period Alex I I got no money if you guys have an opportunity to buy

[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:43.320]  i'm trying to waive that so i could get a an attorney to do that
[2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:47.880]  and now or you can email me guys at powder burns at prodigy dot net
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:52.280]  so let me ask you a question why don't you want to be there for the
[2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:56.280]  uh... arraignment uh... why do you want to pay to have a lawyer go do that
[2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:59.320]  well uh... because i need a lawyer to go with me
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:03.160]  i need to go i mean i i i so so so so you are going to be going i mean the
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:07.320]  whole point here is they tried to give you a quote court appointed they work
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:09.400]  for the system that's totally staged
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:13.000]  well exactly and that when i asked the uh...
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.640]  uh... the public defender you know knowing that
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:19.480]  about me why why can't you defend me so well you really don't have a defense
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:24.680]  so what am i doing here talking to you and uh... you know so i call him and i
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:28.520]  told him i don't need your services i need to retain an attorney to go and
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:32.600]  defend me uh... and that's basically what i'm trying to do right now
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:35.720]  uh... if i don't find uh... an attorney
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:39.720]  uh... between now and wednesday then then what i'll do is i'll just show up
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:42.760]  and tell the judge okay i don't have an attorney
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:45.800]  right now and he's going to try to uh...
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:49.160]  to give me another public defender well selly that's the point is there's a
[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:54.600]  procedure where for uh... in cases we've seen for like six months
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:58.520]  you can stall them just with getting the attorney issue
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:02.360]  well we've actually got people who aren't these cook patriot people but
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:05.320]  but that i've actually had a lot of successes if you want me to get you in
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:06.680]  touch with them
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:10.520]  um... yeah i i i right now uh... you know
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:14.600]  alec i i don't know if you ever got to this before this is the most stressful
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:17.960]  thing that's ever happened to me and uh... you know uh...
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:20.760]  being on medication and and being uh...
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:26.920]  there's uh... there's a very uh... i am surprised i've not gone postal on this
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:31.720]  but uh... you know i'm trying my very honest to to to be a good uh... citizen
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:35.400]  and you're hurting them remember this and like you said last time around the
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:37.880]  show you're still fighting for this country now
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:42.360]  the evil has come the night has fallen they are now among us that they are now
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:43.880]  running everything
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:48.520]  know that as they persecute you their evil will now be exposed and will save a
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:49.480]  lot of others
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:53.160]  well exactly because i i i i i i i i i i i i i understand that they're not going
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:56.600]  to try to help me that they're they'd like for me from the get-go
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:13:01.960]  uh... they like there is no justice the system is corrupt i know that i that
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:04.520]  government cannot be trusted to really help
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:08.600]  somebody else and uh... what i need to do is go forward with this and
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:12.920]  uh... you know i'm looking to do the rest of my life in jail
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:17.000]  for one mistake that i that i might have made uh... in my life but you didn't
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.400]  make a mistake they interpreted
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:22.520]  uh... you know they claim that you're not allowed to
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:26.360]  sell guns probably you can sell your own collection well if you're buying guns
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:28.840]  that are then part of your collection that you then resell
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:33.160]  i mean again the the drug the drug the drug that you're not allowed to sell
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:38.760]  the drug the the the gun laws are meant to persecute gun owners
[2:13:38.760 --> 2:13:44.120]  not stop criminals exactly you know and uh...
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:48.280]  it's just a shame that uh... you know i've placed my life on the line
[2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:52.920]  many many times for my country and uh... i never thought that uh...
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:56.360]  i would be fighting for my life now and uh... you know i still go out and
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:00.280]  protest the war i still go out there and get involved with people for peace
[2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:04.600]  and justice and uh... um... it is just uh...
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:07.720]  hey briefly tell us how they tried to set you up and get you killed your last
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:11.640]  d a d e a operation well it was a a uh...
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:15.320]  bus buy as they say uh... you know i was buying heroin and
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:19.400]  and and cocaine and the bus buy and i gave the best signal
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:23.480]  and nobody would come i could see the agents in there and the guys
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:27.160]  had guns with them and uh... they were going to come they were going to
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:30.920]  you know kill me if i didn't show them the money and uh...
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:35.000]  at the very very last minute the guys just uh...
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:40.200]  uh... got arrested uh... but uh... they gave them ample time to uh...
[2:14:40.200 --> 2:14:43.480]  to try to hurt me because i didn't i didn't have a weapon with me and they did
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:47.960]  and uh... uh... that's all i knew that my career was over with the d e a and
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:52.760]  that's why i left the d e a uh... when i'm sick live for six months before i
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:56.360]  i left the d e a because of uh... what they were trying to do to me
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:14:59.880]  and basically i had threatened to call a press conference
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:03.480]  on the orang contra investigation that's where i can't take the large walls
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:07.800]  the spot for prosecutor for orang contra to let them know that the uh...
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:11.080]  what the government was involved in and also the same files that
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:15.000]  george w bush field when he came into office
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:18.520]  and those are going to be the same files that i'm going to need uh... to defend
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:21.480]  myself in court
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:25.400]  you're a hero you're one of the main people sided
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:28.840]  i mean we've been worked for all over north you know what what can it work for
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:30.200]  me uh... i mean
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:32.280]  all over nor the uh... thought uh...
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:35.320]  silent national security and of course national security was not about to
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:36.760]  release both things
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:38.920]  and then he got excited
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:41.720]  uh... although he was a convicted felon but uh...
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:44.680]  that's what he was able to get away with but he had uh...
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:48.520]  top lawyers uh... to defend them you only get national security for shipping
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:52.760]  drugs into school children where we're at work for uh... for you know for selling
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:53.960]  firearms
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:55.960]  to the american people you get prison
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:15:59.320]  you know that's one of the things i told you at the fbc so i mean what are you
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:00.720]  guys doing about all those
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:03.160]  and sixteen are being sold uh...
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:07.160]  in the black market mexico that are moving to a military issue
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:09.160]  is a well he said uh...
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:11.800]  that happens in third world countries and and that
[2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:14.920]  that's part of the government that we sell them those guns to the military
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:17.720]  and the military comes around and tells them to uh...
[2:16:17.720 --> 2:16:20.040]  uh... to the cartel whatever but that
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:23.080]  you know that business issues with latin america
[2:16:23.080 --> 2:16:24.520]  yeah the uh...
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:27.280]  bush wants to give forty eight billion to mexico now
[2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:29.280]  up for just two billion a year
[2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:32.680]  and that is to build up the drug cartels they want
[2:16:32.680 --> 2:16:35.840]  to wage war on the other cartels briefly explain to people
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:38.160]  who lost that does works for what's really going on
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:41.880]  well it's a government uh... that the military government that run the uh...
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:43.440]  the cartels
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:47.800]  several years now and and uh... and if you know it's obvious that if you don't
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:48.640]  uh...
[2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:53.840]  they know they come in here into the borders of uh... of texas in mexico the mexican military
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:55.560]  and that they call we're uh...
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:58.480]  they took over the street and they took over everything
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:02.280]  so there's no way shape and for that the cartels can fight the military
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:02.920]  though
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:06.240]  who ends up running the drug is going to be the military
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:09.640]  running the drug using the cartels as their
[2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:10.920]  as the gopher for it
[2:17:10.920 --> 2:17:12.160]  let's be clear though
[2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:14.240]  our government the u.s
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:17.320]  is involved with law zetas
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:18.360]  talk about that
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:20.320]  yeah well we trained uh...
[2:17:20.320 --> 2:17:21.920]  the fact that uh...
[2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:25.800]  we trained the cabela i personally train the cabela is down in latin america
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:27.760]  and and what am i like
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:31.640]  and all those that's what we trained on that that's going to be my defense you
[2:17:31.640 --> 2:17:32.520]  know
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:36.880]  i was part of our instrumental in training this kind of people that to come in
[2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:39.080]  and can do all kinds of shit too
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:41.560]  stuff to other car government
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:42.880]  uh...
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:48.320]  to go to all countries and and uh... now they're uh... the the crime has built over into
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:49.880]  the u.s
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:52.880]  and the current let's explain the quote drug war
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:57.360]  is going in and blowing up villages in having planes spray one group of coca
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:17:58.960]  plants but not the others
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:02.800]  owned by the group that's backed by the right wing military exactly and that's
[2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:06.160]  how the uh... paramilitary to get trained and that's why they're still
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:07.160]  around
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:10.720]  uh... they have not been taken out because they're part of the uh... of the
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:12.600]  system that works for the uh...
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:14.240]  firm for
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:16.960]  for the military as you see now today
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:21.000]  maxi coca finally admitted that they do have a paramilitary
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:24.320]  paramilitary group uh... going on
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:28.720]  in the in mexico and let's be clear that right down in south texas don't say
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:30.000]  where is a liability
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.880]  the cia trains lost that is right now
[2:18:32.880 --> 2:18:36.520]  and a train them to wage war against the few small
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:39.040]  rival drug gangs there is a drug war
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:41.120]  at the big scale
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:45.240]  but it's only about who controls the main conduits well it's called the
[2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:48.160]  process of elimination and that's basically what they have done with the
[2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:50.160]  cartels and uh...
[2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:53.440]  uh... they come over and they've taken over and and uh...
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:57.120]  the military uh... will will continue to run uh...
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:59.600]  truck operations uh...
[2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:02.440]  and bush is forty six billion for mexico
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:06.640]  used to finally get a monopoly on the cocaine and heroin coming in
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:10.000]  yeah well that's why black water will not lose their life is black waters on
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.840]  our way to mexico right now to train the uh...
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:17.520]  uh... paramilitary groups in in in mexico and part of it probably can be
[2:19:17.520 --> 2:19:19.280]  here in the u.s. also
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:23.040]  yeah it's all going to be just the drug dealers openly ruling everything but

[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:30.360]  investigation into US government role in 9-11 but just go to prison planet you
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:34.840]  can link throughout the main page John Bolton this is exactly why we voted
[2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:40.560]  against the new human rights council to stop the 9-11 investigation so we're
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:46.000]  covered that after the break before I in this segment I just want to tell you
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:49.960]  that if you don't have a prison planet dot TV membership you're out of your
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:55.720]  mind you get the fourth hour that some days we go for two three hours you get
[2:27:55.720 --> 2:28:00.080]  the fourth hour of overdrive and you get the video feed where we roll footage
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:06.440]  video clips document cam two cameras on me we've got George Humphries coming in
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:10.640]  Monday he'll be with us in the first hour into the I mean in the third hour
[2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:17.160]  into the fourth overdrive hour we've got other guests coming in they're gonna be
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:20.640]  in studio for this hour and then the great part about it is for prison planet
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:25.640]  TV members within two hours usually quicker but the computer compresses it
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:30.560]  all uploads it and the link goes live already posted for you so the second it
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:34.840]  goes live you have it because when we shoot the TV show in high-deaf or films
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:38.200]  and you know high-deaf or whatever we got to compress it down it takes hours
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:43.320]  sometimes days got to edit it all cut it together not now folks the TV show and
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:47.320]  films are still that way but with this you know it's in medium quality so it's

[2:31:57.480 --> 2:32:02.400]  our difficult times is to store food and get healthy my comrades and I of the
[2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:06.520]  media don't want you to panic we unlike fearless radio try not to
[2:32:06.520 --> 2:32:10.360]  tell you about the food control legislation hurricane Katrina the
[2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:15.160]  American famine families unable to buy food if we told you that solution to
[2:32:15.160 --> 2:32:19.360]  all these problems is food you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it
[2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:23.760]  disappeared or you couldn't afford it you'd completely mess up the perfect
[2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:28.520]  strategy for population control and they kick us out of the survivors club you

[2:33:19.800 --> 2:33:27.240]  we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:34.840]  enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude
[2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:42.840]  people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:51.000]  they ought not to enjoy. Perhaps you would better starve from the beginning perhaps you
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:57.560]  would better starve from the beginning perhaps you would better starve from the
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:05.400]  beginning. Too many kids are what's making the planet worse. A lot of these kids come
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:10.760]  from bad gene pools they don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:16.240]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:20.280]  in the journal pediatrics. These new studies suggest that the opposite that
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:23.600]  the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:28.040]  mental performance. Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:33.000]  it also cause cancer. For example the government had the right under US law to
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition. We
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:41.960]  have to work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows. Any attempt to
[2:34:41.960 --> 2:34:47.320]  achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well join me I'm glad to sit
[2:34:47.320 --> 2:34:54.080]  here at the right hand to say there's a need for a new world order. Someday in the
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:16.680]  next few years a solution will emerge. A new world order. It's here. The whole
[2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:24.320]  planet turned into a militarized slaughterhouse. They plan to release bio
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:29.920]  weapons in the final phase to kill almost every one of us. And for the few
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:34.160]  survivors decades from now if they launch the black off and we're unable to
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:42.120]  stop them you will cry and remember. You will remember we warned you. We tried to
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:52.760]  stop them as best we could but you failed. That is one possible future. Or we may
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:58.240]  be able to rest control of the levers of the new world order from these people
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:02.760]  and then break their system down. But they say of the ring of power anyone that
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:10.760]  clutches the controls instantly is seized by the diabolic wickedness. The new
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:16.400]  world order is upon us ladies and gentlemen. Huge story upon info wars

[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:26.000]  role in 9 11. John Bolton. This is exactly why we voted against the new
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:30.800]  human rights council. An official in the newly formed UN Human Rights Council has
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:35.160]  called for fresh investigation into the events of 9 11 in order to examine the
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:39.120]  possible role that neoconservatives may have played in the attacks. New York
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:42.560]  Sun picked up the story today explaining that Richard Faulk a professor of
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:47.360]  international law who were lining up I should add for the show law emeritus at
[2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:50.600]  Princeton University and an expert on human rights was assigned to a new
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:54.600]  position within the council on March 26. His role was to report on human rights
[2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:59.400]  in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. Two days prior to the
[2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:03.280]  announcement Faulk appeared on the former University of Wisconsin lecture
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:08.880]  Kevin Barrett's radio show I guess here on Genesis and spoke of how he is keen
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:13.000]  to see a fresh investigation to 9 11 in order to address inconsistencies in the
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:17.040]  official account of what happened. Mr. Faulk told Barrett it is possibly true
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:21.560]  that especially the neoconservatives though there was a situation in the
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:27.120]  country and it would be something were to happen it would make the American
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:30.040]  people kind of babbled through that. Let me read it again. I'm trying to hurry
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:34.200]  here. Mr. Faulk told Barrett it is possibly true that especially the
[2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:37.360]  neoconservatives thought that there was a situation in the country and in the
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:41.280]  world where something had to happen to wake up the American people whether
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:45.360]  they are innocent about the condition and the contention that they made
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:48.480]  something happen or not. I don't think we can answer that definitively at this
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:52.720]  point. All we can say is there is a lot of grounds for suspicion. There should be
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:57.240]  an official investigation of the sort of 9 11 Commission to not engage in and the
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:38:01.680]  failure to do these things is cheating the American people and in some sense the
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:07.640]  people the world of a greater confidence in what really happened then they
[2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:11.320]  presently possessed. Now some people say oh forget a new investigation it'll be a
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:20.600]  whiteout a total whitewash. Well if you and that's what the big comedian oh
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:24.440]  what's his name he's in the new film we're putting out I love him he's funny
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.200]  I don't get everything he says I have this thing on air I get nervous kind of
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:31.400]  subconsciously and then I can't remember names as soon as I'm off air I'll kick
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:36.200]  myself and be able to remember them all it'll pop my head in a second and you know
[2:38:36.200 --> 2:38:39.720]  he was saying oh we don't need a new investigation because the same people
[2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:42.720]  running it'll be a fraud you know that always happens with Kennedy and with
[2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:49.920]  this and with that but yeah James Carlin that's it George Carlin oh man my
[2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:53.400]  mind is just something else there I got so much going on in it yeah George
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:59.320]  Carlin well look at the 79 congressional committee they spent millions and
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:02.880]  studied it and said yeah he multiple people shot him the acoustics picked it
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:06.280]  up they had experts in they said it was a conspiracy there was more than one
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:09.320]  shooter we don't know who killed him but it was probably elements of the
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:15.320]  government that that got no attention it's like the coroner and everybody else
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:20.000]  in LA said yeah they shot Bobby Kennedy three times in the back and once in the
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:25.200]  back of the head sir Hans arm was pinned down he couldn't even have gotten one
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:29.760]  shot into Bobby but back then we didn't have the internet to get this
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:35.720]  information out so if there is a sub body of the UN because the the thing of
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:38.800]  the Security Council levels totally control on military decisions and
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:43.800]  things like that and it's controlled you know through the higher level boards and
[2:39:43.800 --> 2:39:48.960]  the Secretary General and the committees but at the mid levels and then
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:56.360]  as different spokes you can use it as a venue via anti-Americanism to bring it
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:01.080]  out and then have the investigation widened to where you find out it's
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:04.960]  globalist involved and I said when the attacks happened I said they're gonna
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:09.280]  let this come out this is so bold but they're gonna claim a right wing faction
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:13.520]  did it but never prosecute anybody they'll just let it be publicly known
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:17.280]  and blame it on America it's key we bring it out and show it's international and
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:21.600]  scale with England involved with Israel involved with the Germans involved I
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:25.520]  mean these intelligence agencies all interlocked together it's not one group
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:29.040]  it's not just the US it's not just private corporations it's not just the
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:33.200]  defense contractors that really are the military and then just basically write
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:39.400]  the the the maps of how the Pentagon fits together it's really secondary now
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:44.120]  it's not just the British it's not just the CIA it's not just defense
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:49.680]  intelligence it's not just Mossad it is it's all one creature you can't even
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:54.320]  differentiate they're all guilty that doesn't abscond any of them from the
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:58.800]  guilt it brings them all together and gives you the view of how the crime
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:03.400]  syndicate operates people say oh they couldn't get together they couldn't make
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:07.240]  it work how did the Italian mafia have about 16 different branches when they
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:11.600]  finally got exposed you know they had J. Edgar Hoover blackmailed where he'd get
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:14.160]  up and say in the fifties there's no such thing as the cosinoster and it
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:17.160]  turned out he was vacationing with them and going to the tracks with them and
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:23.080]  you know the racetrack the horse track well that's just the Italians and they
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:27.520]  had these big arms and big systems working together and they'd have
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:32.640]  occasional wars on average about every 10 years but then they would still have
[2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:36.520]  commissioned meetings and fix it and smooth it over the agenda they would
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:40.880]  fight with each other but the agenda of keeping the slaves in the dark selling
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:44.000]  the heroine selling the cocaine corrupting the police running the
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.440]  whorehouses buying the congressman that all continued that's all it is you have
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:53.240]  now each country consolidated under a few kingpins and then they meet in
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:56.840]  yearly commission meetings in fact all they do is go to meetings and they have
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:00.360]  different meetings over the environment meetings over infrastructure and meet
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:05.120]  meetings over energy and meetings over military it and they just fly around
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:08.520]  going to these commission meetings and they whack each other and kill each
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:11.600]  other you're always reading about Rothschild being found tortured dead or
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:16.840]  hung or British royalty being killed or you know that that's always going on to
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:20.840]  they still kill each other but but but it's whoever controls the levers they're
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:24.000]  always wanting the newest mind control the newest brainwashing the newest
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:29.120]  propaganda that's all on autopilot by the big big infrastructures that they've
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:33.880]  built that now are just self-maintaining self-functioning autopilots and then
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:38.000]  they just do slight corrections at the cockpit you understand and then the
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:44.520]  the bureaucracies they bill just rage forward gobbling and growing and oh it's
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:47.320]  incredible how these it's that's how institutions operate they always say
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:51.040]  it's impossible for the government to carry out 9-11 they're too inept but
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:56.360]  guys in a cave did it on dialysis with a laptop
[2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:04.320]  think about this the idiocy they sell you the government has designed
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:09.840]  bureaucracy to bog you down there's not bureaucracy at the top it's command and
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:13.360]  control it was laid out decades before you see something happened the
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:16.560]  infrastructure was built the new phasing was done just like computers and
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:22.080]  technology is phased in they phase in from the VHS to the DVD they phase in
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:26.240]  from this processor to that processor it's all broad and they'll even let two
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:29.560]  or three different systems compete to see which is most successful or they'll
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:35.720]  merge them they have competition amongst themselves I said I'd take calls and I'm
[2:43:35.720 --> 2:43:39.280]  not taking calls who's up first here
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:43.880]  Thomas and Kansas here on the air thank you for holding hey Alex what's going on
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:49.080]  man worldwide transmission against Ernie yeah I just got my prison planet TV dot
[2:43:49.080 --> 2:43:54.120]  membership some pretty stoked about that but I kind of wanted to talk about the
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:44:02.040]  opium over in Afghanistan and basically they're saying now that the opium is
[2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:08.000]  going to support supply morphine and all these other excuses or how does that
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:15.240]  work exactly there's really no excuses the troops openly guard the poppy fields
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:18.920]  that's come out in the news and then it's loaded up on truck and put on plane
[2:44:18.920 --> 2:44:24.000]  and publicly flown directly in to Kosovo which is controlled by the United
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:30.280]  Nations and then then it is sold in bulk to the mass distributors and the money
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:37.120]  is directly put into European and US banks wow so the DEA do they work they
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:40.240]  work nationally or they work internationally with any other group no
[2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:42.960]  no no they work internationally but they're only they're told who to go
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:47.200]  after and then there they go after smaller cartels smaller crime syndicates
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:52.960]  just like with diamonds 98% monopoly just 20 years ago about the beers the
[2:44:52.960 --> 2:44:56.360]  Oppenheimers now they only have a 90% monopoly and diamond prices went down
[2:44:56.360 --> 2:45:01.600]  by about 40% so see it's all about trying to have a monopoly that the drug
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:04.360]  war at the international level is about going after their competition the
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:09.040]  cowboys this is interesting because the NAFTA superhighway that they're building
[2:45:09.040 --> 2:45:12.520]  and they're gonna build you know they're talking about doing more business with
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:17.840]  Columbia Bush has little here let me break it down I've talked to people in
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:22.080]  the army in the Navy they'll be there in the Gulf of Mexico the Coast Guard they'll
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:25.880]  be there at bases they've got these big blimps tethered over the border and
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:29.120]  they'll have a guy standing over their shoulder and who's an intelligence and
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:32.520]  they'll say okay we've been tracking this shipment here comes this plane right
[2:45:32.520 --> 2:45:35.480]  now he'll say leave that and then there'll be another one I'll go get that
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:40.600]  one and and occasionally when they do Boston 18 wheeler with three tons of
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:43.880]  pure cocaine showing it's coming directly from the you know from the
[2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:49.920]  grower from the original maker it was in the AP it just said state police
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:54.560]  busted it with a border patrol and the DEA showed up and the FBI showed up with
[2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:58.440]  the CIA and just said we're taking it and nothing was ever said again because
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:02.640]  because that was an important Mexican politician shipment and those officers a
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:06.600]  lot of them are getting personal cuts out of it it's interesting because I'm
[2:46:06.600 --> 2:46:11.400]  noticing a pattern with like wars and like drugs you know you have the Vietnam
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:17.280]  War you know tons of heroin coming in drugs coming in through you know caskets
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:22.880]  and you know and then we have Iraq war and then Afghanistan it's just it's all
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:26.000]  very interesting let me stop you you see and people always debate is it about
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:30.400]  oil weapons sales is it for Israel is it about having a base to attack other
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:33.960]  countries to be in Iraq it's always about all of that they don't do something
[2:46:33.960 --> 2:46:37.680]  unless it lines up for all their interests their business interest okay
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:41.000]  and when you see all those interest agreeing in the crime syndicate it's
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:45.600]  gonna happen now it is they print the money they issue the money well then why
[2:46:45.600 --> 2:46:50.160]  do they care so much about the 500 billion conservatively in narcotic
[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:55.120]  sales a year in the US that's just the US it's it's you know 500 billion in
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:47:01.080]  Europe it's it's tens of billions in in China in Japan in England tens of
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:08.320]  billions in Canada it's about what banks get that money to then loan 10 times
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:12.440]  that out in fractional reserve banking but more importantly you see it's black
[2:47:12.440 --> 2:47:17.080]  money it's it's it's black world money right it's it's it's ghost money it's
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:21.560]  perfect to corrupt the military it's perfect to corrupt the cops and then
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:28.280]  that corrupting process you can now bring them into underworld black ops with
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:32.880]  the mercenary forces or with secret forces and you can now deploy them
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:38.640]  domestically and so it's about building crime cadres they're basically like KBR
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:41.720]  and black water all these other groups are getting a cut basically well let me
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:47.440]  just leave names out of it but no no the Mr. Prince is a Christian of the Lord
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:54.200]  you heard on the news of the Lord but but the Lord but let's go back and and you
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:47:58.920]  know the Prince is a Lord and and explain how this works this is admitted in
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:03.240]  Vietnam this is admitted in Afghanistan you see there were two Taliban's that
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:08.120]  was the original Wahhabi Taliban brought him by the CIA in the six months you
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:12.480]  know deployed two years before to attack the Soviets come to attack and that was
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:15.800]  because the Soviets were controlling a lot of the opium coming out of that
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:21.680]  region the globalists couldn't put up with that so so they moved in but it's
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:24.720]  never over that one issue it's about leveraging it time and time again I
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:29.000]  mean I told people day one and by the way that was Rumsfeld even admitted this
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.840]  he gave a press conference two weeks before the attack I'll never forget it
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.800]  on Fox News and he said we've already paid off most of Saddam's generals we've
[2:48:36.800 --> 2:48:41.240]  already paid him tens of millions apiece three of his army groups are gonna
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:45.720]  stand down two of the four Republican Guard are gonna stand down and and some
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:48.560]  said oh it's a Psyop to make him not trust this military no he was being and
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:52.520]  then right after the war he said I'm never after the takeover I never said
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:55.960]  that but those that's video he said that and it was true because they'd already
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:01.080]  trained those guys in the 60s and 70s and 80s here in the US like Saddam was
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:04.880]  trained and so they already had well it was the perfect place to really have a
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:10.160]  staged war you understand I see because it was fully owned then they roll in and
[2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:13.640]  I start telling you day one hey I'm hearing from troops at hood after they
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:17.200]  got back in a year they said man they just walk in and give you 30 grand and
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:20.560]  say now keep your mouth shut but then they can use that over you and that's
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:25.680]  grunts get 30 grand to 50 grand the higher ups Colonel level get a million
[2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:30.920]  and it said that generals get 10 15 20 million commanders of you know the heads
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:35.440]  of the operations are given hundreds of millions so basic so basically the DEA
[2:49:35.440 --> 2:49:40.520]  just stays in business because they're getting trickle down money the DEA only
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:45.360]  goes after cowboys and they're compartmentalized they only go after
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:51.000]  small operators I see okay or you know let's say some guy you'll get to deal
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:56.360]  see the FARC we're producing a lot of the cocaine about 30% so they sent
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:50:00.560]  Richard Grasso in Reuters photo hugging the head of the commie gorillas and he
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:05.360]  publicly said and it's US law says drug money can be invested internationally in
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:09.800]  the stock market see it's all public it is not even debatable and then the FARC
[2:50:09.800 --> 2:50:13.480]  refused so they finally killed him a few months ago it took him took him eight
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:17.560]  years but they they finally got him and they have the GPS on the planes that
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:22.160]  taxpayers pay for 24 hours a day they shoot down any body trying to fly in
[2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:28.160]  they shoot down the missionaries flying in and they would GPS they'll spray one
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:32.600]  field right next to the other field they own and run so it's all a business
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:37.080]  okay and so the DEA is compartmentalized most of them don't even know
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:42.040]  they're only sick on the smaller operators that are driving down the
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:47.000]  price which the banks don't like we'll be right back
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:55.560]  it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a
