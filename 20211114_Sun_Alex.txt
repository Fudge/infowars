[00:00.000 --> 00:13.660]  I really like sports, and sports is good for people, but it's been taken over and it's
[00:13.660 --> 00:14.660]  sick.
[00:14.660 --> 00:18.020]  It's woke, and that's why it has about half the viewers it had just five years ago, and
[00:18.020 --> 00:23.940]  I'm not the only person that's had this exodus out of it, but watching the unified talking
[00:23.940 --> 00:27.340]  heads demonizing somebody that didn't want to put some experimental shot in their body
[00:27.340 --> 00:30.120]  that's banned in most countries.
[00:30.120 --> 00:34.040]  And then disgusting Howard Stern, you know, they're blackmailing with all the stuff he's
[00:34.040 --> 00:39.600]  done in the past, coming out saying F.M. F. Aaron Rodgers, he should be kicked out of
[00:39.600 --> 00:45.480]  the NFL for refusing the injection, but then I have stacks of news here where the Pfizer
[00:45.480 --> 00:50.800]  and Moderna shot is getting either banned completely or major governments are saying
[00:50.800 --> 00:56.120]  do not give it to people under 30 because it's causing people that have young healthy
[00:56.120 --> 00:58.840]  hearts to have heart attacks and die.
[00:58.840 --> 01:05.840]  Does it matter if it's skin divers or soccer players or football players or baseball players
[01:05.840 --> 01:10.760]  or basketball players, record numbers have myocarditis and their doctors tell them, oh,
[01:10.760 --> 01:13.640]  you got this from the vaccine, hopefully you'll get better.
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.240]  A Baker County high school senior is in the hospital after collapsing on the tennis courts,
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.560]  breaking new details on the deaths of a high school soccer player, Finland, Denmark, Starman,
[01:23.560 --> 01:26.360]  Christian Erickson collapsing towards the end of the first half.
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.120]  The Kennedy High Community morning tonight after one of their high school football players
[01:31.120 --> 01:32.120]  died.
[01:32.120 --> 01:37.080]  A South Carolina high school football player has died after collapsing at football practice.
[01:37.080 --> 01:39.840]  Star College basketball player collapsing on the court.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.840]  We want to warn you the video may be difficult to watch.
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.800]  Florida Gator Stark, Yonsei Johnson collapsing during the game.
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.960]  A West Catholic high school student has died after collapsing during a football scrimmage.
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.680]  On mile eight, she suddenly felt fuzzy and blacked out.
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.200]  17-year-old Ryan Jacobs' heart stopped.
[01:59.200 --> 02:00.720]  Unexpectedly collapsed on the field.
[02:00.720 --> 02:03.320]  Megan went into cardiac arrest.
[02:03.320 --> 02:05.080]  Collapsing during Friday night's football game.
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.320]  So you might be wondering how someone in such great shape could suffer from cardiac arrest.
[02:09.320 --> 02:10.320]  It's rare to imagine.
[02:10.320 --> 02:13.920]  I think this corner says the condition is rare.
[02:13.920 --> 02:14.920]  It's just one of those tragedies.
[02:14.920 --> 02:15.920]  Do you have any signs?
[02:15.920 --> 02:16.920]  No.
[02:16.920 --> 02:17.920]  For this race?
[02:17.920 --> 02:18.920]  Absolutely not.
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.920]  She felt like she was in the best shape of her life.
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.920]  That's incredible.
[02:20.920 --> 02:22.160]  She's been dying in the world.
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.880]  This happened four months ago, and he's getting worse and worse, and now his heart valve collapsed
[02:26.880 --> 02:27.880]  and he might die.
[02:27.880 --> 02:30.640]  And they had to go replace his heart valve.
[02:30.640 --> 02:31.640]  Incredible.
[02:31.640 --> 02:36.840]  Remember back in the early days, I said the earlys, earlys for me, like back in the eighties
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.440]  and nineties, you would see really healthy basketball players would just collapse and
[02:40.440 --> 02:41.440]  die.
[02:41.440 --> 02:44.040]  Success story took a tragic turn this morning.
[02:44.040 --> 02:48.920]  Len Baez, the Maryland University basketball star on his way to becoming a world champion
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.560]  in Boston Celtic, died of an apparent heart attack today at Leland Memorial Hospital in
[02:53.560 --> 02:54.560]  Prince George's County.
[02:54.560 --> 02:59.160]  I mean, you can't go out there and take drugs when your heart is operating at such a level
[02:59.160 --> 03:00.160]  and you're so prime.
[03:00.160 --> 03:03.640]  It's like giving a racehorse, you know, drugs, it'll have a heart attack.
[03:03.640 --> 03:06.840]  And that's what's happening to these people because they're causing blood clots in the
[03:06.840 --> 03:09.920]  body and the heart just totally freaks out.
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.200]  It's killing old people as well, but we have the studies, we have the information, and
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.080]  there they are demonizing Aaron Rodgers, which will only make the guy a hero.
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.880]  I mean, I wish more of sports was like Aaron Rodgers, but they're just not the type of
[03:23.880 --> 03:25.480]  people I look up to.
[03:25.480 --> 03:34.160]  I see sports icons now as just as disgusting as Howard Stern or any of the leftist in Hollywood
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.280]  pushing their forced injection illusions.
[03:38.280 --> 03:41.640]  And listen, do I think Howard Stern deserves to be fired because he dressed up in black
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.000]  face and made jokes about Aunt Jemima and drank, you know, malt liquor out of a 40 in
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  1994?
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  No.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.400]  But he goes along and says, de-platform everybody else now for things far less.
[03:55.400 --> 03:59.240]  And he doesn't get de-platform because he's protected.
[03:59.240 --> 04:01.680]  And that's the thing about censorship and this wokeness.
[04:01.680 --> 04:11.440]  It's not equally applied because it was never designed to be equally applied.
[04:11.440 --> 04:20.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, November, oh man, all right, we're going to restart
[04:20.680 --> 04:21.920]  the show here in just a minute.
[04:21.920 --> 04:22.920]  We're going to go to break.
[04:22.920 --> 04:26.080]  Got really big news, a lot of key information for you straight ahead.

[04:31.400 --> 04:33.880]  earth shattering information.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.880]  So stay with us.
[04:34.880 --> 04:36.320]  I'll do the best job I can on the other side.
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.280]  We'll see if we can do the show today.

[06:23.960 --> 06:33.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[06:33.480 --> 06:36.480]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:36.480 --> 06:43.480]  It is Sunday, November 14th, 2021.
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.400]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, emergency false flag alert.
[06:48.400 --> 06:53.040]  Deep State announces plan to remove Biden from office.
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.120]  And just like that, you wondered how they would begin the announcement.
[06:57.120 --> 07:01.920]  We're going to have Kamala Harris step in and Pete Buttigieg is a member of the Cabinet,
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.560]  the Transportation Department, and he'll be the first gay vice president.
[07:06.560 --> 07:08.920]  So we've got to accept it.
[07:08.920 --> 07:14.120]  The first Black president, oh, after Obama.
[07:14.120 --> 07:15.520]  And then she's not even African.
[07:15.520 --> 07:16.520]  She's Indian.
[07:16.520 --> 07:17.520]  Nothing against Indians.
[07:17.520 --> 07:20.040]  It's just all identity politics.
[07:20.040 --> 07:25.000]  So the headline is in the Washington Post and it's an MSM and it's everywhere in different
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  permutations tonight.
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.880]  Harris and Buttigieg under the spotlight amid uncertainty over Biden's future.
[07:35.880 --> 07:38.160]  Isn't that just interesting?
[07:38.160 --> 07:40.880]  Just suddenly it's in the news.
[07:40.880 --> 07:44.280]  Washington Post admits Biden may not be the nominee in 2024.
[07:44.280 --> 07:50.720]  Just to Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, both super unpopular, but both minions of
[07:50.720 --> 07:53.240]  the globalists.
[07:53.240 --> 07:57.760]  They're talking about removing Biden even earlier.
[07:57.760 --> 08:01.400]  Poll shows Democrats want to replace Biden on the ballot 2024.
[08:01.400 --> 08:06.240]  A look at why.
[08:06.240 --> 08:10.680]  That's their plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:10.680 --> 08:15.000]  Now how do you take somebody like Biden who's been their puppet and who's taken all the
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  blame for their globalist agenda and who was a horrible person in his own right, but now
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.360]  not mentally even cognizant of his own actions?
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.280]  And how do you take that and turn it into a winner for your agenda?
[08:27.280 --> 08:30.480]  Well, you assassinate him.
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.760]  You assassinate him and you blame it on the terrorist.
[08:33.760 --> 08:36.520]  You blame it on the American people.
[08:36.520 --> 08:41.680]  You blame it on the group that he identified as the terrorist in January when he stole
[08:41.680 --> 08:42.680]  his way into office.
[08:42.680 --> 08:50.480]  And then again, in June, when he officially put out the national terrorism position of
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.400]  the U.S. government and directive that no longer is radical Islam or the communist Chinese
[08:55.400 --> 09:01.040]  or the Mexican drug cartels or any of those other organizations, it's not the human smugglers.
[09:01.040 --> 09:05.840]  It's not the fentanyl killing hundreds of thousands of years, maiming millions.
[09:05.840 --> 09:08.440]  None of that is a problem.
[09:08.440 --> 09:13.760]  Two people in this office this week had family members overdose and die of fentanyl.
[09:13.760 --> 09:14.760]  Two.
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.080]  In an office of only about 80-something people.
[09:18.080 --> 09:22.280]  But that's not on the radar screen.
[09:22.280 --> 09:23.280]  No.
[09:23.280 --> 09:27.400]  The number one threat is people that question lockdowns and people that question election
[09:27.400 --> 09:33.600]  fraud and people that protest drag queen story time and pedophile story time and critical
[09:33.600 --> 09:39.440]  race theory and communism being taught via the National Education Association through
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.280]  the school districts.
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.440]  So that's where we are.
[09:46.440 --> 09:56.200]  And just like we saw the assassination of Lincoln back in the 1860s, leading to a decade
[09:56.200 --> 10:01.560]  of martial law really nationwide, not just in the South and Reconstruction, and that
[10:01.560 --> 10:07.840]  many civil war that went on for decades, they want the same thing here.
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.520]  And if you don't see that in the tea leaves, if you don't see that written on the wall
[10:12.520 --> 10:18.080]  like Ezekiel saw it writing on the wall, I mean, if you don't see their next move, well,
[10:18.080 --> 10:19.080]  you're blind.
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.200]  Now, they've got other cards in their fist, in their paw, in their claws, in their in their
[10:24.200 --> 10:36.280]  crypt keeper hands, but the big question here, ladies and gentlemen, is what are we going
[10:36.280 --> 10:38.960]  to do about it?
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.520]  Very powerful transcript and video on info wars.com, everybody should share Robert F.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.520]  Kennedy Jr.
[10:45.520 --> 10:52.600]  Warren's government and big tech engineered the destruction of democracy and civil rights.
[10:52.600 --> 10:59.880]  And that is absolutely true.
[10:59.880 --> 11:03.200]  That is what's going on.
[11:03.200 --> 11:08.440]  This isn't just COVID is one area and then the open borders is another and the devaluation
[11:08.440 --> 11:13.800]  of the currency and the inflation is another and the world ID they're putting in as another.
[11:13.800 --> 11:21.640]  It's all the globalist agenda in their own words, their takeover of the planet happening
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.920]  right now.
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.840]  And if we don't start getting leaders to talk about what's really going on, we're going
[11:29.840 --> 11:30.840]  to lose this civilization.
[11:30.840 --> 11:31.840]  Well, guess what?
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.560]  I hear the same thing coming out of General Flynn's mouth that I hear coming out of Robert
[11:36.560 --> 11:41.240]  F. Kennedy Jr.'s mouth, it's coming out of my mouth, it's coming out of Tucker Carlson's
[11:41.240 --> 11:48.000]  mouth, and it's starting to come out of everybody whose informs mouth that America is under a
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.240]  new type of war.
[11:49.240 --> 11:54.120]  This is a globalist attack run by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and a coterie of criminals
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.200]  and we have all the documents where they admit it and we must unify the country against them,
[11:58.200 --> 12:03.840]  not about left and right, but about being an American and surviving and not having them
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.280]  deep six the country into a total collapse for a takeover.
[12:07.280 --> 12:12.520]  Our country is at war with the globalist who are out alive with Communist China.
[12:12.520 --> 12:19.200]  And if we have a massive awakening and realization to that, then we have a very good chance
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.320]  of beating this.
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.360]  But if you don't know you're at war, and if you don't know that you're under attack,
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.320]  and if you don't know that you're under real authoritarianism, or you decide to just keep
[12:29.320 --> 12:36.680]  your head down and go along with it, you are allowing to happen here something that is
[12:36.680 --> 12:41.520]  going to be the most destructive event ever in world history seen politically and massive
[12:41.520 --> 12:45.320]  loss of lives, not just here but around the world, this is a globalist takeover.
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.560]  But if the United States fully falls to this, they're going to have permanent worldwide
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.000]  martial law and permanent lockdown, permanent forced inoculation with whatever they want,
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.800]  arrest of anybody that criticizes the dead and dying and disappearing, and just a new
[13:00.800 --> 13:11.360]  dark age that will make all the horrid, destructive, bloody, satanic, humiliating, warlike, horrible
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.000]  events in history look like nothing but a walk in the park.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.240]  And the new world order agenda is waiting right on the other side of that door.
[13:21.240 --> 13:22.720]  We're like a submarine.
[13:22.720 --> 13:25.880]  You open that door and we're going to flood.
[13:25.880 --> 13:28.400]  And the globalists have almost drilled through it.
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.680]  They're almost through.
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.080]  And you're not going to have to wait long now, folks.
[13:34.080 --> 13:37.840]  I mean, the shields are falling, the country and the world's on fire.
[13:37.840 --> 13:40.080]  We're going down.
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.920]  We're losing right now.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.800]  And all hell's breaking loose.
[13:44.800 --> 13:47.480]  I got people tell me, Jones, all you cover is COVID.
[13:47.480 --> 13:50.360]  Well, that's the thin edit of the wedge.
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.240]  That's their system breaking through.
[13:53.240 --> 13:57.480]  That's their particle beam blasting through that steel door.
[13:57.480 --> 13:59.080]  That's their blowtorch.
[13:59.080 --> 14:00.920]  That's how they get the whole agenda through.
[14:00.920 --> 14:04.000]  So if you blunt that, you stop the main attack.
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.400]  And I've got just incredible news on that front, but the good news is I had a hour and
[14:14.400 --> 14:21.240]  a half, really two hour interview with General Flynn in San Antonio yesterday, and he's really
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.480]  informed and really on fire and really ready to go on the political attack against these
[14:26.480 --> 14:27.480]  people.
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.120]  And he's on the same page as I am.
[14:30.120 --> 14:36.120]  We're linked up in San Pateco and Trump behind the scenes really gets it, but isn't quite
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.400]  sure what move he should make.
[14:38.400 --> 14:45.280]  And I can tell you that this is a very serious time to be alive.
[14:45.280 --> 14:51.520]  And there is a way to stop this, but it is a mass awakening to the fact that a new type
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.800]  of war is coming after the country.
[14:55.800 --> 14:59.680]  And that's what we try to detail here is how they're launching this war, how they're carrying
[14:59.680 --> 15:06.360]  this out and trying to get the average person to realize that inflation isn't just magically
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.360]  happening and people asking if your vaccine passport isn't just magically happening and
[15:10.360 --> 15:12.400]  the border is totally wide open.
[15:12.400 --> 15:13.840]  This isn't just magically happening.
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.880]  This is a global corporate government event to permanently collapse things.
[15:18.880 --> 15:25.200]  And if you think there are shortages of food and this or that now, we have not seen anything
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.200]  yet under this plan, swab talks about cutting the world economy off and then seeing the
[15:30.200 --> 15:34.360]  collapse and the rioting that happens as the pretext for them to bring in their total
[15:34.360 --> 15:37.120]  control.
[15:37.120 --> 15:41.800]  So I'm going to do my best here today to lay all this out, but quite the announcement
[15:41.800 --> 15:47.360]  all over the news that, hey, it's time for Biden to start fading, you know, away here.
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.920]  We're not going to let Biden just fade away, I predict.
[15:49.920 --> 15:53.600]  I think the globalists are going to assassinate Biden, very good chance of that to blame the
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.000]  American Liberty Movement and bring in Marshall Law.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.160]  Stay with us.
[15:59.160 --> 16:00.360]  I'm cutting.
[16:00.360 --> 16:08.240]  I'm cutting this brief announcement on the afternoon of November 9th, 2021.
[16:08.240 --> 16:11.920]  And I just want all the listeners and viewers to know that I've kept this show in the air
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.360]  that I am very, very thankful to you because my main drive is opposing these globalists
[16:17.360 --> 16:18.360]  and it's standing against them.
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.480]  I know that that's your main drive as well.
[16:20.480 --> 16:24.920]  So I thank you for your moral support, your prayers, your word of mouth fighting for all
[16:24.920 --> 16:31.200]  of us and all of our children's futures and also your financial support at infowarstore.com.

[16:59.840 --> 17:06.480]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going
[17:06.480 --> 17:09.200]  to cause flooding, that's not a prediction.
[17:09.200 --> 17:10.200]  You know it's a hurricane.
[17:10.200 --> 17:11.200]  You know it's got a lot of water.
[17:11.200 --> 17:12.200]  It's going to die up.
[17:12.200 --> 17:13.200]  It's going to cause flooding.
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.800]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the UN order to lock down the world
[17:17.800 --> 17:21.440]  economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems
[17:21.440 --> 17:22.440]  for years.
[17:22.440 --> 17:24.560]  It's going to starve tens of millions to death.
[17:24.560 --> 17:25.560]  And now it all happened.
[17:25.560 --> 17:29.760]  25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation and the UN that
[17:29.760 --> 17:31.880]  ordered it's running around being the savior.
[17:31.880 --> 17:35.040]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[17:35.040 --> 17:36.920]  And now the first world's becoming the third world.
[17:36.920 --> 17:38.360]  So listen to me now.
[17:38.360 --> 17:41.600]  We've got the highest quality storeable foods, the lowest price you're going to find ready
[17:41.600 --> 17:45.120]  to ship to you right now at 10% off until November 15th.
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.880]  But after that, the prices are going up, we cannot suppress prices anymore.
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.880]  So protect yourself, get high quality storeable food so you're self-sufficient and fund the
[17:53.880 --> 17:57.320]  InfoWare today at 361 at infowarstore.com.
[17:57.320 --> 17:59.920]  It's time to get your food.
[17:59.920 --> 18:05.760]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[18:05.760 --> 18:13.440]  working for, quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[18:13.440 --> 18:15.680]  evil groups are.
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.960]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[18:19.960 --> 18:22.800]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.680]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.000]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.280]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking
[18:38.280 --> 18:39.440]  up.
[18:39.440 --> 18:42.200]  The weapons work a little too good.
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.520]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too
[18:46.520 --> 18:47.520]  big of a noise.
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.120]  But it's too late for a return back now and they're coming after our children.
[18:52.120 --> 18:57.520]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[18:57.520 --> 18:59.480]  Remember, God is watching.
[18:59.480 --> 19:04.720]  I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of Thursday, November 4th, 2021.
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.440]  That means you've only got 10 days as of taping this to get store-wide free shipping, double

[19:25.800 --> 19:29.000]  We've got a bunch of products sold out for a long time like Brain Force Plus back in

[19:47.000 --> 19:51.400]  and it funds the info war, which is so important in the fight against the new order.
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.240]  So thank you all for your support with supply chain breakdowns.
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.560]  I recommend you get your Christmas shopping done now and have it done and support the
[19:57.560 --> 20:02.400]  info war at infowarstore.com.
[20:02.400 --> 20:12.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:12.600 --> 20:15.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[20:15.240 --> 20:21.080]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:21.080 --> 20:27.280]  Okay, I want all the listeners tuning in on AM and FM stations, TV stations, and the massive
[20:27.280 --> 20:34.440]  numbers of folks watching over infowars.com and Vandau video really let something sink
[20:34.440 --> 20:36.560]  in.
[20:36.560 --> 20:38.440]  We're not larping here on air.
[20:38.440 --> 20:45.600]  This is not live action role play where people every October in different parts of the country
[20:45.600 --> 20:52.320]  have their medieval fest and people go and dress up like they're actually in combat and
[20:52.320 --> 20:58.000]  ride around horses and pack at each other with rubber swords.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.920]  This is real, okay?
[21:00.920 --> 21:02.680]  This is real.
[21:02.680 --> 21:03.680]  This isn't a game.
[21:03.680 --> 21:05.800]  It's not a joke.
[21:05.800 --> 21:09.920]  And you understand they're going to try to kill Trump when he runs for office again.
[21:09.920 --> 21:11.560]  You understand that, right?
[21:11.560 --> 21:15.560]  You understand they're going to try to kill General Flynn if Trump doesn't run and he
[21:15.560 --> 21:16.560]  does.
[21:16.560 --> 21:19.920]  You understand that they're probably going to assassinate Biden to blame on the American
[21:19.920 --> 21:20.920]  people.
[21:20.920 --> 21:22.520]  You understand that's real, right?
[21:22.520 --> 21:26.720]  You understand I'm not up here just saying all this stuff, okay?
[21:26.720 --> 21:29.240]  This isn't fantasy land.
[21:29.240 --> 21:31.600]  This is the real world.
[21:31.600 --> 21:36.600]  Now the globalists may have put their people in almost all the major positions of power
[21:36.600 --> 21:43.560]  at the just department and the FBI and the CIA and the rest of it.
[21:43.560 --> 21:49.680]  But if the American people wake up that there's a multinational foreign corporate takeover
[21:49.680 --> 21:54.120]  that's getting rid of freedom of the press, getting rid of freedom of the general public,
[21:54.120 --> 22:00.620]  setting up a world ID card digital tracking system to tax and control you, and that we're
[22:00.620 --> 22:06.080]  really going into bondage right now and that they're going to have forced inoculation
[22:06.080 --> 22:13.480]  with dozens of shots a year that literally slowly kill you, if the public has a revelation
[22:13.480 --> 22:16.840]  of that, which we're very close to, it's game over.
[22:16.840 --> 22:22.160]  Now, this is what the neural order fears, it's why they've intensified all their suppression
[22:22.160 --> 22:26.680]  of the press, the harassment, their indictments, their arrests, their SWAT team raids, all
[22:26.680 --> 22:36.560]  of it is because they know this is getting very, very, very close right now.
[22:36.560 --> 22:43.640]  The good news is I am seeing everybody from Ted Nugent on the right to Robert F. Kennedy
[22:43.640 --> 22:48.480]  Jr. on the left forgetting all those labels and saying, we're under attack, tyranny's
[22:48.480 --> 22:50.360]  here, we've got to come together.
[22:50.360 --> 22:59.440]  And finally, finally I'm seeing pretty much everybody who's informed, understand, oh,
[22:59.440 --> 23:02.720]  they're promoting racial division because foreign banks are looting the country and they're
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.360]  setting up a police state.
[23:04.360 --> 23:08.760]  Oh, they're going after the cops to bully them to get full political control.
[23:08.760 --> 23:13.480]  Oh, oh, they're announcing that they're going to federalize all our bank accounts and control
[23:13.480 --> 23:14.840]  us in live time.
[23:14.840 --> 23:21.080]  That was announced Friday, I've got the clip from Congress of them saying it.
[23:21.080 --> 23:27.040]  I mean, this is it, folks, you read about tyrants making a move on you, you read about generations
[23:27.040 --> 23:32.800]  ago in big wars, millions dead, you're here now, this is a new type of war.
[23:32.800 --> 23:39.320]  So first we play a clip of Tim Poole and Tim Poole is going to be on the show later this
[23:39.320 --> 23:40.320]  week in studio.
[23:40.320 --> 23:45.400]  He's here in Austin, Texas, the Joe Rogan experience as well and we're going to have
[23:45.400 --> 23:49.080]  Mike Cernovich is going to be here and Luke Redaus is going to be in studio and a lot
[23:49.080 --> 23:53.800]  of other amazing individuals very, very excited about this confluence of folks that are going
[23:53.800 --> 23:59.680]  to just be here at the same time and just happen that way and more this week.
[23:59.680 --> 24:07.920]  But I wanted to play the Tim Poole clip first when he got the news that James O'Keefe had
[24:07.920 --> 24:12.440]  been rated himself and not just that news later, we learned that the New York Times
[24:12.440 --> 24:17.600]  had been given access basically to his private data to his phone, not just that the FBI was
[24:17.600 --> 24:22.800]  going to raid him, but then in live time, they were calling up other members of Veritas
[24:22.800 --> 24:26.760]  that got rated and the New York Times knew they'd been rated while the FBI was in the
[24:26.760 --> 24:32.720]  building in their homes and then they later learned their private data was being given
[24:32.720 --> 24:34.520]  out by the FBI to everybody.
[24:34.520 --> 24:38.120]  That's why a federal judge said, stop that, but I mean, that's like slapping the hand
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.120]  of a pedophile.
[24:39.120 --> 24:41.960]  They can't help themselves.
[24:41.960 --> 24:46.720]  You don't slap a pedophile's hand, you put them in prison, they're not going to stop.
[24:46.720 --> 24:53.440]  So this country has cancer politically and spiritually and so Tim got upset rightfully
[24:53.440 --> 24:57.640]  so and he explained that this is the end of the country if this keeps happening.
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.160]  I mean, Steve Bannon indicted, executive privilege.
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.680]  He was advising the president, he was working with the president.
[25:03.680 --> 25:10.480]  You don't see the president demanding Congress give them their private meeting notes or anything
[25:10.480 --> 25:11.480]  when they're in closed committee.
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.160]  No, it's a separate branch of government and all of this is not normal.
[25:15.160 --> 25:17.080]  They may say it's normal all day, it's not.
[25:17.080 --> 25:19.080]  So here's Tim Poole talking about it.
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.640]  These people are evil.
[25:20.640 --> 25:22.160]  I'm asking myself who?
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.080]  Tim Goldman of the New York Times, evil.
[25:28.080 --> 25:30.080]  We've got to stop playing these games.
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.080]  Why?
[25:31.080 --> 25:33.160]  They want this country to burn.
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.000]  They want power and they will get it by any means necessary and they will use the power
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.600]  of the federal government to do it.
[25:38.600 --> 25:42.840]  I am looking at all of you right now and I am telling you this, the police will kick
[25:42.840 --> 25:48.000]  your door in and bash your teeth out the moment Black Lives Matter protests you.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.040]  We've already seen it happen.
[25:50.040 --> 25:51.160]  You think this is a joke?
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.440]  James O'Keeffe's legal privileged communications were just given to the New York Times and
[25:56.440 --> 26:00.080]  Adam Goldman with a smile on his face published it.
[26:00.080 --> 26:01.520]  He doesn't care about this country.
[26:01.520 --> 26:03.600]  He doesn't care about our norms.
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.600]  These people are at war with you and they will burn your life to the ground like they're
[26:08.600 --> 26:12.880]  doing the Rittenhouse and like they're doing now to James O'Keeffe because you dare oppose
[26:12.880 --> 26:14.320]  their power grab.
[26:14.320 --> 26:17.160]  This is not a joke and it is getting worse.
[26:17.160 --> 26:21.960]  And in the next 10 years, as we enter the fourth turning and it escalates, it is going
[26:21.960 --> 26:23.960]  to get worse.
[26:23.960 --> 26:27.200]  James O'Keeffe is a journalist.
[26:27.200 --> 26:33.920]  The federal government stole his privileged … Absolutely stole his privileged material.
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.640]  So now let's go to a clip of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talking about who the real enemies are
[26:38.640 --> 26:40.080]  and how we must wake up to it.
[26:40.080 --> 26:42.080]  Here it is.
[26:42.080 --> 26:43.080]  You think about this.
[26:43.080 --> 26:51.960]  I got expelled from Instagram because of vaccine misinformation, but Instagram and Facebook
[26:51.960 --> 26:59.600]  cannot point to one single erroneous statement that I ever made.
[26:59.600 --> 27:02.680]  Everything we post is vetted.
[27:02.680 --> 27:08.120]  It is sourced and cited to government databases or peer-reviewed publications.
[27:08.120 --> 27:16.800]  And they use the term vaccine misinformation, they are using it as a euphemism or any statement
[27:16.800 --> 27:24.520]  that departs from official government policies and pharmaceutical industry profit-taking.
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.400]  It has nothing to do with whether it's true or false.
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.760]  It only has to do with what the political implications are.
[27:32.760 --> 27:39.760]  And who is doing this censorship, it's government officials in league with Bill Gates, with
[27:39.760 --> 27:46.280]  Larry Ellison, with Mark Zuckerberg, with Sergei Brinton from Google, and with all of
[27:46.280 --> 27:49.040]  these internet titans.
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.640]  There if they have engineered not only the destruction of our democracy and our civil
[27:54.640 --> 28:03.960]  rights, but they have engineered the biggest shift of wealth in human history, $3.8 trillion.
[28:03.960 --> 28:12.400]  I'm working people to these handful of billionaires, many of them from Silicon Valley.
[28:12.400 --> 28:19.760]  This pandemic has impoverished the world and created 500 new billionaires.
[28:19.760 --> 28:27.640]  And those are the people who are strip-mining our economies and making themselves rich.
[28:27.640 --> 28:34.240]  And is it a coincidence that these are the same people who are censoring criticism of
[28:34.240 --> 28:40.480]  the government policies that are bringing them trillions of dollars?
[28:40.480 --> 28:42.040]  People aren't stupid.
[28:42.040 --> 28:44.280]  We can see what's happening.
[28:44.280 --> 28:51.040]  We can ask the question, que bono, and the answer is the people who are benefiting are
[28:51.040 --> 28:55.520]  the people who are squeezing away our constitutional rights.
[28:55.520 --> 28:56.520]  That's right.
[28:56.520 --> 28:57.520]  And they launched COVID.
[28:57.520 --> 28:58.520]  They launched the attack.
[28:58.520 --> 28:59.520]  We'll be right back.
[28:59.520 --> 29:00.520]  After being unavailable.
[29:00.520 --> 29:03.840]  It's Thursday, November 11th, 2021.

[30:46.720 --> 30:50.000]  I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  don't work.
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  They work.
[30:52.000 --> 31:00.160]  infowarstore.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[31:00.160 --> 31:06.000]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[31:06.000 --> 31:13.720]  working for, quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[31:13.720 --> 31:15.920]  evil groups are.
[31:15.920 --> 31:20.120]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[31:20.120 --> 31:23.080]  And Moderna is in trouble as well.
[31:23.080 --> 31:27.960]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[31:27.960 --> 31:32.240]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[31:32.240 --> 31:36.680]  but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[31:36.680 --> 31:39.680]  And so people are waking up.
[31:39.680 --> 31:42.960]  The weapons work a little too good.
[31:42.960 --> 31:46.760]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too
[31:46.760 --> 31:47.760]  big of a noise.
[31:47.760 --> 31:52.360]  But it's too late for them to turn back now, and they're coming after our children.
[31:52.360 --> 31:57.760]  So it's up to us to protect our little children, or God will not look favorably on us.
[31:57.760 --> 32:00.720]  Remember, God is watching.
[32:00.720 --> 32:06.200]  Bone broth is back and better than ever, and 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot
[32:06.200 --> 32:07.880]  points for a new sale.
[32:07.880 --> 32:11.240]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite
[32:11.240 --> 32:12.240]  formulas ever.
[32:12.240 --> 32:14.960]  And it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[32:14.960 --> 32:21.360]  It's ultimate bone broth plus it's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric
[32:21.360 --> 32:26.360]  root that's so amazing, chaga, mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[32:26.360 --> 32:30.120]  And it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[32:30.120 --> 32:35.960]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of
[32:35.960 --> 32:36.960]  sea salt.
[32:36.960 --> 32:38.600]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[32:38.600 --> 32:40.600]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[32:40.600 --> 32:46.920]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[32:46.920 --> 32:47.920]  and dissolvability.
[32:47.920 --> 32:49.400]  You're going to love this.
[32:49.400 --> 32:52.560]  And when it does for your joints, what it does for your body, it does for your bones
[32:52.560 --> 32:53.560]  is simply amazing.
[32:53.560 --> 32:55.440]  And it helps find the info war.
[32:55.440 --> 33:23.840]  This is really the best bone broth out there, so get yours at m4store.com today.
[33:23.840 --> 33:28.080]  All right, welcome back to this Sunday evening here on the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.080 --> 33:34.600]  And obviously this broadcast is a lot bigger than just a radio or TV show.
[33:34.600 --> 33:37.200]  We're not trying to be entertaining here.
[33:37.200 --> 33:40.680]  I'm trying to save the country and save the planet.
[33:40.680 --> 33:48.440]  And we are the main opposition to the globalist.
[33:48.440 --> 33:54.680]  And for my safety, I really need people to understand how to defeat the globalist very
[33:54.680 --> 34:02.600]  very quickly because if we wait much longer and the public doesn't make their move against
[34:02.600 --> 34:06.840]  the globalists with just a total awakening and a total withdrawal of their support from
[34:06.840 --> 34:12.360]  the system, they're going to be able to engineer the full collapse of the global economy and
[34:12.360 --> 34:18.400]  things are going to be so hellish that they're going to be able to have a really good chance
[34:18.400 --> 34:26.000]  of bringing in permanent martial law in a very long, long, long, long, dark period of
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.560]  hellish authoritarianism that will make what you saw in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia are
[34:31.560 --> 34:37.440]  ongoing right now in places like communist China look like a cakewalk.
[34:37.440 --> 34:48.320]  This is going to be a high tech, very satanic, very openly pedophilic satanic exercise of
[34:48.320 --> 34:50.640]  power.
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.480]  And they really have been preparing for this for hundreds of years.
[34:54.480 --> 34:59.680]  And what they want to do to America and the West is extremely a nightmarish.
[34:59.680 --> 35:02.600]  Now, I'm not telling you all that to scare you.
[35:02.600 --> 35:05.640]  This is going to happen if we don't stop them.
[35:05.640 --> 35:12.480]  I'm telling you the only way out of this is to admit it and to get a grip on it and get
[35:12.480 --> 35:13.480]  right with God.
[35:13.480 --> 35:15.520]  Let me give you the example.
[35:15.520 --> 35:22.080]  Orpheus says in the Matrix to Nia, before he takes the red pill, one cannot be told
[35:22.080 --> 35:24.200]  about the Matrix.
[35:24.200 --> 35:26.840]  One has to see it.
[35:26.840 --> 35:34.240]  You take the blue pill, you go back to where you were, Fantasyland, you take the red pill,
[35:34.240 --> 35:43.720]  you go down the rabbit hole and I show you how deep it goes.
[35:43.720 --> 35:51.200]  All of this is interconnected, so let me just read you some headlines right now.
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.200]  Washington Post admits Biden may not be the nominee in 2024, preparing to be replaced
[35:55.200 --> 35:58.680]  with Kamala Harris and Buttigieg.
[35:58.680 --> 36:02.320]  Poll shows Democrats want to replace Biden on the ballot in 2024.
[36:02.320 --> 36:03.320]  Hey, look at why.
[36:03.320 --> 36:06.640]  So they're getting ready to get rid of Biden.
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.040]  The way to introduce it is to talk about it in 2024, but he will not last two, three
[36:11.040 --> 36:12.040]  years.
[36:12.040 --> 36:18.120]  Here it is on the Washington Post, Harris and Buttigieg under the spotlight amid uncertainty
[36:18.120 --> 36:19.760]  over Biden's future.
[36:19.760 --> 36:27.840]  That's why we have the headline today that basically decodes this BS, stating the simple
[36:27.840 --> 36:30.840]  fact that they're now making the announcement that they're going to get rid of Biden.
[36:30.840 --> 36:33.520]  And the question is how will they do that?
[36:33.520 --> 36:37.920]  Will he just develop some quick illness like he said he would and step aside like he said
[36:37.920 --> 36:42.120]  during the campaign if he didn't do things the way the establishment wanted?
[36:42.120 --> 36:47.480]  Talk about a lap dog up there advertising himself as a vassal, advertising himself as
[36:47.480 --> 36:54.920]  a placeholder, advertising himself as somebody who's been bought and paid for.
[36:54.920 --> 36:57.920]  That's all very, very serious information.
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.640]  Now let's just look at some of these other incredible headlines.
[37:03.640 --> 37:11.320]  This Communist Treasury nominee says the Federal Reserve should control all U.S. bank accounts.
[37:11.320 --> 37:12.920]  Now why is that so important?
[37:12.920 --> 37:16.640]  It's not just that she's an admitted Marxist-Leninist and that they would dominate her.
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.720]  It's not just she says she wants to bankrupt the auto industry and the oil industry and
[37:20.720 --> 37:24.120]  have no fossil fuels by 2030.
[37:24.120 --> 37:26.160]  That's eight years away.
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.880]  It's not, no, no, no, it's that what she says is what I've been telling you like a
[37:30.880 --> 37:42.080]  broken record that they're going to end the dollar very soon and nationalize all bank
[37:42.080 --> 37:48.120]  accounts and currency and they're preparing a new global digital currency.
[37:48.120 --> 37:52.240]  It'll still have the U.S. Treasury symbol on it, but it'll be part of a global system
[37:52.240 --> 37:53.240]  on your phone.
[37:53.240 --> 37:55.320]  They're preparing everyone for the end of cash.
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.200]  They even say that, hell, I even was at the Driscoll last weekend to have breakfast with
[38:00.200 --> 38:06.320]  somebody I was meeting downtown Austin, went in there to get a croissant and a cup of coffee.
[38:06.320 --> 38:13.160]  They said, we don't take cash anymore, COVID, worldwide.
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.640]  This one article I could have talked about the whole show and it's just in the stack
[38:18.640 --> 38:22.520]  of more than 20 inflation articles.
[38:22.520 --> 38:29.400]  Now let me tell you what I really want to cover, this next article, because this article
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.760]  is more important than all the other articles I've got because it shows the spirit of these
[38:34.760 --> 38:43.080]  arrogant, disconnected monsters that are strangling the general population to death in this Malthusian
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.680]  orgy they've created.
[38:46.680 --> 38:51.680]  No one knows if Marie Antoinette at the start of the French Revolution really said when
[38:51.680 --> 38:54.880]  they came to her and said, hey, we got hundreds of thousands of people starving to death from
[38:54.880 --> 38:55.880]  all over France.
[38:55.880 --> 38:59.760]  They've come here asking you to open up the granaries and the dispensaries and out of
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.480]  the royal treasury feed them their children are starving.
[39:03.480 --> 39:09.440]  And she said reportedly, let them eat cake.
[39:09.440 --> 39:12.680]  Now a lot of evidence says that it was actually the Jacobins and others wanted to start the
[39:12.680 --> 39:17.200]  revolution then and some of her own ministers went out and said that knowing it would cause
[39:17.200 --> 39:20.760]  the overthrow because they themselves wanted to be the new royalty and they were later
[39:20.760 --> 39:27.480]  in putting Napoleon Bonaparte in as their frontman but not before they did their orgy
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.760]  of bloodletting as they always do.
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.160]  And so why is this so important?
[39:36.160 --> 39:40.000]  This article for radio listeners, I'll give you the headline because it's the attitude
[39:40.000 --> 39:47.240]  that Fauci and Saki and Bill Gates, they all have this caution the wind, we don't care,
[39:47.240 --> 39:49.040]  the public or scum statement.
[39:49.040 --> 39:56.800]  So no one knows that Marie Antoinette actually said let them eat cake, but this woman did
[39:56.800 --> 40:02.920]  and Jen Saki did Jen Saki said a month ago before she got COVID after being double jabbed
[40:02.920 --> 40:07.720]  and hasn't been seen since.
[40:07.720 --> 40:11.720]  Jen Saki, they were saying, hey, oil prices have doubled and truly hurting the average
[40:11.720 --> 40:12.720]  person.
[40:12.720 --> 40:13.720]  He said, you could pay more than that.
[40:13.720 --> 40:14.720]  It's for the earth.
[40:14.720 --> 40:17.760]  It's going to weaken lower if we wanted to, but we're not.
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.720]  That was a Marie Antoinette moment.
[40:23.720 --> 40:25.680]  This one even tops it.
[40:25.680 --> 40:26.680]  Damage control.
[40:26.680 --> 40:32.200]  I don't know how that's damage control NBC says Americans should stop complaining about
[40:32.200 --> 40:38.040]  inflation because they can easily pay more.
[40:38.040 --> 40:45.160]  Really most of the people I know are working two jobs, three jobs.
[40:45.160 --> 40:51.520]  Oh, when you're some NBC reporter that's paid a million dollars a year and you're married
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.240]  to a husband that's on Wall Street making millions a year, you can look down at everybody
[40:55.240 --> 40:58.880]  else and just laugh at them and say, oh, let them eat cake.
[40:58.880 --> 40:59.880]  You can pay more.
[40:59.880 --> 41:08.040]  What's your problem while the ruling class printed quadrillions in derivative currency
[41:08.040 --> 41:09.040]  for themselves.
[41:09.040 --> 41:13.160]  That's thousands of trillions in the last 20 years and they printed more now in the
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.400]  last year than they ever did before.
[41:16.400 --> 41:21.160]  So it's accelerated and they're giving all themselves this money, but then giving you
[41:21.160 --> 41:25.160]  the devaluation and giving you the taxes to pay it off.
[41:25.160 --> 41:33.040]  Yes, she said that inflation, Saki also said it's a good thing.
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.040]  But she does it in a nice little backhanded way.
[41:36.040 --> 41:44.160]  NBC anchor Stephanie rule said Americans should stop complaining about inflation because they're
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.640]  able to afford to pay more food and fuel to eat homes if necessary.
[41:49.640 --> 41:53.920]  We're going to come back and play that clip and a bunch of others.
[41:53.920 --> 41:57.480]  And I'll get into global shortages by design, but it gets better.
[41:57.480 --> 42:02.240]  Next hour, Jeff Bezos just came out and said there's only going to be a few million humans
[42:02.240 --> 42:04.040]  on earth soon.
[42:04.040 --> 42:10.120]  Oh, yeah, go watch the video, read the transcript, it's on infowars.com, but he's got a nice
[42:10.120 --> 42:12.440]  little way of saying it.
[42:12.440 --> 42:19.120]  He says soon earth is going to be like a preserve is the word with no people.
[42:19.120 --> 42:28.760]  Oh, oh, wow, talk about delusions of grandeur, but maybe people are so domesticated.
[42:28.760 --> 42:32.400]  People love to lay down, people love to poison their children, maybe Bezos is right.
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.280]  Maybe Bezos is the deliverer.
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.680]  He's going to kill all these useless eaters that seem to love being slaves and go along
[42:38.680 --> 42:39.680]  with the system.
[42:39.680 --> 42:43.120]  Here's a little problem from old Bezos and the rest of them, though.
[42:43.120 --> 42:48.240]  There's a certain minority of us who are shaped and color and creed who aren't going to lay

[44:07.720 --> 44:11.200]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.480]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and

[47:26.960 --> 47:31.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[47:31.960 --> 47:37.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:37.960 --> 47:44.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[47:44.680 --> 47:50.160]  Now, tell you what, I'm going to get to Biden's Communist Treasury nominee, says the Federal
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.080]  Reserve should control all U.S. bank deposits and track all purchases in live time.
[47:55.080 --> 47:58.920]  That's the official policy, it's not just her saying that, that's what they want.
[47:58.920 --> 48:03.640]  And damage control, NBC says Americans should stop complaining about inflation because they
[48:03.640 --> 48:10.800]  can easily pay more, and how that ties into Amazon's Jeff Bezos predicts only limited
[48:10.800 --> 48:14.200]  number of people will be on Earth soon.
[48:14.200 --> 48:15.200]  That's right.
[48:15.200 --> 48:16.720]  Wait till you hear about that.
[48:16.720 --> 48:21.760]  That's coming up next hour, and then I've got this whole stack of news right here.
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.560]  See this little tweet by Joe Flynn, General Flynn's brother.
[48:27.560 --> 48:33.000]  I had an extremely important two-hour interview, an hour plus with General Flynn, and then
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.760]  a roundtable discussion with General Flynn, Patrick Berg and Joe Flynn, and the crew
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.440]  I had with me, don't just sit there and tell me, great job, that sounded great, that was
[48:43.440 --> 48:44.440]  good.
[48:44.440 --> 48:47.400]  I don't have people around me like that, I don't have people to tell me the truth.
[48:47.400 --> 48:51.280]  And they said, that was your best interview ever, that is so powerful.
[48:51.280 --> 48:57.800]  They feel like we were just basically in on the people in 1776 meeting at the Green Dragon
[48:57.800 --> 48:58.880]  Pub.
[48:58.880 --> 49:05.400]  I mean, it was historic, and we're going to air it Tuesday.
[49:05.400 --> 49:10.600]  It should be done Tuesday, it was a three-camera shoot, it takes time to put it together, we're
[49:10.600 --> 49:14.760]  going to add some documentation of what we talk about, and I've been talking about getting
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.680]  Flynn to Texas a lot, I dropped the ball, and then they reminded me they were in Texas,
[49:20.680 --> 49:25.640]  and so I drove down there, they talked to me Friday and I drove down there Saturday, and
[49:25.640 --> 49:31.280]  just an amazing 5,000 people there, the Cornerstone Church to hear General Flynn speak, it was
[49:31.280 --> 49:37.480]  amazing, I spoke as well along with a lot of other great patriots, and it was amazing.
[49:37.480 --> 49:44.720]  That's coming up Tuesday, it will be posted to Band-Aid Video, and if you want to save
[49:44.720 --> 49:52.280]  the country, if you want to stop the globalist worldwide, he lays out the battle plan, and
[49:52.280 --> 49:58.960]  again, we were synced up, we were, we were simpatico, and now I see Robert Kennedy Jr.
[49:58.960 --> 50:02.960]  saying the exact same things, and Tucker Carlson, and it's not because we're all like getting
[50:02.960 --> 50:07.680]  some orders from headquarters, we know what we're looking at, we understand what's happening,
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.880]  and we're explaining to people this is a designed, controlled collapse in the day both groups
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.840]  own words, and they're really doing it, and so it's crazy, they're so arrogant, they're
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.520]  like over here talking about we've captured the U.S. government, we've captured other
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.120]  governments, we're going to make everybody poor to control them, we're going to save
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.680]  the earth by sterilizing everybody, the U.N. talks about sterilant vaccines, and they're
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.800]  doing it to everyone now, I mean they're really doing it, and you can see their argument too
[50:34.800 --> 50:38.720]  of well, there aren't too many people you could say, and they're the rich elites, and
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.040]  they want to clean things off and have the earth, you know, be like the movie Zardahs,
[50:43.040 --> 50:53.480]  a giant park, you haven't seen Zardahs came out in the 70s with Tron Connery, it's really
[50:53.480 --> 50:59.800]  what they want to do, or Moonraker is another example, I mean this is, this is their real
[50:59.800 --> 51:08.280]  plan, and so I don't want to die, I don't want my children to die, I'm not going to join
[51:08.280 --> 51:13.320]  the globalist just so I get left alone, I'm not stupid, I don't want to get this technocracy
[51:13.320 --> 51:17.600]  in place, they're not going to leave the people around that help them do this, they plan on
[51:17.600 --> 51:21.160]  killing almost everybody, and you get deeper in their literature, they say that, they say
[51:21.160 --> 51:24.920]  over here with all humans, we're going to merge the machines and be God, and you know
[51:24.920 --> 51:28.840]  there won't be allowed to be more than one God on earth, so we'll have a discussion
[51:28.840 --> 51:32.920]  amongst the new gods, and a lot of them will have to blast off to other, you know, other
[51:32.920 --> 51:38.560]  areas of space or other dimensions, because I mean this is not good, this is delusional,
[51:38.560 --> 51:46.320]  megalomania, crazy town, and that's why Elon Musk warned three years ago, beware of those
[51:46.320 --> 51:53.360]  that worship and plan on being AI gods, because Kershle says he's going to be one, so let
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.960]  me hit you with the heavy COVID news right now, because it's so important, and we'll
[51:57.960 --> 52:03.080]  come back and get into big picture, but German state health ministers called to extend state
[52:03.080 --> 52:08.080]  of emergency as COVID cases soar, even though they're massively inoculated and have had
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.800]  lockdowns for almost two years, see that right there, that's the tyranny, that's the permanent
[52:13.800 --> 52:18.520]  martial law, anti-vaxxers and politicians push Germany to the brink, oh really, that
[52:18.520 --> 52:22.920]  why it's the vaccinated that are the most ill and sick, oh you didn't submit enough,
[52:22.920 --> 52:29.280]  it's your fault, says Der Spiegel, shock, CDC admits it has no record of unvaccinated
[52:29.280 --> 52:33.760]  person spreading COVID post-recovery, very important article with a link to the CDC's
[52:33.760 --> 52:38.960]  own admissions on infowars.com, so no person that's ever had it naturally and gotten better
[52:38.960 --> 52:42.840]  has spread COVID, but people that take the vaccine can because it's not a vaccine, in
[52:42.840 --> 52:49.040]  fact, so think of how they've spin golly this and gas lit this, and here's the big one,
[52:49.040 --> 52:54.920]  look this up for yourself, vaccinated Vermont, 75% of September COVID deaths were the jabbed
[52:54.920 --> 53:00.360]  Kelly McBreen, a link to the Vermont Daily Chronicle, their biggest newspaper, they're
[53:00.360 --> 53:05.960]  like, oh that's infowars, don't listen to them, oh go read it, Vermont health department spokesman
[53:05.960 --> 53:10.720]  Tom Truman told the Vermont Daily Chronicle last week that of all the COVID-19 deaths
[53:10.720 --> 53:17.360]  in the state for the month of September, eight of the 33 deaths were not vaccinated,
[53:17.360 --> 53:21.800]  and what are we doing for something that killed 33 people locking everything down, even if
[53:21.800 --> 53:23.880]  it was COVID in every case?
[53:23.880 --> 53:27.160]  Here's another one, Vermont has the highest vaccination rate in the country, so why are
[53:27.160 --> 53:34.040]  cases surging, ABC News, they're not just surging, they're number one in America for
[53:34.040 --> 53:40.680]  COVID deaths, everything, and when you're 90% vaccinated and 75% of the people dying
[53:40.680 --> 53:46.080]  are the vaccinated, what's that tell ya, what the British lands had to admit a month ago,
[53:46.080 --> 53:50.760]  they're more likely to die of COVID if you've had the shot, I mean, folks, you're like well
[53:50.760 --> 53:53.600]  how are they gonna get away with this, they're not, they're not, well they're gonna release
[53:53.600 --> 53:57.520]  a new bio-weapon which Gates says is coming any minute, so you'll forget about the last
[53:57.520 --> 54:02.160]  one, how do you cover up one story, when you're in bed with the Russians and you're in bed
[54:02.160 --> 54:06.480]  with the Chycoms, you create Russia, gate and blame your opposition, when you're already
[54:06.480 --> 54:10.360]  in trouble launching one bio-attack and one rollout, you just launch a bigger one next
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.920]  and change the subject, I mean they're bringing in worldwide depression, worldwide collapse,
[54:15.920 --> 54:21.480]  you understand, this is their move, get ready, why COVID cases are surging in states with
[54:21.480 --> 54:25.320]  high vaccination rates and what it means for the winter ahead, oh it's the states with
[54:25.320 --> 54:32.320]  the high rates, gee says Yahoo News, we don't know why, all over the world, we've got so
[54:32.320 --> 54:35.200]  much more I'm gonna hit on the subject, but I'm gonna play these clips now before I get
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.960]  to the big COVID news I haven't hit yet, where the military in places like Oklahoma, the
[54:40.960 --> 54:45.000]  head of the National Guard there, saying we're not gonna take the shot, and now federal
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.480]  appeals court reaffirmed the full court and said no, this is tyranny, this is a power
[54:49.480 --> 54:56.320]  grab by Biden, you're not doing it, that all happened over the weekend, but what's the
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.280]  big takeaway, last week I played a clip of Gates from last week where he said, oh this
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.600]  shot doesn't stop transmission, we need a new vaccine that stops it, oh the first five,
[55:05.600 --> 55:13.400]  six shots and boosters didn't work, so now you need another one, and then now Fauci has
[55:13.400 --> 55:19.280]  come out and said it doesn't work, so just like that suddenly, oh it does work, it makes
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.120]  you get sick and you die of COVID symptoms, because the shot, I've had medical doctors
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.280]  on the talk about this, top scientists, but McCullough and others, in studio, the shot
[55:28.280 --> 55:33.000]  makes you get the same spike protein just six, seven, eight, nine times worse in the
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.920]  studies, so yeah COVID's dangerous, the shots way more dangerous, that's a fact, so here's
[55:38.920 --> 55:43.960]  first Gates and then here is the new clip of Fauci admitting it's all a fraud to giant
[55:43.960 --> 55:52.120]  hoax, wow here it is.
[55:52.120 --> 55:56.000]  And so I'm hoping in five years I can write a book called, you know we are ready for the
[55:56.000 --> 56:03.280]  next pandemic, but it'll take tens of billions in R&D, that the U.S. and the U.K. will be
[56:03.280 --> 56:10.440]  part of that, it'll take probably about a billion a year for a pandemic task force at
[56:10.440 --> 56:15.320]  the WHO level, which is doing the surveillance and actually doing what I call germ games,
[56:15.320 --> 56:22.040]  where you practice, you say okay what if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports,
[56:22.040 --> 56:28.040]  you know, how would the world respond to that, you know that there's nothing to really cause
[56:28.040 --> 56:34.000]  epidemics and bioterrorism to cause epidemics that could even be way worse than what we
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.200]  experienced today, and yet the advances in medical science should give us tools that
[56:40.200 --> 56:42.840]  you know we could do dramatically better.
[56:42.840 --> 56:49.960]  So you'd think this would be a priority, the next year will be where those allocations
[56:49.960 --> 56:56.360]  have to get made including this global pandemic task force.
[56:56.360 --> 56:58.600]  Point number three, we are seeing something.
[56:58.600 --> 57:04.120]  Yeah, we had a little problem folks, I apologize, that's not the clip I wanted, so we're going
[57:04.120 --> 57:08.640]  to find the right clip and we're going to play it next hour, you can better well damn
[57:08.640 --> 57:11.000]  believe it.
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.600]  So the clip is where Gates says that we don't have vaccines that really work, they didn't
[57:17.600 --> 57:20.360]  really work, we're going to have to get them that work, and then I do have the Fauci clip
[57:20.360 --> 57:24.160]  as well, we've had some technical problems today, we're going to work on that, and we're
[57:24.160 --> 57:28.320]  going to come back in the second hour and knock it out of the park as best we can.
[57:28.320 --> 57:34.240]  infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today, I'm Alex Jones, this is the real takeover,
[57:34.240 --> 57:38.720]  this is the real deal, and again we'll archive this at mandonmedionpost and fix that for
[57:38.720 --> 57:48.960]  you and get those actual clips in there, thank you.

[59:51.160 --> 1:00:21.000]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:43.360]  It is a creature which roams the earth alone, it is half man, half bear, and half pig.
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:48.000]  Al Gore has a new man bear pig to unleash upon planet earth.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:54.400]  Some people say that man bear pig isn't real, well I'm here to tell you now, man bear pig
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:58.280]  is very real, and he most certainly exists.
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:04.400]  The same United Nations tool who predicted at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:10.680]  Conference in Copenhagen that the world would have been under water by 2016.
[1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:22.080]  Some of the models suggest to Dr. Mazlowski that there is a 75% chance that the entire
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:30.720]  North Polar Ice Cap during some of the summer months could be completely ice free within
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.640]  the next five to seven years.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:38.000]  Al Gore now has a solution to fight climate change that is just as pigheaded and doomed
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  to fail as his inconvenient truth.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:58.400]  From the domain of private jets and superyachts gathering from the recent United Nations Climate
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:03.800]  Change Conference, Al Gore touted his latest solution to curb carbon emissions, utilizing
[1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:08.600]  mass surveillance via satellite sensors and artificial intelligence.
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:14.800]  We are entering an era of radical transparency.
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:24.440]  We are now seeing more and more satellites and ground, sea, and air based sensors, internet
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:32.480]  data streams, crowdsourced information gathering, and Climate Trace, an organization that I have
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:41.480]  helped co-found, is now using artificial intelligence to fuse together all of these data streams
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:48.800]  to develop extremely accurate and precise algorithms that can affix responsibility for
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.480]  every significant greenhouse gas source of emissions on our planet.
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:01.560]  We have access to a complete picture of the entire Earth's surface every day, and soon
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:07.840]  we will have a complete picture of every square centimeter of the Earth's surface every
[1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:09.560]  six hours.
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:16.200]  And we are compiling a comprehensive list of those who are responsible for each of the
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:22.840]  entities that are emitting greenhouse gases, not to be the climate police, but to be the
[1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:29.760]  neighborhood watch, except the neighborhood is the globe, and we are all in this together.
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:36.440]  The Lancet Commission has now told us that we could, if we do not act, expect to see
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:41.640]  one billion climate refugees migrating across borders.
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:49.880]  We cannot allow this wave of authoritarian populism to spread around our world.
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:56.360]  This sustainability revolution has the magnitude of the industrial revolution and the speed
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:58.480]  of the digital revolution.
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:02.640]  But per usual, the man bear pig hunter didn't think this went out.
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:08.560]  As Zero Hedge points out, what Gore and his 300 satellites will find is that it is the
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:13.760]  elite super-rich luxury class who are the world's largest polluters.
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:19.480]  New research by the Institute for European Environmental Policy and the Stockholm Environment
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:26.920]  Institute has found that by 2030, the carbon footprints of the wealthiest 1% of humanity
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:33.640]  are on track to be 30 times larger than the size compatible with limiting global warming
[1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:37.560]  by one and a half degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:41.280]  The Paris Agreement's more ambitious temperature target.
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:43.680]  The report notes that should current trend...
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:45.640]  This is a really powerful report.
[1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:46.640]  You need to share it.
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:49.840]  It gets to the conclusion that most of the energy is actually being used by the people
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:51.600]  trying to cut off the portals.
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.160]  The rich people use more than all the poor people combined, who they're trying to kill,
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:05:00.000]  by the way.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:05.880]  Brainforce Plus is back in stock, and it's 50% off with free shipping and double-patria

[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:11.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:14.640]  front lines of the Info War.
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:23.240]  Okay, if you just joined us, last hour, I showed you a letter from the CDC in an article
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:28.200]  where you can find it, where they say no one who has had COVID has ever then had COVID
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:30.480]  again and passed it on to other people.
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:32.040]  That's natural immunity.
[1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:37.400]  But that the vaccine, people are more likely to die if you've had the vaccine.
[1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:41.360]  That's what the numbers show in Israel, what they show in the UK, what they show in Vermont,
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:45.360]  and I showed you mainstream news out of Vermont with those numbers.
[1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:47.920]  Same thing in Australia.
[1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:49.080]  Hospitals are now full.
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:50.080]  They weren't full a year ago.
[1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:52.200]  That was made up and exaggerated.
[1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:57.440]  They're full of people with blood clots and heart attacks and all sorts of serious auto-immune
[1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:05.560]  problems and things that are akin to ADE, Germany, super high level inoculation, massive
[1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:09.480]  surge in COVID hospitalizations, and they're blaming the unvaccinated.
[1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:13.000]  I thought you're protected when you take the shot.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:19.680]  So, on top of all this, last week, Bill Gates comes out and everybody instead focused on
[1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:23.000]  the smallpox clip where he says, oh, the terrorists are about to hit you with a smallpox.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.400]  Better give them all your rights up.
[1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:26.680]  Better give them the UN control of health worldwide.
[1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:28.680]  Better have a vaccine passport.
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:29.760]  It's coming.
[1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:33.560]  But buried in there, he talked about, well, this COVID vaccine, which isn't a vaccine,
[1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.560]  doesn't really protect you.
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:41.880]  And so, we're going to need to then, you know, have a new vaccine that actually does block
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:42.880]  you getting it.
[1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:44.840]  You see, this vaccine doesn't stop you getting it.
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:47.240]  It just makes it not as bad, which isn't even true.
[1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:48.240]  It makes it worse.
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:52.440]  It's the same thing as getting COVID, just worse, according to all these scientists I've
[1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:56.120]  had on and all the literature and all the proof that they predicted what happened has
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:07:57.120]  now happened.
[1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:58.120]  Think about that.
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:03.760]  And so, back to back, here is the clip I was talking about earlier of Gates admitting
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:06.280]  this last week, this got no coverage.
[1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:08.120]  The smallpox statement got all the coverage.
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:13.280]  And then right after that, Fauci followed him up on a podcast and now is letting it slip
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:14.280]  in there.
[1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:16.160]  Oh, yeah, we did do gain a function.
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:17.160]  Okay.
[1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:21.440]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:23.840]  This vaccine doesn't work.
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:26.960]  So here they are back to back.
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:33.640]  Quick damage, the deaths, it's been completely horrific.
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:42.800]  And I would expect that will lead the R&D budgets to be focused on things we didn't have today.
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.960]  We didn't have vaccines that block transmission.
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:50.640]  We got vaccines that help you with your health, but they only slightly reduce the transmissions.
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:55.080]  We need a new way of doing the vaccine.
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:09:00.440]  And number three, we are seeing something that is really interesting and I'd like to
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:05.280]  get a little bit more unpacking of it with you in a bit.
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:14.200]  And that is we're starting to see waning immunity against infection and waning immunity
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:18.280]  in the beginning aspect against hospitalization.
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:25.040]  And if you look at Israel, which has always been a month to a month and a half ahead of
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:32.200]  us in the dynamics of the outbreak, in their vaccine response, and in every other element
[1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:39.720]  of the outbreak, they are seeing a waning of immunity, not only against infection, but
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:46.720]  against hospitalizations and to some extent death, which is starting to now involve all
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:47.720]  age groups.
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:50.360]  It isn't just the elderly.
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:58.760]  So if one looks back at this, one can say, do you know it isn't as if a booster is a
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:05.720]  bonus, but a booster might actually be an essential part of the primary regimen that
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:09.200]  people should have.
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:12.840]  So what's happening here is he doesn't get in trouble and go to prison for cooking it
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:16.840]  up at Wuhan and releasing it and then sent everybody to suppress the truth to what he
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:20.240]  did and then all the hundreds of billions of dollars that these groups are all making
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:21.560]  in the power grab they're having.
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:22.560]  No, no, no, no.
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:25.920]  He doesn't get discredited for saying, oh, 96% effective.
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:26.920]  Just take one shot.
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:27.920]  Oh, just take two.
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:28.920]  Just take three.
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:30.880]  Israel's up to their fifth and sixth.
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:32.760]  Europe's up to their third, fourth.
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:36.840]  No, he gets more power and more control.
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:39.760]  Hey, guess what?
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:43.960]  I was trying to get Tim Poole on the show tonight because he's here in Austin and he's
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:44.960]  going to come on later in the week.
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:49.560]  I said, since you're here and staying pretty close to the office, I said, why don't you
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.600]  come on the Sunday show?
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:56.080]  And he said, no, no, we're, you know, I'm just out having some fun business stuff in
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:57.080]  town.
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:58.080]  I said, that's fine.
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  You deserve a day off.
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:00.080]  He's a hardworking guy.
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:06.960]  And then boom, turns out that he was listening to the show nearby and called me and said,
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:07.960]  you know what?
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  I do want to come on and I said, wow, how'd I hook you?
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:18.240]  And he said, well, the whole statements that have come out by Jeff Bezos and what Jeff
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:24.280]  Bezos had to say about how there's not going to be any humans, very many humans on the
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.560]  earth anymore.
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:27.880]  So that is coming up.
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:34.600]  And by the way, guys, print me a couple copies of that so that I can give Tim a copy of that
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  when he, when he comes in here.
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:39.040]  But that's a big, big deal.
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:49.040]  And we'll also talk with Tim Pool here in studio about the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:52.400]  coming out and not just doing an emergency stay a week ago.
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:57.080]  But Biden just said, hey, ignore the court, just keep forcing shots.
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:59.520]  And so now the full court said, no, you're slapped down.
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:00.760]  This is completely out of control.
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:03.320]  And now I guess it's going to go to the Supreme Court.
[1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:04.320]  That's a big deal.
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.280]  And now courage is contagious.
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:11.160]  Now the head of the National Guard, Oklahoma says, we're not giving the poison death shot
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:12.160]  to the troops.
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:14.280]  They didn't use that term, but they said the experimental shot.
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:17.280]  So the truth is starting to get out there.
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:18.560]  It is a big, big deal.
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.400]  We're extremely excited about that.
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:23.000]  But yes, Tim Pool is in town.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.400]  Great journalist, great reporter, great podcaster and one of the top podcasters out there now.
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:31.120]  It's been very popular for many years, but he's definitely moving up the charts towards
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:32.120]  the top.
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:33.120]  And he's going to be on Joe Rogan.
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:34.400]  I'm told us they're taping Monday.
[1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:36.200]  They'll probably be out Monday or Tuesday.
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:37.480]  They'll be with us a few days later.
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:39.160]  We haven't set the time for that yet.
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:44.080]  And Mike Cernovich, I already had it set up weeks ago for him to fly in and see us.
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:45.280]  So those planets have aligned.
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:47.200]  So he's going to be on with Tim as well.
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:50.360]  And we're going to have him in studio with us, probably all of them together.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:54.040]  And also the great Michael Malus and a bunch of other people.
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:57.720]  Luke Radowski, my old buddy, he's going to be here as well, I'm told.
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.320]  So this is going to be incredible.
[1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:03.320]  And then I did the big interview with Flynn, but it was a not a three camera shoot.
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.160]  I was corrected a four camera shoot.
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:08.880]  So that takes some time to add it together and add documents to and things like we like
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:09.880]  to do.
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:16.600]  So Tuesday, we'll have the Flynn interview that just this interview alone gives me butterflies.
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:18.320]  And I don't get butterflies very often.
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:22.840]  Even when I'm on the biggest shows in the world, going shows like The View, it's not
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:26.240]  very big now, but I was on it 16 years ago when it had like 10 million viewers.
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.240]  No butterflies.
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:31.000]  Joe Rogan the first two times didn't get butterflies, did the last time because I knew I was under
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.400]  the gun with the media.
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:37.800]  But I've got butterflies about the general Flynn situation.
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:38.960]  This is powerful.
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:44.520]  This interview, I don't know what to properly name it because it's the blueprint for victory
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.440]  over tyranny.
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:49.720]  And it's it's extremely important.
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:52.400]  And he just explains America's under globalist attack.
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:53.400]  It's the new world order.
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:54.400]  Here they are.
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:55.400]  Here's how to stop them.
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:59.680]  Americans have to come together regardless of race, color, creed, liberal or conservative
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:03.440]  and understand that you are about to literally lose your standard of living and everything
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:07.480]  you've got and all your basic freedoms if you don't just say, we know you're bad, we
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:12.640]  know you're globalist, we know you're a multinational corporate takeover and we do not comply.
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:16.600]  It's just like Tim Poole said last hour and I played that viral clip where he said, do
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:20.320]  you understand once the sex imbalances are gone, they're going to come in and knock your
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:21.400]  frickin teeth out.
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:27.200]  This is a criminal takeover that does not respect any of the social contract basically
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:28.720]  is what he said.
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:29.720]  And we're screwed.
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:33.760]  I mean, again, it's like being at 35,000 feet and open in the door of the airplane.
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:36.960]  If you don't have oxygen, you're dead or it's like set yourself on fire.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.160]  It's not a good idea.
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.200]  We're not going down the road of tyranny now.
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:44.120]  We are hurtling down it at a thousand miles an hour.
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:47.040]  Okay, so we're going to talk about all of that.
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:51.080]  And yes, Jeff Bezos said, soon the earth will just be parkland.
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:54.920]  Soon the earth will just be this big open space won't have very many people on it.
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:15:00.920]  So what is he talking about and where are we going with all of that today?
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:04.920]  It's going to be coming up on the other side and I'm desperately looking for that article
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:05.920]  actually had it here.
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:10.400]  So I hope you guys are printing me a couple of copies of that because I'm a little OCD
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:14.000]  about my papers and stuff and all the rest of it.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.400]  So it's it's an info wars article those the one I want, please.
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:23.040]  So again, that's up on info wars.com and we're going to get that article and we're going
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:25.640]  to be covering it all here on air.
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:30.720]  Meanwhile, the moon has enough oxygen for eight billion people that that ties into all
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:31.720]  of this.
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:35.160]  So we'll see how fast we can get to get the microphone on the chair and everything kind
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:36.440]  of set up for a guest.
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:38.760]  We know this was going to happen, but I'm very glad it's happening.
[1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:44.040]  We got 10 pools straight ahead and then coming up for two hours live after that is only six
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:45.040]  minutes ads an hour.
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:52.080]  By the way, on this show, Sunday lives coming up with Owen Schreuer in T minus 45 minutes.
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:57.360]  Stay with us.
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:58.360]  I'm cutting this.
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:05.160]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going
[1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:07.880]  to cost flooding, that's not a prediction.
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:08.880]  You know, it's a hurricane.
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:09.880]  You know, it's got a lot of water.
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:10.880]  It's going to die up.
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:11.880]  It's going to cost flooding.
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:16.480]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the UN order to lock down the world
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:20.120]  economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:23.280]  for years and it's going to starve tens of millions to death.
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:27.840]  And now it all happened 25 million extra dead hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:30.520]  and the UN that ordered it's running around being the savior.
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:34.560]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies and now the first world's
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:35.640]  becoming the third world.
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:39.280]  So listen to me now, we've got the highest quality storeable foods, the lowest price

[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:51.120]  So protect yourself, get high quality storeable food.

[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:32.840]  Well, Tim Poole of Tim Cast, ladies and gentlemen, is here in studio with us, a surprised guest
[1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:33.840]  this evening.
[1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:35.160]  A lot of folks are coming through awesome this week.
[1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:36.160]  It's great to have you.
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:40.040]  I really appreciate the great show you do and I guess you're libertarian, pro-freedom,
[1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:45.440]  pro-first amendment operations and how you've defended me when I've been censored up front
[1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:46.520]  when almost no one else would.
[1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:49.080]  So thank you so much, Tim, and congratulations on all your success.
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:50.080]  I mean, you've been successful.
[1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:54.080]  I've known about you for over a decade, but you're really top of the charts now.
[1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:55.080]  So congratulations.
[1:20:55.080 --> 1:20:56.080]  Thanks.
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:57.080]  Appreciate it, man.
[1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:58.080]  Thanks for having me.
[1:20:58.080 --> 1:21:01.160]  Well, it is great to have Tim Poole here in studio with us.
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:05.360]  Again, Tim, you got pretty excited earlier hearing about this Jeff Bezos story.
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:08.840]  Yeah, but I do want to say one thing before we talk about this because I heard you mentioning
[1:21:08.840 --> 1:21:11.000]  how I called you up and everything.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:15.720]  Well, actually, I was mini golfing on this fine Sunday with my girlfriend, relaxing.
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:19.880]  And you know, guys, tonight we had a skeleton crew.
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:20.880]  This never happens.
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:27.320]  And we just had a lot of technical problems is his mic working because it is working.
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.320]  Can you hear it?
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:29.320]  It is working.
[1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:31.320]  I don't hear him in my ear, but that's fine.
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:32.320]  Start over, brother.
[1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:33.320]  Go ahead.
[1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:34.320]  So it's Sunday and I'm chilling.
[1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.560]  I know you were like, hey, would you come on the Sunday show?
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.240]  And I'm like, look, it's Sunday.
[1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:39.040]  Very rarely get any time to do anything.
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.160]  And I was mini golfing with my girlfriend.
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:44.480]  But then I knew you were doing the show and I was like, I really do want to see, you know,
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:45.720]  the show being done.
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:47.960]  And then, you know, I came over and then I'm like, let's just do it.
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:48.960]  Let's just do it.
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:49.960]  And so, so I ended up coming up.
[1:21:49.960 --> 1:21:53.200]  We were here and it was, you know, we sometimes we have a few hiccups, we just rushed some
[1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:54.200]  money in.
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:56.120]  That's what's great about the way you do it with podcasting.
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:59.120]  It's a lot easier to do stuff than this big, giant, fancy studio.
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:02.840]  I may just get rid of all this and just don't go kind of simple like you guys are doing.
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:03.840]  I'm saying the opposite.
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:09.480]  I'm like, man, wow, we're down here in Austin doing a variety of shows as a bunch of there's
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:13.880]  a ton of people down in Austin who are good, you know, commentators and the like that we
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:15.320]  want to have on the show.
[1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:19.120]  So I remember when I had, when I had you on my show the first time, you asked me to
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:22.920]  come on and I had this reaction and I was like, I don't know.
[1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:25.680]  People were saying it was because I wouldn't go on your show because it's you or something.
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:29.200]  The reality is we couldn't travel, but we built an RV.
[1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:33.680]  We got an RV and then our CTO was able to put together a mobile recording studio.
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:35.620]  So now I can come to Austin.
[1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:36.620]  We're going to do trips.
[1:22:36.620 --> 1:22:39.080]  We're going to go like we needed to find a way to actually travel and do more than just
[1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:40.080]  one place.
[1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:44.160]  But I'm looking at what we got and it's like we got these little handicams mounted to
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:47.760]  the wall and you got this massive operation and I'm saying the opposite.
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:51.160]  I'm like, man, I got to build a studio.
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:52.160]  This Bezos thing.
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:53.600]  It's up on infoworks.com.
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:59.000]  Amazon's Bezos predicts only limited number of people will get to remain on earth.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.760]  It's going to be a park only for the elites, basically, and then we're all going to have
[1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:03.760]  to live in space.
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:07.120]  I mean, any way you slice it, this just gets more and more authoritarian.
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:11.400]  So I was listening and you know, I'm hanging out with my girlfriend and I was like, I disagree
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:12.400]  with him on that one.
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:13.400]  Because I'll look at this quote.
[1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:17.120]  It says, millions of people will move from earth to space over time.
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:19.840]  And that's the vision of blue origin, millions of people working in space.
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:25.400]  So my question is, when you say it sounds like this nefarious plot to like evict people
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:28.920]  from earth, but I'm wondering if what he's really saying is that people will choose to
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:31.080]  leave and eventually no one wants to be here.
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:33.280]  So it'll just be like a historical monument or something.
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:37.320]  If you read the full transcript and actually watch what he said, he says to protect the
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:38.320]  earth.
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:39.320]  It's beautiful.
[1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:40.840]  Not everyone just gets to be here.
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:44.240]  We're not going to just let people mess it up.
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:45.920]  He's saying he's going to make you go to space.
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:48.440]  And then if you know everything else, the globalists are doing, it's already in that
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:49.440]  whole direction.
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:50.440]  But you're right.
[1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:53.520]  If you read that solely on your own and didn't know the background of them, you would, you
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:55.760]  know, not understand that it's basically the great reset.
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:57.000]  No, I agree with you.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:02.240]  I'm just playing, you know, no, it's good because I can't get mainline liberals on just
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:04.920]  like you can't get them on your show when I'm there.
[1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:08.640]  And I wouldn't call you a liberal, just kind of a classic American pro freedom guy.
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:10.880]  You've tried to get liberals on.
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:12.720]  So I like people challenging me.
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:18.160]  It's crazy to have any conversation with someone about like my political positioning and it's
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:24.760]  crazy that if you are for the truth, if you are just Russiagate, complete and utter garbage.
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:28.880]  And if you from the beginning said it was, and I didn't, you're right wing.
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:32.520]  And then eventually when I came around, now I'm right wing, initially, even, even the
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:35.800]  way I was treated by Google was as a left wing commentator.
[1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:38.920]  When I would read the news about Russiagate, I'd say, Oh, the New York Times is saying
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:40.520]  this is really interesting.
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:42.080]  Let's let's give the investigation a chance.
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  Now that it's all bunk and we know it's bunk and I say it's bunk and here's the evidence.
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:46.640]  Now they're like, that's right wing.
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:48.320]  Kyle Rittenhouse is a really good example.
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:50.840]  From the beginning, I had witnesses on my show.
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:56.000]  We we had five different witnesses, journalists with video footage giving us their account.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.880]  And I said, self defense.
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.920]  But the narrative from the left was always that a white supremacist traveled across
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:06.480]  state lines with a gun simply by being for the truth, your right wing or something.
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:11.120]  So when it comes to like actual politics, I'm probably left libertarian, but there's
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:14.480]  a big difference between the mainstream progressive left libertarians.
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:15.480]  They're really far off.
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:19.240]  I'm at the far left, but they also just don't believe in the truth.
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:20.240]  That's it.
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:21.240]  And they play dirty games.
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  They don't have integrity.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:26.080]  The Green New Deal, you know, when the Green New Deal comes out, I was actually excited
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:30.000]  like, Hey, look, a government infrastructure project to make energy independence in America
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.360]  and develop new technologies.
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:32.720]  We're working on fusion.
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:33.880]  Nuclear energy is great.
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:35.560]  And then what was the Green New Deal?
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:38.760]  Social equity, social justice, free college, free health care.
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.040]  And when mills that don't really are.
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:43.040]  It's just lying.
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  It's just lying.
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:47.640]  So I can sit here and be like, I believe in decentralized networks.
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:52.080]  I believe, you know, we're working on building, we have a nonprofit where we've started recently
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:54.360]  where we're building technology to give away for free.
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.240]  It's a very like left libertarian perspective.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:01.120]  But we'll all like me, Ian, the rest of the crew will be called right wing simply for
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.240]  telling the truth.
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:05.360]  Absolutely.
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:09.520]  Where do you see not just America, but the world going because you had a, they called
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:10.520]  it a ramp.
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:15.280]  It really wasn't on your show just a few days ago where now it's coming out the New York
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:16.280]  Times.
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:18.840]  Not only are they rating journalists now and going after their sources, which is totally
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:24.720]  legal and dangerous, but now they're actually leaking the information to the press.
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:30.160]  So I would say a reasonable person would conclude if Project Veritas, James O'Keefe
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:34.400]  and his staff, his journalists get rated by the FBI and within like an hour, I think
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:37.320]  the New York Times was calling them saying what happened.
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:41.720]  There is either a snitch or at that point you could be like someone in the FBI tipped
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:45.160]  off that the New York Times seems to be more likely considering the speed.
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:49.400]  Then we get Project Veritas' devices seized from James O'Keefe himself.
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:51.040]  They're going through his devices.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:54.200]  We know they are because a court ruled they had to stop.
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:56.400]  Then those documents get leaked to the New York Times.
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:01.400]  So I try to be careful when I, when I had this rant, we're in the middle of the show and
[1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:05.160]  you know, Luke's on the show and he says, Hey, we're getting word that the FBI is leaking
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:09.080]  Project Veritas' privileged legal communications to the New York Times.
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:13.640]  And so I pull up the tweets from trusted sources and right off the bat, I just, I, I assumed
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:14.800]  it was definitive.
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:18.320]  And so I'll be a little bit more careful and say it appears to be by beyond a reasonable
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:20.200]  dot the FBI did this.
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:21.480]  I just snapped.
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:26.880]  When you have the federal government rating a news organization, a journalistic enterprise,
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:31.920]  a non-profit no less, and then giving privileged communications to a company that they're
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:32.920]  suing.
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:34.600]  They're in a lawsuit.
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:36.920]  You go to anybody who knows history and what do they say?
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:38.080]  It's Soviet style.
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:39.400]  It's Stasi style.
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:41.720]  This is, this is, we're getting in this dangerous place.
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:44.480]  So I went off on that and it's really funny to see the reaction.
[1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:46.920]  There's people on the right who are like Tim Pool nailed it.
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:50.400]  I mean, I was, I was smack talking law enforcement and police saying the police will come to
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:53.600]  your house when they, when they're given the word and they will bash your teeth and, and
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:55.640]  then you know what the left did.
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:58.680]  They cut out the part where I said the police.
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:02.040]  So all you hear me say is they, they, and they're trying to make it seem like it was
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:04.160]  an anti-Semitic rant or something.
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:05.160]  Unbelievable.
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:07.120]  But I mean, that's the level of deception here.
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:09.200]  The left has just embraced the police state.
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:12.000]  I've never been anti-cop, but I'm anti-police state.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.160]  Now they're anti-police, but pro-police state.
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:15.160]  Right.
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:16.160]  It's amazing.
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:17.160]  That's a good way to put it.
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:21.160]  I've, I've always like called out police brutality.
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:22.800]  I try to make sure we get the facts right.
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:25.320]  If I see a story and I'm like, I don't know what that cop did.
[1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:26.440]  I'm not going to condemn him.
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.800]  But when you get a story like out of, uh, I think it was North Carolina where the cop
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:33.320]  shot the black man in the back as he was running away.
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:35.440]  Like we know what that was.
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:37.920]  So I don't know if there's music playing, is there something going on here?
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:38.920]  We're going to go to break.
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:39.920]  Absolutely.
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:40.920]  Everything's awesome.
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:41.920]  Yeah.
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.120]  This is, uh, this is all, this is all, you know, this is a talk radio format.
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:47.120]  So we got to have the breaks.
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:48.120]  That's why we're still on air.
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:49.520]  They tried to de-platform us.
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:51.960]  We still had hundreds of radio stations while we're still on air.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:54.200]  But yes, this is good old fashioned talk radio on TV.
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:56.200]  We'll be right back with Tim Pool.
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:57.200]  I'm De-
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:01.000]  This is a great sponsor.

[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:01.360]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in info war's live products.
[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:05.000]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:08.480]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:12.760]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:14.560]  made them even stronger.
[1:31:14.560 --> 1:31:18.280]  So out of all the Bone Broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.

[1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:34.280]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:37.680]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:38.680]  added.

[1:31:46.440 --> 1:31:47.440]  And it just goes on and on.

[1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:57.120]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.

[1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:42.040]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick, remember?
[1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:47.440]  That's a tiny amount of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large
[1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:48.440]  amount.
[1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:52.640]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything
[1:32:52.640 --> 1:33:18.920]  else with the new and improved Bone Broth at M4warStore.com.
[1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:23.280]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, Tim Poole is riding a shotgun with us.
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:26.160]  I cannot wait until we do like an hour or two commercial free.
[1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:29.360]  Some evening this week we're going to do it, we've got the big General Flynn interview
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:31.880]  that I already taped in San Antonio, York State.
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:32.880]  That's coming Tuesday.
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:36.960]  We've got Mike Cernovich coming to town, Luke Radowski, what an amazing journalist as well.
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:38.360]  He's going to be here and so much more.
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:43.280]  But Tim Poole is front and center right now, and yes, Twitter literally, without me even
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:47.360]  looking, I'll just walk by and my wife will have Twitter on, and I just see Tim Poole
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:51.400]  at the top like, he's now a right winger, he's Alex Jones, he's Tucker Carlson.
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:56.440]  And all he is against is SWAT teaming journalist and then sharing the information of the New
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:01.600]  York Times, which by the way, they caught CNN and others with the FBI on the Roger Stone
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:02.600]  raid.
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:06.160]  They left the headers on the email where they even knew before the raid happened.
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:07.680]  I mean, this is what they do.
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:13.480]  It's a merger of the dinosaur media and a merger with the FBI and it's super dangerous.
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:17.840]  I think it's, I think the power is waning, right?
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:21.720]  So the move by the FBI is shocking as it was, as angry as I got.
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:26.600]  It was like 9.30, the show is, we go back, we go into the user, like the audience comments
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:27.600]  around then.
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:30.520]  So we're like winding down the news segments and just taking questions.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:32.560]  And then like, it was like 15 minutes.
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:33.560]  I just snapped.
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:37.720]  I'm like, people keep saying, oh, I better keep my head down if I want to feed my kids,
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:39.200]  which makes everything worse.
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:41.680]  And now there's food shortages and now there's inflation crisis.
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:44.920]  If people just spoke up and remained active.
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:49.400]  But so, you know, I basically went off on that hearing what the FBI had done.
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:52.520]  And I think though, one thing that was, you know, important that I added to that probably
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:58.880]  after the rant, I said, keep in mind, a move this desperate and panicked.
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:02.280]  Even the ACLU is like, this is scary what they're doing to Project Veritas and they
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:04.000]  ate Project Veritas.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.080]  The fact that they didn't use standard spying methods, the fact that they didn't do undercover
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:10.040]  operations, that they kicked the door on numerous people shows.
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:14.040]  I think, I think the establishment realizes their power is dwindling and there's like
[1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:16.600]  a new, there's something changing.
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:19.040]  Obviously they saw it with Trump, the populists came in.
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:20.680]  So I think they're worth.
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:22.080]  Well, I want to be clear.
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:24.760]  People ask me constantly, am I still for Trump?
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:28.600]  I got persecuted supporting Trump and I didn't support him because I thought he was perfect.
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:30.680]  I knew that he was a somewhat of a populist.
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:34.280]  I'm really upset with him or going along with experimental vaccines and all the rest of
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:35.280]  it.
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:38.680]  But regardless, Trump is a whole separate thing.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.200]  When people see it almost like Trump's the resistance to the globalist, Trump's the
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:43.200]  resistance to the New World Order.
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:46.840]  In a way, that's bad because it makes it right wing versus left wing.
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:50.200]  It doesn't matter what color you are, whether you're a communist or a liberal or whatever,
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:53.480]  the collapse of the United States and what the globalists are setting up is not going
[1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:55.800]  to be good for 99.9% of people.
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:36:00.320]  I mean, this, this, you'll own nothing, have nothing, great reset thing is bad news.
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:05.000]  As I think they lie so often, especially about the rant that I had was like critical of law
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  enforcement and government authority.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:11.160]  They need to smear it because they want to make sure the left wing populists, I think
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:15.000]  their economics for the most part are wrong, but you can't have the anti-establishment
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.280]  left and right coming together and, and, and realizing this is a really good example of
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:21.680]  how they, they smear people at Steve Bannon.
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:23.680]  We had Steve Bannon on my show on more than one occasion.
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:24.920]  I know, I watched it flipped out.
[1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:30.680]  But we're getting comments from people saying, I didn't realize how normal and smart Steve
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:35.840]  Bannon was because the media said he was a racist or a right supremacist or a Nazi.
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:39.520]  And then Steve Bannon comes on the, on my show and says, tax the rich and I said, Steve,
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  that's not a right wing position.
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:41.520]  And he's like, I don't know.
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:45.480]  I'm just saying these elitists are screwing over the working class, regular people getting
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:46.680]  access to that.
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:51.240]  I think, you know, we can disagree with left, you know, socialist populist types.
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:55.520]  I think they got really bad policies, but as long as the libertarian of, of everybody
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:02.600]  agrees on, you know, innocent, so proven guilty, personal responsibility, and we were critical
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.800]  of the elites who are stealing our money, who are driving our savings down with inflation,
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:10.520]  stealing our buying power and selling us out, then we can actually solve some of these problems.
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:11.520]  Well, that's right.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:15.800]  I mean, if we don't have basic populism, just a belief in the people and the belief in
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:21.800]  a social construct, a social contract, then we're going to lose everything.
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:26.200]  And instead, the globalists that are a tax exempt and run the planet, they're the ones
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:31.160]  fueling the fake woke mob, not because they're actually liberals or leftists or building
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:35.520]  some communist utopia, but because that's the tool they're using to basically divide
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  and conquer the people.
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:39.880]  I wanted to tell you something, too, I mentioned this before we came back from the break.
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:44.480]  So I'm, I think I was like 19 when I first heard about you, prison, planet, info wars,
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:45.920]  all that stuff.
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:49.200]  And I'd see people, I don't, I don't remember what social media we're using where I was
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:53.120]  hearing about it, but I would be like, I'd go to your site, I'd look at stuff and often
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:54.840]  I'd be like, you know, I'd be like, what is that?
[1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:55.840]  What is that?
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:59.320]  And I remember you talking about real ideas come in and you talk about, you know, the
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:01.360]  Amaro and stuff like that.
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:03.560]  And then I was just like, this is ridiculous, it's never going to happen.
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:04.920]  And you know what I have in my wallet right now?
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:06.200]  I have a real ID.
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:07.520]  It's got the mark on it.
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:09.320]  And I have a North American ID card.
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:10.320]  That's right.
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:12.080]  I have literally, I remember when I was...
[1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:13.080]  See, you talk about this.
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.160]  Yeah, I was getting my passport renewed and they asked me if I wanted my passport card.
[1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:21.720]  And I look at it and it's an ID that is good in North America, is United States, Canada
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:24.440]  and Mexico, as well as several Caribbean islands.
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:28.880]  It is an ID card that I can use as an American citizen in Canada and Mexico.
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:30.160]  It's a North American ID.
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:31.160]  I think that's funny.
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:34.120]  We didn't get the Amaro or whatever, but I think it's fascinating that it's now been...
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:35.120]  Man, what was that?
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:41.200]  It was probably like mid to late 2000s, you're talking about real ID and how it was coming.
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:46.240]  And people, they don't realize you'll talk about something and it's true, but it's so
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:49.360]  far away that they don't believe it, it doesn't affect them.
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:53.760]  And then 15 years later, here we are with our federalized ID cards with a star on it
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:54.760]  tracking us.
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:39:01.080]  And that's what's frustrating to me is I am going to demystify what I did.
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:06.600]  I learned to go read, I mean, I've got stacks up, I've been reading today of, I've got one
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  document here that the UN put out calling for global government and saying we're going
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:13.760]  to track and control everybody in live time using the vaccine passport.
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:17.680]  I've got another article in video from the Davos group three weeks ago saying it.
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:21.040]  So, and then it comes true later, people go, how did you know?
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:25.960]  They tell us in their different white papers and that's what's so frustrating is that they're
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:29.360]  building this extremely hellish world and I'm just trying to warn people.
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:32.240]  But on a separate note, I know you have a lot of young people listening because I've
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:36.640]  seen the demographics, but it is crazy to walk into the kitchen at my parents' house
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:39.160]  and my 70-something-year-old mom's got you on.
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:43.840]  And then her friends, when I go over to her house and they're over there, sometimes they're
[1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:47.880]  having a cookout, they go, hey, talk to Tim Poole for me, they're not asking about Joe
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:48.880]  Rogan.
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:53.200]  So, I don't know what's going on where you got the old ladies watching, but I mean, you
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:58.960]  and Tugger have definitely got, I know young women watch too, but the older, intelligent,
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:03.440]  you know, white collar, because my mom's got a bunch of degrees, all that stuff, and it's
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:05.800]  sort of her friends, they really like Tim Poole.
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.680]  We do have the main risk of, you know, YouTube being a large source of where we present our
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:12.280]  show and everything.
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:16.640]  And then we started TimCast.com to do members-only segments.
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:19.720]  That's the show where, you know, we did our two-hour show with Steve Bannon.
[1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:22.080]  We talked a lot about a lot of things.
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:25.520]  We didn't talk about election stuff, because that's where YouTube outright banned you.
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:28.800]  So as soon as we start the members-only show, I literally said, did Donald Trump win the
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:29.800]  election?
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:31.320]  Let's talk about voter fraud.
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:32.480]  And this is the challenge for us.
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:34.520]  I mean, I may be getting a lot of views now.
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:37.960]  We may be growing, but they're not going to let me get that big.
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:40.200]  They're going to figure out a way to shadow band or curtail.
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.200]  They've been doing it.
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:43.320]  Notifications don't go off for our show.
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:47.840]  So we've been trying to diversify, build culture, set up a website.
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:54.720]  I'll say this, our key demo, MSNBC CNN got nothing on us.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:58.240]  Our key demograph, like 90% of the viewers we get are young people.
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:40:59.240]  They're millennials.
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:00.240]  They're like 18 to 35.
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:01.240]  Sure.
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:05.240]  And I knew that, but I'm saying it's also cool that, like, you've got-
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:06.240]  Absolutely.
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:07.240]  Absolutely.
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:08.240]  I'm not discounting that at all.
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.280]  I'm just saying these dinosaur networks are just not getting it anymore.
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:15.800]  So it'll be interesting to see what happens if YouTube tries giving us the band hammer
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:20.840]  and we've had close calls, we've, you know, they've called me and things like that.
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:26.320]  And so we try to make sure we can talk about everything we need to without getting banned.
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:27.320]  That's a beautiful thing.
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:28.760]  I noticed Stephen Crowder does that too.
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:33.360]  You have like an hour or two hour show and then you kind of don't touch the, okay, don't
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:36.160]  question the vaccine too much, though you do that.
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:37.680]  Don't talk about election fraud.
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:41.000]  And then, hey, come over here and as long as people start moving over, that gets bigger
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  and bigger.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.120]  And in our culture, we build our own ecosystem.
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:47.800]  And that's what InfoWars is for the listeners and viewers who are so precious.
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:51.480]  And that's why watching you build your own ecosystem excites me because that's what
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:52.480]  we need.
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:53.480]  Yeah.
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:57.680]  The other thing we're heavily focused on, and I think my main goal is culture building.
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:00.680]  So the next show we launch is not a news show.
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:01.680]  It's a vlog.
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:02.680]  It's like we're hanging out.
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:08.720]  We're playing board games because we need young people to be inspired and have fun.
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:12.080]  Not just talk about the news, but create an environment where people can feel confident
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:13.080]  and comfortable.
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:14.920]  And let me just say, we're planning that too.
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:18.800]  It's like radio got vetted by three guys the same week in like Italy and Germany and
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:20.200]  the U.S. and same time.
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:23.800]  But yes, what you're saying is the site guys, and I'm trying to make myself for years.
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:28.560]  We actually want to like play pool, play blackjack, play board games, do some comedy because
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:29.560]  we need to do that.
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:31.000]  We need to not just focus on the bad.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:32.080]  I'm going crazy doing it.
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:34.640]  I totally agree with what you're doing and you're a trailblazer.
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:35.640]  All right.
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:40.800]  Tim pools with us one more segment and then another trailblazer Owen, the cut destroyer

[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:03.460]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:11.160]  working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:13.400]  evil groups are.
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:18.120]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:25.400]  and madernas in trouble as well, they know that the people are starting to get wise.
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:29.560]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons
[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:36.000]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:37.160]  up.
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:40.440]  The weapons work a little too good.
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:44.240]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars but instead they're making too
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:48.640]  big of a noise but it's too late for them to turn back now and they're coming after
[1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:53.920]  our children so it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:54.920]  on us.
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:57.640]  Remember, God is watching.
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:03.480]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:11.200]  working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these

[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:25.400]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.

[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:20.680]  Well it's the final segment with Tim Poole, one of the top podcasters in the world and
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:24.760]  he's gonna be on Joe Rogan this week out of Austin of course and he's got a lot of other
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:26.640]  big shows come up this week.
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:29.960]  We're not gonna let any of that out of the bag but it's gonna be as you were saying during
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:32.920]  the break some internet breaking stuff.
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:36.920]  We can't say exactly what it is but Tuesday we're gonna break the internet.
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:38.560]  Okay, Tuesday we'll break the internet.
[1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:42.880]  You know, look, that was what was said to me and I always try to just, we'll just do our
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:47.160]  thing, we're gonna have a good time but we're gonna have a really, really, really big show.
[1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:50.800]  Well hey, when you and I get 30, 40 million views on Rogan's show that's an internet breaking
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  event.
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:55.360]  I mean the Super Bowl is like only like a hundred million.
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  Right.
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:57.360]  And it-
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:47:58.360]  Is it even doing that much anymore?
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:47:59.360]  No, it's not.
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:00.360]  Yeah.
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:01.360]  It is-
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:02.360]  You're always correcting me.
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  Yeah, what is it?
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:04.360]  Super Bowl is like 70 million now?
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:05.360]  I was just trying.
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  I thought it was like 25.
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:08.040]  No, I think, I think, guys-
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.480]  Maybe with the internet and everything combined, I'm getting it wrong.
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:13.960]  How many people tune into Super Bowl 2021?
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:21.560]  I guess they call that Super Bowl 2020 because then it happens in the new year but who knows?
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:27.480]  The point is, yes, out of your, out of your farmhouse in West Virginia, you're reaching
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:28.760]  millions of people a day.
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:30.120]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:34.560]  I never expected it and it is really weird to like, you know, I did a video about Cal
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:39.000]  Rittenhouse last week on a Friday and it got almost a million views and I'm humbled
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.200]  by it because I just like talking about what's going on, how I feel, how I see it, and my
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:47.040]  concerns and my questions and my frustrations.
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:51.880]  Well, I just see victory in independent media because you're not an overnight success.
[1:48:51.880 --> 1:48:56.920]  I mean, how long ago, I remember you back during Occupy Wall Street and all that, you
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:49:01.720]  got, you know, the most riveting footage and you've been out there doing what, Andy
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:09.080]  Nego and people like Drew Hernandez have been doing now, dangerous stuff.
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:10.520]  I mean, you've been around a long time.
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  Yeah, man.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:15.000]  I started, I mean, I had a lot of friends who were in the activist and hacker community
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.520]  and so that got me more political over time.
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:21.200]  Plus I was like an activist when I was younger and I was very lefty punk rock kind of stuff.
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:26.480]  And then in 2011, I actually went to Occupy Wall Street and started doing live streaming
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:30.840]  and it was, I should have realized what I was doing that was working, what really worked
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:31.840]  as the narration.
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:35.320]  I would be filming and talking at the same time and people really liked the show.
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:40.080]  And I took that as reporting the news is what people like most about me.
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:44.240]  Now that I've, you know, for, for safety reasons, I had to start moving away from being on the
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:45.240]  ground.
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:46.240]  I did documentaries.
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:48.840]  I was covering a lot of the Antifa Black Block stuff in the early days.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  I got too many death threats.
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:52.320]  I got people posting pictures of my family.
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:55.280]  And so then I started switching more and more to doing news and commentary.
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:56.360]  Isn't that funny?
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:59.920]  They tried to silence you and it made you go in a direction that made you 50 times
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:00.920]  bigger.
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:01.920]  Exactly.
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:02.920]  Exactly.
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:05.520]  So now we're doing live streams in much the same way I did before with my commentary
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:08.120]  with other people's commentary and it's even bigger.
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:12.840]  Is there a group of bigger losers than Antifa, I mean, maybe the Nazis, but I mean, they're
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:14.840]  all just the same thing bullies.
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:19.920]  They go around, I've got footage from England, from Germany, from France, from Australia,
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:21.560]  from the United States.
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  They had an anti force inoculation event what a few weeks ago in New York at a basketball
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:33.080]  arena and Antifa came out and was beating up Black Lives Matter and Trump supporters,
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:39.080]  which really scares the system coming together and saying no to forced inoculations.
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:42.080]  And again, they're beating people up.
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:46.240]  That's not anti fascism of beating people up that don't want forced inoculations and
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:47.440]  vaccine passports.
[1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:49.000]  You work for the establishment.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  You guys are a joke.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Sorry.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:52.520]  I had a funny way to explain this when I was doing a segment.
[1:50:52.520 --> 1:51:00.920]  I said, anti, Antifa, anti fascists were protesting government mandates, which is fascism.
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:06.920]  And then Antifa fascists attacked them because I think most people can understand the joke.
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:10.480]  But if you've got a group of people that are opposing the government and the corporations
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:15.840]  having a lucrative merger, mandating a medical procedure on the public, giving billions to
[1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:20.600]  the pharmaceutical CEOs, that's Mussolini's fascism.
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:22.880]  The state and the corporations.
[1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:26.960]  And so if you have people protesting that, they're anti fascist, but these people protesting
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:32.200]  it are also anti Antifa because Antifa doesn't actually oppose fascism.
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.000]  They're acting as fascists now.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:38.320]  They're now the teeth of the fascist corporations.
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:39.320]  But you know why it's smart.
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:41.560]  This is what the establishment has realized.
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:43.680]  They need to project what they do like Russiagate.
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:45.880]  They project that on Trump when they're the ones doing it.
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:49.100]  And when they're supporting fascism, they need to claim they're the ones who aren't.
[1:51:49.100 --> 1:51:53.040]  And when they're racist, they need to call it anti racism, so they can constantly trick
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:57.440]  people who aren't politically, absolutely because I mean, calling Tucker Carlson a white
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:51:58.440]  supremacist.
[1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:00.480]  If you watch Tucker, he's unifying the country.
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.240]  He's trying to get jobs back.
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:05.360]  He's a very like classical liberal in my view.
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:06.360]  And so are a lot of other people.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:09.560]  I mean, like general friends of Democrat and he's against what's happening.
[1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:12.840]  This thing of calling everybody white supremacist, it's beyond beating a dead horse.
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:16.280]  In fact, I saw a cartoon of a pile of bloody meat and they say, what's that?
[1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:18.040]  And they say it used to be a dead horse.
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:20.800]  They've just been beating it until nothing's left.
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:26.120]  Well, this is the, this is the, I'll put it this way.
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:29.480]  I think it's going to break at a certain point when you see what happened in Virginia, when
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:34.240]  you see the state senator in New Jersey, this guy was named editor, I think his name is
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:39.080]  153 bucks to run, he ends up winning it as an even campaign.
[1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:43.160]  People at this point seem ready to vote for a ham sandwich over the Democrats or the establishment.
[1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:46.520]  I think it is important to point out when I say Democrats at the very least, I think
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:47.520]  most of us understand this.
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:48.520]  The establishment.
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:49.520]  Yeah.
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  Because the neocons went to Lincoln project, they're, they're, they're, oh, the neocons,
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:55.600]  a lot of that is, as you know, run the Democrats.
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:52:56.600]  Exactly.
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:53:00.160]  They, they, they merged when Trump came in because they lost control.
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:02.760]  The populists are starting to rise up and say no more.
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:04.680]  And so they sought refuge of the Democrats.
[1:53:04.680 --> 1:53:08.200]  And this is why I think you see, for the most part, the establishment as a whole is now
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:12.840]  operating just under the Democrats and some Republicans, you know, well, yeah, the Republicans
[1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:16.480]  won't explain it's a globalist takeover that they're, they're opposing some of it, but
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:17.720]  they're in a wimpy way.
[1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:21.640]  And I get why if you're Rand Paul, you get shot at your ribs broken.
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:24.400]  You get, I don't, I don't like, I don't like the word globalist.
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:25.400]  You know why?
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:30.840]  Because I think these people are the establishment elites, the people in the media, those who
[1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:34.960]  would cheer for the feds, writing a journalist, it's their, their authoritarian authoritarian
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:36.480]  global corporate fascist.
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:37.480]  Right.
[1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:42.200]  I call them globalists because 20 plus years ago, I read articles written by them where
[1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:43.680]  they called themselves globalists.
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:44.680]  Right.
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:45.680]  Like we are globalists.
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:46.680]  They want global government.
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:47.680]  They want global governance.
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:48.680]  I think.
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:49.680]  You know what?
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:50.680]  You're right.
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:54.680]  Like the Nazis called themselves national socialist and they were really, I'm not defending
[1:53:54.680 --> 1:53:57.160]  socialism, but they really were fascist.
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:53:58.160]  I get it.
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:53:59.160]  They call themselves globalists.
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:01.280]  We should call them a global corporate criminal combine.
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:02.280]  I would.
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:06.680]  So people, people comment to me, comment to me this very often that they say the idea
[1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:11.160]  of the world being unified and people working together and trade and agreements and no war
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:14.400]  and whatever you want to call it, international agreements is not what they're referring to
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:15.560]  with globalism.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:19.120]  They're referring to corporate, but just corporate world government.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:21.600]  Like they treat humans like chicken or cattle.
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:25.040]  And I'm like, how can we, how can we make sure that's the idea we're getting across?
[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:26.040]  That's right.
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:30.240]  Globalism is, I was thinking that today is turning us into a commodity is corporate
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  fascism.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:32.240]  Globalism is corporate fashion.
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:35.680]  If you're not, we should be defining that because globalists is too nice a word.
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:36.680]  Exactly.
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:37.680]  It is.
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:39.680]  There's a lot of, like there's a lot of people who think what's wrong with the world coming
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:43.360]  together and having peace and unity and it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean you go
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  wherever you want.
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:45.640]  It doesn't mean you're a world citizen.
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:46.800]  I'm all for that.
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:48.600]  This is not, oh, I'm a citizen of the world.
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:49.600]  You can do, you know, whatever.
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:52.440]  No, this is global corporations run your ass.
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:56.440]  This is how no more cash is being accepted.
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:58.680]  Every, every transaction you have will be tracked.
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:00.400]  We're going to track your bank accounts.
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:04.680]  They want to create a rigid homogenous world where everyone is forced to fall into the
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:09.200]  line of a few despots that will not work.
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:11.560]  Centralized authority throughout history has never worked.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:12.560]  You're right.
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  Global intelligence won't help them do it either.
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:17.000]  They're insane if they think it will.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.320]  You got to take a look at how a lot of the AIs they've built have worked.
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.880]  They cannot, I'll try and simplify, YouTube built their algorithm to try and deliver you
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:29.520]  what they thought would be Game of Thrones, long form interesting content.
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:31.280]  Let's make an algorithm that will promote that.
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:32.280]  What did they get?
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:36.680]  They got weird videos of Hitler dancing with the Incredible Hulk while singing nursery rhymes
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.800]  because the algorithm doesn't understand human society and human culture.
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:45.400]  If these despots think they can centralize all the authority with some AIs assistance,
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:50.800]  the future will be humans swimming in fields of corn and then there will be no other product
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:54.360]  because the AI won't understand the difference between corn, carbohydrates, and soy and
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:56.000]  other products.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.280]  Human minds can do that.
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:55:59.840]  The machines will go insane.
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:01.440]  That's beautifully said, Tim Pool.
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:05.840]  How do people who don't know who you are, most folks do, find your podcast about your
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:07.880]  YouTube, your subscription, all of it.
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:12.720]  Timcast.com and then really the member segment is where we're trying to build the secure
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:14.240]  business where we can make more and more.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:15.240]  But we're on YouTube.
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:18.520]  Timcast.irl is the conversational podcast and Timcast everywhere.
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:19.520]  All right.
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:21.120]  How long are you in Austin?
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:22.120]  Till next weekend.
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  All right.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:25.000]  We're going to go shooting, right?
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Absolutely.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  We're going to bring some people.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  We're going to film it.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  Great.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  And you're going to be on my show on Tuesday?
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  I believe Tuesday.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.280]  And we're going to get some barbecue here then.
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:34.600]  We're going to get some barbecue.
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:38.120]  We were actually trying to figure out how we can get catered a bunch of barbecue for
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:39.120]  everybody.
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  Well, I'm already doing it.
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  Oh, okay.
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:46.160]  But if you want to, I mean, I'm catering Wednesdays and you're also going to be popping by Wednesday.
[1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:48.320]  So we're going to change it to Tuesday.
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:49.320]  How about I change it to Tuesday?
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:52.320]  Yeah, let's do it Tuesday because Wednesdays are particularly busy, too.
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:53.320]  Yeah.
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:54.320]  I forgot.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:55.320]  I thought it was Monday you were doing that now.
[1:56:55.320 --> 1:56:56.320]  It's Wednesday.
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  Yeah, Wednesday.
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:56:58.320]  I don't want that.
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:01.080]  It's going to be big because you do a morning show and an item show.
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:02.080]  Yeah.
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:03.080]  I work nonstop.
[1:57:03.080 --> 1:57:07.520]  Hey, I used to do a daytime show, a nighttime show, and soon I'm bringing a nighttime show
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:10.960]  back because in these times, they're so crazy, we got to do it.
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:12.840]  I think the key to success is perseverance.
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:13.840]  Just keep working.
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.760]  But the truth is, you know, I started taking weekends off, not so that I could not work
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:22.960]  because I need to do paperwork, administrative stuff, and I'm working more than ever.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:28.720]  And oh, Troyer's coming up with Sunday Live, two hours of news commentary and massive amounts
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:30.240]  of critical information.
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:31.320]  Tim Poole's been with us here.
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:32.560]  We appreciate Tim coming in.
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:33.560]  I'd ask him to come.
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  He couldn't do it.
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:35.560]  Then he just popped in.
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  He's had a last minute.
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:37.560]  He just did it.
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  So here he is.
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:39.560]  Ladies and gentlemen with us on Sunday night.
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:44.040]  Oh, Troyer and Sunday Live coming up in T-minus two minutes on this side of this break.
