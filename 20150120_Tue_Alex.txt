[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:31.080]  I should have hyped this up I mean I really don't hype things like I should we
[00:31.080 --> 00:37.160]  have a one-hour debate with Bill Ayers the former head of the weatherman
[00:37.160 --> 00:44.880]  underground and Bill Clinton's mentor joining us today in the second hour so
[00:44.880 --> 00:49.960]  that should be extremely informative I can't wait to ask him about how he's
[00:49.960 --> 00:54.340]  funded by big foundations and why the robber barons and ultra rich continue
[00:54.340 --> 00:59.920]  historically over and over again to fund socialist and communist movements
[00:59.920 --> 01:07.160]  that's coming up also I'm working on getting Dr. Jerome Corsi on the
[01:07.160 --> 01:11.480]  transmission today he's got a powerful article we have linked up at info wars
[01:11.480 --> 01:19.560]  dot com from worldnet daily dot com generals conclude Obama backed al-qaeda
[01:19.560 --> 01:25.480]  that's right and we're gonna be going over this article but more and more the
[01:25.480 --> 01:31.480]  military and former brass are going public including congressmen are now
[01:31.480 --> 01:36.920]  speaking out about this information now I know for our audience this is really
[01:36.920 --> 01:41.800]  old news but it's not something the general public has consciously come to
[01:41.800 --> 01:49.600]  grips with the military knows and see supporting the troops is not supporting
[01:49.600 --> 01:56.280]  lies and fraud or having the troops go battle for al-qaeda in Syria or Libya
[01:56.280 --> 02:01.480]  just like supporting our troops and not hating them like a Michael Moore or a
[02:01.480 --> 02:07.840]  Bill Ayers doesn't mean then you support a movie like American sniper that is
[02:07.840 --> 02:13.800]  propaganda and is full of BS doesn't mean you just buy into stuff that's
[02:13.800 --> 02:17.720]  strictly packaged by the way I love Clint Eastwood my favorite actor probably
[02:17.720 --> 02:20.200]  people always ask me who's your favorite actor I really been thinking about it
[02:20.200 --> 02:24.040]  over the years is probably Clint Eastwood the icon of icons and I am
[02:24.040 --> 02:30.280]  physically sick at American sniper that we've now reviewed and we've got that
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.840]  review coming up in the next segment because it is a powerful film it makes
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.640]  an individual look like a hero a good guy you want to believe in him and so to
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.960]  attack the lie you're attacking something that feels good on the surface
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.320]  because the guy Chris Kyle plays is a great guy the truth of who Chris Kyle
[02:51.320 --> 02:57.760]  really is isn't in this film you know they don't talk about him divorced from
[02:57.760 --> 03:01.320]  his wife they don't talk about him setting up a company to get the money
[03:01.320 --> 03:06.160]  away from her that's what came out in the court case she goes on TV and cries
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.320]  about him and says this movie so accurate when that's not the truth I
[03:11.320 --> 03:15.480]  mean when Chris Kyle heard he had a huge bounty on his head he famously said my
[03:15.480 --> 03:20.880]  god you know my wife will try to cash in on that so you know watching his wife
[03:20.880 --> 03:26.800]  go around it's like Michael Hastings wife who worked in the National Security
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.520]  Council in the most classified areas I mean that's as high level as it gets in
[03:31.520 --> 03:36.640]  the shadow government definitely a spook I talked to folks like Joe Biggs who
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.880]  was at his funeral and she was like oh yeah I think they killed him oh it's
[03:40.880 --> 03:45.640]  terrible oh it's horrible then she goes on CNN on Pierce Morgan and cries and
[03:45.640 --> 03:50.640]  says the official story is true it's bull ladies and gentlemen they killed
[03:50.640 --> 03:55.960]  private Lynch's crew when they started going public saying it was a fraud so
[03:55.960 --> 03:58.840]  they could promote women in the military they killed Pat Tillman when he
[03:58.840 --> 04:02.600]  wasn't gonna play ball and so it's a of all the news we've got in front of us
[04:02.600 --> 04:06.880]  I'm gonna do a review of this from the nightly news last night it's about nine
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.800]  minutes long because it's not just about Chris Kyle or Clint Eastwood American
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.480]  Sniper it's about propaganda it's about deciphering it and coming to grips with
[04:16.480 --> 04:22.440]  it because this is all war propaganda timed for new terror attacks to launch
[04:22.440 --> 04:26.240]  a war in the Middle East where they will attack a country or group that's
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.240]  against al-Qaeda just like Saudi Arabia is involved in 9-11 we attack Iraq or
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.560]  arch enemy they're saying we should go into Syria so al-Qaeda doesn't have a
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.680]  base when our own government put them in there so understanding this can bring
[04:38.680 --> 04:42.360]  down the globalist and we're close because the military is going public
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.400]  more and more they understand what's happening now we can educate the public
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.280]  it's a big deal we got bill there's coming up we got some medical news
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.760]  coming up we've got generals conclude Obama back to al-Qaeda it's all coming

[08:34.040 --> 08:40.520]  your host Alex Jones again it is the 20th day of January 2015 on this
[08:40.520 --> 08:46.600]  Tuesday worldwide transmission Bill Ayers Bill Clinton's mentor who he of
[08:46.600 --> 08:53.800]  course also was a mentor to Barack Obama will be joining us coming up in the
[08:53.800 --> 09:01.200]  second hour today for a debate we were reached out to months ago by Bill Ayers
[09:01.200 --> 09:07.680]  as people saying that we hear Alex Jones doesn't like Bill Ayers and so this is
[09:07.680 --> 09:14.640]  somebody that Barack Obama has even lived with Hillary Clinton of course
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.800]  has praised Bill Ayers and sent him letters we also know that Hillary
[09:19.800 --> 09:24.000]  Clinton's letters were published last year dozens and dozens of them that she
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.800]  had sent to Saul Alinsky rules for radicals so I'm not going to do the
[09:29.800 --> 09:33.560]  standard conservative attack of Bill Ayers I'm just going to talk to him
[09:33.560 --> 09:39.360]  about hey big tax-free foundations fund you Carnegie forward endowment
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.680]  correct he'll probably say no then we can go back and show where he's funded
[09:45.680 --> 09:48.800]  by them later so that that's really the whole point of this interview and I'm
[09:48.800 --> 09:51.040]  putting my cards on the table in case they're listening or they want to
[09:51.040 --> 09:54.480]  check it out coming on because I'm going to ask him questions I'm going to let
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.760]  him sit there like a commie and lie to people and then I'm going to absolutely
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.920]  grill him with the information so that's what's coming up and I'm sure he'll have
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.640]  his attacks as well but we're going to be breaking it down why are communists so
[10:09.640 --> 10:15.280]  connected to the ultra-rich one-tenth of one percent throughout history over and
[10:15.280 --> 10:21.480]  over and over again how proud is he of his Lord and Savior Barack Hussein Obama
[10:21.480 --> 10:27.880]  I guess that's Jamie Foxx that called him the Lord and Savior so that is all
[10:27.880 --> 10:37.000]  coming up today this story is one of our top stories and we're going to be
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.280]  getting to it as well generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda but first I want to
[10:44.280 --> 10:49.320]  review American sniper Clint Eastwood's new film because it's bigger than just a
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.320]  movie it is the science of propaganda decoding it you can understand the big
[10:53.320 --> 11:02.280]  picture and here is my review from info wars nightly news last night and finally
[11:02.280 --> 11:07.040]  tonight on info wars nightly news we're going to break down and analyze what is
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.120]  some of the most thought-provoking propaganda that we have ever seen in 20
[11:13.120 --> 11:20.160]  years of operation I'm talking of course about the blockbuster film that made
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.240]  over a hundred and five million dollars on its opening weekend produced and
[11:25.240 --> 11:31.920]  directed by Hollywood icon of icons legend Clint Eastwood I've been a big
[11:31.920 --> 11:35.640]  fan of Clint Eastwood since I grew up watching spaghetti Westerns with my
[11:35.640 --> 11:41.200]  folks and I agree with many of the political views of Clint Eastwood that
[11:41.200 --> 11:48.980]  said the film is very upsetting when you know the admitted facts surrounding
[11:48.980 --> 11:55.280]  Chris Kyle the American snipers life and the book that he wrote so it would be
[11:55.280 --> 12:01.680]  produced into a Hollywood film please keep an open mind here because I'm not
[12:01.680 --> 12:06.920]  attacking Chris Kyle I'm not attacking Clint Eastwood I'm attacking a known
[12:06.920 --> 12:14.720]  Pentagon system that creates fables that creates stories that creates legends to
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.520]  manipulate the public mind now before I get into the film itself in my review
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.680]  and breakdown it's important to note that in a few minutes we'll play a clip
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.120]  of where I actually had a discussion with Chris Kyle shortly before he was
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.200]  killed outside Dallas Texas so I've talked to Mr. Kyle on air and I've also
[12:35.200 --> 12:40.320]  talked to some of his friends and family but before I get into this current case
[12:40.320 --> 12:47.600]  I want to look at some past cases where we've caught corrupt elements inside
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.920]  the Pentagon engaging in serious deception first let's look at the case of
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.440]  Pat Tillman who I see is a real hero gave up a lucrative contract to go join
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.920]  his brother fighting who he believed was involved in the September 11th attacks
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.280]  he began to ride home to family and friends saying this whole war is a
[13:05.280 --> 13:10.160]  fraud and we're helping him grow the drugs and it's a scam I'm gonna come
[13:10.160 --> 13:15.440]  home and expose it well they executed him then claimed he was a hero who died
[13:15.440 --> 13:20.680]  charging a machine gun nest fighting al-Qaeda it later came out because the
[13:20.680 --> 13:26.280]  army corner wouldn't lie that he'd been killed by friendly fire in an apparent
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.920]  homicide now pay attention to this pattern Pat Tillman was worth billions
[13:31.920 --> 13:37.360]  in army and Pentagon recruiting money they couldn't allow him to then turn
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.160]  against it so he had to be taken out because this pattern repeats over and
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.600]  over again remember private Jessica Lynch it even came out that Jerry
[13:47.600 --> 13:52.600]  Bruckheimer the Hollywood producer was on sat phone directing how to save her at
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.520]  the hospital which they knew the Iraqis had pulled out three days previous they
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.040]  gave her credit for battling this column of Iraqis in her supply truck as the men
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.200]  cowered in fear well the men began to speak out and say we actually fought
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.840]  them she hid in the back in fear so not one not two not three but four
[14:11.840 --> 14:17.840]  different members who were actually in the firefight all ended up dying getting
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.560]  shot in the head being found dead in their cars being found in a puddle of
[14:21.560 --> 14:27.600]  water because dead men tell no tales then private Lynch went public in a press
[14:27.600 --> 14:32.400]  conference and said it's all a fraud I was told to lie to put out a book to put
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.520]  out a movie they already had Hollywood deals to come out and show her as this
[14:36.520 --> 14:42.400]  hero to recruit women in the military and to sell the military on the idea of
[14:42.400 --> 14:49.800]  putting women in frontline combat all I know is I don't believe that Jesse
[14:49.800 --> 14:55.560]  Ventura said you deserve to lose a few but as soon as he said the thing on all
[14:55.560 --> 15:00.560]  Riley and stuff about yeah he said you deserve to die you guys deserve to die
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.960]  when the family's right there that is made up period I knew it was bull then I
[15:05.960 --> 15:10.640]  feel the opinion that he said exactly what I thought he heard and I feel
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.120]  horrible about it coming out the way ahead and I'm sorry I handled it the way I
[15:14.120 --> 15:18.480]  did on your show I I guess I should have just denied it and said I don't know
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.080]  what you're talking about and again right now he sounds like a nice guy so I'm
[15:22.080 --> 15:26.680]  completely blown away by this because Ventura sounds credible you know Kyle
[15:26.680 --> 15:32.040]  you know you know right now sounds calm and nice and I mean I don't know what
[15:32.040 --> 15:38.200]  kind of sigh off this is or what this is just as with Pat Tillman or with Jessica
[15:38.200 --> 15:45.160]  Lynch when the asset when the frontman story is compromised they kill members
[15:45.160 --> 15:50.000]  of the unit who aren't playing ball or they kill the front person if they don't
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.920]  go along with it now we don't know what really happened with Chris Kyle but
[15:54.920 --> 16:00.120]  even before he was dead we had reporters on the ground in Boston and we had the
[16:00.120 --> 16:04.760]  surveillance footage that showed men wearing the uniform of his security
[16:04.760 --> 16:08.840]  company Crafts International with the Punisher symbol with the blood dripping
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.960]  wearing their uniforms and having black backpacks and we never said that they
[16:14.960 --> 16:21.200]  were involved in the bombing we surmised that they were probably called in to
[16:21.200 --> 16:25.840]  run security because there may have been intel that there was going to be a terror attack the
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.280]  media then spun that and claimed that we were saying they were terrorist so that
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.040]  let us know that we were on target they were put this type of disinformation out
[16:33.040 --> 16:38.920]  then MSNBC came out claiming the Zarnab brothers bombed and that I had
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.280]  actually influenced them with no evidence so you need to understand any
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.560]  time you get near Chris Kyle or Crafts International or anything they're
[16:47.560 --> 16:51.480]  involved in there's a massive controversy going on and that's because we
[16:51.480 --> 16:56.600]  know Navy SEALs and private contractor groups made up of SEALs like Blackwater
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.000]  and others are used as intelligence group cutouts and a lot of time are used
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.000]  for Patsy's or decoys ladies and gentlemen I live this I didn't just
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.480]  debate Chris Kyle I'm not just friends with Jesse Ventura I didn't just cover
[17:10.480 --> 17:15.000]  the Boston bombing with our reporters on ground and break the major stories of
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.960]  what appeared to be Crafts International on the ground and then they
[17:17.960 --> 17:23.360]  wouldn't deny it I lived here in Austin and saw with my own eyes the city shut
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.240]  down for much of a day while Chris Kyle's body was brought in to be buried
[17:28.240 --> 17:34.320]  and as he was built up as the ultimate hero this thing has all the signs of
[17:34.320 --> 17:40.200]  scripting from the start to the finish and it needs to be investigated to
[17:40.200 --> 17:46.520]  really discover who Chris Kyle was and why he was actually killed this thing
[17:46.520 --> 17:50.080]  stinks to high heaven and then you go and sit in the theater and watch the
[17:50.080 --> 17:54.880]  movie and he loves Muslims and he wants to help them and he wants to get all
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.680]  kind of people to come join him to fight the terrorist and he's such a sweet
[17:58.680 --> 18:03.040]  person that gets along great with his wife when the court records show it's
[18:03.040 --> 18:06.600]  the opposite and they were divorced and he was setting up these companies to
[18:06.600 --> 18:12.760]  try to transfer his assets into them and none of it is true from our research as
[18:12.760 --> 18:17.800]  best we can tell it's just not true he didn't call up crying when he had to
[18:17.800 --> 18:23.120]  shoot people he was quoted in the news in radio interviews in TV interviews
[18:23.120 --> 18:30.720]  saying that the enemy are despicable savages and that he only regrets he
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.240]  didn't kill more he made those statements in his best-selling book
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.280]  American sniper now look I'm not criticizing him like Michael Moore is
[18:40.280 --> 18:46.080]  saying that any sniper is a coward snipers are targeted it's a very dangerous
[18:46.080 --> 18:50.480]  job highly skilled I don't think snipers are cowards I think you're some of the
[18:50.480 --> 18:57.280]  best people in the military when it comes to pure skills but Chris Kyle did
[18:57.280 --> 19:01.680]  like to brag about killing people he did show a lot of unsavory traits that I
[19:01.680 --> 19:06.000]  haven't seen in other operators that I personally know who will not talk about
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.400]  the people they've killed and the system will purge people that have been willing
[19:11.400 --> 19:17.360]  servants of the system like Chris Kyle did he get a conscience at the end was
[19:17.360 --> 19:21.600]  he deciding that he was going to come clean we'll never know because now
[19:21.600 --> 19:26.760]  sitting there in the movie theater at the end you get to see everyone cry when
[19:26.760 --> 19:32.480]  they show real footage of his funeral when he's buried like George Washington
[19:32.480 --> 19:39.280]  or something this is part of living in this modern propaganda state and people
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.160]  need to cut to the emotion and look at the cold hard truth it's propaganda and
[19:44.160 --> 19:49.520]  lies it's killing America a truly moral nation has the high ground and doesn't
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.760]  need disinformation doesn't need brainwashing to convince the population
[19:53.760 --> 19:57.200]  to go along with the government the truth is America has been captured by
[19:57.200 --> 20:01.680]  offshore globalist interest and we're losing our country the real heroes of
[20:01.680 --> 20:04.840]  the men and women everywhere to stand up for our Bill of Rights and our
[20:04.840 --> 20:09.520]  Constitution and actually stand up for what the American flag symbolizes as for
[20:09.520 --> 20:14.560]  Clint Eastwood I hope this is just the fact that he's seen oil but this film is
[20:14.560 --> 20:19.840]  so well done I know that's not the truth Clint Eastwood has decided to have
[20:19.840 --> 20:24.640]  the biggest hit of his life based on a lie and in the end I think it hurts his
[20:24.640 --> 20:30.640]  reputation think it hurts his legacy and for that I'm sad well that's it for
[20:30.640 --> 20:36.160]  this extended breakdown tonight of American Sniper I'll be back tomorrow
[20:36.160 --> 20:39.680]  live on the radio 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time with the
[20:39.680 --> 20:44.000]  syndicated radio broadcast and please never forget if you're watching this
[20:44.000 --> 20:55.400]  transmission you are the resistance I got several calls late last night from
[20:55.400 --> 21:00.720]  bigwigs in Hollywood about this report so they were watching it when it aired
[21:00.720 --> 21:06.920]  last night on the nightly news so it's already making the rounds there and it's
[21:06.920 --> 21:11.200]  because this attack is not just some jealous attack of the movie it's it's
[21:11.200 --> 21:18.360]  it's a rule a reluctant attack it's a serious breakdown that only really
[21:18.360 --> 21:24.720]  scratches the surface but still scratches it with a lot of truth we have an
[21:24.720 --> 21:32.560]  article up on info wars.com right now by Kurt Nemo you heard my quote in that
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.880]  analysis piece saying that I don't agree with Michael Moore overall saying
[21:36.880 --> 21:43.600]  snipers are cowards I do agree that the Iraq war was a fraud and was bad and was
[21:43.600 --> 21:49.360]  based on a lie as Michael Moore is saying but Michael Moore doesn't criticize
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.640]  Obama for all the wars that he's continuing or turning Syria and Libya
[21:53.640 --> 21:59.800]  over to Al Qaeda to engage in ethnic religious cleansing that is even more
[21:59.800 --> 22:05.360]  corrupt premeditated and evil than the Iraq war so what I don't like by the so
[22:05.360 --> 22:09.960]  called left is that there's such despicable hypocrites of course Kurt
[22:09.960 --> 22:15.000]  Nemo is an anti-war libertarian patriot and he has the article Michael Moore is
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.560]  right it's a provocative headline he actually breaks down that Michael Moore
[22:18.560 --> 22:25.160]  is a globalist socialist but that in his tweet overall he is correct but he had
[22:25.160 --> 22:29.960]  another tweet you know talking about snipers being cowards that from Michael
[22:29.960 --> 22:34.560]  Moore who has six armed bodyguards but doesn't want citizens to be able to be
[22:34.560 --> 22:40.800]  armed so I just don't think Michael Moore is a legitimate voice to criticize
[22:40.800 --> 22:46.600]  the military I mean he's got his first amendment I have my right the left always
[22:46.600 --> 22:49.960]  spins disagreeing with him as hate speech that's what more even says in his
[22:49.960 --> 22:55.360]  piece because someone calls him a traitor oh that's hate speech now implying
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.680]  it's illegal like they've already made it in Europe this is a guy that says that
[22:59.680 --> 23:04.040]  white people only want guns because they're racist no what's racist is not
[23:04.040 --> 23:10.240]  letting blacks have guns in Democrat run black cities like Chicago New York DC
[23:10.240 --> 23:14.240]  that have the highest crime rates in the United States some cases the world we
[23:14.240 --> 23:19.080]  talk about Chicago and they can't have guns I mean this is all blaring common
[23:19.080 --> 23:23.840]  sense stuff and the people are awake and understand what's happening we're
[23:23.840 --> 23:30.920]  going to have at least three hours of live in studio in this studio coverage
[23:30.920 --> 23:36.760]  tonight starting at seven o'clock central one hour before we'll have the
[23:36.760 --> 23:41.000]  State of the Union with analysis and commentary by David Knight jacari
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.400]  Jackson Lee and Makadu Joe Beggs Darren McBreen and many others here in the
[23:46.400 --> 23:52.960]  crew during the lengthy canned applause by canned they just are supposed to like
[23:52.960 --> 23:59.240]  lap dogs clap to everything he's saying and not dare call any of it out as lies
[23:59.240 --> 24:05.800]  then there'll be at least an hour of analysis after and we have a contact
[24:05.800 --> 24:10.120]  with what you could call anonymous and quite frankly anybody could be anonymous
[24:10.120 --> 24:14.440]  but now this particular contact we got from anonymous is definitely on the
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.040]  inside definitely has big contacts throughout the hacking community and
[24:19.040 --> 24:27.560]  we're going to have an announcement from the white hat anonymous sector tonight
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.000]  I'm not sure when we're going to air it but we have it that's coming up tonight
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.800]  it's pretty powerful stuff between 7 and 10 central and I've told the crew if
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.760]  they want to go further if they want to go longer they're welcome to I could
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.040]  easily come up here tonight and dominate the whole thing I I did that last year
[24:48.040 --> 24:55.880]  and a lot of folks tuned in to watch it tonight I'm going to sit back and let
[24:55.880 --> 25:01.080]  the crew conduct the special transmission so seven o'clock central
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.360]  standard time we will also on the front page of info wars.com have a video box
[25:06.360 --> 25:10.960]  also info wars.com forward slash show where we'll have a free feed for
[25:10.960 --> 25:14.720]  everyone the nightly news is subscription generally because we got to pay for the
[25:14.720 --> 25:19.200]  bandwidth and the computers and the crew and the camera folks and the analysis
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.280]  and investigative reporters so it's $5.95 a month it's actually right now $2.50
[25:25.280 --> 25:28.960]  a month the discounts going for the rest of the month and then 20 people can use
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.880]  each membership so that's 12 cents a person per month if you're not a
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.840]  prison planet.tv member takes one minute to sign up you're supporting the
[25:37.840 --> 25:42.400]  absolute very tip of the spear in the fight for Americana renaissance basic
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.360]  freedom classical liberalism the opposite of the socialist slash communist
[25:48.360 --> 25:54.040]  slash fascist implemented system with fascist worldwide above it tax exempt
[25:54.040 --> 25:57.920]  or diplomatic immunity using communist socialist tactics to domesticate the
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.760]  slave population that's a real paradigm and that paradigm continues to get out
[26:01.760 --> 26:05.440]  it's game over for the globalist just it's game over they've always sold
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.600]  opposition in Latin America Asia and Africa the Middle East as be a
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.080]  communist and then fight capitalism when this isn't capitalism we're living
[26:13.080 --> 26:17.400]  under it is a crony insider system you're always going to have a percentage
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.160]  of that capitalism but now it's becoming the dominant sector and it's why
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.720]  you've got one tenth of one percent not one percent with half the wealth and
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.160]  it's projected within five years to be seventy plus percent because they're
[26:31.160 --> 26:37.960]  waging financial war on the population that's what's happening that's what's
[26:37.960 --> 26:45.000]  unfolding now what are we going to be covering today I went to drudge report
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.040]  calm this morning at about 7 a.m. after I checked info wars calm and prison
[26:51.040 --> 26:59.320]  planet calm and I saw us say today the new headline is humanoid's hold news
[26:59.320 --> 27:04.080]  conference interview baby but the previous top headline was from us say
[27:04.080 --> 27:17.040]  today new police radars can see inside homes this very radar is in police state
[27:17.040 --> 27:23.400]  2 and police state 3 from 2000 and 2003 I mean in fact I need I know the crews
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.480]  working hard on this show and others but if somebody can scan through those two
[27:26.480 --> 27:34.080]  films I know I cover it multiple times in fact I show your TV viewer this very
[27:34.080 --> 27:42.120]  device that is at least 20 years in action this very device when you go to
[27:42.120 --> 27:47.240]  USA today info wars calm to link through and you can watch the USA today video
[27:47.240 --> 27:53.160]  they did a video report on it this very device has been around and been sold for
[27:53.160 --> 28:00.480]  at least 20 years and they are now reporting that they just rolled it out
[28:00.480 --> 28:09.440]  last year the FBI did I'm not tuning my horn but we covered this 15 years ago
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.240]  with the documents and they're now announcing that it just started in the
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.960]  last couple years it says 50 law enforcement agencies are using it
[28:19.960 --> 28:25.760]  here's the deal if you're using this when you are going after a suspect and
[28:25.760 --> 28:33.680]  you think they're dangerous and they're in a building then fine use it but
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.920]  that's not what's happening they have mounted on helicopters now stuff that
[28:37.920 --> 28:41.360]  gives them a black and white image in live time of your house doesn't just
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.400]  tell them where a person is or show them a basic image of where they are so
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.400]  they're showing you 20 year old technology that we that we've been
[28:49.400 --> 28:55.280]  documenting for 15 years and rolling it out and I would tell people the police
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.240]  are getting devices and see through your walls and they would laugh at me well
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.360]  guess what Google cars are getting mounted with these but they're not just
[29:03.360 --> 29:07.200]  grabbing that data they're grabbing your other data from all the quote smart
[29:07.200 --> 29:14.040]  devices the point is this is a premeditated organized long-term program
[29:14.040 --> 29:20.360]  now here's another report the next frontier hacking your car oh see the
[29:20.360 --> 29:27.360]  whole new problem is oh all these smart devices can be hacked oh my goodness see
[29:27.360 --> 29:31.160]  see how they set up the problem to offer the solution well here's our article
[29:31.160 --> 29:36.280]  from two years ago Microsoft denies new Xbox can see your genitals though it
[29:36.280 --> 29:40.440]  can see through your walls this is much worse than the police device and it's
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.280]  in most your houses just like Chamsung came out last year and said yeah we're
[29:44.280 --> 29:49.280]  listening to you in your house quote watch what you say we're on the March
[29:49.280 --> 29:57.040]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.360 --> 30:03.760]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[30:03.760 --> 30:07.280]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.320]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[30:11.320 --> 30:15.520]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[30:15.520 --> 30:19.360]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.520]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[30:23.520 --> 30:27.320]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[30:27.320 --> 30:30.680]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[30:30.680 --> 30:34.360]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[30:34.360 --> 30:38.760]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we

[33:19.840 --> 33:27.080]  I wasn't sure it was gonna be ready today but they have basically completed
[33:27.080 --> 33:33.400]  the report so we're gonna break it today here on the radio TV broadcast info wars
[33:33.400 --> 33:39.600]  live instead of tonight during extended three-hour live coverage of the state of
[33:39.600 --> 33:51.120]  the Union and that is a story that was only picked up on in some trade
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.840]  publications and some governmental publications that contractors use to
[33:56.840 --> 34:04.400]  look for bids you cannot make up how over the top the information is that we're
[34:04.400 --> 34:13.400]  gonna break in the third hour and Joe Biggs wanted to illustrate it and so I
[34:13.400 --> 34:18.320]  let him do it because he's the guy that you know basically ferried it out the
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.000]  news it deals with veterans so he also illustrates you know basically what's
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.880]  going on but it is just over the top and then we're gonna continue our
[34:29.880 --> 34:37.800]  investigation basically undercover on this into the future but it deals with
[34:37.800 --> 34:43.720]  the death panels of the veterans and how they're on the death panels and who
[34:43.720 --> 34:48.440]  decides who gets care and who doesn't and I was sitting there last night looking
[34:48.440 --> 34:56.200]  at all these documents and I actually began pinching myself like I was dreaming
[34:56.200 --> 35:00.920]  I mean I didn't really think I was dreaming but I caught myself pinching
[35:00.920 --> 35:09.640]  myself thinking is this a dream this is so evil and it just goes on and it's
[35:09.640 --> 35:15.840]  just put out there like it's blasé and no big deal we go celebrate veterans we
[35:15.840 --> 35:25.560]  go celebrate the archetypal warrior the Chris Kiles the Audie Murphy's and then
[35:25.560 --> 35:35.200]  we treat them worse than we would treat a dog if humans can't be treated as good
[35:35.200 --> 35:42.760]  as an animal we're in deep trouble so we're going to be airing that at the
[35:42.760 --> 35:48.760]  start of the third hour today I'm going to just leave it at that until we get to
[35:48.760 --> 35:54.600]  it and I'm going to intro it then Anthony Gutiard is going to be joining us in
[35:54.600 --> 35:58.960]  studio with some breaking news I'll be honest with you I'm not even looking
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.280]  forward even though it'll be powerful radio and informative to talking to
[36:03.280 --> 36:10.000]  Bill Ayers next hour because I want to be polite and classy but at the same time
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.080]  knowing and I'm gonna have to sit there and listen to him shovel BS in my
[36:14.080 --> 36:18.680]  direction and in your direction is nauseating
[36:20.560 --> 36:25.360]  Obama is to deliver his state of the Union tonight obviously and I'm going to
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.000]  talk some about that with the Bill Ayers
[36:29.320 --> 36:34.040]  Obama is a fraud within a fraud he claims he's this free market guy but then
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.240]  tells his constituents he's basically a commie he's gonna deliver them all these
[36:37.240 --> 36:42.880]  free goods and then what he delivers them is select corporate welfare to
[36:42.880 --> 36:46.880]  supplement their wages to work for these globalist combines who are busy
[36:46.880 --> 36:52.600]  deindustrializing and consolidating the economy insurance companies in the last
[36:52.600 --> 36:58.360]  two years as we reported from the Japan Times and from the Davos forum have had
[36:58.360 --> 37:06.960]  their profits go up almost 50% what was it 47% from Obamacare alone global
[37:06.960 --> 37:13.880]  insurance companies the rape job of doubling or tripling prices brought to
[37:13.880 --> 37:20.760]  you by a commie not a commie commie is their cover landing and giant planes
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.000]  with red carpets saying you can't have air conditioning or a car
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.680]  oh we're gonna have carbon taxes and transfer wealth to the poor people you
[37:30.680 --> 37:37.360]  get the actual plan it's basically doubling taxes on poor people worldwide a
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.400]  veritable death sentence for people who spend half their money their
[37:42.400 --> 37:49.320]  discretionary income on food what happens when you double the taxes on them
[37:49.320 --> 37:55.680]  they starve to death 30 million people a year half of them children it's
[37:55.680 --> 38:04.320]  estimated by the WHO at the UN starve to death and when you get the Planned
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.560]  Parenthood documents when you get the Roe v. Wade that just came out the lawyer
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.360]  that lives here in town that's a woman that had the abortion that's a woman who
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.360]  was in the case of Roe v. Wade you know it's now a Christian is repented but the
[38:19.360 --> 38:30.000]  the the lawyer who lives right here in Austin who got it through she was in
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.360]  the news last week with her letters to the president at the time talking about
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.440]  we've got to get rid of all these poor people just like Margaret Singer said
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.040]  we've got to kill all these black people I mean I'm just so sick of it I'm so
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.160]  sick of knowing the facts knowing the players being informed knowing their in
[38:46.160 --> 38:54.720]  game here's some of our past articles dealing with x-rays that's now in the
[38:54.720 --> 38:57.880]  USA today today shifting years back in what I was covering earlier and more
[38:57.880 --> 39:04.000]  detail New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscation
[39:04.000 --> 39:15.080]  Wednesday July 7th 2010 person planet calm all Joseph Watson police to get x-ray
[39:15.080 --> 39:20.880]  scanner for vehicle inspections and public safety June of 2014 just to show
[39:20.880 --> 39:25.280]  that it's now proliferating DHS to x-ray scan Americans at border
[39:25.280 --> 39:31.640]  checkpoints 2012 TSA invades roads and highways with
[39:31.640 --> 39:38.240]  viper checkpoints and x-ray systems 2011 TSA to roll out covert surveillance
[39:38.240 --> 39:45.680]  vans with x-rays and systems to see through walls 2013 that and these are
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.840]  just stuff the last three four years I made four police state films I know two
[39:50.840 --> 39:57.040]  of them made in 2002 2003 show this very scanner that USA today has in their
[39:57.040 --> 40:03.120]  article today that is a very primitive one so deciphering that getting the rest
[40:03.120 --> 40:11.520]  of the story as Paul Harvey would say good day the full story is they're
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.240]  rolling out this is going to be used everywhere and they show you on the news
[40:15.240 --> 40:21.360]  the most primitive one that just shows a basic human shape through walls and the
[40:21.360 --> 40:24.520]  police can argue hey we're going out for somebody you know the chute net us
[40:24.520 --> 40:26.800]  whatever this is a good way to know where they're at so we don't get killed
[40:26.800 --> 40:32.240]  makes perfect sense but this is being rolled out in private corporate systems
[40:32.240 --> 40:38.840]  governmental systems it's in satellites now they've got basically sound wave
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.600]  technology and other systems radar systems that are so sensitive they
[40:43.600 --> 40:48.440]  shoot through the walls resonate back that's why Microsoft Connect admits they
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.960]  can see through up to eight walls and people up to 400 yards away with an
[40:54.960 --> 41:01.600]  x-box connect that was three years ago that rolled out and hackers and people
[41:01.600 --> 41:09.640]  demonstrated it by capturing the video feed of it connect the spying on you and
[41:09.640 --> 41:16.280]  again scroll back up I'll show folks that publication mainstream news gizmodo
[41:16.280 --> 41:23.960]  Washington Post they're all reporting that lazy gamer net we were the first to
[41:23.960 --> 41:30.480]  tell you this and it's not hey we were first it's hey it really gets old
[41:30.480 --> 41:34.680]  reporting on something 15 years before it's admitted because by the time they
[41:34.680 --> 41:40.400]  admit it they're 10 15 years ahead and have already got helicopters looking
[41:40.400 --> 41:47.000]  through your wall the x-box connect can look at the pores on your skin and
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.560]  biometrically recognizes you and your voice and this is being rolled out on
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.520]  the new smart TVs everywhere remember remember three years ago the head of the
[41:58.520 --> 42:06.400]  CIA Petraeus CIA chief will spy on you through your dishwasher I go on other
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.520]  radio and TV shows and I mentioned this and they laugh at me I was on British
[42:11.520 --> 42:17.440]  radio a few years ago and in studio and they began laughing at me see it's so
[42:17.440 --> 42:22.400]  funny I'm like hey even Petraeus admits that they're watching you through your
[42:22.400 --> 42:26.720]  dishwasher that's ridiculous but see then it all comes out and oh well that's
[42:26.720 --> 42:32.440]  acceptable now they don't want this an Intel known until it's already widespread
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.680]  until it's ubiquitous until the technology is in place because they
[42:36.680 --> 42:42.080]  know you're then comfortable with the Samsung or with the Sharp or with every
[42:42.080 --> 42:48.360]  major brand is now putting in their terms of service data collected off this
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.920]  platform will be given can and will be given to third parties for marketing
[42:53.920 --> 42:58.280]  other reasons and by turning this on and with your purchase you accept click
[42:58.280 --> 43:04.240]  here for the system work you can't turn it off in the settings Samsung went
[43:04.240 --> 43:10.280]  further four months ago as I keep mentioning there's the headline Samsung
[43:10.280 --> 43:13.920]  Smart TV records quote personal conversations and sends them to third
[43:13.920 --> 43:18.840]  parties new companies new privacy policy causes consternation all Joseph
[43:18.840 --> 43:26.840]  Watson November of last year because they say in their terms of service watch
[43:26.840 --> 43:35.640]  what you say we're got audio and video we're just supposed to accept this now
[43:35.640 --> 43:41.360]  this is how Orwellian it is and I'm going to do this myself or if any of the
[43:41.360 --> 43:46.120]  crews bold enough it wants to do it just we need to get this done that's why I
[43:46.120 --> 43:49.720]  hired a big crew or bigger crews so we can actually carry out all these ideas
[43:49.720 --> 43:54.680]  because I can't get them all done we just go to people's doors and then once
[43:54.680 --> 43:57.760]  they find out the truth we just give them a sign a waiver and agree to it that's
[43:57.760 --> 44:01.120]  how you get around the privacy issue that's how they do it with a you know
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.880]  hidden TV cameras there's a lot of folks will understand I'll end up you know
[44:04.880 --> 44:07.800]  being aware of what's happening and then we'll say yeah it's for TV is an art if
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.280]  we use this or we can just blow their faces we need to go to people's doors and
[44:11.280 --> 44:18.960]  go hey we're here from television in full wars and we'd like to plant cameras
[44:18.960 --> 44:22.840]  in your house and we'd like to watch and listen everything you do and then give
[44:22.840 --> 44:25.960]  it a third parties and sell that data and they'll say get off my porch you're
[44:25.960 --> 44:32.240]  crazy and I'll say but here's the policy report by by Samsung do you have
[44:32.240 --> 44:36.920]  Samsung products all their products for two years now have this and if they're
[44:36.920 --> 44:40.360]  hooked into the internet as a quote smart TV they're watching everything you're
[44:40.360 --> 44:44.600]  doing and they'll say you're crazy and I'll say no here it is they'll read it
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.880]  I'll say yeah we did this to illustrate what's happening because you're upset at
[44:49.880 --> 44:56.160]  me wanting to do this let's go one step further how about you pay me three
[44:56.160 --> 45:01.800]  thousand dollars to watch everything you do for the next five years while you have
[45:01.800 --> 45:05.880]  this television and sell that data to everyone how about while you're having
[45:05.880 --> 45:10.040]  sex with your wife on the couch watching porn how about we take that video and
[45:10.040 --> 45:15.880]  sell that on the open web how about in your bedroom even when you're not you
[45:15.880 --> 45:19.080]  know having sex how about how about when you're on the toilet with your iPhone
[45:19.080 --> 45:22.880]  how about we get that data because here's the deal I talked to not one not
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.280]  two not three not four people in the last week this didn't happen to me but
[45:27.280 --> 45:32.520]  happen to people I know family that their droids and iPhones when state law went
[45:32.520 --> 45:40.920]  into place in Texas that you can't talk on the phone anymore you have to have a
[45:40.920 --> 45:45.520]  hands-free that the phones automatically all went to voice print and began not
[45:45.520 --> 45:48.760]  letting them use them but but but talking at them till they change the
[45:48.760 --> 45:53.120]  settings guess what I went and looked it up and saw talks going on a few years
[45:53.120 --> 45:57.320]  ago with different governments in Europe about the phones turning off when
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.960]  they're civil disobedience turning off anytime the police want them to and just
[46:02.960 --> 46:08.000]  not working hands held they have new sensors in the droids and the iPhones
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.440]  where they know if it's up to your head they know if you're moving they know
[46:11.440 --> 46:14.720]  where you're going they know how many calories you've had they know where you're
[46:14.720 --> 46:18.800]  you know those programs are all public those apps are all public but do you see
[46:18.800 --> 46:24.640]  the other side of all this Apple granted patent to disable cameras according to
[46:24.640 --> 46:31.880]  location three years ago info wars.com this is not our opinion this is the
[46:31.880 --> 46:37.960]  master plan where all this social engineering tech is built into
[46:37.960 --> 46:44.160]  everything so it's so shocking now why the police have handheld systems then
[46:44.160 --> 46:48.040]  you watch the video oh that's just kind of grainy black and white there's a
[46:48.040 --> 46:53.280]  shooter in the building sounds reasonable they always show you the old
[46:53.280 --> 46:59.960]  thing that's been in place for 20 years when the new stuff is beyond Orwell so
[46:59.960 --> 47:07.320]  there's that tactic you heard it here first government spies on innocent
[47:07.320 --> 47:12.320]  people via webcams laptops Xbox Steve Watson links back to articles we wrote
[47:12.320 --> 47:17.560]  eight years ago in his 2014 article he links to them and now it's admitted that
[47:17.560 --> 47:24.560]  NSA GCHQ in England others in programs called optic nerve have AI watching you
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.240]  and Google admitted in a patent ten years ago that they were already with
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.800]  with audio with the embedded microphones listening for save your dog
[47:32.800 --> 47:41.400]  barks then ads for dog toys pop up you read it here first Google's ambient
[47:41.400 --> 47:50.040]  background spy tech 2012 we link back to our 2006 report Alex Jones is that
[47:50.040 --> 47:54.400]  crazy guy I remember I would have family and neighbors at my house and I would
[47:54.400 --> 47:58.680]  have webcams covered with a bandaid and they'd say why is that covered and I'd
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.520]  say oh there's patents they watch and listen over that and the FBI without
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.360]  warrants dials into them all the time they can also frame you with those
[48:07.360 --> 48:13.720]  cameras and they went man you're nuts really I'm nuts and again this isn't
[48:13.720 --> 48:17.360]  about Alex Jones being right and everybody else being wrong it's about
[48:17.360 --> 48:21.840]  we're still in this process there is a global government putting fluoride in
[48:21.840 --> 48:26.080]  the water and GMO that kills the rats and you're eating it Chuck Morris has
[48:26.080 --> 48:33.440]  now come out and warn people okay I mean this is going on people so understand
[48:33.440 --> 48:38.640]  it I don't care if your school teacher an auto mechanic a farmer a factory
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.600]  worker a police officer I don't care who you are your family is being hit by
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.600]  this and I know a lot of you are gonna laugh right now you're not gonna laugh
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.840]  when your 12 year old has that seizure and a month later is dead you're not
[48:52.840 --> 48:59.840]  going to laugh as all of this unfolds understand that that's what it comes
[48:59.840 --> 49:06.200]  down to so trying to figure out the studio we never really did a briefing in
[49:06.200 --> 49:08.900]  here is the is the red light of the green light the camera on green lights
[49:08.900 --> 49:11.440]  the one I'm on right
[49:13.880 --> 49:16.960]  that's what I thought
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.920]  Jesus it's just what's the point the public just all wants to die fine enjoy
[49:22.920 --> 49:28.760]  yourselves okay strength fluoride take the shots eat the GMO don't go look at
[49:28.760 --> 49:32.480]  the rat studies don't go look at the guinea pig studies just don't look at
[49:32.480 --> 49:39.920]  it let's go watch ESPN and act tough all day the elite have told me the public
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.880]  doesn't care and doesn't want to be helped but that's not really fair because
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.520]  if you tried this on people in 1950 it wouldn't have flown or even 1960 or 70
[49:48.520 --> 49:52.320]  it was incrementally done people were set in front of televisions from birth
[49:52.320 --> 49:58.120]  they were taught where they mix like Mark Dysart saying yesterday nuclear
[49:58.120 --> 50:02.280]  war is inevitable top scientist says you know next
[50:02.280 --> 50:09.080]  teletubbies I mean they just come out and calmly announce yeah your
[50:09.080 --> 50:13.320]  television's watching you the head of the CIA flaunts it they just do it it's
[50:13.320 --> 50:18.280]  all totally illegal it's not done to protect us our government is totally
[50:18.280 --> 50:25.520]  corrupt at the top and now dr. Corsi comes out generals conclude Obama backed
[50:25.520 --> 50:37.840]  al-Qaeda and it's a huge thick long article with just generals and former
[50:37.840 --> 50:44.320]  CIA people in all of them admitting our government runs al-Qaeda it's just an
[50:44.320 --> 50:50.880]  amazing article and it's just like I so why you know so why well when al-Qaeda
[50:50.880 --> 50:54.960]  starts blowing stuff up that's gonna be used to take our liberties so the system

[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.960]  American who just died last year Larry grass walled Vietnam veteran green
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.040]  beret 101st Airborne Division former FBI weather
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.800]  underground informant who quoted Obama confidant and former leader of the
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.920]  weather under meant of stating that those Americans who could not be
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.600]  educated in communist camps of the revolution will be eliminated in
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.800]  malcultural revolution style he wrote the book bringing down America and he's
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:52.040]  dead Larry 101st blogspot.com let's go to a clip of a man speaking from the
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.240]  grave they also believe that their immediate responsibility would be to
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.440]  protect against what they call the counter-revolution and they felt that
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.200]  this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.800]  establishing reeducation centers in the southwest where we would take all the
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.720]  people who needed to be reeducated into the new way of thinking and teach them
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.040]  how things were going to be I ask well what is going to happen to those people
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.600]  that we can't reeducate better die hard cap capitalists and the reply was that
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.840]  they'd have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further they estimated
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.600]  that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:48.040]  centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people I want you to
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:54.920]  imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have graduate
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:02.360]  degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:09.240]  hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:17.520]  they were dead serious that's from 1982 the documentary no place to hide and I

[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:01.800]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are now into the second hour of this
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.040]  worldwide broadcast and I've got to hand it to him joining us here on the 20th
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:13.760]  day of January 2015 on this Tuesday Bill Ayers you can say what you want about
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.000]  him he is more than happy to go out and debate people that I guess he
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.880]  disagrees with and he's the former head of the weather underground distinguished
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.400]  professor of education and senior university scholar the University of
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.960]  Illinois at Chicago I'm not going to go over all the things that he's been
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.280]  involved in Ayers has written extensively about social justice democracy
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:43.200]  and education the cultural context of schooling and teaching as an essential
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.240]  intellectual ethical and political enterprise he is a former vice president
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.280]  of the curriculum division of the American Educational Research Association
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:57.000]  a member of the executive committee of AER a council his articles have appeared
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.240]  in the Harvard educational review I'm not going to go over all of it Bill Ayers
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:08.200]  dot org and I think what I want to do today is just let him have the floor the
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.200]  first three four or five minutes and say what he has to say because we were
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.000]  reached out to first by some of his people and I'm glad this this discussion
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.720]  or debate is now finally happening they want to talk about common core education
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.800]  things like that that's fine I want to get into Obama and the legacy I mean I
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.480]  know Ayers was his mentor I think Obama even lived with him for a while and he
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.040]  could correct me if I'm wrong and so I mean is is Obama the Messianic
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.720]  Socialist leader they thought would come or or will that be another I mean was
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.080]  Mal the Messiah was it Lenin was it Stalin I want to understand this so Bill
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.800]  Ayers joins us we'll also ask him about Larry Graf wall the FBI informant and
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.560]  that clip you just heard you know does he say that's true or is that not true so
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.120]  Bill Ayers thank you so much for coming on with us today again Bill Ayers dot
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.640]  ORG thank you very much well where do you want to start well let me correct a
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.960]  couple of things one I don't have any people who could have reached out to
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:19.600]  you because I'm just a retired professor and I write and I take care of my
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.760]  grandchildren but how did you end up getting on the show because I remember
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:27.120]  months ago yeah I have no idea somebody for called me and said would you do it
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.520]  and I said sure that's number one number two I was never the leader of the
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.760]  weather underground I was one of the people who founded the faction within
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.440]  students for democratic society became the weather underground number three I
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.840]  was never a mentor to Barack Obama he certainly never lived with me he was a
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.880]  guy around the neighborhood he's somebody I knew for many years and I know
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:56.720]  it's been a big trope among some people on the right that somehow Barack Obama
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.800]  is not what he appears he's got this black nationalist minister Jeremiah Wright
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.880]  he's got this Palestinian friend and he's got me who apparently ghost wrote
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.160]  his books all of that is false it's all silly and if you just take a minute to
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.720]  think about it it's somewhat ridiculous so do you want to talk about Obama the
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.760]  past history education where do you want to begin Alex well first off because I
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.080]  don't get sidetracked on my new show I think you were here in town a while back
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.720]  and from memory and then one of the what counter you in Austin Texas yeah I was
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.560]  in Austin that's a long ago and I think it was one of the people that brought
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.520]  you then that contacted us and said hey would you want to debate him we're like
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.520]  oh yeah that's gonna happen so so so that's cleared up there okay all right
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.800]  good but but all of that aside here then let me just start with communism itself
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.840]  because most communists say they're socialist but then when you get around
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.280]  them in person they they start telling you about violent over throws and the
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:01.920]  plan to take over do you endorse the type of communism we saw in Russia in
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.680]  China or or how would you really describe yourself well the answer to your
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.760]  question is no but you know I've been a person in my whole life as an educator
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.320]  I've opposed the notion of labeling people in a simple-minded way but yes I
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.000]  am opposed to capitalism I think capitalism is a predatory system I
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.240]  think it's a system that leads to racism exploitation etc so yes I'm
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.240]  anti-capitalist and I am in favor of participatory democracy which has been
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.160]  true my entire adult life and that includes global democracy and it includes
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.120]  economic democracy so yes all of those things are true I wouldn't if you want
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.160]  to put a label on me it's kind of complicated because I would say on the
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.800]  First Amendment I'm a fundamentalist I am fundamentally in favor of the First
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.400]  Amendment on the question of the economy I tend towards socialism of a
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.200]  democratic nature in terms of the government I'm more of an anarchist or
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.600]  a left libertarian than anything else so it's hard to put a single label and say
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.920]  well this is what you represent no it's not true but I am definitely I believe
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.280]  that we need more democracy in any democracy the solution to our problems
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.760]  is more democracy more participation so that's what I fight for let's come at it
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.840]  from this angle then have you changed or how have your views changed since you
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.480]  were one of the core people in the weather underground versus 2015 well I
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.920]  mean I'm now 70 years old so of course I've changed I change every day as you
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.720]  do and all of us change but in terms of fundamental values I am deeply opposed to
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:43.520]  war I'm deeply opposed to imperialism I'm deeply opposed to white supremacy I've
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.840]  been an ally of and fighter for the black freedom movement and for
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.720]  anti-colonial struggle so in that sense I haven't changed I think the wars that
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.560]  were involved in now are catastrophic not just for the rest of the world but
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.160]  for America itself and I think that we should I in that sense I don't know
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:04.840]  where you stand on any of these issues I've never talked you have never you
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.720]  know read anything you've written I've never heard your show but I would I'm
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.960]  wondering are you closer to Rand Paul when it comes to militarism are you
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:19.760]  closer to John McCain oh I'd be Ron Paul so so you've got Ron Paul over on the
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.040]  libertarian end you've got a son unfortunately moving towards the middle
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.200]  you've got John McCain completely mentally Ellen and Shane well exactly so
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.520]  in that sense we have a point of unity because I think we should call close all
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.280]  foreign military bases as Rand Paul does I think that we should downsize the
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.480]  Pentagon by about 90% I think we should stop the war industry I think we should
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.520]  stop arming the the dictators and petty fascists all over the world I think we
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.080]  should become a nation among nations not the uber nation not the controller of
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.320]  everything so in that sense Alex we've already found a point of unity what is
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:02.200]  your view of Barack Obama then I've always had the same view of Barack Obama
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:07.440]  as long as I've known him I've known him for a long long time Barack Obama as he
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.680]  said of himself in the 2008 campaign and as he said as he's defined himself all
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.680]  through his political life he says of himself I'm a moderate middle of the
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:21.320]  road pragmatic compromising politician that's who he said he is that's who he
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.680]  is the right wing looked at him and said no he's not that what he is instead is a
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:29.640]  secret Muslim who pals around with terrorists and as socialist ideas I
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.720]  have yet to see a socialist idea come out of barrage are you are you kidding
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.600]  he's talking about free community college and open borders let me just say the
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.240]  left-wing looked at Obama and said I think he's winking in my direction but
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:48.960]  it wasn't true Obama is a moderate middle of the road pragmatic politician
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:54.680]  that's who he said he was that's who he is for seven years you can examine his
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.760]  record you don't have to turn hey Bill Ayers Bill Ayers our guest professor
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.640]  Ayers look very good tactics about getting a point of unity why if you
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.840]  were a green beret in a village with the village elders having a debate you'd
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.640]  find that first point of unity common ground in a month you'd have them
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.120]  fighting for you and I understand that but you're not a green beret you fight
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.640]  for a different army who who funds you because I've read you're connected the
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.120]  Ford Foundation Carnegie and others have you ever gotten any funding from those
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.360]  guys never and I don't even know what that means who funds me I'm a retired
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.000]  professor I live in bodestly like other retired professors I'm not sure what
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.360]  you're saying there's not a CIA program back to the 50s to fund liberation
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:43.000]  theology that I know you're fully aware of at university campuses I hear your
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.520]  paranoia eking through but I don't know what you're talking about
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.040]  liberation theology has nothing to do with campuses it's a movement within the
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.400]  Catholic Church is a left-wing movement in the Catholic Church yes it is does it
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.600]  come out of Brazil it does there's Pope Francis to some extent is he some
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.400]  extent influenced by that apparently he is oh boy that has to do with me are you
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:10.520]  excited about Pope Francis and his liberation theology it's hard for me
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.640]  to get excited about a pope I know that for those of you who are Catholic he's
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.520]  infallible so I guess the Catholics must be excited about him I think that when
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.160]  he says who am I to judge and when he opens himself to the possibility of
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.560]  greater freedom for women I think those are good things and of course carbon
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.200]  taxes for George Soros though I'm not sure what that means Alex I mean I know
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.480]  you've got that a big paranoid background that's somewhere bubbling up but I don't
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.520]  know you don't know who I am hold on a minute a big paranoid background
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.720]  now killed 84 million people according to Chinese government the CIA says 60
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.240]  million are you saying that I shouldn't be worried about communism I didn't say
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.600]  that at all you said something about George Soros I don't know anything about
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.000]  George Soros let me ask you this I don't know what you're drawing on so you
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.400]  know nothing about George Soros I said when you say this is a George Soros
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.800]  connection to Pope Francis I don't know what I wasn't saying that I was about to
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:13.880]  get into asking you about George Soros who is funding liberation theology does
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.040]  George Soros support liberation theology I have no idea I don't know much
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.520]  about liberation theology and I know nothing about George Soros except what
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.080]  I read occasion in the newspapers well I mean community organizing stirring up
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.760]  groups that's basically domestic liberation theology Reverend Wright was a
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.640]  lever slow down that's liberation theology community organizing is stirring
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.720]  up groups what's wrong with community or no that that's a name radicalizing
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.000]  people has then been named community organizing and this funded by the big
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.720]  billionaires to destabilize well listen I want you to have a counterpoint to that

[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:15.120]  alright Bill Ayers is our guest this is a short six minutes segment along 18
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.640]  minutes segments coming up so we can really get into a serious discussion if
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.560]  he's up for it we'll open the phones up so I guess supporters and detractors can
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.880]  call in here's where I stand professor Ayers I don't know if you've read none
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.480]  dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen I read that book back when I was like 14
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:39.480]  years old since then pretty much all of it has been proven to be accurate from my
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:44.000]  perspective we're ultra-rich crony capitalist fund socialist and
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.920]  communist movements but also fascist movements because they like to deal with
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.880]  command and control systems with domesticated populations and I think
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.160]  that history shown that collectivism delivers hell on earth and forced work
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:04.000]  camps now that's why I disagree with you fundamentally and I guess you believe
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  that we have a real form of capitalism and you disagree with that I don't
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.300]  believe we have capitalism I believe we have fascism sitting on top of a
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.680]  socialist management system and that the left-right paradigm that's taught is a
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.960]  fraud what do you say I have no idea what you're talking about but I think that
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.280]  I agree with you I'm against forced work camps I'm against slavery I'm against
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.440]  nuclear holocaust I'm against military bases abroad that I understand I don't
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.520]  know what you're talking about about crony I know finance capitalism is one
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.840]  of the great dangers in the world today but I don't know what you mean about
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.120]  them funding socialists what socialists have they funded and if you say well
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:49.360]  they've funded Obama I see no evidence of Barack Obama as a socialist in any
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  sense at all it's been declassified that the CIA did indeed put Mao Zedong in the
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.200]  power in 1949 where do you find that that's fascinating history channel but
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.040]  it was previously declassified you know I've never heard of that but that's
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:09.040]  fascinating and Mao Zedong is no hero of mine so there we are I mean you've got
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.240]  these great theories but I don't know we're not talking the same language
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.080]  because I don't know what you're talking about exactly you're speaking
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.920]  academia speech we're here this nice mild-mannered guy and you're there with
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.760]  your significant other Bernadine Dorn I guess you guys were never involved in
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.520]  any bombings or anything right no that's not true we were involved in trying to
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.320]  stop the murder of 6,000 people a week by our government that dragged on for 10
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.120]  years we conduct that we I was involved in nonviolent citizens I was involved in
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:45.360]  all kinds of tactics that were legal and eventually we did turn to to what I
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.760]  would call extreme vandalism we destroyed property to raise a screaming
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  opposition to the murder of 6,000 people you didn't bomb police officers or blind
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.320]  police officers not at all nothing like that ever happened I know it's part of
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.720]  the narrative of the right but it's just not true really so weatherman bombs
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:11.040]  never wounded police I'm sorry weatherman bombs never wounded police never
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.480]  because you know what I'm gonna do with all this we're gonna take this live
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.120]  interview and then take clips of what you're saying and then and then show
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.760]  them throughout that's the whole point I don't know what you're talking about
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.400]  because we were involved I was underground for 11 years the weather
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:31.840]  underground was very active between 1970 and 75 our government people like John
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:38.080]  McCain killed 6,000 people a week for 10 years and we engaged in illegal some
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.120]  would say you know ill-advised crossing lines of legality and maybe common sense
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.560]  we involved in it we're involved in extreme acts of vandalism to destroy
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.880]  property to raise a screaming alarm against sure they claim that Tim McVeigh
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.240]  was angry about Waco and blew up that building the evidence shows it's a false
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.320]  flag to blame the right but but expanding on that you're talking about
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.960]  about Waco I'm not sure what I'm asking you do you think it was okay what
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.760]  McVeigh did absolutely not he murdered people innocent people in the federal
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.160]  building absolutely not we never did that and we never murdered anybody so
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.480]  that's what McVeigh did was horrendous was Larry Grathwald I heard he tried to
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.880]  debate you have you ever debated him no and never and he's passed away now but
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.320]  Larry Grathwald was a pathological liar a paid informant of the FBI I don't know
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.000]  if you're a fan of the FBI but Larry Grathwald was paid to lie and he none of
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.600]  what he said was true or has ever been proven to be true well I'm not a fan of
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.240]  a lot of stuff the FBI has done but it's pretty much a creature of whatever
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.160]  whoever runs the Justice Department and the White House but but I'm certainly
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:51.640]  not a fan of communist so Larry Grathwald is a creature of the Justice
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:57.240]  Department correct of the Justice Department he was under but he I think
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.240]  there's good people and bad people in there is what I'm saying department or
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.280]  you not like that Justice Department I believe that when he when you guys
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.680]  recruited him and reportedly tried to get him to train you in military
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.320]  tactics I mean I think it was good to stop violence that is true Larry
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.720]  Grathwald hung around SPS everybody thought he was a cop it turns out he
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.240]  wasn't a cop he was simply a paid informant paid to lie and that's what he
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:27.720]  did none of what he said ever resulted in anything so the fact that he tried to
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.480]  make a second career out of himself is ludicrous he was not a truthful person
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:35.880]  he never told the truth and he never stood for anything except let me get a
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.400]  little money to lie we gotta go to break come back you can finish

[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:06.640]  wrong that you guys followed a malice cultural revolution style system at the
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:11.120]  weatherman yeah he was wrong and he was lying but the red star in the black
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:16.680]  background is also the sign for Heineken beer and Macy's so be careful what you

[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.920]  you love linen first of all I'm not famous secondly I don't know what you
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.840]  meant when you said Bill Ayres supporters call in you we haven't had one
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.280]  substantive exchange you and me so I don't know what one would think to be a
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.720]  supporter you mean if somebody has read one of my books and has something to
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.920]  say about it we haven't talked about anything substantive okay well you're
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.880]  you're setting and defining things like MSNBC saying parents your kids don't
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.800]  belong to you let me ask you this question do you support abortion wait
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.360]  when did I say that when did I say parents don't belong to their I said
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:58.800]  MSNBC said that no they did not what are you talking about I didn't say we need
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.760]  to break through this view that you know kids belong to their parents and that
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.000]  they actually belong to the wider community I've got you know I'm so
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.320]  bewildered about what you're talking about let's talk about the question of
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:14.280]  whether kids belong to their parents if a kid is being let's talk about that
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.120]  in general I think yes indeed children and their parents and their families
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.040]  are sacred sacrosanct absolutely but if a parent is raping the child the
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:28.200]  community has an interest in stopping that do you agree with that yes so you
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:33.240]  agree with Melissa Harris Perry I'm not sure you disagree with her wait a minute
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.840]  about what well that's her statement about the kids the point is we know all
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.920]  communist systems try to take over the kids three question if a parent is
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.440]  raping a child does the community have an interest the local community but not
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.760]  the central communitarian okay that's fine I'm with you the local community has
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.920]  an interest but but so I mean I'm not sure what the big distinction is but you
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:59.920]  and I then agree the child and the parent sure is sacrosanct and less
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:07.440]  something what do you think about Obama wanting a domestic security force just
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.280]  as big and just as strong as our military and having youth brigades chanting
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:16.600]  his name I'm is that I didn't know he was doing that but I'm opposed to all
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.760]  domestic security forces I'm I'm opposed to the US military I'm opposed to the
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:27.080]  massive militaristic nature of the society including surveillance mass
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.360]  incarceration are militarization of the police all of that I'm opposed to what
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:36.360]  do you think Bill Ayers of our government with NATO maybe you disagree
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.400]  arming al-Qaeda renaming of ISIS to turn them loose on Sharia and murder
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:46.440]  hundreds of thousands you know I I've always been opposed to the US arming
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:50.000]  al-Qaeda which they did in their fight against the Soviet Union the United
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.960]  the al-Qaeda is a creation of the United States yes they've created ISIS and all
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.320]  these invasions including the bush chaining invasion of Iraq have been
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.240]  mindless and stupid and they've caused nothing but grief in the world and in
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.560]  the United States well I'll say this we have a big video out today that's going
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.760]  viral where we expose American sniper as a giant hoax so just so you know where
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:15.920]  I'm coming from I attack everything I see is baloney so I agree there's right
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.360]  wing tyranny there's left wing tyranny all I attack everything I see is baloney
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:24.200]  as well and right now I'm feeling you're the biggest baloney here I don't
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.960]  understand what do I support Melissa Harris Perry what is it what is that I
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.320]  didn't know what you're talking that's like the mouth of Sauron in SNBC you're
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.080]  like a real celebrity over there and so that's the kind of stuff they're saying
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.720]  you're absolutely mistaken I am not a celebrity anywhere but certainly not on
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:45.400]  that is pure bold you are almost like a Christ-like figure in the circles of
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.920]  hardcore commies show me show me where show me some evidence of that Alex that's
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.880]  so fascinating I feel like I'm just sitting here in my home trying to write
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.560]  something this morning I'm suddenly having a conversation with you and you're
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.360]  bringing up these gigantic categoricals I have no idea what you're referring to
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.080]  let me just play a Melissa Harris Perry for you in a promo they still air
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:08.400]  they've been hearing this for three years here it is so part of it is we
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.600]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:15.040]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.640]  communities once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.200]  households then we start making better investments so do you agree with that or
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:27.800]  disagree with the lean forward Marxist-Leninist statement I only got a
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.240]  little piece of that because I was talking but I'll once again give you the
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.240]  example and you tell me if you agree no no we've already been over that let me
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:42.560]  ask you this key question are you aware that IBM and the eugenicist movement
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.600]  funded much of the modern left and Margaret Sanger who got awards from
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.000]  Hitler gave awards from Hitler as the whole great society was a plan to take
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.440]  over black communities and exterminate them because they're quote weeds well I
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.120]  know that the eugenicist movement and Margaret Sanger and Hitler and a large
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.640]  part of the American society were eugenicists and and academics were
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.360]  eugenicists and I think it's all part of a very heinous part of the human of
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.080]  human history and the human condition I agree with you and from my research the
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:19.360]  left represents the core vestigial movement and at its base it's eugenical
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.520]  maybe you never got that high in the power structure but that's what it is I
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.800]  had no idea but this is news to me I have no idea what you're referring to I
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:34.040]  don't know that the left I mean to me that the Hitler and the right wing notion
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:39.200]  of racial superiority and white supremacist has never been you know a
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:46.560]  core value of of the left but so again I don't I don't accept your premise I
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.360]  don't know what you're referring to the reason some of what I say to you you
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.360]  know about makes sense and other stuff you say sounds a total baloney is
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.360]  because I am outside the box and I'm trying to transcend all these labels
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.560]  Hitler called himself a national socialist but I would agree with you that
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.960]  he had right wing aspects but only within the left right paradigm as
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.000]  curl quickly wrote have you read tragedy and hope I curl quickly no I have not
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.080]  that's Bill Clinton's top mentor in his words I have no idea he wrote an
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.720]  unofficial secret history for the State Department so their section chiefs could
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:26.280]  understand why they were funding fascist and communist and a totalitarian and he
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.760]  admits in the 1100 page book how the whole game works I mean clearly big
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.280]  corporations try to control the left and right right I don't know much about
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.600]  Bill Clinton but I've never been a support and a supporter of Bill Clinton
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.760]  and so I you know again you're trying to make some connection that I'm not
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.800]  following I haven't read the book I don't know he was a Clinton's advisor I've
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.800]  never been an admirer of Bill Clinton sure and I'm trying to get at the fact
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.760]  that there are robber barons funding socialist and communist movement from
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:59.480]  Armand Hammer to you know people like George Soros who just got caught
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.720]  spending 33 million trying to hype up the Ferguson protestor you were that I
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.800]  am not I am not and George Soros again I know nothing about George Soros but the
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:14.440]  idea that somehow big capitalists are funding movements that would want to
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.760]  overthrow them seems preposterous to me but again you're crashing through the
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.920]  through the lies so maybe you know something I don't know but I don't know
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:25.920]  it so asking me about it is if I'm an expert on it I have no idea what you're
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.880]  referring to well here's the deal the system promotes communism or socialism
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.160]  is the only way to rebel against corrupt forms of capitalism and I just think
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.040]  that's a total fraud and I'm sick of it that's what I'm saying I don't think
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.400]  that's true and I don't think I think that that you know most systems and
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.520]  certainly the American government hates dissent despises dissent and does
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.560]  everything it can do to to ruin it to wreck it to reframe it and so no I don't
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.360]  accept the the terms that are given to me by the ruling class sure percent I
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:02.880]  don't accept it sure well I found that communism is historically least tolerant
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.120]  of free speech than capitalism though I agree capitalism is degenerating into a
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.760]  fascist corporatist model right now I think that's probably true there are
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:18.040]  all kinds of indications of fascism including the intolerance of dissent
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.480]  and including the suppression of free speech and including the linkage of
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.280]  corporations with government which has gone so far that we have very little
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:31.640]  left of a participatory system very little it's mostly controlled by big
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.840]  money and big money is I mean you know we fought we yesterday there's great
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.080]  celebration for voting rights and the movie sound man so on but the reality is
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.720]  that voting rights have been dismantled in this country by the wealthy but if you
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:49.000]  notice the one-tenth of one percent to control most the wealth in the world get
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.560]  their money from government deals insider deals government bailouts and
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.000]  they're the ones pushing higher taxes on the middle class Warren Buffett and
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.960]  other dirtbags don't you know they're funding leftist foundations across the
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.400]  board and want a limited leftist movement to domesticate the public I don't
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:09.360]  consider these foundations leftist foundations but I do think that the
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.480]  Ford Foundation the Gates Foundation the Broad Foundation all of these people
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:18.440]  are right-wing absolutely so I agree with you on that and I think that
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:23.280]  government this is a government that supports the big finance capitalist
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.640]  class there's no question my mind that the government is run by Wall Street
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:30.960]  that's who runs it but I'm saying they're creating a monopoly so you can't
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.520]  call it capitalist and I'm not saying the foundations are right-wing or left-wing
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:40.080]  they push fake left-wing ideology as a form of domestication see any fake with
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.920]  left-wing ideology you take the Ford Foundation the Ford Foundation you know
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:50.320]  funds mostly horrible controlling racist kinds of things I don't I have anything
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.200]  the Ford Foundation wants the open borders what do you think of Obama
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.960]  acting unilaterally more and more not even executive orders but just doing
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.200]  whatever he wants I don't know what again what are you referring to for example
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:07.000]  open borders the the power plants I think he's done anything about open
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.800]  borders I think the idea for example of opening the Cuba which he did
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.800]  unilaterally was a good thing I think it should have happened 50 years ago I
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:21.960]  think the idea that somehow the United States has gained anything by boy by
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:27.240]  trying to destroy cuba also that has hurt the Cuban people and isolated them
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.640]  from the possibility of new ideas and new developments I think it's great that
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:36.840]  that the United States now has an open door to Cuban and Marco Rubio can have
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.080]  a conniption fit if he wants but it doesn't mean anything the fact is
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.640]  sure it's not a it's not a danger to the United States I think they should close
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.660]  Guantanamo as long as I'm talking about Cuba I think that Guantanamo was a
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:53.320]  massive mistake from the beginning it's expensive it's stupid it makes no
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:58.240]  sense sure let me do this I want to go to some phone calls while we've got you
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:04.880]  bill airs dot org you can find his books and other things there but I think
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.920]  there's a culture clash here because we're not in the control left or
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.640]  controlled right paradigm I mean I am a feminist and then I want women to all be
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:18.040]  trained how to use firearms that's right you let me guess you don't want the
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.160]  citizens to have weapons right now that's not true but I'm a feminist in the
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.880]  sense that I think women should be paid equally for equal work and have the
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:30.720]  right to control sure should women be able to own guns oh absolutely oh good
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.680]  so you're not for taking the guns like Chicago's done never have been I don't
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.080]  know what you're referring to show you're an old-fashioned type coming you
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:45.200]  believe in raising that AK-47 either we should eat go one of two directions we
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:49.240]  should either disarm everybody starting with the most massive military
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.960]  establishment ever established on earth and that's the US military could
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.880]  disarm them disarm the police disarm everybody or we should go the other
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.920]  direction and arm the homeless which is I think would be a great thing I think
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.120]  there are a lot of good people among the homeless why not have them all get a
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.760]  little I think there's a lot I think you actually you find mainly and I'm sad
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.720]  for homeless I try to help them but most of them are schizophrenic drug addicts
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:17.960]  well good Lord and why aren't they getting help I bet you I bet you ten
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:22.440]  thousand dollars you can come to Austin with me and and if 90% of the homeless
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.080]  aren't mentally ill people dumped out of facilities who I feel sorry for or
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.320]  aren't total drug addicts I'll give you 10 grand I mean I really I mean everybody
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.720]  knows they're mainly mentally ill when we count on you to be the diagnostician I
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.200]  be a little suspicious just from the last no we can bring like three random
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.720]  people with us just I mean the person's muttering to themselves and talking
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.760]  to themselves I mean obviously they're completely out of their minds I mean you
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:48.840]  you know most of homeless people listen you've been muttering to yourself for
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:54.800]  the last 45 minutes but good one but listen Alex the fact that I'd be locked
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.480]  up like the Soviets would do because am I mentally ill if they're if they are
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.320]  mentally ill on the streets of Austin shouldn't they get some help from the
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:08.880]  community shouldn't we allow them to get treatment absolutely I'm all for that
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.840]  but you notice the welfare system always gets sucked up by the corporations I
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.400]  want to go to some phone calls while we've got you here we don't have you
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:18.240]  very long maybe five six more minutes we appreciate Bill Ayers joining us I got
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:22.020]  to say I agree with more of what Bill Ayers says than what Obama says which is
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:30.360]  frightening Bill Ayers says arm the women absolutely arm them yeah don't
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.200]  forget arm the homeless then they won't need to be armed everybody that's right
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.840]  I say on the police and just everybody can have weapons and they have tanks I
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.720]  have tanks buddy I gotta have my guns when the commies come let's talk to Gary
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:48.640]  Gary and pencil Vanya you're up first go ahead yes hi Bill I just want to ask
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.120]  you just a quick question maybe get some a few bull points on what your
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.040]  definition in your own work and opinion of the difference between socialism and
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.080]  communism just of what you believe in well you know I don't think you know for
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:06.560]  me if you read if you read for example the communist manifesto there's a lot
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.840]  in there that you that you would find you agree with the communist manifesto is
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:14.440]  not a plan for state communism it's not a plan to overthrow the government it's
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.880]  not a playbook for communist revolution what it is is mainly a praise song for
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.040]  capitalism it basically says in the storable sweep of nations the the the
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.920]  rise of capitalism is the most productive force that's ever been made and
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:34.040]  it's going to exhaust itself I think that the communism of the 20th century was
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.520]  catastrophic for humanity I think the socialism of the 21st century 20th
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.920]  century 21st century in Europe is inadequate and in many ways feeds the
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:47.640]  corporate the corporate culture I think we need participatory democracy and
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.840]  that includes participatory economic democracy that is a community socialism
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:56.960]  is a stagnant rotten cesspit that lets special interest control big pools of
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.240]  money that's why big money always is backing limited socialism and I'm glad
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.160]  you just basically admitted that it's all nothing but a corporate welfare system
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:09.680]  that then controls the population Gary thank you they in Europe yes Alex that's
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.440]  what I said yeah no it's it's it's that before I don't think you should be
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.000]  surprised if you've ever read anything I've written I write about these kinds
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.880]  of things all the time folks can read your website let's rush to some more
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.560]  calls here let's go ahead and go to Ray in Iowa go ahead you're on the air with
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.760]  the Grand Weatherman go ahead yes sir Alex thank you sir for taking my call
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.440]  go ahead you're on the air with the grand boob on well I want to have a
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:40.400]  question for mr. bell airs I wanted to find out if he had ever seen a film by
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:47.760]  Joel Gilbert called dreams of my real father and if so what was his take on
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:51.880]  that film and how did he feel about it I've not seen it and I've never heard of
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.200]  it Frank Marshall Davis as you know him I never knew Frank Marshall Davis I read
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:01.760]  about him in the New York Times so Barack never told you that was his
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:06.600]  pappy I you know I knew Barack Obama about as well as thousands and thousands
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.320]  of other people it's not that we we weren't intimate friends we never shared
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:15.320]  a milkshake with two straws never all right well I wouldn't nobody ever said
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:19.880]  you did that you'd have to be cuddling to be done then those friends I was never
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:26.960]  dated Barack Obama I never dated him right okay let's go ahead and go to
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:30.320]  Jeff and Tennessee you're on the air with Bill Ayers go ahead we got two more
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.960]  calls we'll let us his lordship go go ahead okay guys good to talk to you
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:40.360]  mr. airs that just a question as far as listening to you talk on the radio I
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.880]  mean there's things that we definitely have in common but there's a lot of
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:49.200]  things we don't have in common and I think would help me understand if just
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.680]  hypothetically Rand Paul and Hillary Clinton are running for office which one
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:57.080]  would you vote for and what would be your reasons behind standing behind one
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:02.120]  or the other I wouldn't vote for either one of them and I'm not a big fan of the
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:07.040]  of the Republicans and the Democrats in fact I don't think if you look at
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:12.000]  history I don't think that the great man or the great woman is what changes
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.440]  history if you look at Lyndon Johnson he was never part of the black freedom
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.440]  movement but he passed the most far-reaching civil rights legislation
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.680]  since Reconstruction Franklin Roosevelt was never part of the labor movement
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:27.040]  and Abraham Lincoln never belonged to an abolitionist party what changes his
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.000]  history his movements on the ground I'm more interested in people being active
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.240]  in trying to engage with each other to change the terms of the discussion the
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:42.040]  people are the resistance we agree on that then then and then who's president
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:46.040]  who's president you notice if you go back even in this century Democrat
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.600]  Republican Democrat Republican they're pretty much the same they're not
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:52.760]  completely the same but they're pretty much the same well who would you share a
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:59.800]  milkshake with Hillary Clinton or Rand Paul you know I find Hillary Clinton I
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:03.240]  could never vote for Hillary Clinton she's in the pocket of Wall Street she's
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:07.800]  a militaristic candidate and those are the two things that matter most to me
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:14.000]  Rand Paul I agree with him more around the question of militarism but he also
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.600]  is is a Wall Street favorite so I you know neither one of them really I'd like
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:24.680]  to share a milkshake with you in Austin all right you know if you come down here
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:30.640]  we will share a milkshake with a strawberry milkshake together let's go
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.640]  ahead and take two more calls and we'll let you go I appreciate your time this is
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.760]  a ridiculous debate folks we'll get him in person down here will waterboarding
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.960]  that's what patriots do we'll get the answers I'm joking there's waterboard
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:46.480]  people what it's a joke I don't support waterboarding even though Dick Cheney
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:52.160]  you know I'm a big fan of Dick Cheney though I'm shocked I'm joking all right
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:57.520]  let's go ahead and talk to let's go ahead talk to Patrick and then Kevin and
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.600]  then that's it I'll have to get to Clinton others because we got to go here
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:01.840]  tomorrow guest has got to go we're holding him over Patrick you're on the
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:07.480]  year with Bill Ayers yes hello mr. curious there's a lot of this discussion
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.400]  going back and forth and it's just a constant here the same thing come out
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.680]  of your mouth is I don't know you're talking about I'm not familiar I don't
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.720]  know I don't know I guess my question is what does it do that you do know and
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:21.320]  obviously it should be education but I question that because you look at the
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.680]  current state of our educational system it's absolutely just blasphemously
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:28.680]  ignorant and disgusting is that something that you advocate is being
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:32.000]  appropriate or do you find there's a better model than what this public
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.600]  system is doing to demolish the brains of these young children I'm very much
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:41.160]  you've been a person who's opposed the status quo in education where I think
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:44.240]  we could start in a lot of different places we could start but one of the
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:48.320]  things is public education very much serves the people who are privileged so
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:52.680]  you go to a city like winnetka north of Chicago those kids get a great
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:57.360]  education go to Chicago those kids get a rotten education why because the
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:01.280]  education for the people who are pulling the strings is an education for
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.840]  initiative courage imagination and entrepreneurship the education the kids
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:09.920]  in Chicago get is about obedience and conformity well that's true but
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.720]  shouldn't people in Chicago themselves change that to say some small wealthy
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:20.400]  town shouldn't use its own money for its kids is just fundamentally theft Alex
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:24.680]  you ask the question and the answer I'll give you is yes shouldn't the people in
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:30.560]  Chicago change it yes there you go so I mean I want people to do good and I
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:33.600]  mean certainly there's an equity but there always be in any attempt to change
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:38.200]  it by just taking money creates a new evil Patrick you know again I never said
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:42.560]  anything about taking money here's what I would say in a democracy whatever the
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.760]  most privileged and wisest parents have for their children should be the baseline
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.120]  of what we want for all children but we're not a democracy we're a republic
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:54.760]  we can't have two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner well the
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:59.640]  fact is that we want all kids I want all kids to get a decent education and a
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:05.320]  decent education is not an education for obedience and you like common core no I
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.840]  do not like common core and the then the hugest thing that's hideous about common
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.280]  core is it goes along with the corporate reform agenda yeah dosing
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:21.080]  education to a simple-minded score on a standardized well I agree with you because
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:26.040]  we're testing more testing that is the an anathema to education well yeah the
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.960]  left defense it all day but you're actually right Bill Omelette Gates came
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:34.320]  up with it as a brainwashing system it is a corporatist thing and the right wing
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.040]  can't square that that their precious corporations want a bunch of dumb zombies
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.200]  wait a minute when you say the left supports it who are you talking about
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.680]  I think you've got some magical mindset somewhere am I the left I don't support
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:51.080]  it so who's the left that you're referring to that loves common the main
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:54.560]  line Democrats that can't tie their shoelaces and think that Martin Luther
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:58.840]  King is an astronaut but I just said to you I thought that leading Democrats are
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.440]  idiots and they're like leading Republicans with that we have one
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.560]  political party in this country in charge is called the repulsak rats the
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:15.440]  repulsak rats all right well I I do appreciate you joining us late but
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:20.000]  thank you for talking to me and I hope to talk to you in Austin someday if you

[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:38.160]  some we'll put some vodka in the milkshake I have no idea well we'll get
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.080]  you drunk the truth serum what is that in Latin that wine makes you tell the
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:46.560]  truth I have no idea you want to have a drinking contest and sell tickets no I
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:53.520]  don't drink but thanks I mean either Vino Veritas have a good one oh my
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:59.440]  goodness oh boy well that's that's the hardcore commie trying to try and it
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.360]  trying to charm us and oh I don't know this so I don't know that I'm sorry I
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  didn't get to Kevin Clint Allen and others and I've really not even plugged
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:11.000]  anything I've got something really exciting to announce we have the super
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.160]  high-quality nutraceutical grade DNA for survival shield x2 nason i9 silver
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.400]  bullet colloidal silver that's a low price for the value it's about ten
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:22.080]  dollars less than leading competitor it's the same silver you have it whole
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.840]  foods just we private label it from the same company and it's about five to ten
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:29.800]  dollars cheaper depending on what sale they have but some of our stuff is higher
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.320]  end because it's so expensive to get some of these compounds so I said I want
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:39.120]  to come out with an entire line of discount but high-quality organic
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:45.720]  concentrated but known ancient defense that's my term type things that are known
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.400]  staples that work that are purified that are strong at the lowest price
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:56.080]  anywhere the leading competitor that's basically almost the same formula use
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:02.280]  $35 it's basically even I'm gonna just be honest with folks it's made the same
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:08.120]  major respected factory laboratory our formula is a little bit different ours
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:13.520]  is 1495 it's ancient defense we did a limited run it was popular a big run

[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:34.080]  available it's normally 1995 that's massively discounted 25% off 1495 in

[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:40.680]  we have Jerome Corsi joining us Dr. Jerome Corsi with huge breaking news
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:44.960]  generals conclude Obama is backing al-Qaeda
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:50.880]  Washington Times how Obama arms al-Qaeda it's a big deal that the
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:56.600]  establishment right wing and then the libertarian arm of the right wing is
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:00.520]  exposing that al-Qaeda has been currently run by the government because
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:02.560]  they're not going to be able to put that genie back in the bottle when
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:06.760]  Republicans get in office this is a victory on every front it's a victory
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.280]  for info wars.com and it's a victory for the military that helped expose this in
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:15.960]  the last three years with us we've got the military we've got we've got the
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:20.640]  Republic we've got the Communist plan on bringing the government down blaming
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.320]  capitalism for what's happened when insider elites did this this is a
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:30.160]  carefully maneuvered program and the left is being crushed right now because
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:33.120]  their program is so evil so they're gotten the border they're gotten the
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:36.640]  energy sources trying to bankrupt us to make us dependent that's why they've got
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.200]  leftist out trying to make contact with the libertarian movement and the and
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.040]  the real paleo-conservative movement to try to neutralize us and trying to
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:52.200]  humanize them and you just got a big dose of that in the last hour a big dose
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.240]  of it because the left knows and the foundations know we are deprogramming
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:01.880]  leftist everywhere they're buying guns their women are actually becoming real
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.280]  women and slinging their power around and they're everybody's having a good
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.920]  time and women are figuring out how to empower their men and men are figuring
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:13.680]  out how to empower their women and be on a damn team against the world against
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:19.240]  the tyrants people are not wanting to gut their kids 76% of them in Gallup of
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.160]  high school students don't want to kill babies it was the opposite in 1974 in
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:30.120]  polls we're winning the culture war and he knows it you are the resistance you
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.320]  have the power we're not gonna fight with the police the military we're gonna
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:38.920]  walk in there and show them history and they're gonna know it they already know
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:43.560]  it we're gonna remind them of it we're not gonna have the civil war if we have
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:49.560]  our way and when the leftist blow up federal buildings and women on us our
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:54.040]  people will be there within minutes to document it and we'll jack you up side
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:59.000]  the head politically and that false flag will blow up in your face we're not
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.920]  playing games humans that want renaissance and empowerment and true
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.240]  libertarian ideas true diversity true classical liberalism of live and let
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:13.720]  live but you don't tell me how to live you don't tell me how to raise my kids
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:19.240]  you don't get all my money you don't run my life you get out of my life
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.880]  worldwide that's what's popular it's always been popular and all you
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:27.560]  collectivists in the big corporations that set you up in power try to turn us
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:33.400]  into dumbasses excuse my French you figured out having a bunch of drooling
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.760]  followers that can't tie their shoelaces and don't know what planet they're on
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:39.840]  you might as well not have followers to begin with because you can't even get
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:47.880]  their lazy butts to go vote for free stuff that's how lazy they are so slowly
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:52.200]  but surely the elite itself that isn't pure evil I'm saying elite that isn't
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.320]  pure evil there is pure evil there but the ones that aren't pure evil are
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:00.280]  realizing this is really a destructive system and it doesn't feel good to them
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:05.920]  inside to be part of a fraud they want to build people up so at the grass roots
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:12.760]  and at the top we're hitting bottom the whole systems beginning culturally hit
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:16.160]  bottom and folks are looking for alternatives and they don't think it
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:20.160]  comes from Shea Guevara the hardcore racist against Hispanics they know it
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:23.400]  doesn't come from aborting their black babies they know it doesn't come from
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.880]  going and beat an old white man over the head with a hammer in st. Louis and the
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:33.120]  media covers it up it doesn't work anymore people want freedom they want
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:38.680]  prosperity they want health they want a future they want goals they want to build
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:44.360]  space colonies and undersea colonies they want to explore when they die they

[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:34.480]  Jerome Carsey joining us coming up now this next report is the first report of
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.600]  several of an investigative in-depth breakdown we also dramatized some of
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:45.880]  how this IBM computer system operates but this came out at nextgov.com that's
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:48.520]  one of the big sites that just tracks government operations government
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:54.520]  contracts got no attention because the big huge things are hidden in plain
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:59.040]  view like flatulence in church no one quite knows where it came from it just
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:03.400]  stinks and then by the time people notice it's all over you move on to the
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:10.080]  next abhorrent activity now we began reporting last year when and everybody
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.520]  saw it on the news it was big national news we covered it as well that they had
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:19.120]  death panels young old male female black white doesn't matter veterans being put
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.600]  on secret death list not being given health care and we told you folks it's
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.200]  system-wide it's it's not just rogue people this is authorized this is how
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.360]  death panels work this is how health care works in Europe you got lung cancer
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:36.360]  it's operable they don't give you surgery you die you got brain cancer it's
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:39.200]  operable you don't get surgery you need a knee worked on they give you pain
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:44.040]  killers Joe Biggs has been trying for years to get health care he's got purple
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:50.760]  hearts the whole nine yards can't get it because he's on a death list Joe Biggs
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:55.820]  has done a report on this we're gonna do other reports on it VA turns to IBM
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:11:00.120]  Watson to improve veteran care they said oh instead of humans deciding how to
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:05.880]  ration care but the VA has a bigger budget all the time we are going to have
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:12.720]  the computer do it well this report gets into that IBM started with race
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.800]  mixing study computers to decide how to control blacks on welfare and how to
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:23.640]  give him a limited amount in New York 1925 then Hitler used the machines
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:28.480]  Watson was one of the biggest hitler supporters he had technicians in the
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:32.320]  death camps running them the machines with the tattoo number you put in them
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.200]  decided how long you were worked what you were fed if you were killed right
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.160]  away they put your measurements your weight into the machine they even call
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:44.280]  the new computer over the vets that will decide who to give care and who not to
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:49.360]  so no humans have to feel bad now on the panels the computer decides so it's
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:55.080]  high-tech who dies so this is a robot killer brain called Watson because I
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.600]  know the public doesn't know how sick this is but the IBM Watson hollereth
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:04.840]  machines what it's called well Watson's back and this time it's gonna decide off
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.720]  your social security number and your military ID when to tap your butt let's
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.440]  go to this video report with Joe Biggs then Anthony Gutiarty joins us with
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:19.120]  breaking news stay with us here is the shocking spread this to everyone we're
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.600]  gonna post the video info wars dot com the next 20 minutes get it out to
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:35.600]  everybody in focus and three two one tonight IBM friend or foe IBM has been
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:41.280]  announced as the winner of a long-term VA contract to modernize the electronic
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:46.560]  health records management system for the embattled VA IBM will utilize the
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:51.800]  latest technologies yeah by up to the minute care for veterans all across this
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:57.120]  great country the VA released a statement we are serious about health of our
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:02.080]  nation's heroes and are sparing no expense to update modernize and create
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:07.400]  an efficient system to diagnose and provide real-time health care solutions
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:12.680]  for those who've served our country we think IBM a company that has a long
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:17.360]  history providing cutting-edge information technology solutions for
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.440]  stepping in providing leadership and experience that will be valuable to our
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  country and save taxpayers money hold on this isn't who we are now give me those
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:36.760]  freaking cue cards man ah you know what you know what's gonna happen with us you
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:41.560]  know what the implications are of this Watson program that's gonna come up it's
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:46.600]  a computer that they're gonna use to replace the doctors at the VA to do the
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:51.640]  death panels that have been going on to help take away human emotion for making
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.400]  those decisions this is something that's got to change this is ridiculous and I'm
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:03.000]  Joe big with info wars calm and I'm not gonna take it anymore I'm standing
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.520]  outside of the Veterans Affairs Center in Austin Texas this will be the
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.960]  proving ground for IBM's brand-new technology Watson now what that is is a
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:17.600]  supercomputer that will have all of your medical records admin records and many
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:22.140]  other things downloaded into it they want to use this machine to replace the
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:26.880]  doctors that have had death panels going on at the VA for years now newly
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:31.680]  released documents expose more explicitly the details of IBM's pivotal role in
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.760]  the Holocaust all six phases identification expulsion from society
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:43.280]  confiscation ghettoization deportation and even extermination moreover the
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:47.560]  documents portray with crystal clarity the personal involvement and micro
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:52.640]  management of IBM president Thomas J. Watson and the company's co-planning and
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:58.240]  co-organizing of Hitler's campaign to destroy the Jews why is the Department of
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:02.920]  Veterans Affairs awarding IBM with a large contract to bring in Watson a new
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:08.000]  technology that will be used to replace doctors in an already failing VA health
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.640]  system why are they naming it after Thomas J. Watson the founder and
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.680]  president of IBM did you know this man was responsible for making the machines
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.120]  that created punch cards with a coding system to label and eventually kill
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:26.240]  thousands of Jews this machine would generate codes to be tattooed on
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:31.000]  prisoners and Hitler's concentration camps this man committed jettisoned by
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.080]  any standard and IBM in the VA want to throw it in our face clear as day and
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:38.840]  name it after that monster if this doesn't piss you off I don't know what
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:43.680]  will Hitler was so impressed with what Watson had done for the third right that
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:47.960]  he awarded him with a special award created specifically for the occasion to
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:52.640]  honor extraordinary service by a foreigner the metal was the order of the
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.200]  German Eagle was star bedecked with schwoznikas and was to be worn on a
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.120]  sash over Watson's cold dead heart why do they want to put a machine in charge
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:05.800]  of your health you might ask yourself they do it so this pre-programmed evil
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:09.800]  robot can make the life or death decisions about you the veteran instead
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.440]  of the doctors that have received so much flak from the VA scandal over the
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:18.000]  last year this helps take human emotions away and also allows the medical
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.680]  personnel to use Watson as a scapegoat should any problems arise like death
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:28.160]  Watson will be a new form of medical AI technology used to run the death panels
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:33.120]  already in place at the VA how soon will it be until this technology moves over
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:37.720]  into civilian health care will you be a victim of Watson's wrath this is also
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:41.720]  happening in another area of the government they now want to replace
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:46.920]  humans at fly drones and making fully autonomous and many pilots were also
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:51.480]  claiming PTSD what you take the human aspect out of dealing with health care
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:55.600]  and war things become even more evil who is going to check the morals of the
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:59.600]  men and women who program these machines how do we know the machines will be
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.880]  told to act ethical and make the right decisions well there you have it that is
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.400]  the new Watson technology that's going to run the death panels at the already
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:12.480]  failing VA health care system now I have a vision of how this Watson technology
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:24.960]  will be implemented when you walk into the VA let's go in here and take a look
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:27.960]  next
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:39.200]  you're a radio listener they barcode them take them in and basically
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:45.200]  disintegrate them all right Watson is determined to use that in the medical
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:49.720]  chamber so go ahead but instead they just let you go home and die so it's
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:55.320]  okay but they're actually vaporizing you people get up in arms these are death
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:02.880]  panels but we care about our veterans so much
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.120]  you actually looks like one of those hippie grizzly Adams type doctors they
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:12.320]  have that when they exterminate everybody I'm joking
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:22.000]  all right that report is powerful Joe Biggs has been here less than a year
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.960]  he's doing a fabulous job and that's what it is it's a computer to decide how
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:31.280]  to ration care and under Obamacare now computers are telling doctors everywhere
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:35.400]  even into smaller clinics what they can and can't do I mean this is getting
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.080]  humans out of the decision-making process already the drones are converting
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:43.000]  to autonomous where they're just programmed and humans aren't involved
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.880]  oh humans have a problem killing people with the drones we'll just get humans
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:50.920]  out of there we're building a world where we're not needed and the globalists
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.240]  admit that's the plan it's not just hey we can see where this goes it's dangerous
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:01.600]  it's a plan that video is going up on info wars.com in the next 15 minutes or

[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:22.640]  actor that plays the seven-foot tall bipedal gorilla creature that is more
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:27.520]  real than Barack Obama saying he wants to save the middle class in his stupid
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:31.920]  speech coming up tonight Anthony go over these headlines I mean last year was a
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:35.320]  record bad of mystery illness and deaths now it's even worse we had Dr. Group
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:39.600]  Emily the mainline headlines that the flu and other mystery illnesses are tied
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:43.240]  directly to the flu vaccine and they admit again doesn't protect you like
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:47.320]  every year but the idiots go out and get the shot Anthony Gutiarty. Last year we
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:50.200]  know there was a lot of mystery illness and I do want to talk about pneumonia
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:53.280]  because it affected you personally in effect I had it as well but it affected
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:58.200]  your family and everything took me until I did heroic amounts of silver I couldn't get rid of it yeah you
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:01.720]  know it for me it was I didn't even full-fledged get it I felt it coming on
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:04.840]  I felt the sickness happening and I knew what to do right away to stop it with
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:08.840]  silver and everything like that you were guzzling silver yes but so this year is
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:14.320]  on record now one of the worst in recent history if not the worst and if we
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.560]  look at the flu charts it's just off the record off the charts Austin Dallas you
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:23.280]  name it all of Texas it's always hitting the south in Texas it's hitting
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:26.720]  everywhere but what's interesting is they lump all of these different illnesses
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:30.560]  in to what they categorize as the flu so it could also be a bunch of other
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.760]  things a bunch of mystery illnesses and then everyone goes out and they get
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:37.080]  their flu shot for the flu and for whatever they have even for pneumonia
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:40.360]  then that lowers immunity and the regular flu spray exactly and my thing
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:46.960]  here is that MSNBC morning Joe this is their post your their featured post
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.920]  your 2015 flu shot probably isn't working this year's flu vaccine is only
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:57.080]  23% effective and that by the way the 23% number is from the blogs like WebMD
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:00.360]  that are heavily subject by the way that's because some people are getting a
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:04.400]  type of flu but a different variant of one of the ones that covers but it
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:08.720]  doesn't even cover that because it's not the right mutation it's bull on top of
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:13.760]  bull it never works ever and this is just mainline WebMD big pharma back
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:17.240]  numbers saying it's 23% effective which is still garbage and then of course it
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:22.160]  has antibiotics and hormones and just pig feces and stuff like that but anyway
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:25.600]  why are you racist against pig feces I am racist against pig feces and I do not
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  want to inject it in my bloodstream along with antibiotics call the Southern
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.880]  Poverty Law Center in ADL he does not want to have pig crap injected into it and
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.640]  I actually have four dead fetal cells now you're against killing babies even
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:39.640]  more racist you know what's the most racist though is I'm gonna offer
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:43.640]  solutions I'm gonna oh no don't do that seriously folks we've had this
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:49.880]  for three months in a limited supply we are doing again a discounted type
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:53.600]  product line called right side that Anthony and I and Dr. Griffin others
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.360]  came up with and this is well-known ancient defense herbal immunity complex
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:04.240]  that is well-known ancient herbs purified organic concentrated but we cut
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:08.880]  out the ones that are super expensive so it's affordable the similar formula is
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:14.880]  up to $39.35 when it's discounted this is $19.95 but out of the gates we're
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:19.960]  offering ancient defense for two weeks or while supplies last for $14.95 no one
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.240]  can offer something like that it is a big bottle of it I've been giving it to
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:27.760]  my children every day I've been taking it every day amazing haven't got sick yet
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:32.040]  Anthony tell folks what's in ancient defense and if you're gonna get this at
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:36.320]  a brick and mortar store like Whole Foods it would be easily $60 so what we do is
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:39.160]  we source the highest quality and we're being we're being conservative when we
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:43.040]  say 35 to 40 yes we bring it in we sell it at the lowest possible prices you
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:47.120]  actually wanted to discount it before we went on air today from $19.95 to $14.95
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:51.520]  that was already a really good deal yes I just said no I want to give people the
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:54.440]  very best deal because it's good karma it's good mojo I'm obsessed with that
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.840]  because it absolutely works it's true and I'm not doing it for the right reason
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:02.120]  to I want people to get this and and to battle against all this garbage is out
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:05.840]  there well that's why we called it right side so in in my mind and as we talked
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:09.000]  about you know there's there's two ways you can approach your health there is
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.080]  the right side so good organic based healing yourself and then there's of
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:16.680]  course going in and getting injected with hormones and antibiotics and you
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:19.560]  know we're not saying that these two are comparable in same level it's totally
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:22.560]  different you're taking your health into your own hands with this this is being
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.640]  on the right side of your health I do want to go through some studies we have
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.600]  some time here because they're really powerful there's 400 different pieces
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:33.480]  from PubMed which is the National Library of Medicine from Congress that
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:36.120]  are showing some of the ingredients that we've used in cultivated this is
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:39.720]  concentrated elderberry ginger root echinacea that's only three of how many
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:44.280]  ingredients numerous there's like 20 what we did is we've we've refactored
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:46.880]  manufacturers so many different times with these formulas we've gone back and
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:51.240]  forth like what 35 times now and found the best because we could find certain
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:54.320]  organic ingredients and let's say they're from India right and they're super
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:58.000]  clean ultra pure tested and we'd say well that would make it $50 right and we
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.200]  find something comparable that's just as good with all the research from PubMed
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:05.360]  and that's why we've made such a yeah this is a discount brand line we're
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.160]  coming out with I mean take DNA force it's a super
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:13.200]  neutral medical at about a third the price it should be comparables or 600
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:17.880]  bucks this is 140 or our nascent iodine's already pretty discounted but
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:23.400]  it's 29.95 I mean we're just coming out with a discount line that is the very
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:26.720]  best stuff we can get for the price and that has incredible bang for the buck

[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:52.840]  this could bring down the system the military concludes in this article with
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:57.760]  sources that there's basically a coup in the government and they're actually
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:02.560]  planning to turn much of the world over to radical Islamists with Saudi Arabia
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:08.920]  and we know this is happening through Kenya it's just unbelievable we're

[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:35.240]  important articles he's ever done in my view is on the site generals conclude
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:39.680]  Obama backed al-Qaeda he's been to Kenya he's been to Egypt everything he's been
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.480]  saying here for years keeps coming out mainstream news Washington Times says
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:47.680]  how Obama arms al-Qaeda so this is really starting to come out but what the
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.000]  high-level brass and former brass are saying and ambassadors and others are
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.960]  saying is that this appears to be a complete realignment so to break this
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:00.440]  down is Dr. Corsi you've got the floor surf the next 14 minutes before we got
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:04.120]  a break please give us a special report on what's happening please give us a
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.960]  briefing well Alex I've been interviewing a lot of the members of
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:14.360]  this citizens commission on Benghazi which include really top admirals and
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:18.920]  generals who are very aware and some of them involved in the situation in
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:27.880]  Benghazi when the attack was occurring on 9-11 in 2012 what is the case is they
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:34.920]  proved that a decision was made by the Obama administration really about 2011
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:39.800]  at March 2011 that we were going to switch sides in the war on terror and
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:46.520]  that we were are going to we're going to have supported the al-Qaeda affiliated
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:52.480]  militia in Libya that we know to be under the political control the Muslim
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:57.320]  Brotherhood and that we in fact and I detail in the article the evidence that
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:04.520]  supports this established Christopher Stevens as our first envoy to al-Qaeda
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:09.920]  and his mission what he was doing in al-Qaeda was running a fast and furious
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:15.560]  gun operation bringing weapons in from Eastern Europe through Qatar and getting
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:22.520]  them into the al-Qaeda affiliated militia in Libya in order to overthrow
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:28.360]  Qaddafi I mean that's remarkable we were funding providing weapons to
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:35.760]  established Benghazi as our special diplomatic compound operating posts
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:41.200]  right next to the CIA annex from which Ambassador Chris Stevens before he was
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:46.880]  ambassador he came in a cargo ship this is 2011 was running guns unbeknownst to
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:52.320]  the American people into our new allies which are the al-Qaeda militia in Libya
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:56.840]  that was the Obama administration decision and the policy follows from there
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:02.480]  it's fundamental that listeners understand that Obama changed sides in the
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:08.520]  war on terror and decided that we would ally with al-Qaeda to bring down Qaddafi
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:14.320]  in Libya I'm it's shocking to be absolutely honest with you it's shocking
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:19.400]  now you could talk for 10 hours on this but condensing it down you had this
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.160]  intel years ago I confirmed it with Colonel Shafer and others on the inside
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:28.480]  that have been in Congress in these briefings that are classified that your
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:34.160]  analysis is dead on they know that 95% of the fighters in Syria are al-Qaeda so
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:38.120]  they had him change the name to ISIS to confuse the public from your intel is
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:44.600]  this really a another bait and switch now where they claim that the US and
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:50.560]  NATO and Turkey are allied with Iran against Saudi Arabia at al-Qaeda or is
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.080]  it another double-cross where they're really still arming al-Qaeda as the
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:59.200]  Iraqi government is saying they've caught him doing because every indicator I
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:03.680]  see is they're attempting to look like they're doing both but that they're not
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:08.360]  really engaged in real strikes against al-Qaeda and that this is a triple cross
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:14.640]  well in the series of stories that I'm writing I've interviewed former CIA
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:20.640]  operatives who make it clear that we're playing both sides we're playing both
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:26.840]  encouraging Iran to enter as our supposed allies to defeat ISIS while the
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:31.280]  same time what Christopher Stevens was doing at the time of his death was
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:39.360]  diverting weapons from Libya through Turkey to al-Qaeda groups are fighting
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:44.880]  Assad many of those al-Qaeda groups became ISIS this fundamental understand
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:51.080]  that we in a sense created ISIS and provided the weaponry and the funding
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:58.320]  through Libya in order to keep ISIS going to have them grow and now we're
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.280]  encouraging Iran to come into the conflict to defeat ISIS I mean the CIA
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:09.400]  playing both sides against the middle but in this Obama has gone completely on
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:15.280]  to the other side he's now supporting al-Qaeda he's supporting the Muslim
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:21.440]  Brotherhood he's supporting the Shiites in Iran even though they're developing
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:26.040]  nuclear weapons that they could potentially use against Israel okay so
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:31.320]  to be clear what you're getting at is our enemies I understand so so it's not
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:34.960]  he's either on the side of the Wahhabist or he's on the side of the Shiites are
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:40.080]  you saying that beneath the surface this is really allying with the Muslims
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.440]  period whether they be Shiite or Sunni and that this is a master plan to turn
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:50.080]  Africa the Middle East and much of Central Asia over to them into a radical
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.240]  Islamic hotbed that's correct I agree with that that's what I'm saying so they
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:58.200]  don't care now it's fun to everybody who's radical we're not we're no longer
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:04.480]  fighting radical Islamic terrorism we're funding it and arming it and is that why
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:09.080]  starting in 2011 big sis came out and said aren't we're no longer worried
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:12.920]  about Islamic terror we're only focused on tea party and gun owners right
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:16.480]  because they've the White House has abandoned the idea that there is Islamic
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:22.160]  terror except maybe for some hotheads that do it you know a deed that becomes a
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.680]  little bit too obnoxious so Obama wants to be able to distance himself from the
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:31.360]  particular ones he doesn't like but we're still supporting radical Islamic
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:36.120]  terrorism and the administration will not say our enemy is radical Islamic
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:41.160]  extremism well I had a mod salamon is a big FBI informant former colonel in the
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:44.320]  Egyptian military very respected even the New York Times says his credentials
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:48.800]  are impeccable he said your analysis is dead on and that from his sources in
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:53.160]  intelligence they're totally freaked out in Egypt that our government is trying
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:57.680]  to overthrow Egypt and he stabilized the whole Middle East he said exactly what
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:02.120]  you just said you quote you quote high-level officers in your article
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:07.200]  concurring this is really scary then you add that with the war on brass that
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:13.120]  aren't traders what's the master in game out of this a and b how is it going for
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:17.720]  them then in this in this turn the world over to radical Muslims operation
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:21.760]  well I'm only partway through the series of articles but what I'm gonna
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:25.640]  develop and have been developing is that Obama has completely switched we are
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:31.640]  now embracing radical Islamic terrorism we're destabilizing all of North Africa
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:39.120]  we're destabilizing Iraq we're allowing Iran to come into influence in Iraq this
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:42.200]  is extending over to Hezbollah I mean soon I think you're gonna find a
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:47.360]  regional war involving Hezbollah even potentially Hezbollah joining with Iran
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:51.040]  against Israel this could all you now see France and others lining up against
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:54.840]  Israel and even if people don't say well France will not support Israel France
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:58.240]  will be on the side of the radical Islamic terrorists too I mean they're
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:05.880]  appeasing right now France is the radical Islamists and Obama is at the
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:10.640]  center of this duplicity because he's not come out and told the American people
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:16.320]  that we've al-Qaeda is no longer our enemy we're sided with al-Qaeda we've
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:21.400]  funded al-Qaeda we've armed al-Qaeda this is what Chris Stevens was doing this
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:27.880]  was the whole plan we we supported the Muslim Brotherhood LCC in Egypt right
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.840]  now as soon as he came into power Obama quit funding him Obama you know LCC
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:38.560]  has called out Obama and said Obama has supported the Muslim Brotherhood which
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:43.800]  is a going back to World War two and I see motherhood not signed with Hitler
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:47.520]  they've been a radical Islamic destabilizing force determined to
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:53.640]  destroy Israel and then to destroy the United States and our White House are
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:59.440]  you know his our CIA our State Department under Hillary Clinton I've all
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:04.560]  embraced supporting al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood by the way Dr. Corsi
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:08.080]  I would hear you say this you weren't going this far six years ago because it
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.960]  hadn't happened yet but you were warning of this and I would debate you and say
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:15.360]  come on they want to get radicalism out of controls and excuse to have no bid
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:19.800]  contracts and keep some wars going but no you were right this is a plan to turn
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.440]  it loose and to take over much of the world and anybody that stands in the
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:26.480]  way of it is attacked but let me I criticize some of the elements in Israel
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.480]  I'm not an Israel first year I'm an American I don't like some of the lobbying
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:33.360]  Israel does here in the US I don't like any country doing that I don't like
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:38.600]  China doing that telling Hollywood what to do but that said think about really
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:42.200]  putting radical Muslims in charge to overthrow every moderate government and
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.120]  Assad's moderate compared to them or Egypt's moderate compared what is the
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:54.040]  point it's so evil to be backing these people and so bold and then you pull back
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:46:00.480]  Israel has been supporting in the Golan Heights some of the Syrian army the
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:05.040]  Free Syrian army as well so even Israel to a certain extent has been going along
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:10.400]  with this I mean how do you square that I mean this is bizarre well you you
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.880]  first of all you can't make deals with radical Islam and have it turn out the
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:18.960]  way you wanted to turn out they have their own agenda their own agenda is
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:24.480]  basically a totalitarian political object objective to crush everyone all
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:30.600]  of the religions and take over the world for radical Islam and sharia law and
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:36.000]  what we're going to find what you see my article tomorrow I've just completed it
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.240]  today is going to be that we rejected the Obama White House and the Hillary
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:46.680]  Clinton State Department move you had in in Libya Qaddafi was ready to
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:52.680]  abdicate and the good negotiations were going on for him that's right and the
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:58.520]  Obama White House said no and within days Obama signed an order authorized in
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:07.720]  the CIA to support and fund an arm the al Qaeda affiliated militia in Libya
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:11.360]  knowing that they were Muslim Brotherhood controlled politically and
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:14.040]  you're getting this from high-level military sources if you go back to the
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:18.120]  time he'd invested billions in France the word was he was planning to move to
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:22.560]  France a really smart move he let Western governments in their answer was
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.240]  double-crossing put al Qaeda in and now they admit Libya is a totally failed
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:30.280]  state and is now a jihad center to invade all of Africa and I've been in
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:34.720]  touch for years with the you know the tribal leaders who have left Libya and
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:37.440]  are trying to get the country back they're working out of Egypt I've been
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:40.720]  reporting on them the Libya has been totally
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:47.200]  destabilized it's been controlled right now by warring militias that are al
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:51.760]  Qaeda dominated Muslim Brotherhood is in there the tribes are trying to win back
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:55.320]  their freedom they're trying to get their country back let's be clear the
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:59.360]  indigenous people are working with Egyptian intelligence yeah try to kick
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.320]  al Qaeda out and our government supporting them I mean that is so evil so
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:08.160]  what we're doing we're supporting the bad guy we're supporting al Qaeda we are
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.440]  supporting the Muslim Brotherhood we are arming the Muslim Brotherhood in al
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:16.800]  Qaeda we're destabilizing all the Middle East where we're overthrowing stable
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:23.160]  maybe evil but stable leaders like Mubarak in Egypt in favor of Morsi
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:28.160]  mother Muslim Brotherhood in favor of what do you know deposing Qaddafi and
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:34.760]  putting in force for these Muslim radical jihadists militia that are al Qaeda
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:41.440]  dominated operating in Libya under the al Qaeda flag we are al Qaeda in the White
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:46.200]  House and the State Department Hillary Clinton Barack Obama are al Qaeda in
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:50.960]  Libya how is it going for them how is Obama doing what do you expect them to
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:55.160]  pull next one thing is a disaster I mean the whole thing is just a complete
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:49:02.880]  chaos it's just it's degenerating into a massive chaos I'm not sure though the
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:06.080]  next thing is I'm going to be reporting which I think you're going to find you
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:11.480]  also I'm also documenting the Muslim Brotherhood in dominance and movement
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:15.880]  into the US government I mean that policy levels in the White House this is
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:20.720]  not a small movement it's been going on since Obama was elected Obama's I
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:25.920]  pointed out when I wrote the Obamination back in 2008 when Obama first came on
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:30.280]  the scene he was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the radical
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:34.840]  jihadists in Chicago this is a revolution open the borders flood us I
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:39.000]  mean this is the communist roots I just can't believe that the establishment is
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.600]  backing this this is extremely dangerous if I was a top billionaire I mean I
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:47.080]  wouldn't want to do this this would endanger my wealth my children I mean
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.240]  this is this is this is the leader in control of the West and they're breaking
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.400]  it because they hate the Renaissance values their totalitarian instincts are
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:59.080]  insane about the coursing yeah they would like the 14th century returned and
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:05.280]  the you know the information I'm getting now increasingly is the group of generals
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:10.280]  the admirals the intelligence people the former special forces people who are
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:16.040]  trying to bring to the American people the duplicity if not outright treason of
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:20.600]  the White House and Hillary Clinton in not explaining the American people that
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:25.080]  we switched sides in the war on terror and joined the bad guys we became al-qaeda

[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:10.920]  hi folks I'm probably a little bit of overdrive here so we can finish up this
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:15.000]  report with Anthony Gucciardi because it's so important and I just promote the
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:20.000]  cell what I believe in I personally don't take the flu shot so I then go out
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:23.480]  and try to boost my immune system and my children's immune system to deal with it
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:27.440]  and the pneumonia and other viruses under bacteria I try to stay out of
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:32.800]  hospitals if I do go to a clinic I want to go to new clean ones so that I don't
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:36.480]  get you know sick from sick people this comes from physicians advice by the way
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:42.560]  just briefly finishing up the last talk the larger geopolitical strategy of the
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:46.880]  central banks is to build up radical Islam turn it loose let it take over a
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.680]  lot of the world then battle it on the fringes to consolidate power and take
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:56.040]  liberties here on the fringes of the Islamic radical jihad empire that
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:59.840]  really is happening I didn't believe it I was wrong it's something I didn't
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:04.000]  foresee I couldn't believe the elite were that unstable I mean I knew they
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:08.400]  would toy with it build up some grips but they're really going offensively
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:13.520]  they're gonna hold the West hostage with the Stinger missiles you name it because
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:17.160]  the globalists couldn't even beat the jihadis they helped create an Iraq and
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:21.240]  in Pakistan and had drones bombing them that they knew was actually getting them
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:26.560]  recruits they were building up this giant army of resentment to actually give
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:32.760]  them part of the world and just like Hitler and Stalin divided Poland or the
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  Warsaw Pact I mean they are just they are just dividing different parts of the
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.400]  world right now and when they're done there'll be a bunch of new wars a lot of
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:44.640]  liberties lost a lot of veterans their arms and legs blown off really makes me
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:51.400]  sick but when we came out with ancient defense herbal immunity complex again I
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:55.640]  said I want a line of things or my goodness we got but we buy such
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:59.760]  incredibly high quality products such exotic stuff some of this stuff's high
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:04.600]  end aren't there a lot of things that are just staples that we can get high
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:09.640]  quality concentrate and then discount to give people a low-cost alternative we
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:14.320]  have this newscast with a nurse we'll play a clip saying all the flu shot
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:18.360]  doesn't help you but go ahead and get one now that's admitted from the CDC as
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:23.560]  well but this is the cult like attitude it doesn't help you in fact it lowers
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:28.360]  your immunity and lets you get the regular flu three flu shots doubles your
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:33.120]  chances of getting Alzheimer's that's a major study this isn't a game let's go
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:36.840]  ahead and go to this newscast clip here it is
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:44.600]  strain H3N2 which does not happen to being an exact match to the
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:49.000]  immunization now having said that it still is important to get the
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:54.640]  immunization for a number of reasons the immunity that you build from the shot
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:58.880]  there is some cross-protection even though it's not an exact match of horse
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:06.800]  crap that's on KOTA news and so now it's not an exact match but no it doesn't
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:14.040]  help you it has to be an exact match they've never done it it's pure malarkey
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:18.440]  but these nurses are forced to take it so I guess now she's a virologist don't
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:21.360]  we've interviewed the virologist and the epidemiologist she's gonna tell us
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:25.280]  what to believe she's gonna she looks like she's taking a few herself Anthony
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.200]  you already tell us about the studies and give us your take on that it's funny
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:31.280]  we were just talking about al-qaeda al-qaeda because this ties into it
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:34.680]  we're dealing with a government that armed the Syrian rebels that went
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:38.200]  around killing Christians just cutting their heads off in public hundreds of
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:42.680]  thousands screaming literally bathing in their blood eating hearts and Obama
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:48.520]  Reuters reported this was doing it by executive order since 2011 and before
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:52.000]  that before they even released it and started justifying it knowing that these
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.800]  weapons were doing that they started the war public squares decapitating 20 plus
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:59.800]  Christmas Christians bathing in their blood on a jihad to kill all of them
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:04.800]  that is what we're supporting and then we wonder why our government isn't
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:09.280]  telling us about natural alternatives for the flu we're wondering why they're
[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:12.720]  pushing the vaccine on us this government many elements of it obviously
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.360]  there's various elements when you go to the low level you're not going to
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:19.320]  experience government hates us not care about us and in fact hates us so it's up
[02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:22.680]  to us to control our own health and to look at these studies I mean why would
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:26.640]  they they you know push down these studies such as elderberry significantly

[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:00.920]  transmission Anthony good shard you got the floor go over these studies and
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:05.120]  yeah we're here pitching ancient defense herbal immunity complex discounted
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:11.160]  Cadillac quality for pent up prices 1495 introductory price this is what I'm
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:15.040]  taking to get a leg up against all this garbage and haven't gotten sick so far
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:18.920]  because it's stuff in here is all backed by these studies go ahead Anthony we live
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:22.640]  in a world where natural research is extremely suppressed we live in a
[03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:25.920]  world where even though the things I'm referencing by the way are from a
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.520]  website green med info and all they do is take the National Library of Medicine
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:34.360]  studies from PubMed the biggest library medicine in the whole world that
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.800]  doctors reference every single day they take it and they put it in a easy to
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:40.480]  digest format it would take hours and hours and hours and days to actually
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:43.440]  find the stuff so for example when we type in some of these ingredients that
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:47.960]  are in ancient defense shots such as elderberry and ginger we find these
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:51.240]  amazing studies such as the fact that elderberry is actually crushing the flu
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:55.280]  it's reducing the duration of its infection it's stopping its infection
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:59.080]  it's a effective treatment they're saying for influenza A and B and this
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:04.760]  isn't us saying this this is as far back as 1995 was the study they found that it
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:07.960]  was a safe and effective treatment for influenza A and B and we're got a
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:13.480]  connoisseur it's got bayberry bark it's got elderberry fruit it's got I can't
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:16.500]  even go over all the stuff over 20 different ingredients including a
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:21.000]  proprietary blend of different herbs inside of a specific formula where we
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:24.480]  took a bunch of different extracts we put it in various doses that's the
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:27.760]  proprietary nature of it we didn't patent it because then everyone else would
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:30.920]  know what to do when you patent something you have to make it available so
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:34.600]  that others you know could take less quality versions of this product we
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:38.680]  made proprietary so it's a it's a secret process that we use to keep it very
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:42.580]  cut low cost at 1495 but also super high quality and we looked at all these we
[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:46.480]  looked at this evidence I mean if you look at it there's 54 pieces of research
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:50.640]  just for elderberry and we're using the top certified organic laboratory
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:55.040]  factories in the country going to the biggest best oh absolutely this this
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:58.000]  comes out obviously we know we're a target of the FDA and everybody else
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:02.840]  yes exactly we go to neurotic levels I mean look most nutritional
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:07.880]  nutraceutical manufacturers would come on here and say a lot more okay they
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:11.360]  would say the truth they would say a lot more but we know we're an FDA target
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:14.240]  that's why we're just sitting here reading these studies that are coming
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:19.040]  from PubMed on these ingredients and telling you since 1995 they said that
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:21.840]  elderberry appears to be a safe and effective treatment for influenza A and
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:25.280]  B we're not making any claims we're saying this is what the studies what kind
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:28.560]  of freedom we have in this country we're simply here saying the flu shot
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.820]  doesn't work they admit it here's what the studies admit helps you exactly it's
[03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:36.680]  like we can't even say this anymore that the flu shot doesn't work in elderberry
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:39.600]  is being suppressed completely when there's studies showing that it actually
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:43.520]  suppresses the flu and of course in a real rational world we wouldn't arm
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:48.200]  al-qaeda and we would fund research about how a natural plant well when you go
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:51.440]  to the pediatrician now they do say get elderberry this winter I mean the good
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:54.520]  do just medical doctors are because those doctors are usually good people we
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:57.760]  both know a bunch of doctors you know on a friendship level and they say hey
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:01.760]  we're starting to realize this such as the microbiome if your immune system
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:07.160]  produces the right hormone related chemicals you can pretty much stop any
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:11.280]  virus from getting in your body but what happens though it's the lectins that
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:14.480]  you make but what happens is your immune system and your microbiome which is
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:18.880]  your biotic dome essentially your gut your bacteria your good and bad
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:22.280]  bacteria if that gets out of whack your immune system get out gets out of whack
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:25.760]  you're susceptible to anything that's why you know what I want to apologize
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:29.000]  today for getting you on and then I had course you on and played those
