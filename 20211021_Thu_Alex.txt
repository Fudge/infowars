[00:00.000 --> 00:10.800]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.800 --> 00:18.400]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.400 --> 00:43.200]  The lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:43.200 --> 00:49.880]  Everywhere you turn, signs of neo feudalism fueled by the great reset are rising up from
[00:49.880 --> 00:51.400]  the higher levels.
[00:51.400 --> 00:54.320]  It is just a game and they are all working together.
[00:54.320 --> 00:59.520]  At some point, I was invited, which is why I'm telling you all this, to participate
[00:59.520 --> 01:02.960]  in sacrifices.
[01:02.960 --> 01:05.000]  That was the breaking point.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.840]  Whether it's Hungarian billionaire George Soros meddling in local elections in Austin,
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.680]  Texas as the murder rate hits historic highs.
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.400]  This intersection of Sixth and Nueces is one of two deadly scenes called into police within
[01:19.400 --> 01:21.600]  just minutes of each other this weekend.
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.720]  A stabbing here and a shooting on North Lamar marked the 59th and 60th homicides of this
[01:27.720 --> 01:29.220]  year in Austin.
[01:29.220 --> 01:33.960]  That's the highest number ever recorded in modern history here.
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.320]  Nationally known left-wing activist George Soros has joined the fight over the Proposition
[01:38.320 --> 01:42.000]  A ballot measure Austin voters will decide on this November.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.800]  The billionaire contributed $500,000 through the Open Society Policy Center Organization
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.920]  to the Equity Political Action Committee's No Way on Prop A campaign.
[01:51.920 --> 01:56.840]  I would hate for someone's out of state money to diminish the voices of people that lived
[01:56.840 --> 01:57.840]  here.
[01:57.840 --> 02:03.720]  Or California Governor Gavin Newsom's insane ban on gas-powered lawnmowers, chainsaws and
[02:03.720 --> 02:10.200]  leaf blowers to appease the architects of the coming climate change totalitarianism.
[02:10.200 --> 02:12.280]  I don't know of a battery-powered rototiller.
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.400]  I don't know of a chainsaw larger than a 20-inch bar that's battery-powered.
[02:17.400 --> 02:23.080]  So I'm not quite sure how Cal Fire and some of those type of things are gonna go out there
[02:23.080 --> 02:26.640]  and mitigate fires when they have to have battery-powered products.
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.160]  New this morning, gas-powered generators could be a thing of the past if the governor signs
[02:31.160 --> 02:32.840]  a new bill into law.
[02:32.840 --> 02:38.000]  Not only would Assembly Bill 1346 phase out those generators, but it would also get rid
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.760]  of machines like gas-powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers.
[02:42.760 --> 02:46.480]  The authors of this bill say that equipment puts out too much air pollution.
[02:46.480 --> 02:53.240]  Or the enforcement of that totalitarianism fueled by the rise of machines, as the Special
[02:53.240 --> 03:01.840]  Purpose Unmanned Rifle, or SPUR, is basically a robot dog armed with a rifle on its back.
[03:01.840 --> 03:10.680]  Those rifles come in calibers such as 7.6251 mm, 6.5 mm Creedmoor, 300 Norma Magnum, 338
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.040]  Lapua Magnum, and 338 Norma Magnum.
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.880]  Meanwhile, the military behind the Terminator dogs is purging thousands of soldiers who
[03:19.880 --> 03:24.800]  refuse the New World Order inoculation of the COVID vaccine.
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.400]  So tonight, a new study on the COVID-19 vaccines found more cases of heart inflammation than
[03:29.400 --> 03:32.480]  expected among members of our U.S. military.
[03:32.480 --> 03:35.120]  It is raising questions about the role of exercise.
[03:35.120 --> 03:40.880]  The military administered 2.8 million doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.
[03:40.880 --> 03:46.640]  A new study describes how 23 service members later developed chest pain and sought medical
[03:46.640 --> 03:48.040]  attention.
[03:48.040 --> 03:50.840]  Tests showed it was myocarditis.
[03:50.840 --> 03:56.880]  And as the gender war rages on against our children in what's left of toy stores in
[03:56.880 --> 04:03.040]  America, these large stores have to also show a reasonable selection of products regardless
[04:03.040 --> 04:06.800]  of whether they've been traditionally marketed for either girls or boys.
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.000]  The World Economic Forum states their goals and ultimately the goals of the Democratic
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.200]  Party on their own website, predicting the total collapse of the West, the end to all
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.720]  private ownership of everything, the end of meat production, and the installment of
[04:24.720 --> 04:27.520]  a global carbon tax.
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.080]  This means the death of the United States as a global power.
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.000]  The solution is simple.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.680]  Stop complying.
[04:36.680 --> 04:46.240]  This is Darren McBreen for John Bowne.
[04:46.240 --> 04:53.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this worldwide broadcast.
[04:53.240 --> 04:58.400]  And we've got the biggest news yet again in the shaga with COVID-19 when we come right
[04:58.400 --> 05:01.640]  back in 60 seconds.
[05:01.640 --> 05:07.800]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part
[05:07.800 --> 05:14.560]  of the same satanic, globalist, control-free system that seeks to play God, that seeks
[05:14.560 --> 05:21.000]  to turn the general population of this earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.880]  their hands that they control.
[05:23.880 --> 05:28.480]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high-quality vitamins and
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.800]  minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[05:31.800 --> 05:37.240]  And so the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist
[05:37.240 --> 05:38.240]  takeover.
[05:38.240 --> 05:41.920]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[05:41.920 --> 05:45.960]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high-quality water
[05:45.960 --> 05:51.240]  filtration at infowarstore.com and with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back
[05:51.240 --> 05:56.600]  in the stock, like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, now 40% off for a limited time at
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.600]  infowarstore.com.
[05:57.600 --> 06:02.600]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[06:02.600 --> 06:14.920]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:14.920 --> 06:15.920]  Do you want answers?
[06:15.920 --> 06:16.920]  Well, so does he.
[06:16.920 --> 06:24.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.920 --> 06:36.200]  Well, I've been watching, and I've been waiting, knowing this time was coming, and now I'm
[06:36.200 --> 06:43.200]  going into full launch mode.
[06:43.200 --> 06:52.280]  Globalists are scared, scared of me, scared of you, scared of human potential, scared
[06:52.280 --> 07:01.680]  of us getting a line with a big guy, and coming in for the next launch.
[07:01.680 --> 07:04.920]  Woo!
[07:04.920 --> 07:10.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not an info wars headline.
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.600]  This is not a zero hedge headline, it's not a Tucker Carlson headline.
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.440]  It's not a Joe Rogan headline.
[07:19.440 --> 07:25.240]  It is Associated Press, MSNBC, MSM, they're having to admit it all.
[07:25.240 --> 07:36.640]  The rats are leaving, the sinking ship, here's the headlines, this is from MSM.com, NIH admits
[07:36.640 --> 07:42.040]  Fauci lied about funding Wuhan gain of function experiments.
[07:42.040 --> 07:51.280]  He didn't just lie about it, he lied in front of everybody's face.
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.600]  He lied over and over again.
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.920]  He had a whole bunch of conferences called in favor of gain and function, and why gain
[07:57.920 --> 08:04.640]  and function safe, and then funded this specific COVID-19 virus under another name, and we've
[08:04.640 --> 08:07.520]  got the genetic scan of it, it's the same virus.
[08:07.520 --> 08:12.240]  And then proposed releasing it in the open air of China, and the Pentagon said, are you
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.240]  insane?
[08:13.240 --> 08:18.520]  Well, yeah, they were going to set the U.S. up, and the Chinese up, into a war.
[08:18.520 --> 08:23.080]  We now know.
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.200]  That was phase two, phase one was shut down the west, and in power China, if China played
[08:28.200 --> 08:33.120]  ball, but China's not playing ball and didn't come and agree with the whole conspiracy,
[08:33.120 --> 08:36.000]  so then the global asserted blaming China for it.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.600]  A lot of us looked at that and said it was certainly a possibility, but now we have all
[08:40.600 --> 08:49.640]  the documents from the NIH, from the FDA, from Peter Dazsik's organization, and we know
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.840]  exactly what they did and how they did it.
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.840]  Bill Gates was in charge of it, and that's why you've seen Bill Gates not out in public
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.160]  a lot lately, because they've told him he better shut his mouth, because this plan did
[09:05.160 --> 09:07.080]  not go as well as they thought.
[09:07.080 --> 09:10.240]  The problem is, they're still going to double down, and we better have a discussion about
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.960]  that, because this is not about celebrating that we were proven completely right again.
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.480]  You know what the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start celebrating until we've got
[09:18.480 --> 09:21.000]  all this taken care of.
[09:21.000 --> 09:29.800]  Then we can do all that later, but just take a deep breath right now and realize the historical
[09:29.800 --> 09:30.800]  moment we're all in.
[09:30.800 --> 09:31.800]  Look at these headlines.
[09:31.800 --> 09:33.800]  And I've got the NIH letter.
[09:33.800 --> 09:39.440]  Of course, the NIH directed all this through Peter Dazsik's organization so that they would
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.520]  have, again, more go-betweens with illegal activity, and then they had Dazsik's organization
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.200]  and his operatives go into the Canadian facility, and when it came out that they transferred
[09:48.200 --> 09:53.640]  viruses much more deadly than COVID-19 that kill 80% of humans they come in contact with
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.800]  if you actually inhale it, they then, oh my God, the Peter Dazsik group, and connected
[09:58.800 --> 10:03.080]  to the Chinese, they stole it out of the Canadian lab.
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.480]  No, Trudeau was letting them build it up there.
[10:07.480 --> 10:17.920]  So the wheels have come off, the rats are leaving the sinking ship, the canary is singing,
[10:17.920 --> 10:20.480]  like a bird, and the canary's died in the coal mine.
[10:20.480 --> 10:27.160]  I mean, you can use any analogy or parable or oxymoronic thing you want, but at the end
[10:27.160 --> 10:32.720]  of the day, ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable, because it is oxymoronic for
[10:32.720 --> 10:38.480]  them to sit there and try to tell us that they weren't doing this, but that's the hutzpah,
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.640]  that's the bravada, that's the hubris of these people.
[10:43.640 --> 10:48.680]  They've been in power so long, and Fauci was over the HIV release, and then over poisoning
[10:48.680 --> 10:53.760]  millions of people to death with the AZT, there's even, you know, award-winning movies
[10:53.760 --> 10:58.440]  about it, Dallas Buyers Club, and I was a young kid when that was going on in Dallas
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.440]  and read about it in the newspaper.
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.280]  My dad even knew doctors that were prescribing people the drugs, so they wouldn't die to
[11:04.280 --> 11:10.000]  get around the FDA trying to murder them.
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.080]  So this is the real world, ladies and gentlemen, and just because you don't like to kill people
[11:18.080 --> 11:24.320]  doesn't mean Fauci doesn't love it, and Fauci is a baby mingala, but on the scale of killing
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.680]  he surpassed mingala worldwide.
[11:27.680 --> 11:36.560]  So Fauci needs to be arrested, and he needs to be brought up on crimes against humanity,
[11:36.560 --> 11:38.800]  and that's a very good chance it's going to happen.
[11:38.800 --> 11:39.800]  It has to happen.
[11:39.800 --> 11:46.360]  They've gone way too far, but instead they're trying to indict Bolsonaro in Brazil who was
[11:46.360 --> 11:49.920]  right about this whole time and exposed it, and told people to get up on their vitamins
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.880]  and minerals, and they saw the death rate go down massively in Brazil, and so they're
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.480]  trying to arrest him now for what they should be arrested for, because Big Pharma runs their
[11:59.480 --> 12:01.920]  country as well.
[12:01.920 --> 12:12.720]  So it's all coming out, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Harvard, Yale, all these big institutions
[12:12.720 --> 12:18.680]  University of Texas involved in weaponizing these viruses, and good U.S. scientists, nonpartisan
[12:18.680 --> 12:23.720]  people, liberals and conservatives, they didn't see it as a political issue, came out in 2004,
[12:23.720 --> 12:30.400]  through 2014, and completely bitched and complained about these level four bio weapons labs, part
[12:30.400 --> 12:36.800]  of the bio shield program, going on all over the country, that Bush got passed in 2004,
[12:36.800 --> 12:40.360]  and saying this is going to get out and kill people, this is illegal.
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.320]  So they just moved it to China, so they'd have plausible deniability to blame China,
[12:44.320 --> 12:47.520]  and I'm not saying Xi Jinping might not have been involved, we just don't have evidence
[12:47.520 --> 12:48.840]  of that.
[12:48.840 --> 12:54.320]  That damn lab was a UN globalist operation that did have the Chinese military monitoring
[12:54.320 --> 12:58.240]  it, and demanding they be given copies of everything, and so yeah, that's treason on
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.000]  top of treason right there, and they may have been the ones that released it, but who stands
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  to gain?
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  Who cooked this up?
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  Who's done it before?
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.320]  Fauci, the Rockefeller Combine, the UN, Bill Gates, they're the top of the pyramid, not
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.240]  Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping says we're going to have three children, we're going to put
[13:14.240 --> 13:19.480]  homosexuals in prison, men are going to be manly, our astronauts are all men, we're going
[13:19.480 --> 13:26.240]  to take the world over, we're going to imitate 1950s America.
[13:26.240 --> 13:30.480]  They know what's powerful, what's strong, what works, I'm not saying but homosexuals
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.400]  in prison, I'm just saying they're going the super extreme route of the other side of
[13:34.400 --> 13:41.920]  the equation, while China funds propaganda here to break down our entire society.
[13:41.920 --> 13:48.360]  So here it is folks, MSN, NIH admits Fauci lied about funding Wuhan gain of function
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.520]  experiments to Congress, that is a crime, there's another one, New York Post, Fauci
[13:52.520 --> 13:57.840]  admits modest, oh now, he said absolutely wrong, nothing ever happened, Rand Paul you're
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.600]  a liar, you don't know what you're talking about, no one ever did gain of function, it
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.440]  never went on ever, when he's in all the documents saying I want gain of function specifically
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.000]  ordering him to do it, and they wanted him to say give us the orders because we don't
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.920]  want to go to jail, they wanted him to send him emails saying okay you want gain of function
[14:14.920 --> 14:18.400]  because the Chinese government says we can't do this here unless it's authorized by the
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.120]  NIH and the CDC, so Fauci had to give them letters to give the Chinese, the Chinese
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.560]  are like you're going to do this right here in this lab and you're going to give it to
[14:26.560 --> 14:34.160]  us too, okay we want letters saying that, and then they went to the Pentagon in 2017
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.960]  and said, just to set up Trump of course, we want to release COVID-19 in the open air
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.640]  in China, the Pentagon said that will start a war, that will infect humans, no, so again
[14:45.640 --> 14:51.120]  it's this corporate group trying to play China and the United States off against each other,
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.040]  and there's double agents in both combines, that's how this works, so NIH admits Fauci
[14:56.040 --> 15:01.320]  line about funding Wuhan gain of function experiments, Fauci admits modest NIH funding
[15:01.320 --> 15:05.800]  of Wuhan lab, but denies gain of function, so he's still trying to spin it, and then
[15:05.800 --> 15:10.440]  we've got this really well written article out of zero hedge, NIH admits funding gain
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.760]  of function COVID experiments gives eco health five days report data, and that's the big
[15:14.760 --> 15:19.040]  news we'll cover when we come back, what's really going on, what's the rest of the story,
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.040]  there's a zero hedge article, here's another gateway pun, we've got more articles on
[15:22.040 --> 15:27.920]  info wars, NIH today corrects false statements by directors Collins and Fauci, the NIH did
[15:27.920 --> 15:34.400]  fund gain of research in Wuhan, Fauci lied under oath, there's Breitbart NIH contradicts
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.480]  Fauci admits funding gain of function research at Wuhan lab, so info wars we first reported
[15:39.480 --> 15:49.880]  this with Dr. Francis Boyle in early February of 2020, Alex Jones is right again, and first
[15:49.880 --> 15:58.680]  again, all glory goes to creator of the universe, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[15:58.680 --> 16:00.520]  If you're concerned about the power grid and
[16:00.520 --> 16:07.680]  Because of the globalist reset, info wars listeners and viewers know a lot of our best
[16:07.680 --> 16:13.760]  selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year, bodies ultimate turmeric
[16:13.760 --> 16:20.040]  formula with 95% of humanoid has been sold out for almost five months, because again
[16:20.040 --> 16:25.320]  the high quality turmeric and the concentration process is very, very expensive and time consuming,
[16:25.320 --> 16:28.200]  and with the supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the problems, we've been unable
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.880]  to get it, but we finally got a shipment in and it's 40% off, it is the secret weapon
[16:33.880 --> 16:37.680]  when it comes to your immune system, when it comes to antioxidants, when it comes to
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.480]  your joints, when it comes to your whole body, people absolutely love bodies ultimate turmeric
[16:42.480 --> 16:47.680]  formula, incredible amounts of five star reviews at info wars store.com and it's back in stock
[16:47.680 --> 16:53.360]  at info wars store.com and it fuzz the info war, a true 360 win, bodies ultimate turmeric
[16:53.360 --> 17:03.840]  formula back in stock at info wars store.com for a limited time, I want to explain something
[17:03.840 --> 17:07.920]  that is absolutely seed understanding our world, it's very, very simple, but the most
[17:07.920 --> 17:13.760]  sensible don't know, the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially
[17:13.760 --> 17:19.560]  creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them
[17:19.560 --> 17:26.920]  to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to
[17:26.920 --> 17:32.520]  buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could
[17:32.520 --> 17:36.840]  leverage that manipulate markets, they never allowed that money to get into the general
[17:36.840 --> 17:39.080]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[17:39.080 --> 17:44.280]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[17:44.280 --> 17:50.240]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[17:50.240 --> 17:55.000]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund, the only things left
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  standing.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.760]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now, warn everyone, it's the only way to stop
[17:59.760 --> 18:00.760]  it.
[18:00.760 --> 18:09.840]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity, I have decided that all of you
[18:09.840 --> 18:17.440]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe, but the injection is not ready
[18:17.440 --> 18:28.040]  yet, and so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can, I
[18:28.040 --> 18:36.040]  also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations, that
[18:36.040 --> 18:42.840]  way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[18:42.840 --> 18:51.520]  only I own, profitable, you will then be my slaves, oh, and then you'll get that special
[18:51.520 --> 18:57.120]  shot of freedom from copra, it will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent
[18:57.120 --> 19:02.000]  on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.400]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[19:07.400 --> 19:11.360]  happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.200]  my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[19:16.200 --> 19:17.200]  with the climate.
[19:17.200 --> 19:23.440]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant, so yes, climate
[19:23.440 --> 19:28.440]  change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.280]  and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't really happen
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.200]  the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate change, but did you know that
[19:35.200 --> 19:41.280]  man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department
[19:41.280 --> 19:47.080]  of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN, they have weather control trees for 1979, and Bill
[19:47.080 --> 19:52.000]  Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time, in fact back in 1994 two
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.840]  scientists won a Nobel Prize for the idea of spraying different particles out of jet
[19:55.840 --> 20:03.520]  engines to control the weather, so yes, man-made climate change is real.
[20:03.520 --> 20:25.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:25.480 --> 20:33.920]  You have found it, the tip of the spear, the millions of amazing, God-fearing humans who
[20:33.920 --> 20:35.480]  are race-colored and creed-lessing this transmission.
[20:35.480 --> 20:41.240]  It's Thursday, October 21st, broadcast, I'm asking you for the sake of your own future,
[20:41.240 --> 20:47.800]  your children's future, the world's future, to carry this transmission through the enemy
[20:47.800 --> 20:53.360]  lines, through the sensors, to override them, to circumnavigate them and to take the live
[20:53.360 --> 20:59.800]  feed from band.video, freeworldnews.tv, infowars.com, forward slash show, and to share it with your
[20:59.800 --> 21:05.160]  email list, with your text message list, that is the best way to override the sensors, to
[21:05.160 --> 21:09.360]  put links up on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, however you've got to do it, keep
[21:09.360 --> 21:13.680]  doing it, take clips of the shows, put them out, ask people what they think is a great
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.480]  way to get it out there and not get censored, because if you affirm us on a mainstream site,
[21:18.480 --> 21:24.360]  they will take you down, that whatever you do, know that the people are very, very hungry
[21:24.360 --> 21:28.920]  for the medicine of truth that we're putting out, and that's why the globalists are trying
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.480]  to suppress and shut down this transmission.
[21:31.480 --> 21:36.880]  Okay, let's get into it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:36.880 --> 21:44.680]  Let's talk about this right now, and how big a moment this is in human history, and really
[21:44.680 --> 21:52.280]  where we are and what we're facing as a society and as a species.
[21:52.280 --> 21:56.960]  I could sit here for the next three hours and just talk about the NIH letter and how
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.000]  the top scientists there, and including the new head of the NIH, understand they're all
[22:01.000 --> 22:06.200]  going to go to prison if they join with Fauci and continue to lie and say that they weren't
[22:06.200 --> 22:10.160]  running billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[22:10.160 --> 22:17.320]  In fact, next segment I have a clip where a top researcher, Ph.D., covers the documents
[22:17.320 --> 22:23.640]  where over $190 billion has been spent by Fauci in the last 40 years that he directs
[22:23.640 --> 22:26.680]  to develop weaponized viruses.
[22:26.680 --> 22:33.920]  So next segment lets you play you a clip on that, and that's important, $190 plus billion.
[22:33.920 --> 22:35.960]  That's on record.
[22:35.960 --> 22:40.160]  But the fact that Fauci lied to Connors, the fact that he did that, the fact that they
[22:40.160 --> 22:43.680]  cooked up COVID-19, that's very important.
[22:43.680 --> 22:51.320]  But the issue that the NIH is bringing this out shows you that they finally realized that
[22:51.320 --> 22:55.200]  there really is a depopulation agenda going on, and that this really is the end of the
[22:55.200 --> 22:58.680]  world as we know it, because I know a lot of the people that work at the highest levels
[22:58.680 --> 23:03.120]  of government, and a lot of people that have been at the very tops of these systems, and
[23:03.120 --> 23:08.240]  most of them just buy the cover story, most of them really think they're doing good work.
[23:08.240 --> 23:13.080]  But now this evil is so out in the open, and the fact that the vaccine isn't a vaccine
[23:13.080 --> 23:17.440]  is killing so many people, and the fact that the majority of the sick and dying worldwide
[23:17.440 --> 23:21.720]  and that's now come out mainstream news is from the shot.
[23:21.720 --> 23:26.160]  They had thought that everybody would Stockholm syndrome and go along with this, and a lot
[23:26.160 --> 23:27.520]  of folks have.
[23:27.520 --> 23:34.120]  And other people are actually going from being asleep or in denial to waking up.
[23:34.120 --> 23:39.080]  So yes, the sleeping giant is awakening, and the sleeping giant doesn't need to tear its
[23:39.080 --> 23:41.240]  own face off because it's angry.
[23:41.240 --> 23:47.360]  It needs to focus on who's in charge of the New World Order, and then legally and lawfully
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.920]  dismantle them.
[23:48.920 --> 23:53.520]  But first you've got to expose them and identify them, and we're very close to that.
[23:53.520 --> 23:57.920]  People always gets arrogant and makes a big move to kill the majority of the people.
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.400]  It's what it does, it's spirit.
[24:00.400 --> 24:04.000]  And it usually takes good people a while to realize that's happening, but once good
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.080]  wakes up, then very quickly the tables turn.
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.880]  Now here's the problem, because we can talk all day about how he did it and how they cooked
[24:11.880 --> 24:15.040]  it up and how they released it, but that's old news here.
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.520]  We're not here to give you today's news today.
[24:17.520 --> 24:23.520]  We give you next year's news today because that's what's going to save us, is understanding
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.400]  and fourth and fifth dimensional thinking and sixth dimensional thinking and historical
[24:27.400 --> 24:32.600]  perspectives and real wisdom, and the will to face the truth, and the will to have courage
[24:32.600 --> 24:36.440]  to go forward with what you have to do because in the end it's the only hope you've got,
[24:36.440 --> 24:41.240]  the courage to face the facts.
[24:41.240 --> 24:47.880]  This coming out is so seismic and so dangerous that myself and most of the very intelligent
[24:47.880 --> 24:53.520]  people I talk to, including some of the most powerful people in the world who claim they're
[24:53.520 --> 24:55.520]  not with the New World Order, and I'll leave it at that.
[24:55.520 --> 24:58.640]  I'm just going to stop right there, but I think people can probably put two or two together
[24:58.640 --> 25:01.680]  and guess what is Alex talking about.
[25:01.680 --> 25:07.920]  But there are some of the, if not the richest people on paper in the world that are signaling
[25:07.920 --> 25:16.040]  everywhere they're not with this, and who've told me they're not with this, and just recently,
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.320]  and then I've seen what came out of it.
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.640]  I've been told a year ago, we're going to do this, we're really with you, we're with
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.600]  humanity, and I've started to see those people that told me that, all do what they said they
[25:27.600 --> 25:28.600]  do.
[25:28.600 --> 25:32.920]  And I told you in the case of Rogan about it because he didn't mind me saying that, even
[25:32.920 --> 25:35.880]  though they came after him a lot and there was a lot of news articles about it, about
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.440]  Rogan's going to take on the censors, Rogan's going to destroy them, and then later Rogan's
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.800]  like, well, I didn't quite say it that way, and later he's like, Jones, damn it, and
[25:45.800 --> 25:51.880]  I said, you didn't say that was off record, I'm sorry, but it's above Rogan now, and
[25:51.880 --> 25:56.920]  there's not much higher to go, right, when it comes to people that are on our side.
[25:56.920 --> 26:05.640]  So what you've got to understand here is the smart money is on a war with China, and I
[26:05.640 --> 26:12.320]  don't want a war, but we're looking at a giant war in February right now, currently that's
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.480]  the projections with the top people on the earth who claim they're not with the New
[26:17.480 --> 26:22.840]  World War Combine, is war in February.
[26:22.840 --> 26:28.080]  And this is the type of time like right before World War One, right before World War Two,
[26:28.080 --> 26:33.120]  when everything kicks off, and I hope that doesn't happen.
[26:33.120 --> 26:43.520]  But currently, that is the trajectory we're on, and there is a consensus on that, and
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.840]  a large consensus, I don't mean a consensus with people that just live here in Austin,
[26:48.840 --> 26:52.000]  the new main power hub of the country.
[26:52.000 --> 27:00.080]  I'm talking about all over the world we have contacts, and General Flynn thinks war with
[27:00.080 --> 27:01.600]  China is imminent.
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.600]  He was raised in the alarm ten years ago on that, and that's why they got mad at him.
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.160]  So all the smart people I talked to say the same thing I'm seeing, and so we can sit here
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.320]  and talk about, oh yeah, Fauci's a criminal, Fauci's a go to jail, and the fact that they
[27:15.320 --> 27:21.240]  put this letter out and said, give us all your documents, you have five days, I mean
[27:21.240 --> 27:29.440]  you know that the FBI is all over this, but the FBI is controlled by the Democratic Party
[27:29.440 --> 27:38.840]  and the globalists, but they also know that their own people now understand that they've
[27:38.840 --> 27:43.440]  been part of a eugenics depopulation operation, and so even people's husbands and wives, I
[27:43.440 --> 27:47.280]  told you yesterday, at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, highest levels of
[27:47.280 --> 27:54.040]  the national news, people's families are saying we're not going to be part of this with you.
[27:54.040 --> 27:57.600]  Member Bill Gates's wife said, oh we're not developing plans about micro tips, and people
[27:57.600 --> 28:01.560]  I asked Bill and he said no, he smiles at her and looks really weird, and the word is
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.240]  she didn't even know about all this stuff a lot of it.
[28:06.240 --> 28:14.160]  So this is all coming out, ladies and gentlemen, and the whole secret life of Bill Gates and
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.360]  Jeffrey Epstein and all that's coming out, and yes, Military.com says World War Three
[28:19.360 --> 28:25.040]  has already begun, yeah, it's insane, and they've already got us all in our mask and
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.960]  already got us in our hazmat with the COVID drill, which is a real weapon, but it's weak
[28:29.960 --> 28:33.840]  compared to what they've got, and now they're letting us know, oh Fauci's got stuff that
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.120]  kills 80% of humans, and that's where everybody kisses his ass and is scared of him because
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.720]  he's doctored death, man.
[28:41.720 --> 28:47.640]  He pulls back that black cape and the plague comes out, so knowing who the different factions
[28:47.640 --> 28:53.080]  are is key, and knowing what the next moves are going to be is key, and getting ready
[28:53.080 --> 29:00.080]  for it is paramount, we'll be right back to stay with us.
[29:00.080 --> 29:06.680]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[29:06.680 --> 29:10.920]  It's associated with cancer, it's associated with joint problems, it's associated with
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.280]  viral infections, bacterial infections, it's associated with death, and out of all the
[29:15.280 --> 29:19.560]  incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes
[29:19.560 --> 29:25.000]  our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all, and chief amongst all the turmeric
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.560]  products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[29:28.560 --> 29:32.080]  My wife loves turmeric, she has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it, the type
[29:32.080 --> 29:34.640]  of stuff she buys at the grocery store for it to work.
[29:34.640 --> 29:37.960]  She started taking this and said, all we need to take one pill instead of four, why is it
[29:37.960 --> 29:38.960]  so good?
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.680]  It's not just turmeric, it's concentrated with the proprietary process, it's back in
[29:43.680 --> 29:50.480]  stock and for being sold out almost five months at infowarstore.com for 40% off, but supplies
[29:50.480 --> 29:53.600]  are going to sell out quick because of supply chain breakdowns and because we will not lower
[29:53.600 --> 29:57.000]  the quality of this product, and body's is one of our best selling products because it
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.560]  really does work and people love it, get yours today at infowarstore.com.
[30:00.560 --> 30:02.800]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[30:02.800 --> 30:04.400]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[30:04.400 --> 30:07.600]  Why do they hate America so much?
[30:07.600 --> 30:13.440]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[30:13.440 --> 30:14.440]  coexist with.
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.600]  It's very, very simple.
[30:15.600 --> 30:22.280]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human eugenics system to flourish, freedom
[30:22.280 --> 30:28.280]  and liberty and due process, injustice and God fearing systems must fail.
[30:28.280 --> 30:33.160]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates, you didn't start a fight with David
[30:33.160 --> 30:38.760]  Rockefeller, you didn't start a fight with the UN, they started a fight with you and
[30:38.760 --> 30:42.520]  they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away and they're not going
[30:42.520 --> 30:47.880]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[30:47.880 --> 30:51.960]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[30:51.960 --> 30:56.520]  or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[30:56.520 --> 31:00.640]  attack we have any chance of beating these people.
[31:00.640 --> 31:10.280]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[31:10.280 --> 31:14.720]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[31:14.720 --> 31:15.720]  in place.
[31:15.720 --> 31:21.280]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[31:21.280 --> 31:26.720]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[31:26.720 --> 31:29.560]  faces from the light of the sun.
[31:29.560 --> 31:37.760]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[31:37.760 --> 31:42.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[31:42.200 --> 31:45.080]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[31:45.080 --> 31:49.120]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[31:49.120 --> 31:51.080]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[31:51.080 --> 31:56.640]  Things only get worse from here if we submit, they only get better if we resist and say
[31:56.640 --> 31:57.640]  no.
[31:57.640 --> 31:59.960]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[31:59.960 --> 32:04.440]  By now you've heard me talk about the BioPros and how they're creating amazing products.
[32:04.440 --> 32:10.000]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.360]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[32:13.360 --> 32:17.480]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[32:17.480 --> 32:22.960]  The BioPros are excited to release BioRVPro, a product specifically designed to establish
[32:22.960 --> 32:26.000]  healthy black and or gray water holding tanks.
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.640]  BioRVPro digests grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[32:31.640 --> 32:33.640]  It is also human and animal safe.
[32:33.640 --> 32:37.520]  Get up to 20 treatments, coupled with an easy application scoop.
[32:37.520 --> 32:39.480]  Just pour and flush, it's that simple.
[32:39.480 --> 32:44.440]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer hoses
[32:44.440 --> 32:45.440]  and plumbing.
[32:45.440 --> 32:51.600]  Say goodbye to holding tank problems, gas buildup and odor, guarantee, stick it to the
[32:51.600 --> 32:55.320]  stinky slinky with BioRVPro.
[32:55.320 --> 33:02.920]  Visit theBioPros.com and see for yourself.
[33:02.920 --> 33:16.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.120 --> 33:20.360]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[33:20.360 --> 33:24.480]  Resistance to Titans is obedience to God.
[33:24.480 --> 33:26.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:26.520 --> 33:35.720]  All right, so thank you for joining us, the Fauci News is the biggest thing in the last
[33:35.720 --> 33:40.520]  21 months of this hell we reported.
[33:40.520 --> 33:43.520]  When it comes to the BioWeapons, how they cooked them up, how they released them and
[33:43.520 --> 33:49.520]  then it's the heart of the whole takeover with the Debo script that directed it, that
[33:49.520 --> 33:53.720]  came up with a plan, Fauci that implemented it, with their world ID, with their casual
[33:53.720 --> 33:58.560]  society, with their medical IDs, I mean the entire architecture of the world government
[33:58.560 --> 34:02.440]  corporate takeover operation lockstep is tied to this.
[34:02.440 --> 34:05.440]  And the fact that it's come out, that they lied to Congress, they created the weapon,
[34:05.440 --> 34:09.680]  they obviously released it on purpose, look at all the timing, they suppressed treatments,
[34:09.680 --> 34:16.280]  they gave us drugs that killed 56% of the folks that took it, Rindesivir, they censored
[34:16.280 --> 34:22.280]  Congress, they censored the President, they censored you, they censored me.
[34:22.280 --> 34:28.760]  This is the biggest story ever that this came out.
[34:28.760 --> 34:34.440]  I mean I've got the letter from the NIH director with them saying that he willfully and deliberately
[34:34.440 --> 34:40.000]  lied to Congress and see that's the thing about this folks, when all this came out because
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  people leaked the information and brought it forward, the scientists have been concerned
[34:43.000 --> 34:50.640]  the whole time, Fauci got up on TV and five exchanges with Rand Paul and said that is
[34:50.640 --> 35:01.840]  preposterous, I never did any such thing and no one did and you are stupid, I am smart,
[35:01.840 --> 35:05.080]  you are stupid.
[35:05.080 --> 35:10.280]  And then we've got all the videos of him going, thank you for joining us at this night annual
[35:10.280 --> 35:17.040]  gain of function conference, I believe in gain of function, we are the leaders in developing
[35:17.040 --> 35:23.920]  gain of function technology to study it and stop future disasters, oh you mean combining
[35:23.920 --> 35:28.360]  five viruses that would never show up naturally?
[35:28.360 --> 35:36.000]  So now he's like well we did a modest one, you know modest, well you released a super
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.920]  fancy one, I mean to just breed a virus naturally and test it to see and isolate more infectious
[35:43.920 --> 35:50.440]  variants is super gain of function, it's horrible, but that's the bare minimum, he went light
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.920]  years into splicing viruses by the thousands of different types together and again viruses
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.640]  that kill 80% of humans they come in contact with, he's now weaponized those so they get
[36:00.640 --> 36:07.760]  into humans out of pigs, that's the jump out of bats that into pigs, we covered that on
[36:07.760 --> 36:14.040]  Monday and on Tuesday because that's now coming out and so this guy's cooking up stuff, let
[36:14.040 --> 36:22.160]  me explain that if it gets out we'll collapse civilization and then there's 600 plus nuclear
[36:22.160 --> 36:25.760]  reactors most of those will break down because they won't be there to take care of it, they're
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.720]  going to blow up and it will be like a giant nuclear war because one big reactor blowing
[36:30.720 --> 36:36.240]  up is worse than 100 hydrogen bombs going off over your country because hydrogen bombs
[36:36.240 --> 36:42.880]  dissipate most of the radiation, they detonate up in the sky, they flash down, when radiation,
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.320]  when radioactive isotopes, when radioactive material is next to other things it spins
[36:48.320 --> 36:59.240]  off horrible things like Chernobyl, this would be if all the reactors went up they say like
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.440]  20,000 times worse than Chernobyl, Chernobyl just had a partial blow up and you saw how
[37:05.440 --> 37:11.520]  nice that was, so we're talking about the end of life on the surface of the earth for
[37:11.520 --> 37:16.760]  thousands of years as we know it, so that's what these maniacs have done, someone explained
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.600]  to all of you that like the movies where the virus gets released by the elite to depopulate
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.280]  and people all agree well there are too many humans, do you understand you're going to
[37:24.280 --> 37:29.800]  be dead too, you understand that right, you understand we're like one second from this,
[37:29.800 --> 37:34.680]  Bill Gates and Fauci must be arrested now, Klaus Schwab must be arrested now, they must
[37:34.680 --> 37:41.360]  be convicted and they must be publicly hung, they are Nazis, they are communist 2.0, they
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.920]  are going to kill everybody, we cannot let them be walking around, now let me explain
[37:47.920 --> 37:50.920]  they want me dead, they want me destroyed because I'm calling out these people, I'm
[37:50.920 --> 38:02.000]  going to be dead anyways if we don't stop these people, so this is so seismic, this
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.400]  is so massive, now I don't want any harm by these individual citizens who go after Bill
[38:07.400 --> 38:12.360]  Gates or Peter Dazik or Klaus Schwab or any of these people that will turn them into victims
[38:12.360 --> 38:17.640]  and that is horrible, do not do it, do not do that, continue to destroy them politically,
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.240]  continue to attack them with the truth and I've been on here every day for months saying
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.800]  if people in these companies and these corporations and these government institutions don't go
[38:27.800 --> 38:32.040]  public soon, you and your whole family are going to be killed by these globalists that
[38:32.040 --> 38:35.200]  have built all these underground bunkers, we got to stop them and I've said that to
[38:35.200 --> 38:38.960]  Rand Paul, I've said that to everybody, on the record, off the record, I've talked to
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.120]  a bunch of them and they know this and you're starting to see them get that good, here's
[38:44.120 --> 38:52.520]  the problem, we have now reached the Rubicon point here or the point on return, the event
[38:52.520 --> 38:59.280]  horizon, where do you just think the New World Order and the people behind Fauci and Gates,
[38:59.280 --> 39:03.480]  do you think they're going to stop now that their whole plan is exposed and now they're
[39:03.480 --> 39:04.480]  in so much trouble?
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.040]  No, they're not, they're going to pull a huge war, another bio-weapon release much
[39:09.040 --> 39:21.440]  worse, false flags, I mean everything's on the table, unless they're given an armistice
[39:21.440 --> 39:30.760]  like Napoleon Bonaparte and unless they're allowed to go into exile and I don't want
[39:30.760 --> 39:36.440]  vengeance, I don't want blood, I don't want George Soros in the Nuremberg too because
[39:36.440 --> 39:40.720]  folks, they can still kill us, they got a gun to our head, I'm telling them just put
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.520]  the gun down, just walk away, just walk away and we'll spare your lives, just please don't
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.360]  kill us, okay, but you're never going to get away with doing this now and you're not going
[39:50.360 --> 39:53.720]  to be safe in your bunkers if you pull this on us, so don't kill my family, we won't hurt
[39:53.720 --> 39:58.240]  yours, okay, okay, let's just stop, it's like a Mexican standoff, let's just, all this
[39:58.240 --> 40:04.800]  is put our guns down right here, that's nice and let's just stop this right now, right
[40:04.800 --> 40:11.280]  now, let's stop this right now, because this is a bio-weapon war, directed by major corporations
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.280]  to bring in world government and all their greedy, crazy crap and their world ID and
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.720]  all this stuff and it's prophesied it's going to happen sometime in the future, I'd like
[40:19.720 --> 40:27.240]  it not to happen maybe in my lifetime, maybe now, because if you study this algorithm,
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.200]  this thing tries this over and over again, I mean there's books written about it 2,000
[40:31.200 --> 40:37.920]  years ago for a reason, this is what this thing does and so all I'm saying is, is that
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.040]  we're the stalemate, the globalists can't get away with this, the globalists can still
[40:42.040 --> 40:49.000]  kill us and I don't want a civil war, I don't want to put on a general's outfit, I don't
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.480]  want to see bombs going off and I'm not going to get the general's outfit, what I'm saying
[40:52.480 --> 40:58.120]  is I don't have any desire for this, I have a desire for peace and justice and I am just
[40:58.120 --> 41:03.640]  going to try as best I can to stop this madness, this is much more dangerous than the Korean
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.280]  War, much worse than the Cold War, much worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the
[41:08.280 --> 41:16.560]  most dangerous time in human history, no one denies that, no one debates that and what does
[41:16.560 --> 41:23.440]  a, what does it mean for the globalists to at least this crop to stop what they're doing,
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.760]  obviously they're going to go slink around and try to re-coordinate and come back again
[41:26.760 --> 41:32.680]  later, the point is, is that we need to get out of this situation with them now and I'm
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.280]  telling you what I'm bringing up is the best course and it probably isn't going to be followed
[41:37.280 --> 41:42.120]  because everybody has this bloodlust to have a giant cataclysm and a giant destructive
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.000]  process take place and our country is run by seriously demonic individuals that have
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.240]  men dressed up like women in admiral outfits so, but this is nevertheless the course that
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.160]  I believe we should all be trying to take, now I think if the clip I said I'll get to
[41:57.160 --> 42:03.520]  the next segment, but you understand that this giant piece of news is only one part
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.360]  of this, when we come back I will give you the rest of the story and I will play the
[42:07.360 --> 42:12.360]  clips as well, there I have a whole stack of mainstream science and government submitting
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.640]  and this is why the globalists are in so much trouble and this is what finally allowed
[42:16.640 --> 42:24.120]  them to go after Fauci and the heart of this, you don't fight that the virus is not, you're
[42:24.120 --> 42:29.040]  not protected with the vaccine or us does, you fight that you're fighting a losing battle
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.320]  because it's too complex to the republic to understand, but it comes out they cooked
[42:33.320 --> 42:38.920]  it up and released it, the whole thing goes away, but that said you've got to now reverse
[42:38.920 --> 42:43.560]  what's happening with the injections and you've got to then tell people the mitigating factors
[42:43.560 --> 42:47.800]  that can heal them of what's been done and there are processes coming out that can help
[42:47.800 --> 42:53.280]  people that have been injected, if they get these treatments soon, okay so we just need
[42:53.280 --> 42:58.680]  to put this war back in the box.
[42:58.680 --> 43:05.960]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation,
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.240]  it's associated with cancer, it's associated with joint problems, it's associated with
[43:10.240 --> 43:15.040]  viral infections, bacterial infections, it's associated with death and out of all the incredible
[43:15.040 --> 43:19.480]  compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives
[43:19.480 --> 43:24.720]  better, turmeric is chief amongst them all and chief amongst all the turmeric products
[43:24.720 --> 43:29.760]  out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula, my wife loves turmeric, she has joint pain

[43:33.960 --> 43:37.240]  she started taking this and said all we need to take one pill instead of four, why is it
[43:37.240 --> 43:38.240]  so good?
[43:38.240 --> 43:42.960]  It's not just turmeric, it's concentrated with the proprietary process, it's back in

[45:12.960 --> 45:17.560]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was
[45:17.560 --> 45:23.000]  loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your x2
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.040]  for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm
[45:28.040 --> 45:34.040]  55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought you know
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.600]  well maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation,
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.120]  but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you know over a period
[45:43.120 --> 45:49.080]  of time I started noticing okay you know this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful,
[45:49.080 --> 45:55.680]  you know I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know, so anyway it worked wonderfully
[45:55.680 --> 45:59.960]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.640]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.960]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[46:09.960 --> 46:13.840]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.040]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.000]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government, that's why they
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.920]  launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[46:28.920 --> 46:34.880]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy, and because
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.200]  they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.560]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon
[46:44.560 --> 46:45.560]  on us.
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.560]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple,
[46:50.560 --> 46:54.920]  they can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[46:54.920 --> 46:58.120]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[46:58.120 --> 47:02.960]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[47:02.960 --> 47:17.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.200 --> 47:25.080]  Dear the town of our free road, a stranger one fine day, Hardly spoke to folks around
[47:25.080 --> 47:32.520]  him, didn't have too much to say, No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to
[47:32.520 --> 47:41.920]  make a slip, the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip, big iron on his
[47:41.920 --> 47:42.920]  hip.
[47:42.920 --> 47:51.360]  It was early in the morning when he rode into the town, he came riding from the southside,
[47:51.360 --> 47:58.520]  slowly looking all around, he's an outlaw, loose and runnin', came the whispered from
[47:58.520 --> 48:04.760]  each lip, and he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip, big iron on
[48:04.760 --> 48:05.760]  his hip.
[48:05.760 --> 48:12.640]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[48:12.640 --> 48:23.600]  Here we are, let's go ahead and lay this out, here is Dr. David Martin, PhD major top
[48:23.600 --> 48:31.200]  investor, he's an MSNBC frequent host over the years, knows what he's talking about,
[48:31.200 --> 48:37.440]  and here he is going back and doing an analysis of how much money Fauci has gotten in his
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.720]  career to weaponize viruses and then to have him, it's like saying, it'd be like Michael
[48:42.720 --> 48:46.720]  Jordan testifying to Congress and they said, Michael Jordan, you played basketball, he
[48:46.720 --> 48:51.280]  goes, no, never played it, once, hate it, aren't you like a seven, eight time champion
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.320]  or something, like the NBA, nope, what's the NBA, well we have thousands of hours of footage
[48:56.320 --> 49:01.840]  of you being the greatest basketball player of all time, and he just goes, I've never
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.040]  heard of that, what is basketball?
[49:05.040 --> 49:12.640]  Now Mr. Jordan, you are testifying to Congress, under oath that you do not know what basketball
[49:12.640 --> 49:17.960]  is, you never played basketball, I'm warning you, this is not a joke, you're under oath,
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.520]  this is a felony, seven years in prison, every lie you tell, Michael Jordan, I don't know
[49:23.520 --> 49:29.840]  what basketball is, okay, well Mr. Jordan, do you have amnesia, let us show you footage
[49:29.840 --> 49:35.720]  of a slam dunk you did, Michael Jordan says, I can't see, I can't see what you're doing,
[49:35.720 --> 49:41.000]  I'm suddenly, oh you're now blind, you can't see, that's Fauci on gain of function, he's
[49:41.000 --> 49:52.800]  the OG, he's the pimp daddy, he's everything, he's the guy for 45 years, 44 years, so here
[49:52.800 --> 49:57.120]  it is, 190 something billion, here it is.
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.920]  I want this number to stick in your head, because this number unfortunately was cut
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.080]  out of the movie, it's been cut out of a lot of things, so you're not going to have to
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.560]  cut it out of your brain, because I'm going to give it to you right now, Anthony Fauci
[50:07.560 --> 50:21.440]  has spent, listen to this number, $191 billion, not 3.7 million, not 30 million, $191 billion
[50:21.440 --> 50:28.200]  of audited funds for the bioweaponization of viruses against humanity, and it's your money
[50:28.200 --> 50:36.200]  that has been spent, $191 billion, and do you think you can get any agency or oversight
[50:36.200 --> 50:42.800]  body or any politician to even take that investigation on despite the fact that we have every grant
[50:42.800 --> 50:48.880]  recipient, every person, their address, their phone number, their laboratory, we literally
[50:48.880 --> 50:54.120]  have the entirety of where that money went, and not a single investigation agency in this
[50:54.120 --> 50:57.760]  country is willing to look.
[50:57.760 --> 51:03.720]  This is a bioweapons program designed to kill us, that's what it is, and it's not just designed
[51:03.720 --> 51:08.560]  to kill us, it's designed to kill massive numbers of the population.
[51:08.560 --> 51:12.040]  We do not have a virus, we have a biological weapon.
[51:12.040 --> 51:16.040]  Well said, Dr. David Martin is amazing, I had him scheduled for the show one day, had
[51:16.040 --> 51:20.400]  a family emergency, he had to leave, and he thinks that I dissed him on purpose, so won't
[51:20.400 --> 51:24.520]  come on, that's not that, but whatever, I'd love to get him on sometime, I've already
[51:24.520 --> 51:27.720]  apologized five times, so I'm done talking about it, but he is dead on, I've done my
[51:27.720 --> 51:31.720]  own research, I've checked everything he said, and he said of this like a year ago,
[51:31.720 --> 51:38.040]  let's all come out, we have all the documents, thousands of pages of it, it is on the record
[51:38.040 --> 51:45.880]  ladies and gentlemen, that this unfolded, and now we move on from that, now we move
[51:45.880 --> 51:52.760]  on from that because I want to hit this huge piece of news that ties into all of this.
[51:52.760 --> 51:59.280]  The fact that the bioweapon isn't just the original virus that was still pretty hard
[51:59.280 --> 52:03.080]  for most people to catch, but if you were run down or had problems, it was a very, very
[52:03.080 --> 52:10.040]  serious attack on your lungs, and other parts of the body, but with whatever's been going
[52:10.040 --> 52:15.840]  around since then, that a lot of studies and tests doesn't show up as COVID-19, but acts
[52:15.840 --> 52:22.640]  just like it, but worse, we know it's from variants, from simulant, prion sprays that
[52:22.640 --> 52:30.240]  are being put out against red state areas, that's even come out, but now from Singapore
[52:30.240 --> 52:37.480]  to Israel, from the UK to the United States, we can run this on the screen for TV viewers,
[52:37.480 --> 52:40.920]  we have the John Hopkins numbers from three weeks ago, which now the British government's
[52:40.920 --> 52:47.240]  release numbers confirming those, that in the UK 80 plus percent of the deaths of COVID
[52:47.240 --> 52:51.280]  are from the quote COVID vaccinated, and that's not counting people that again die in the
[52:51.280 --> 52:57.240]  first 14 days after quote inoculation, so it's way higher than that, 80 plus percent
[52:57.240 --> 53:04.800]  in the UK, so here's some of the headlines backing this up, 82% of vaccinated Singapore
[53:04.800 --> 53:09.160]  records highest daily coronavirus cases yet, including deaths and illnesses, doesn't quote
[53:09.160 --> 53:14.080]  make it less severe, it's not how immunity works, Tucker Carlson asked the question last
[53:14.080 --> 53:21.840]  night, we'll play that in a moment, countries are seeing unusually high other different
[53:21.840 --> 53:27.920]  types of deaths, that sounds like COVID, looks like COVID, but they're saying is it COVID
[53:27.920 --> 53:33.280]  and it's in the vaccinated, so countries are seeing unusually high of all different types
[53:33.280 --> 53:38.400]  of different types of deaths not related to COVID, and here if you want to find the article
[53:38.400 --> 53:42.520]  and see the link to John Hopkins and see the link to scientists and doctors analyzing
[53:42.520 --> 53:48.800]  the data, it's in an article written weeks ago and in special reports we did, John Hopkins
[53:48.800 --> 53:54.360]  data proves COVID shots causing majority of illness and death, that's from October 10th,
[53:54.360 --> 53:59.360]  and now that's hitting mainstream news all over the place, so this is life and death
[53:59.360 --> 54:06.600]  information, here's another one, Don Salazar last week, alarming double-vax contracted
[54:06.600 --> 54:11.760]  COVID at higher rates than unvaccinated UK data shows and they're dying at a higher
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.280]  rate, now that isn't just a Don Salazar saying that, he links to the British government's
[54:16.280 --> 54:20.680]  own COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report, and then it's got all these medical doctors
[54:20.680 --> 54:26.960]  and scientists breaking it down like Merkola and others below it, so you can see this,
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.280]  anybody in your friends or family or neighbors, it'll wake them up, here's some more, Gibraltar,
[54:31.280 --> 54:40.160]  Iceland, see massive COVID spike despite over 90% of population vaccinated, Sydney, Australia,
[54:40.160 --> 54:47.160]  all new COVID hospitalizations involve vaccinated individuals except one, that's WSAU.com, that's
[54:47.160 --> 54:55.040]  the national government admitting that in press conferences, major government report
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.640]  proves COVID vaccines are bio weapons, another great video from yesterday, Greg Rees with
[54:59.640 --> 55:03.440]  the latest numbers proving it all, you want to go see that, that's at Band-Aught Video
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.240]  in the Greg Rees section, here's a huge one out of the Daily Star, double jab Brits with
[55:08.240 --> 55:16.360]  worst lurchy, that means disease ever, could actually have COVID without realizing it,
[55:16.360 --> 55:21.560]  and they're finding again that they're twice as likely to die or be in the hospital, it's
[55:21.560 --> 55:24.160]  both the same number, there it is, you can read all about it for yourself, and they're
[55:24.160 --> 55:32.200]  calling it the super cold, well it's called antibody dependency enhancement, ADE, UK HSS
[55:32.200 --> 55:38.680]  into super cold emit rise in people dying from it, why vaccinated people are dying from
[55:38.680 --> 55:46.120]  COVID-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective, says CNN, they're going to say they're extraordinarily
[55:46.120 --> 55:52.360]  effective, yeah what, 3% now, and then this huge article, Defense Department pulls a bait
[55:52.360 --> 55:56.400]  and switch on vaccines, we reported this back when it happened a few months ago with Robert
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.720]  Barnes reading the sub, but at least it's in the mainstream news now, you can pull up
[56:00.720 --> 56:04.600]  these articles where people want to wait a minute, they said it's a fully authorized
[56:04.600 --> 56:07.920]  by the FDA and that's why they approved it, but it was never fully authorized, and the
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.240]  FDA pulled a fast one and said it's authorized, if it gets approval in 2026, and I showed
[56:13.240 --> 56:19.480]  you the FDA website yesterday on screen, you think of the magnitude of these lies, the
[56:19.480 --> 56:23.360]  only thing bigger is saying that Fauci never was involved in gain of function and no one
[56:23.360 --> 56:29.200]  he knew was, alright that's just some of what we've got coming up, I'm going to hit this
[56:29.200 --> 56:34.560]  tyranny and how we get out of this and how we expose it, and how we don't need a civil
[56:34.560 --> 56:40.200]  war over this, just killing each other, we need to blame the globalist and see how knowing
[56:40.200 --> 56:46.440]  that the vaccine is deadly is meant to make us not go to work or be fired so society collapses,
[56:46.440 --> 56:49.800]  so we need to get people to be aware of that, still not go to work, but get the general
[56:49.800 --> 56:53.280]  public to understand why the globalists did this and why they want to wreck the economy,
[56:53.280 --> 56:56.840]  because a lot of people say God the virus must be deadly, if the corporations love us
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.840]  so much that they want us to take all these shots or we can't go to work, no they've
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.520]  been ordered to by the big banks that own them to implode the economy so they can buy
[57:04.520 --> 57:08.040]  it up for pennies in the dollar, and speaking of that I got all the globalists after, it's
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.840]  more than ever because they want to take us off air, but your funding is what allows us
[57:11.840 --> 57:16.200]  to stay on air and expand what we're doing and not be shut down, we either going to
[57:16.200 --> 57:21.160]  get bigger or we're going to get shut down, so I need to get bigger right now and I got
[57:21.160 --> 57:24.240]  products you need, so get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get your storeable foods

[43:33.340 --> 1:00:31.080]  being lured into a war with the West. Look at these headlines, I'll cover this
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:36.200]  in the next segment. China tested second hypersonic orbital nuke and the Pentagon goes, oh my
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:41.520]  god, we've got nothing like we're so scared. I don't think the Chinese are stupid enough
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.120]  to not understand. If they think these type of weapon systems are not in the U.S. or Russian
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:54.720]  arsenal, they're extremely stupid. Hypersonic glide vehicles. The United States has had
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:01:02.360]  those since the 1970s. What do you think the Chinese stole it from? Because this is not
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:09.320]  the United States to see, this is the new Atlantis. This is the king daddy, ladies and
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:19.200]  gentlemen, of all the dark technology. What the U.S. has, what, like 20 times the submarine
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:28.600]  to China? 30 times the aircraft carriers? But then you watch the globalist poison in
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:32.920]  our military and all the rest of that. Oh, they're trying to undermine it to get people
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:37.560]  in they want they'll accept being part of an evil military. But China shouldn't take
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:45.520]  that as as a weakness. It's all about power. It's all about control. But yes, it was the
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:51.560]  Clintons that gave them so much of the technology. That's coming up next segment. I'm gonna do
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:58.560]  something right here. That's important. You don't want the globalist to be successful
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:03.240]  and capture the flag. You don't want them to be able to take this standard of resistance
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:09.280]  off the air. And you've seen the unprecedented moves in the news against us. And that's only
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.080]  the tip of the iceberg, as they say, the proverbial floating mass of ice. What you see on the
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.160]  surface is maybe 5% of what's going on behind the scenes. Well, they need to take us off
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:22.840]  the air because we're the tip of the spear. And because we've woken up so many people
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:26.480]  and because we've woken up so many prominent people, and it's getting more intense by the
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:31.280]  day. And so they really blame this show and you, the listeners, that's what they really
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:36.720]  want to silence for the fact that the new world order isn't a lot of trouble. Because
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:41.280]  if we expose how the power structure works and what its big end game is, people then
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:49.200]  recognize these Machiavellian systems and come together and say no. And we'll be able
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:54.720]  to have a better future. And they don't like that. And so it's very simple. We need to
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:03:01.320]  stay on air. We need to be able to launch a lot of new projects like COVIDland Part 1.
[1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:05.640]  There's going to be four other parts. That's already reached conservatively 15 million
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:09.520]  people. If you count all the places, it's being downloaded and shared and watched. Four
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:15.560]  plus million at Bandod Video alone. And then tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of DVDs
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:19.680]  going out with people making copies and getting around the sensors that way. That's just one
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:28.120]  thing that we are involved in. And I would not call that of the projects I've got going.
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:33.160]  I've got eight big projects we haven't announced or finished yet, but they're close. And all
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:38.320]  those projects are bigger than COVIDland. And COVIDland was big. And they did almost all
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:41.800]  the work so it was easy for us. So I don't even, you know, completely count as one of
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:46.720]  our projects, even though we're heavily involved in it. It is a project. We have been pregnant
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:53.400]  for a while. Had a lot of distractions, a lot of things, but this stuff is all launching.
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:58.920]  Now like fuel in a rocket, it's how much fuel can I put in the projects? Because having
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:05.800]  extra money makes it where I can finish these and get these launched properly and not half
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:10.280]  ass. So we need a lot of money right now. And we've got products you need. So it's like
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:16.020]  a horse and carriage that goes together. It's like milk and cereal. Okay. Or it's like cream
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:21.160]  gravy and biscuits, man. It goes together real good. So we need you to go to infowarstore.com.
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:26.640]  These are products you already need. 360 win. And again, we have a very limited supply.
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:32.880]  It will sell out probably by this weekend. Rain Force Ultra, which is the cleanest, most
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:37.080]  powerful, fast acting energy. And it goes away in a few hours. My experience of people
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:42.080]  say it lasts longer for them. Turbo Force is 10 hours. This is super fast acting. Brain
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:47.040]  boosting stuff. It's discounted. Even though it's selling out infowarstore.com. Try Brain
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:52.920]  Force Ultra if you haven't and bodies is back at stock 40% off along with DNA Force 40%
[1:04:52.920 --> 1:05:00.920]  off the DNA force will go off sale next week. I am taping. I'm taping this message on the
[1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:07.960]  morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021. And I've got some great news to report to the
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:12.960]  listeners. For at least one week, we're going to be able to run a sale with bodies ultimate
[1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:18.440]  turmeric formula that just got back in stock after being sold out almost five months because
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:25.720]  of supply chain breakdowns. It has a 95% curcuminoid level. Most of the turmeric supplements have
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:32.000]  a five to 10% curcuminoid level. Our leading competitor has a 75% curcuminoid level. This
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.840]  is a special proprietary concentrate. It is so good for information for your immune system
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:43.440]  as an antioxidant for your whole body. It's documented. It's amazing. Everybody knows
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:47.600]  that turmeric is an incredible thing that God created and bodies is the strongest and
[1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:53.120]  best you're going to find and it's back in stock and it funds the info war 40% off for
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:57.920]  a limited time that goes back to regular price right now. Then foreshore.com run the special
[1:05:57.920 --> 1:06:27.720]  for one week. So here's the big question. Everybody's got to be asking themselves and
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:31.640]  I'm not talking about this great audience of activist listeners that are the tip of the
[1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:38.080]  spear. I'm talking about the millions of people that tune in every day when they go find info
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:42.880]  wars.com forward slash show or band on video or free world news dot TV or all other places
[1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:49.280]  you can find links to the verb bidden verboten information. They tune in to see what all
[1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:54.760]  the hubbub's about and they go, wow, most of them say that was really powerful info and
[1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:59.120]  I went and looked it up and it was true and I didn't realize how dire the straits were
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:03.640]  and we're not telling you how dire the straits are. How bad the situation is because we don't
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:09.200]  think we can get out of it. I believe in you and if you start believing in yourself and
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:13.580]  believing in God working through you, there's nothing we can't do together, but it's really
[1:07:13.580 --> 1:07:18.320]  very, very simple. So next segment, I want to play a viral video of a woman predicting
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:25.560]  cupboard pandemic in 2019 warned of global tyranny and Vax mandates. Now I did the exact
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:29.480]  same predictions at the time. I don't know if she's a listener. I want to get her on.
[1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:36.720]  It's not about credit. She saw it herself and could see them pre positioning the propaganda
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:40.320]  and that's what I've explained. People ask, how do you know this beforehand? Well, I can
[1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:44.280]  read the light papers and the books. These people have written dead Rockefeller wrote
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:48.040]  books saying I want a world government. I want to take over. I don't want general public
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:52.600]  being able to control their destiny. I mean, Klaus Schwab says that on the Davos website.
[1:07:52.600 --> 1:07:57.000]  It's linked on Wikipedia on his Klaus Schwab site. He wants to capture governments of the
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:06.920]  world and needs to be run by major corporations because they know best. So people that serve
[1:08:06.920 --> 1:08:17.320]  the system unwittingly are becoming red pilled. They're becoming decompartmentalized and they're
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:22.560]  finding out that there really is a death sentence for humanity and we really are being erased
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:27.080]  and we really are being attacked. And it's being done not to save the earth, but so these
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:33.640]  globalists can play God and they believe become God by merging with machines and testing all
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:42.320]  of the cyborg angle of immortality. They believe they're developing with the genetic arm of
[1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:48.680]  this and then they've got their quantum study going on about interdimensional transcendence,
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:58.800]  but their eye is fixed on immortality artificially and that's what they've been promised by their
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:07.800]  benefactor. You may have heard of the benefactor, but God says was marooned here on this planet
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:15.720]  and it's not allowed to leave. Oh, and we're in the cage with it. You'd say, well, God
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:21.160]  is a sadist. No, that's a very loving thing to do. We are God's children. We're making
[1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:27.800]  God's image and God wants to test us and we have free will. So God is going to put us
[1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:34.880]  down into the pit. And I really appreciate that. Elon Musk is worried about people who
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.920]  talk of AI gods. Well, a lot of people are critical of Musk and I think he's got his
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:43.800]  bad side and Greg Greese to report attacking him. I'm so sure I respect Greg Greese and
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:48.280]  like his perspective, but Musk has really been signaling he's against the new world
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:52.960]  order and all the rest of stuff lately. And so that either means he knows they're in trouble
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:58.840]  and he wants to take over from them or he really does care about his immortal soul. I
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:05.880]  guess only Elon Musk knows that fellow austinite, but I digress. Let's let's let's let's get
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:14.720]  into the real heart of this. People are coming to the point of that moment of truth where
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:17.840]  they say, am I really going to be part of this new world order? I'm going to be really
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:22.320]  part of something that destroys myself and my family and my future. Am I really going
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:30.560]  to pretend like I'm getting ahead in this system by complying with it when I can see
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.760]  that it's going to destroy prosperity, destroy security, destroy innocence, destroy every
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:41.120]  form of freedom? Do you really want to sign on to give an experimental shot that absolutely
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:46.040]  wrecks the immune system of little children? And then in rat studies, they have given similar
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:51.200]  mRNA vaccines to them and it ends up killing the majority of the rats very, very quickly
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:57.600]  in just a few months or years. I mean, are you really into child sacrifice? Because that's
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:03.720]  what this is. And is that what you want to be part of? People have now reached that point.
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  Let me tell you who's coming up today. Speaking of these new projects we're launching, one
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:16.000]  of the most important, if not the most important, I'm developing right now with some great people
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  and I've got to go do that. And so I can't do the third hour today. Owen Schroyer's
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.320]  going to come in and do a great job and I shot a little special report with my oldest
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:28.160]  daughter while we were hiking. And so it's interesting that that's going to air in the
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:33.320]  third hour. And in the fourth hour, we have Wayne Allen Root, who's just amazing. We're
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:37.280]  going to turn him loose and I don't need to introduce Wayne Allen Root. He's going to
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:41.680]  be taken over in the fourth hour. Then Owen comes back at 3 p.m. central with the war
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:46.200]  room. And then I'm going to be doing some other special reports and things. We're going
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:54.640]  to be launching a lot of new stuff. We're going to launch three new things by December.
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:00.440]  And then the really big stuff is going to be coming in January. And you won't know about
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.440]  that until January. And the enemy's got all our phones tapped and everything. I'll say
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:10.880]  no, we're up here. That's why they're so pissed. And I really shouldn't gloat. It's not Christian.
[1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:17.400]  But people are trying to kill me and destroy me and stop me. It makes me super excited,
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:22.480]  super energized. And I just love kicking their ass politically. I love watching these devil
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:28.480]  worshipers and pedophiles. I mean, our enemies are pedophiles and Satanists. I really like
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:33.000]  seeing them know that I'm beyond their grasp and that they could do anything to me. And
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:40.120]  I just put it in God's hands. That's what enrages them, is that my courage is so strong
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:44.800]  that it's constantly fulfilling me millisecond to millisecond. It's all God. I'm not up
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:52.720]  here saying, I mean, I don't just have courage about this. I enjoy this. And that's been
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:56.720]  God doing that. And that's your prayer. So I'm very humble about that. But they don't
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:03.600]  want this spirit, this energy spreading, because this spirit right here, they don't like it.
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:08.680]  It's a spirit of courage. And it's a spirit of will. And it's a spirit of ready to do
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:14.840]  what it takes and ready to go the full measure. And they don't like that because they like
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:17.840]  fear. They like people that are scared of them. Well, let me tell you something. I'm
[1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:23.640]  not scared of these people. I'm scared to be in cut off from the eternal super being
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:28.360]  from the all powerful omnipresence. That is what I want to be in the countenance of.
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:36.880]  I want to be on my knees with forever. I have experienced the energy that nothing else can
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.720]  compare to. And I would die a trillion tortured deaths to experience that energy one more
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:49.160]  time. And I'm going to experience it for absolute total completion with you. I mean, it's not
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:57.240]  even not even a debate about this. I am so absolutely beyond driven to continue to be
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:02.320]  in that presence forever that the enemy's attacks and all of it doesn't even register
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:10.040]  because this is a magnitude upon magnitude upon magnitude so perfect. It is unimaginable
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:21.000]  until you've experienced it. Let's just stop there. King David called it the quiet place
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:34.360]  of the most high. And that's the what you would theoretically call the 11th dimension.
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:42.160]  Unbelievable. That's all I just it's it's easy. It's just unspeakably, unbelievably good.
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:47.440]  I just there's not even again, because ecstasy is almost something you can't handle. Ecstasy
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:15:01.200]  is low level. Actual total completion. Actual interfacing with eternity, all the past, all
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:06.320]  the present, all the future, all interconnected forever. And then there's no time. There's
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:11.240]  no there's like, man, I'm going to just be in perfect bliss forever. How imagine being
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:18.800]  Satan and being into that total completion and then to saying, I don't want to be with
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:23.760]  this. And because that thing is so good, then you wonder why everything the devil does
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:28.480]  is so bad. But see, it had to exist, didn't it? Because free will has to exist. You can't
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:31.880]  wave a magic wand and make everybody love God. Everybody see this. Everybody know this.
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:42.640]  You can't do that. So there has to be a devil, doesn't there? Doesn't there? That's why they
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:50.280]  call that what sympathy for the devil? Well, I don't really have that at all. I'm just glad
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:16:20.080]  I'm not the devil. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:16:21.080 --> 1:16:25.680]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and
[1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:31.560]  minerals that are essential for life on this planet. And so the information we cover exposes
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:36.640]  their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover. And we're having an incredible effect
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.840]  thanks to your support and your word of mouth. But it's also important to take care of our
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:47.240]  bodies themselves with high quality water filtration and info works to our com with amazing supplements,
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:51.560]  many of which that just came back in stock, like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula. Now
[1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:57.040]  40% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com. So let's fight the info war, but also take
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:05.960]  care of our bodies. The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery,
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:12.280]  a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:18.600]  has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:24.560]  emerge. It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad must cover disease criminal
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:33.280]  faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:41.000]  surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.560]  destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:51.040]  microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if
[1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:56.880]  we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance,
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:03.200]  noncompliance. The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:08.120]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:12.920]  that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:18.720]  are powerful. And the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:25.360]  famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:31.720]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:38.720]  propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:42.560]  they know we are strong. And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:46.400]  who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the
[1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:50.640]  air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:55.720]  are manifesting and setting up is Jay Cannon. And we are opposing the one world government
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:58.520]  and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:03.040]  By now you've heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing products.
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:08.600]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio remediation products
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:12.800]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer. They're literally changing
[1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:17.400]  the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system. The bio pros are excited
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:22.880]  to release Bio Porta Pro, a product specifically designed to establish healthy waste tanks
[1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:29.320]  and pits. Bio Porta Pro, Digest Grease, Fats, Oil, Sludge, Paper and Organic Matter with

[1:19:54.320 --> 1:20:00.440]  for yourself.
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:26.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:33.440]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer, but it
[1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:42.440]  didn't look like it. Chips, motorcycles, where the circuits locked free last, and I
[1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:53.440]  kept dreaming of them. I thought I'd never see them. And then, one day, I got in and
[1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:56.440]  I got in.
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:21:04.440]  You got in, all right, buddy. Transhumanists gather in Spain to plan global transformation.
[1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:13.940]  You'll accept a man being a woman or that two women had a baby. You'll accept that these
[1:21:13.940 --> 1:21:19.840]  computers have rights and these human animal spliced creatures have rights and that you
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:30.740]  have no right but to bow. The failed God of this world and all of its twisted, not creations,
[1:21:30.740 --> 1:21:32.240]  but abominations.
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:36.840]  Let's play the Tucker Carlson clip first. I'm going to play viral video, woman predicted
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:42.440]  cub in pandemic 2019, warned of global tyranny and vax mandates. And she said this four months
[1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:49.320]  where there was ever even anything about Wuhan or the Wuhan pneumonia or any of that. But
[1:21:49.320 --> 1:21:52.800]  first, let's play a little bit of Tucker Carlson because that's the other big news here. Not
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:58.080]  just that the NIH came out and said, yeah, Fauci deliberately lied. These are quotes
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:02.880]  and misled Congress, everybody else. He did do this. And we're giving Fauci and Dazik
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:07.640]  all of them five days to give us all of the work you've done ever period because it's
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:12.240]  not 3 million or 20 million or 100 million. It's like the doctor wrote down earlier,
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:20.640]  $190 plus billion in Fauci's history, funding, research into mutation and gain a function.
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:26.080]  Again, it's like saying Michael Jordan never played basketball. It's saying Fauci never
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:33.280]  did gain a function. Or Tom Brady never played football. Tom Brady was in front of Congress
[1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:37.320]  saying, I've never been in the football. I don't know what it is. You're like, okay,
[1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:43.560]  well, you're like, how many time world champion? Nope, I'm not. So it's not even about getting
[1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:47.800]  Fauci in prison. That's important. It's about what does this mean in the power structure
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:51.480]  this came out? Well, it means they're getting ready to burn Fauci and Peter Dazik and others
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:57.560]  to protect the people above them. It also means people in government are figuring out
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:00.840]  wait, this really is a depopulation operation. This is really about to happen. And the mutinies
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:04.640]  are so big inside the power structure that they're going, hey, we didn't get away with
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:11.520]  this. The public knows we did this. Let's start putting the brakes on this because
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:14.400]  they had a plan when they start injecting the children and they start dying in mass.
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:19.480]  It's already happened in the studies where they've been doing all the claimants authorized
[1:23:19.480 --> 1:23:24.160]  that they're just going to end up being people that they're going to start shooting folks.
[1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:28.760]  And I don't want that to happen. But they intended that to then call people terrorists.
[1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:32.840]  But they know that's not going to work when mad dads and mad moms or neighbors or whatever
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:38.840]  or grandparents go after big pharma for this bio weapon attack. They know that no matter
[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:43.000]  how they do it, no matter how many false flags they pull to make us look bad, the public's
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.600]  just going to go, yeah, let's go ahead and rise up. And so they're gauging things and
[1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:51.720]  thinking we wanted to create a world revolution, a world meltdown, a world breakdown. But our
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:55.760]  own doctors, our own scientists, our own lawyers, our own soldiers, our own bureaucrats, our
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:03.360]  own nurses are saying no. Okay. And so now they're having to back off so many other
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:09.080]  agendas because it's not working because their agenda of demoralization and destabilization
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:14.000]  only works if we give up because we don't know who did it. It's like Hitler wanted to
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.120]  make the Brits give up because they wouldn't give up. So we started bombing civilian targets
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:23.120]  and they went from 95% in polls that were against the new war because they just lost,
[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:26.200]  you know, what was it? Six, seven million Brits died in World War I. Almost everybody
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:33.400]  had sons and dads never came back. But within a week of Hitler bombing civilian targets,
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:38.800]  they had a 99% wanted war. But see, the globalists thought, well, we'll intimidate and attack
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:42.360]  them and censor them and bully them and take their bank accounts away and call them Nazis
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:48.280]  and censor them. But they'll never know really who did it, that it's a global combine. Or
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:51.800]  they'll just think it's Joe Biden did it. No, no, we know Joe Biden's a puppet. We know
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:56.440]  who did it, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, Hollywood, the globalist. I mean, we know
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:02.960]  all that. And so you're doing this attack on us and we know it's you. You didn't suppress
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:11.720]  info wars. You failed. You failed bad. And I suggest you depart from the field of battle
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:21.080]  now. Okay. That discretion is the greater form of valor, is it not? But if it is, your
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:26.640]  will to press the attack, then that is the course we're on. And it means world war and
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:32.320]  mass death and billions dead. And it means the globalists dug out of their holes. The
[1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:35.320]  Anglo-American establishment has nothing to do with white people. It's the name of the
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.960]  combine. The Anglo-American corporate system will be destroyed in the process of this.
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:46.800]  It needs to stop. It's so evil. Try to absorb the strength of the West, get rid of Christianity.
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:51.040]  While it parlays the final strength and taking over the world to then carry out this, this
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:56.320]  this, this global operation. And it just got to stop. So now Tucker Carlson and others
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:00.040]  are saying, why are all these mystery illnesses out there? And then he knows they're going
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:04.480]  to attack and say, he's claiming the vaccine's causing mystery illnesses. And then he'll
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:09.840]  go, well, yeah, here's a scientist. ADE was predicted. And now these are ADE symptoms with
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:13.760]  the people that have the shots. Now the next time they come in contact with a regular cold
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:17.920]  virus, it's way worse than COVID. That's what the scientists said years ago. It's what we
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:25.560]  predicted. It's what happened. So we're going into this winter and there's going to be a
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:30.600]  lot of people dying. It's already happening. And of course, they don't test for COVID because
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:37.320]  they don't have COVID. They have ADE. But it's the same damn thing. And it kills your
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:42.320]  lungs. So let's go ahead and to go to Tucker Carlson last night.
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:48.000]  Recent data from around the world show that so-called all cause deaths are running well
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:53.760]  above normal. This is happening in Western Europe, for example. What explains this? What
[1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:56.880]  could explain it? These are not deaths from COVID. These are deaths directly. These are
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:01.040]  deaths from some other things. What are they? Can you just describe the outline of this?
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:05.120]  Because it's a pretty amazing story. And I really am exploring this and have explored
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:08.440]  this a couple of times on the stack, on the sub-stack. And I'm going to go back into that
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:13.200]  again. But let me quickly tell you what we know, which is in the big countries in Western
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:17.520]  Europe, in several of the big countries in Western Europe, notably the UK and Germany,
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:24.240]  which are the two of the largest by population, deaths are suddenly running higher than normal.
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:27.640]  And that's been true in the UK for several months. Remember, the UK vaccinated a lot
[1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:31.960]  of people early this year. They've had deaths running higher than normal for a couple of
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:37.720]  months. Germany, the vaccinations happened closer to the spring and they've had deaths
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:43.520]  higher than normal in September. We don't know why. In the UK, where there's more data,
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.160]  it looks like there's a lot of cardiovascular deaths. They're driving this. We don't know
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:52.360]  what that means. In the US, there are... Let's come back. We'll play the whole thing
[1:27:52.360 --> 1:27:56.560]  again next segment and write the conclusion. Yeah, we don't know what that means. If I
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:27:58.840]  walk up to you and shoot you in the head, I don't know why there's blood spurting out
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:02.520]  of it. Or I put gasoline on you and a lot of you don't know why you're on fire. Or I
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:06.800]  put eggs on top, scale it and turn it up on high. I don't know why it fries. I mean,
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:11.480]  I go take a dump in the toilet. I don't know why it stinks. I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:17.280]  The damn CDC documents in October said, we're going to have microcarditis and heart attacks
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:22.920]  and all this other stuff. They knew it. They knew they did it. UT did studies with the same
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:28.880]  type of injections in 2012 in rat studies for Fauci and it frickin killed them with blood
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:37.280]  plots. At least it's starting to come out. We don't have time for this. We don't have
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:42.120]  a year for us to all figure out they knew and did it on purpose. There'll be hundreds
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:46.560]  of millions dead by them. You already see the numbers up around the world are, oh, doubles
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.320]  in the heart attacks, doubles in the strokes, triples in little kids dying. It's all happening
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:29:03.360]  from the shots.
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:29.840]  My wife loves turmeric. She has joint pain, but just take a lot of it, the type of stuff
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:33.640]  she buys at the grocery store for it to work. She started taking this and said, I only need
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:39.160]  to take one pill instead of four. Why is it so good? It's not just turmeric. It's concentrated
[1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:44.080]  with the proprietary process. It's back in stock. It's being sold out almost five months

[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:05.600]  God created each and every one of us with free will. But we look at the world system now
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:10.920]  openly announcing the mark of the beast. Everything that it's attempting to do is built around
[1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:16.600]  getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies,
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:25.120]  our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them. They want control
[1:32:25.120 --> 1:32:29.000]  of appropriation. They want control of the relationships between men and women. They
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:35.720]  want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization. All of us were
[1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:40.880]  formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will. And make no mistake
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:46.040]  all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you
[1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:53.040]  could make the right decision free will and stand against evil. And then for eternity
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:33:01.440]  win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:24.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:35.720]  Okay, so I know what Tucker Carlson is doing. He is a journalist. He's very professional
[1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:41.520]  and he knows all this information, but he is laying a trap for the left. And I'm usually
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.360]  okay with that. And it always ends up making him be proven right and that they're liars
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:50.680]  and that's good to discredit them at the same time. But we don't have time for that because
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:54.760]  we don't have time to have the sub-stack journalist on that talks about, yeah, we don't know why
[1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:59.120]  people are having myocarditis and heart attacks and platelet counts fall through the floor
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:06.280]  and brain aneurysms and autoimmune diseases and, you know, 20-fold increase in this type
[1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:10.760]  of cancer. I mean, we don't know why all over the world right after people take the shots.
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:16.160]  That's happening because they never did studies that were public. So that's why. And then
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:19.480]  they just always just say, okay, we don't know what happened. That's why they skipped
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:22.240]  the studies because they'd already secretly done them and that's come out under other
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:27.680]  names. They knew exactly what would happen with this. This has all been played out. The
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:33.120]  only variable is will you wake up and admit it's happening? When you're faced with them
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:37.920]  actually exterminating you and your family and coming for children, can you handle the
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:41.440]  fact that of course they want to abort children before they're born and now they want to kill
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:44.480]  them after they're born and now they want to kill them now. And they want to erase their
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:49.760]  immune systems and make them minions of the system in their short, painful lives. That's
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:54.760]  in their own internal documents, how they're going to be accelerated customers for the medical
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:35:04.760]  system. Oh, yeah. Giving you diseases that they then treat. Absolutely evil. And then
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:07.840]  they control you through that and control you through the treatments that are coming
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:13.400]  to make you so sick and so ill, you can't live without further gene therapies to counteract
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:20.800]  the original gene therapy you gave them when they were young. That's the plan. Poisoning
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:30.040]  you and then withholding the cure. And that's going to be the big issue. The big issue in
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:35.280]  the future is going to be how to detox from these things, how to reverse the damage or
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:39.200]  stop the ongoing damage. And we've got a lot of evidence on that, a lot of information
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:42.560]  and a lot of doctors and scientists are saying if you've been forced to take the shot or
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:47.800]  you had to take ivermectin before, during and after, and it looks like it's mitigating
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:53.500]  by not letting your body manufacture as much of the spike protein, and then it basically
[1:35:53.500 --> 1:36:02.680]  stops a lot of that effect. Still, there's been some problems, but it's been a lot better.
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:07.600]  Because again, the vaccine gives you what they claim they're fighting. Again, double
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:12.800]  jab brits with worst diseases ever, that's what lurgy means, could actually have cover
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:15.640]  without realizing it. Oh yeah, but they go get tested and they don't because they don't.
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:22.880]  They have A.D.E. antibody dependency enhancement. So here's Carlson introducing the idea and
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:27.280]  like, oh, we don't know why, but I just showed you on screen. We'll put it back on screen,
[1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:32.920]  Tucker. Why don't you, Tucker, have the guy from Substack back on and then, you know,
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:37.760]  that guy can say, oh, look, I've discovered that they knew this. And then he can, he can
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:45.720]  discover the 2012 UT study. He can discover the 2013 Baylor discovery. And he can discover,
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:49.120]  you know, the, you know, because we, I don't care who discovered it. Just let, let the
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:53.720]  his guest discover it and then we can send people to prison. Because I just want to beat
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:58.200]  these people, but we don't have time to like slowly introduce it to people and then show
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:03.080]  them and oh, and then the, oh, Tucker implies that the vaccine's killing people. That's
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:08.040]  preposterous. Tucker implies it doesn't protect you trucker. Of course, it's all true, but
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:13.640]  we don't have time for that. Just bring it all out. It's all there. It's all incontrovertible.
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:17.480]  I think people can handle being hit with a two by four to wake them up or a cold bucket
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:22.880]  of water. We don't have time anymore. Here's, here's the guest.
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:28.600]  Recent data from around the world show that so-called all cause deaths are running well
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:34.360]  above normal. This is happening in Western Europe, for example. What explains this? What
[1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:37.480]  could explain it? These are not deaths from COVID. These are deaths directly. These are
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:41.640]  deaths for some other things. What are they? Can you just describe the outline of this?
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:45.720]  Because it's a pretty amazing story. Right. And I really am exploring this and have explored
[1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:49.080]  this a couple of times on the stack, on the sub stack. And I'm going to go back into that
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:53.800]  again, but let me quickly tell you what we know, which is in the big countries in Western
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:58.120]  Europe, in several of the big countries in Western Europe, notably the UK and Germany,
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:04.840]  which are the two of the largest by population, deaths are suddenly running higher than normal.
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:08.240]  And that's been true in the UK for several months. Remember, the UK vaccinated a lot
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:12.600]  of people early this year. They've had deaths running higher than normal for a couple of
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:18.320]  months. Germany, the vaccinations happened closer to the spring and they've had deaths
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:24.120]  higher than normal in September. We don't know why. In the UK, where there's more data,
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:27.760]  it looks like there's a lot of cardiovascular deaths that are driving this. We don't know
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:33.920]  what that means. In the US, there has been an excess in mortality in people under 50
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:38.440]  that has gone on for two years now. And we have a terrible number of deaths happening
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:43.000]  in people that age. Some of those deaths are COVID. Some of those deaths appear to be lockdown
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:48.480]  related or IE drug overdoses, which we know are running really high. But in the last few
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:53.480]  months, even as COVID deaths fell in the spring, deaths in that age group remained very high
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:59.440]  in the US. And again, there's a couple possibilities. One possibility is that some COVID deaths are
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:04.800]  being miscounted, although we count COVID deaths very aggressively. Another possibility is
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:08.720]  that it's these lockdown slash drug overdose deaths, although Europe doesn't have nearly
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.760]  the problem that we do with that. Another possibility, and I hesitate even to say this
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.600]  out loud, Tucker, because I know what the response will be, is that this is cardiac related
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  and it is something to do with the mass vaccination campaigns. But, you know, we don't have evidence.
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:29.880]  We don't have enough evidence to separate what the possibilities are. All we know is
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:35.360]  that people are dying at unprecedented rates in the US in the 30 to 50 age group, the 20
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:39.760]  to 50 age group. And now we're seeing excess mortality in some European countries. And
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:41.640]  we really should find out why.
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:47.240]  Yeah, Alex Barron said is a smart guy. And I'm glad he's on there. And we have a couple
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:52.200]  of articles about him today. He says the media's agenda is not to mislead people, but to demoralize
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:55.360]  them. And that's absolutely true. That's what they're doing to everybody. That's another
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:01.880]  article on m4wars.com. But I have right here from the FDA is on a website in the CDC list
[1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:06.960]  of adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine in October. That's three months before they
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:14.040]  rolled it out. And oh, look at the list. It's microcarditis, a guion beret and narcolepsy
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:21.480]  and anaphylaxis and just everything else we said. Oh, okay. If you want to find it, here's
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:26.320]  the original article from back in July. Oops, FDA. We didn't find out about it until then.
[1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:30.400]  Accidentally reveals list of COVID vaccine side effects, including microcarditis, auto
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:37.960]  immune disease and death. Well, that'll mess up your day. Oh, but this is from a couple
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:42.040]  weeks ago. John Hopkins data proves COVID shots causing majority of illicit death.
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:45.720]  You know, I've got hundreds of really interesting articles and things that are new, but I just
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:49.600]  keep going back to this every day because that's John Hopkins. And it all over the world,
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  right when the shot starts, death skyrockets. Illness is everything else, right? And then
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:41:01.720]  I've got it all over the world admitting it. So what are we going to do about this? I mean,
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:07.960]  again, they think that we just are hit with something this evil. We can't handle it.
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:12.400]  I'm going to go to break and I will get to viral video of woman predicting COVID pandemic
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:17.200]  in 2019, warned of global tyranny and vax mandates. And then I'm going to hit some other
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:22.120]  geopolitical and China missile news. But this is a globalist anti human revolution. And
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:26.640]  they are actually meeting in Spain and declaring they're about to forcibly transform humanity.
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:32.240]  We'll talk more about that as well separately. We're not funded by George Soros or the big

[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:23.040]  force plus is the most powerful in force life formally yet. I think I wrote that like six
[1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:27.600]  seven years ago. We need to update it is it's our flagship King Daddy product info war
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:31.760]  store.com and what's in it is very expensive. And that's why you find out that they sell
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:36.000]  this like doctors clinics and stuff for three times the price. We're selling a very similar
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.880]  formula because the PQQ and CoQ 10 once the good type costs a lot and a limited supply
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:43.800]  came in. I said anytime you get the ingredients just make it even if it's a small run, only
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:48.640]  a couple thousand bottles can sell it a few days. Brain force ultra experience this level
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.440]  of energy and clarity. It's something special about this. The most powerful thing yet we've
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:58.880]  made when it comes to energy brain force ultra. By now you've heard me talk about it was almost
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:03.880]  15 years ago that I've released my seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:09.240]  And that documentary I predicted the globalist with established world government are releasing
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:14.760]  a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:19.880]  our industrial society. And now they've done it. How did I know they would do it because
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:24.480]  they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:29.400]  were leaked. You see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group whose head at the time was
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:34.720]  Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:39.520]  this great reset. Well we're now living in a purposeful collapse of the third world and
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:44.640]  the first world on its ass. It's a tyrannical corporate world government. Total censorship
[1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:51.040]  no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:55.840]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us in the populace. This is what info
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.240]  wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future. In late August info wars saw an explosion
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:07.080]  of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:14.280]  planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.

[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:11.680]  do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:16.920]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:21.800]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:25.680]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial

[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:25.800]  that supports us here. You are a family. We are a family and it's been quite a journey
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:33.240]  and we're in this together and I'm just very thankful for all of you because I am just
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:37.960]  a focal point in this fight and it is all of you that are just as important or more

[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:46.720]  and attacked or things get rough sometimes I understand that you're part of something

[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:07.080]  Creator thanking the Creator for consciousness and not being selfish and then creating other
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:12.720]  entities that could share in this universe. Thank you Lord. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:19.960]  you. And we understand your will and we follow it. We don't know all your mysteries but we
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:24.480]  understand it will be with you in eternity and we thank you for the gift of consciousness.
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:32.600]  Amen. All right. Let's get to this because before I play this lady's clip I want to play
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:38.520]  the evil premiere in one of the Australian states. Speaking of news conference, Andrew's
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:43.080]  commented he's unsure why the state of New South Wales has set a timetable for easing
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:47.320]  restrictions on the vaccinated. He said it won't be happening in Victoria and you'll
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:52.440]  never wait him out. You will take the shot. And they're going, I was reading last night,
[1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:57.720]  to remote Australian areas that are 600 miles from a town that no one ever visits that you
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:03.280]  have to get to by boats because helicopters can hardly even go 600 miles and that they're
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:08.240]  forcibly injecting the aborigines who don't even aren't going to be around COVID. The
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:14.680]  aborigines are fighting back. They're hunting down people in the middle of the desert to
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:18.880]  make them do this and the aborigines are running from them because they say they've injected
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:23.920]  us before and our babies die when they give us shots. They're not stupid. So they're
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:29.000]  all holed up with their bows and arrows waiting to kill the UN people. I mean, that's how
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.320]  crazy this is. Here it is.
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:37.680]  Look, why would you just get the system going? Why would you have the thing up and running
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:43.080]  and then essentially pull all that down, pull all the architecture that you built, all
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:46.560]  the infrastructure that you built, the culture that you've changed? Why would you change
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:49.840]  that four or five weeks later? We will not be doing that here. I'm not going to say
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:53.600]  to someone, oh, look, just wait us out, will you? Just wait four or five weeks and then
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:58.440]  you'll be able to go to the pub. No. If you make the judgment to not get vaccinated and
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:02.640]  you reckon you can wait out us or the publican or whoever you want to think you're waiting
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:07.360]  out, you won't wait out the virus because the virus will be here for a long time and
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:13.920]  your only protection against it is being vaccinated. This will be well into 2022, well and truly
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:18.280]  into 2022. Then we're going to get into booster issues. So it won't be your first and second
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:22.400]  dose. It'll be have you have you have you had your third. And then the other issue will
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:29.440]  be, well, who knows what variants coming? Who knows? Like we don't. So we've got every
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:32.200]  reason to be confident with every reason to be optimistic enough.
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:36.280]  Shut it down. I can't listen anymore. I mean, you want to see something as bad as Hitler?
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:40.880]  I mean, that you're looking at it. That is a stash, an enemy of humanity. And then they
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:43.680]  go on to say it's never going to end. It's never going to stop and there's going to be
[1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:49.800]  more shots. You see? Oh, and by the way, they kill you. So here is viral video woman predicted
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:55.280]  COVID-19 pandemic 2019 born to global tyranny and vax mandates. I want to get her on. She's
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:58.720]  got a current channel. She's posting videos. They're excellent just this week. Watch forum
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:03.840]  last night. This is what's going to happen globally. We don't wake up the YouTuber accurately
[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:09.240]  predicted. And again, the video uploaded to YouTube September 20, 2019 is going viral
[1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:13.360]  after predictions made. The post ended up coming true over the next couple of years.
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:17.120]  The video shot almost four months before the World Organization, World Health Organization
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:21.240]  first announced mysterious coronavirus related pneumonia was being found in the Wuhan, China
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:25.920]  posted in the YouTube channel of Cabin Talk, a woman named Claudia told her followers,
[1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:29.160]  they're planning a pandemic. I'm so sure of it. And then she predicted that Bill Gates
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:35.200]  would run it and that would be a global government, global takeover. Here it is. Hi guys, it's
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:43.600]  Claudia with Cabin Talk and I am just about to lose it. Okay. They are planning a pandemic.
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:50.160]  I am so sure of that. First of all, Bill Gates said there will be a pandemic and at least
[1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:59.800]  30 million people will die. Boom. Then just now Trump signed an executive order that there
[1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:07.400]  is going to be a new task force to make a better flu vaccine and a faster flu vaccine
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:15.440]  because in case there is a pandemic, we are not prepared enough. And I am just about beside
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:23.200]  myself. He signed an executive order to create a flu vaccine task force. I mean, how much
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:29.960]  more clear can it get that we have mandatory adult vaccines just around the corner, just
[1:52:29.960 --> 1:52:35.880]  around the corner? Okay, this is where we are at in this country. And I tell you something,
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:43.080]  if there is a pandemic anywhere, there will be global everything. Because you know what,
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:47.520]  you know what will happen? All the countries will say, well, oh, we have to rally together
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:54.200]  because with airplanes, the viruses can travel so fast. And we all globally implement the
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:53:03.920]  same damn laws, which will be mandatory vaccines with toxic in our bodies that has not at all
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:10.880]  been proven effective or safe. But that's where we're heading. That is exactly where
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:15.400]  we're heading. Exactly where we're heading. And by the way, in California, they already
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:22.560]  passed the law that some little Chosmo at some little health department in bump nowhere
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:27.920]  can decide that Oh, three people, five people have the same thing. I need to implement martial
[1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:36.200]  law. And that little Chosmo can implement martial law. I mean, what else do we need?
[1:53:36.200 --> 1:53:40.880]  What else do we need to wake up? I mean, the Trump executive order of anybody thought that
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:47.320]  any president is better than any other president. Excuse me, where have you been? And don't
[1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:53.640]  forget to go voting again, because there will be change. There will be so much change in
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:54:06.160]  the next election. Maybe we get another Democrat. Oh, my God. I mean, I can't even I can't even
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:14.400]  like this is what is going to happen globally if we don't wake up. I mean, what else is
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:21.080]  there? What else do you need to know? Honestly, what else do you need to know? The pharmaceutical
[1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:31.160]  industry and the health care industry is paying is paying doctors bonuses for shooting us
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:37.320]  up with it, whether that's chemotherapy or whether that's vaccines doesn't even matter.
[1:54:37.320 --> 1:54:46.120]  They get bonuses, okay, for destroying children by the age of two, 10 mandatory vaccines by
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:53.240]  the age of two with multiple doses, by the way, not just 10 vaccines. All right, let's
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:54:59.680]  pay that down. The full video is on info wars.com. And I've told my producers I want her on yesterday.
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:04.960]  I mean, I want her on. But here's the thing. She's put on a video saying I did not predict
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:08.520]  the future. That's her newest video on her channel. I simply paid attention. And that's
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:14.000]  what I keep telling all you. You saw me 10 years ago, 12 years ago, say exactly what
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:21.600]  she just said there. Did I tell the future? No, these damn people are out to get us. I
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:25.000]  mean, I told you a year ago, you know, Australia, they'll say it's permanent more shots. He
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:32.960]  just said it to you. And then I told you a year ago with top scientists 16, 18, 19, 20
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:38.240]  months ago, that the shots will cause autoimmune disease and blood clots because that's what
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:53.840]  vaccines for coronaviruses do. And all over the world. This is in Brazil. But there's
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:56:00.600]  also new footage coming out. Similar things I saw last night in very remote areas of Australia.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:04.880]  Because again, when all the white folks showed up there in one prison ships, they wanted
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:09.880]  to stay on the coast. It's beautiful jungle. But 95% of Australia is mountains and desert
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:14.120]  and giant, beautiful lakes that are in the middle of the deserts. I mean, it's people
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:17.840]  who have been there. They say it's insane. It's like like Planet of the Apes type, you
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:23.040]  know, architecture or landscape. It's just amazing. Natural architecture. And the average
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:27.640]  of these aren't stupid. They've been sterilized and killed in eugenics. They run. And so,
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:35.080]  yeah, that's what's going on. Oh, it's going to be taken over. I'm going to do a little
[1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:38.280]  bit more time here. We're going to come back. But I've just got to recap the top stories.
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:41.320]  This is the biggest show we've ever done. And you notice it keeps every few weeks. It's
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:44.760]  the biggest, the biggest things just get bigger and bigger. I got to hit this China news.
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:50.320]  He'll take over 15 after separately. Again, we need funds right now to really take the
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:53.760]  global standpoint like range. I can't just sit here at this size. We're either going
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:58.440]  to implode or we're going to massively expand. That's just the way this works. And I've decided
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:04.000]  to take it to the new world order. And I've almost closed on selling my house so I can
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.280]  get extra money to throw it all into the fight. I mean, I intend to spend everything I've
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:14.920]  got to just maximize right now historically to get the word out and do a whole bunch of
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:19.360]  exciting things. But the money I'll make at my house, even though Austin prices have doubled
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:24.480]  in the last few years, it'll just be enough to help a few of the projects. I need you
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:30.160]  to go to infowarstore.com and get great products like DNA Force Plus, 40% off back at stock
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:34.640]  that's going to end in by next week. And of course, a limited supply, a brain force ultra
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:39.240]  back in stock, a very small run, and it's 25% off. And it is incredible. It's not just
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:46.520]  it's not just a stimulant. It creates a new tropic effect. That's amazing infowarstore.com.
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:54.040]  The engineers at bio. I'm taking this message on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021.
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:58.920]  And I've got some great news to report to the listeners for at least one week. We're going
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:04.560]  to be able to run a sale with bodies ultimate turmeric formula that just got back in stock
[1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:11.520]  after being sold out almost five months because supply chain breakdowns. It has a 95% curcuminoid
[1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:17.280]  level. Most of the turmeric supplements have a five to 10% curcuminoid level. Our leading
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:23.480]  competitor has a 75% curcuminoid level. This is a special proprietary concentrate. It is
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:28.760]  so good for information for your immune system. It's an antioxidant for your whole body.
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:33.680]  It's documented. It's amazing. Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that

[1:58:49.960 --> 1:58:59.960]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:10.120]  humanity. Then our God see the reward us with eternal life. That's basically the ethos
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:18.080]  of the globalists. They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:23.040]  in their social Darwinistic system. And in a way they're right. If we let them lie to
[1:59:23.040 --> 1:59:28.800]  us and dump us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:35.680]  and out in the open we really deserve what's happened to us. So I asked you now, are you
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:41.480]  going to step up and expose the new order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up
[1:59:41.480 --> 1:59:49.200]  and redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is info wars.com.
[1:59:49.200 --> 2:00:02.520]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:02.520 --> 2:00:15.120]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lines, disinformation.
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:24.520]  Out on the streets, stalking the night. I can hear their heavy breathing. Paid for
[2:00:24.520 --> 2:00:48.960]  the kill, but it doesn't seem right. Something there I don't believe in. All the people inside
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:54.200]  the N I H, the FK, all of knowing they're killing people, knowing it's a corporate takeover.
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:02.320]  Now figuring out that they're all expendable too. And it's all just a shot in the dark.
[2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:08.320]  And once you sign on to killing kids, you're cut off from God. You're as long as Satan.
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:15.680]  You want to work for Satan? Here's your chance. I'm here to make sure you know that choice
[2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:29.200]  is being made right now. All right, here we go. What a time to be alive right now. I
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:35.040]  mean, again, I could do 10 hours. You know, I may just do an emergency broadcast tonight
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:38.040]  after I could do it. There's a very important mission I'm about to be on here. It's things
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:46.040]  we're up to. I mean, we should be running around in the streets with honking cars handing
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:51.120]  out flyers about this. I mean, the guy that ran the federal government bio weapons program
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:54.680]  cooked this up and released it on us for Bill Gates, the new order to take over. And they're
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:59.320]  doing it with the World ID rolling out with martial law of the world and forced injections.
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:07.320]  And then the N I H, National Institute of Health burns Fauci and burns them. Oh, here's
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:11.120]  the key. I was already thinking this. Where's my phone? I was already thinking this at the
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:15.080]  start of the show, and I meant to get to this. And I saw emails popping up from people from
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:19.560]  friends and others. And I just want to say this right now, not going to say who the friend
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:26.000]  is when we're with except the subject is Fauci. As a result of the NIH admission with respect
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:32.840]  to Fauci and his viral activities, this is now the time for Trump to stand up in front
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:38.240]  of the American people and admit that he was misled, lied to and made a huge mistake with
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:45.200]  warped speed. If you would then admit to the people that we are under attack by the actions
[2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:51.080]  of the involved traders, American patriots would awaken as one and the Democratic Party
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:03:00.440]  would crack. It is time Trump, Alex, passed us on to him regards. Yeah, I can get that
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:05.120]  message to Trump and I have gotten that exact message to Trump. And I'm just going to leave
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:13.600]  it at that. And then the response I get is being followed around and death-threaded and
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:17.080]  all the rest of it just gets 10 times worse because, I mean, the phones are tapped. They
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:21.640]  know what Roger Stone goes in and tells him. They know all of it. I mean, I'm trying to
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:26.840]  knock on, you know, talk how great we are here or wherever. But you've seen Trump come
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:30.560]  out and say, people have a right to not take it now and I think the booster shots are a
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:34.160]  scam. We said Trump just at least do that because it's going to come out what Fauci
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:38.000]  did and how they set you up. And I mean, not people that are in the meetings, okay? And
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:41.200]  Trump's like, I just can't believe it. It's really hurting people. I don't believe that.
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:44.040]  Well, I took it and, you know, I'm like, well, sir, you probably weren't actually giving
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:53.000]  it. We're not going to take that risk. So they give Trump stuff that works like Regeneron.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  He got better in five hours. Like he said, he's like, I feel better than I ever felt.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.600]  Good God, what the hell is this stuff? So when people put 20 million Y blood cells in
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:08.120]  your ass, you're going to feel better. So I don't know what to say at this point, okay?
[2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:13.440]  But what that individual said is dead on and Trump is a great asset and ally of freedom
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:17.160]  overall. I know he's good. I know he means well. But if he doesn't extricate himself
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:21.120]  out of this, I mean, let me tell you, he's got a bunch of low grade morons around him
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:25.960]  who got rich off their dad's own success. And, you know, he his dad helped him, but
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:30.840]  he deserved it. Trump's smart. He got a lot done. But if Trump won't save his own ass,
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:41.880]  I can't do it. So that's where I'm at. But as for me, I mean, that vaccine is a bio weapon
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:47.160]  and is a damn assault on humanity. And it's all coming out. So Trump better get his ass
[2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:51.520]  in gear right now that he was set up by Fauci. Are they're going to connect it to him? Something
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:05:03.040]  we predicted over a year and a half ago. I am because of the globalist reset info wars
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:06.840]  listeners and viewers know a lot of our best selling products have been sold out in some
[2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:14.000]  cases for up to a year. Body's ultimate turmeric formula with 95 per secret humanoid has been
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:19.200]  sold out for almost five months. Because again, the high quality tumor and the concentration
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:24.040]  process is very, very expensive and time consuming. And with the supply chain breakdowns
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:27.720]  and all the rest of the problems, we've been unable to get it. But we finally got a shipment
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:33.040]  in and it's 40% off. It is the secret weapon when it comes to your immune system, when
[2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:37.120]  it comes to antioxidants, when it comes to your joints, when it comes to your whole body.
[2:05:37.120 --> 2:05:42.520]  People absolutely love bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, incredible amounts of five star reviews

[2:05:54.880 --> 2:06:22.880]  for a limited time.
[2:06:22.880 --> 2:06:41.880]  And they're walking on the fighting side of all of us. Now coming after our children.
[2:06:41.880 --> 2:06:46.880]  We've already done the experiments and killed a bunch of them. Rest it. Erase our children's
[2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:51.920]  immune systems and then give them antibody dependency enhancement. It kills them better
[2:06:51.920 --> 2:07:03.640]  than a hammer. Be a warning to you. I told Fauci, we'd get him. And all glory goes to
[2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:10.520]  God. Let me just say this again. If you don't know and you're hiding under a rock and you
[2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:15.400]  just tuned in, I want destroyers taken over. We have a very special guest host, Wayne Allen
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:21.000]  Root in the fourth hour. I'm going to be leaving because I got to keep my powder dry
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:26.400]  and I've got some really important things that have to be done on a timetable for part
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:32.440]  of our operation victory that you'll be learning about in the future. So I got a lot of irons
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:40.480]  in the fire and we're going to be working very hard on completing these phases of our
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:48.080]  resistance operation. And we expect to be attacked for it. And that is exactly where
[2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:53.200]  we want to be. Because we're masochists but because we've got to get this thing off of
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:56.960]  us and we're going to do it because we've got the will and we've got the information
[2:07:56.960 --> 2:08:05.440]  and we've got the history and we've got the God behind us. So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:10.440]  NIH admits Fauci lied about funding a long gain of function experiments, MSN.com. It's
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:16.600]  all over the news. And Fauci is going, well, I did actually, I did a little bit of it.
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:20.280]  Well, because he doesn't want to say the NIH is lying about him. Oh, and the NIH, here's
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:26.280]  the letter. I think I was going to read part of this coming up next segment. And they are
[2:08:26.280 --> 2:08:30.360]  now publicly saying that they are ordering EcoHealth Alliance and Fauci and all the rest
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:37.120]  of them to release all of their documents to them within five days. So what does it
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:40.920]  mean now that the rats are leaving the sinking ship? Well, it means that people don't want
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:44.480]  to go to prison and it means individuals at the top of the NIH because they've already
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:51.360]  had so many resigned, so many be fired at the FDA and the CDC. And that Biden has announced
[2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:55.640]  that on Halloween, he's going to announce, he's announced, he's going to announce that
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:08:59.640]  it's approved. And he says, I don't care who I fire, who I get. If I have to get out of
[2:08:59.640 --> 2:09:05.320]  the janitor, this is come out in the news. That janitor at the FDA is going to approve
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:08.520]  giving down to five year olds these shots and saying they're safe and effective. They
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:12.240]  already lied and said that the FDA said they were safe and effective for 15 or not. None
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:18.960]  of that ever happened. None of it's approved. It's not approved until 2026. And so Fauci
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:26.640]  and Gates and all them are, and Obama's minion, Biden, is playing chicken with these bureaucrats
[2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:30.320]  and the bureaucrats are like, people are dying everywhere. We really killed people. We got
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:35.840]  set up. They think it's a bureaucracy. We're about to go along with them thinking that's
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:39.240]  why they put pedophiles in the Catholic Church or pedophiles in the Boy Scouts or pedophiles
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:43.520]  in all these groups so that then when the pedophile first gets busted, it'll be in a
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:46.840]  jurisdiction where corrupt police come and say, listen, we'll cover this up. Don't worry
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:50.280]  about the child porn. Don't worry about the rape kid. Just work with us on some other
[2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:55.420]  things. And most institutions go, okay, when they try to set us up with that, I went crazy
[2:09:55.420 --> 2:10:02.000]  on air and threw it right back on their damn dirty faces because, you know, I don't fear
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:05.360]  them. I fear God. But that, I mean, yeah, of course they tried to set us up with that.
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:12.640]  So that's what these people do. It's who they are. So we are now, we are now at this point,
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:16.880]  ladies and gentlemen, and it's the same thing. They corrupt all the scientific institutions
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:20.720]  by having them launch a bio attack that they don't know has been launched. Then once the
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:27.760]  bio attack becomes evident, they then circle the wagons against us and double down. But
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:31.080]  in a lot of jurisdictions like India and other areas, they've actually thrown these systems
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:35.040]  out. They've thrown them out of African countries. Five African countries throughout these people
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:38.600]  and they killed all their presidents. But still, the next president didn't go along
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:42.160]  with it either. You got to give it to the Africans. You got to give it to the Aborigines.
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:44.680]  You got to give it to people all over the world. They've learned what's going on with
[2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:52.480]  this UN shot garbage. Because I guarantee you those men that got killed, those presidents
[2:10:52.480 --> 2:10:57.200]  that got killed, not going along with it. Oh, the Haitian president, they killed him
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:00.880]  too. So when he wouldn't do it, well, you know what, I think they're a little more worried
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:03.700]  about God and what would have happened if they had gone along with killing their own
[2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:09.760]  people. Because, I mean, you do stuff like this. You're damned to eternity in a black
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:14.640]  hole with all this energy that doesn't want to be part of God's universe. Separation from
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:21.520]  God. And so that's where we are. But the seismic level of this and what's going to come out
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:23.880]  of this now, everybody's like, hey, you're going to cover Merrick Garland. He's getting
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:28.640]  grilled by the FBI spying on parents of public school kids. Hey, are you going to, you know,
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:32.480]  it's coming out. They wouldn't let Jim Jordan play a video, but the Democrats are allowed
[2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:37.040]  to play a video. That's censorship. Yeah. That's authoritarian. Exactly. But that's
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:43.440]  all I sing on the cake. So you get a big old T-bone steak and like potatoes and stuff.
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:47.960]  The steak is the main deal. And the steak is, they're rolling this out against their children
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:51.040]  and it poisons them and kills them. And they think they're going to get all the lawyers
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:55.000]  and doctors and nurses and the bureaucrats on board with killing people. And then when
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:59.360]  it turns out it is killing everybody, they'll keep doubling down, you see, and say, oh,
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:04.480]  actually boosters are the answer. That's Stockholm syndrome. That's forcing you into
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:11.000]  supporting the abusers. But it's not going to work. And they now know, whoa, all over
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.360]  the world, people aren't buying into this. And all of the major scientists are, I mean,
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:21.960]  almost all of the major medical unions, the coroner's unions, the epidemiologist unions,
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:27.080]  the doctor unions, the nurse unions, all the unions from Japan to Germany to France, the
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:32.640]  professors saying, this is a holocaust. This is horrible. What are you doing? We were all
[2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:36.000]  just supposed to kill each other and not know what was happening and be confused and go
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:42.440]  burn down the police station. But the cops are all quitting saying, we're with the people.
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:46.320]  And when they go feed the homeless, you're screwed, New World Order. We're not going
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:49.840]  to go kill the cops. We're not going to blow up FBI buildings. We're not going to even
[2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:53.560]  go to Fauci's house and burn it down. We're going to burn your lives down politically
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:59.560]  by exposing you monsters. And when you hit me, I say, thank you, sir, may I have another?
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:03.960]  Because while you're blasting all your political flak up at me, I'm over the target with big
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:11.200]  old juicy giant slabs of truth. And I'm dropping them on you every day. And so I just feels
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:17.320]  like a warm kiss on my cheek and a nice loving dagger running the right in my spleen because
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:21.840]  I know I'm up against you. And while you think you're stabbing me in the gut, you feel those
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:26.400]  tentacles and those big bulk of stricter arms breaking your frickin ribs politically. You
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:34.120]  feel that? You ain't getting out of that ever. And I'm going to be your tombstone. You understand
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:45.600]  that New World Order? Yeah, you know it, don't you? So cry havoc and let loose the dogs of
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:49.760]  war. The dogs of war I'm talking about is information warfare and the truth. The bombs
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:55.760]  I'm talking about are intellectual. The revolution I'm talking about is a velvet. It's beautiful.
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:02.680]  It's sexy. It's real. And it's what the people want. We are going to people the stars together.
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:05.960]  It's God's will. We are going to go to the next level. We are going to transcend Bill
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:11.520]  Gates and other selfish demonic creatures. I'm going to go to break. Oh, I'm sure you're
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:15.800]  going to take over. I did a little special report. My daughter just kind of quirky and
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:18.640]  funny and interesting. And I shot at myself real quick. Didn't even know I was going
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:21.760]  to put it on here. That's the last segment of Sour. Then Wayne Allen Root takes over.
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:25.160]  But I was going to come in and host two powerful segments. He's always doing a great job. He's
[2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:28.240]  been on fire lately. So is Harrison Smith. He's taking over. I'm going to go do some
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:32.280]  really important stuff. And then Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow with a Friday transmission.
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:36.920]  But don't forget, I'm trying to get funds in right now. Like when you swing, get your
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:41.640]  fist ready, pull it back and try to throw it as hard as you can. And as you fund us
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:47.200]  and you support us and you pray for us, you spread the word, it's just, you just put that
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:52.920]  real power on that punch. And so go to info or store.com and symbiotically get products
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:56.600]  that are great for you and your family. While you fund the info or while you let us charge
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:15:01.600]  up for the main assault, while you give your energy and will to us, we give it right back
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:05.800]  to you because this isn't Satan's system. It's God's system where we make each other
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:14.480]  stronger together, rising together, our wills together with God directing us is unstoppable.
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:19.560]  And we will defeat the new old order. We will break its will. We will bring it down, ladies
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:25.200]  and gentlemen. And in the process of that great collision, we will found new civilizations
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:30.480]  together. I need the funds info or store.com and with supply chain breakdowns, everything
[2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:35.360]  else happening. I told you food prices, we have 3040% a year ago in a year they are.
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.040]  And if we don't turn this around disastrous major war, you name it, you need storeable
[2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:43.080]  food. We got the best rate of ship info or store.com or prepare with Alex.com recalls
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:46.520]  all three triple eight two five three three one three nine DNA force plus bodies almost
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:51.560]  driven formula and so much more back in stock 40% off info or store.com and limited supply
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:16:00.320]  of brain force ultra experience the ultimate new tropic. I want to explain something that
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:04.480]  is absolutely feed understanding our world. It's very, very simple, but the multiple don't
[2:16:04.480 --> 2:16:11.480]  know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:18.920]  of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:26.360]  property, energy, they're using it to buy people to buy influence. And in the past, they created
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:30.560]  thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets. They never
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:35.960]  allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:40.480]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:46.480]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:51.200]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do find the only things left
[2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:55.160]  standing. This is the great reset. This is what's happening now. Warn everyone. It's
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:17:03.720]  the only way to stop it. Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:08.480]  job. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's
[2:17:08.480 --> 2:17:12.840]  basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:17.680]  and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone. All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:21.000]  Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could,
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:25.280]  I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products. The X2 Group does wonders.
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:28.680]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:33.040]  product. Support the info ward. Tyler in Maine. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go
[2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:37.880]  ahead. Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor. Honored talk to you. Awesome.
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:43.520]  So first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29. If
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:48.560]  you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So just number one for
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:58.120]  a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely. By now, you've heard me
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:03.080]  talk about the Bio Pros and how they're creating amazing products. They've done it again and
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:09.200]  have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products, bringing industrial level technology
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:13.280]  to the everyday consumer. They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary
[2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:19.920]  patented delivery system. The Bio Pros are excited to release Bio Marine Pro, a product
[2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:25.880]  specifically designed to create healthy black and or gray water holding tanks. Bio Marine
[2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:31.800]  Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease. Get up to 20
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:36.880]  treatments, coupled with an easy application scoop. Just pour and flush. It's that simple.
[2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:41.720]  It contains no chemicals and no GMOs and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:48.080]  hoses and plumbing. It is also human and animal safe. Say goodbye to holding tank problems,
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:55.280]  gas buildup and odor guarantee. Visit theBioPros.com and see for yourself.
[2:18:55.280 --> 2:19:01.960]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:06.280]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:09.600]  didn't stand up. And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  so he didn't stand up. And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:18.240]  up. Well, the global social credit score that China is putting in that's banning people
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:21.960]  to three hours of video games a week. And if you criticize the government, you can never
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:26.480]  buy or sell again. Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise
[2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:31.920]  of COVID vaccine passports. They even admit it. Now, there's going to be a carbon tax
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:35.440]  attached to it. They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you
[2:19:35.440 --> 2:19:39.960]  can go and what you can do. That's the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that. You'll accept
[2:19:39.960 --> 2:19:45.480]  anything. So again, leftist having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:48.400]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:52.560]  nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:59.840]  of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:26.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Okay, Alex has stepped out of the studio on Troyer
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:33.880]  now in the seat here in the info wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas. And I'm just
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:39.680]  trying to think of how to follow up with the last two hours plus of a powerful Alex Jones
[2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:47.840]  show. And the trend that we're seeing is only going to continue. This is the story. This
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:56.200]  is the name of the novel. This is the title. It's the great reset versus the great awakening.
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:00.160]  The great reset versus the great awakening. That is what we are in the middle of right
[2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:10.000]  now. We've been here leading the charge for the great awakening for decades. And the great
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:16.960]  awakening though is starting to take a wider effect as more people just through existence
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:21.760]  and wanting to be free and pushing back against the system realize that there is a battle
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:25.520]  for the future of America going on right now. There is a war for the hearts and the minds
[2:21:25.520 --> 2:21:34.680]  and the souls of America and the world going on right now. So when you're seeing top FDA
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:39.800]  officials quitting and you're seeing scientists refusing to get the vaccine and you're seeing
[2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:46.920]  NIH officials stepping down and calling out Fauci and you're seeing nurses quitting because
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:52.520]  they don't want to get the vaccine. They're calling out the dangers of the vaccine. And
[2:21:52.520 --> 2:22:00.240]  now you're seeing athletes step up and stand out against vaccine mandates and their voices
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:05.960]  are getting louder and slowly but surely more are kind of popping their heads out and saying
[2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:15.880]  something about freedom and that movement is growing. There's a media blackout. There
[2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:22.800]  is a media blackout including Fox News. I mean I don't know Fox News hosts I'm sure could
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:28.440]  cover it. They just figure they don't have enough air time to cover it. They want to
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:33.920]  cover whatever it is they want to cover so they don't give it any air time. We don't
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:38.280]  have teleprompters here. We don't have scripts here. We don't have big corporate sponsors
[2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:43.120]  telling us what we can and can't say. So we can cover it. We can do our best to cover
[2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:48.000]  it. I mean I don't even have enough time to cover it. It's it's nationwide California
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:23:02.280]  New York Texas Florida Washington Chicago Michigan just everywhere Ohio. You have mass
[2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:10.400]  protests happening against the vaccine mandates against Anthony Fauci. Kind of like how you
[2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:19.360]  saw mass protests mass peaceful protests against the steal of the 2020 election. Well now it's
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:26.600]  bigger now it's against the vaccine mandates. But there's a total media blackout on that.
[2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:34.880]  So as it said the revolution won't be televised. But this is a revolution of people's minds.
[2:23:34.880 --> 2:23:42.960]  This is a revolution of people's awareness. This is a revolution of the average citizen
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:48.000]  realizing that it can take control of its destiny or or better yet that the government
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:55.880]  has had a desire to take control of its destiny and has and now they want to take it back.
[2:23:55.880 --> 2:24:01.040]  So I think you're only going to see more people step up and stand out in the in the realm
[2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:08.120]  of professional sports or in the realm of media where you wouldn't expect it or science.
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:15.480]  Who knows if the people that left the FDA or the NIH or other bureaucracies because they
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:21.000]  didn't want to be a part of Fauci's criminal activity anymore. Maybe maybe they start doing
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:28.360]  interviews and saying things that of course we've been saying for a while but okay now
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:32.720]  hey somebody else said it so it's it's good now now we can cover it now we can talk about
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:45.200]  it. But if we don't see justice if we don't see a punishment for Anthony Fauci at least
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:50.080]  for lying under oath. But that should just be the beginning that that should just be
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:56.400]  the entry point. You know that's how prosecutors work is you got to find an entry point you
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:01.280]  got to find something you got a big fish we got to hook him with something you may think
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:05.240]  he's doing big crimes you may know he's doing big crimes but you got to find something to
[2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:11.920]  hook the big fish to bring him in then you can get the big crimes. Well this is the hook
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:15.960]  Fauci lying under oath it's he now basically admits it I don't know how he could worm his
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:27.600]  way out of this one. Fauci lying under oath if we can't at least have charges against
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:33.360]  Fauci for lying under oath and perjury at least to hook this big fish this big criminal
[2:25:33.360 --> 2:25:41.200]  fish then we have nothing and you know I do have a lot coming up obviously on the war
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:47.600]  room that I host for three hours a day and I'm going to be covering a video that broke
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:50.480]  yesterday when I was on air and I couldn't really properly cover it because I was just
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:54.160]  kind of seeing it for the first time and I had all the other stuff on my desk and all
[2:25:54.160 --> 2:25:59.160]  the other video clips but it was outside of Netflix where you had a walk out a staged
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:04.760]  walk out because Dave Chappelle made a joke and Netflix employees are delicate little
[2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:12.960]  snowflakes I guess or whoever it is that's out there and they attack this man and they
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:17.520]  rip up a sign his sign I think says that jokes are funny or he likes Dave Chappelle it's
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:22.600]  one of those two things either jokes for funny or I like Dave and so this this radical leftist
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:27.600]  mob takes his sign rips the sign off and then he's just left with this wooden stick and
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:34.240]  they say he's got a weapon he's got a weapon and then of course he's I mean they literally
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:40.200]  ripped the sign off of his wooden pole the sign he's holding up and they ripped the sign
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:46.760]  off and break it and throw on the ground and then they say oh look he's got a weapon and
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:50.640]  let me explain where that goes but let me let me another element here that I just saw
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:56.640]  a teacher I'm going to be covering all of this on the war room but a teacher does a
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:02.040]  video where she says that and you saw the FBI do this saying that parents are domestic
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:11.160]  terrorists parents that want to know what their kids are being taught in schools or terrorists
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:16.080]  so so combine what what are we doing here well let's combine these two these two instances
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:21.520]  oh okay my political opposition I guess which is just parents that want to raise their kids
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:25.480]  somehow that's your political opposition that's a weird stance to take on the issue but that's
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:30.720]  how they feel it's their duty to indoctrinate and raise the children so they look at parents
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:35.960]  as political opposition and then the radical leftist in the street here's a guy who likes
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:42.800]  Dave Chappelle doesn't want to see comedy canceled and he has a sign so we're going
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:46.560]  to we're going to rip the thing off we're going to rip the sign down and they're going
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:51.160]  to say he has a weapon okay so so what have you just done well you've just labeled your
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:57.080]  political opposition a terrorist which is obviously untrue okay what have you just done you've
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:05.240]  just taken a man standing there with a sign and then turned his sign what you call into
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:11.840]  a weapon and that's the video that you're showing here and so you know maybe I'll just
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:17.720]  do that when we come back before we go to Alex Jones in the park which I actually watched
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:22.600]  the video this morning I actually thought it was funny it's just you know Alex Jones
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:26.760]  is one of the most misunderstood men in the world and you know I get it when you don't
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:30.040]  know somebody and you kind of see them from a 10,000 feet view and you make all these
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:34.440]  assumptions and so there's all kinds of political commentary on Alex that I just laugh because
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:39.840]  I know Alex I'm like you guys have no clue but so maybe I'll play the video of the guy
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.720]  yesterday and I'll explain what they're setting us up for folks is so it's just like Fauci
[2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:50.600]  if Fauci can't be charged for perjury and if these radical leftist mobs can't be disciplined
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:57.840]  you know where it goes next right if you're concerned about one of the most studied and
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:03.960]  researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation it's associated with cancer
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:08.840]  it's associated with joint problems associated with viral infections bacterial infections
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:13.080]  it's associated with death and out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:18.480]  through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better tumeric is chief amongst
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:24.560]  all and chief amongst all the tumeric products out there is body's ultimate tumeric formula
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:28.560]  my wife loves tumeric she has joint pain but just take a lot of it the type of stuff she
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:32.280]  buys at the grocery store for it to work she started taking this instead all we need to
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:37.720]  take one pill instead of four why is it so good it's not just tumeric it's concentrated

[2:31:05.960 --> 2:31:11.480]  system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world
[2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:18.080]  government their anti human post human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and
[2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:24.520]  due process injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight
[2:31:24.520 --> 2:31:29.600]  with bill gates you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight
[2:31:29.600 --> 2:31:35.280]  with the un they started a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:40.920]  not gonna go away and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the
[2:31:40.920 --> 2:31:45.280]  fear of god put into them the average person still doesn't even know about the new world
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:50.480]  order or about globalism or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand
[2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:55.960]  that and that we're under attack we have any chance of beating these people the purpose
[2:31:55.960 --> 2:32:02.040]  of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population
[2:32:02.040 --> 2:32:07.600]  has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:12.920]  to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly
[2:32:12.920 --> 2:32:18.520]  stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:23.840]  mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this
[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:28.800]  is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things
[2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:34.360]  to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken
[2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:39.880]  from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of
[2:32:39.880 --> 2:32:44.840]  convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a years worth
[2:32:44.840 --> 2:32:51.800]  of storable foods water filtration survival gear seeds shortwave radios and life saving
[2:32:51.800 --> 2:33:17.800]  knowledge that in four store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:30.600]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he it's alex jones and now your host owin shroyer
[2:33:30.600 --> 2:33:37.560]  so yesterday there was a staged walkout of netflix employees that are upset that davis
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:43.320]  chappell makes jokes that they don't like and who knows what the numbers of netflix
[2:33:43.320 --> 2:33:49.520]  employees that walked out versus just radical leftist that showed up to add to the numbers
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:52.760]  who knows what the split there is but the point is there are probably maybe close to
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:58.240]  a hundred of them protesting that davis chappell makes jokes and that netflix would dare have
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:04.320]  davis chappell on their platform and a couple individuals showed up in support of davis chappell
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:10.120]  and in support of comedy and free speech small handful maybe maybe four or five in fact we're
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:14.440]  going to try to get this gentleman on i'm told he's a big fan of the alex jones show so
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:19.720]  we're going to try to get the individual on in this and the guy that shot the film is
[2:34:19.720 --> 2:34:26.280]  actually a pretty popular podcaster in his own right and so let me just show you the
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:29.880]  video i'm just going to shut up because that was my problem is when it broke yesterday
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:35.160]  i was kind of talking over it and quite frankly kind of having like relapses of myself when
[2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:41.280]  i've been in the middle of these radical mobs and so i get a little i get a little frenzied
[2:34:41.280 --> 2:34:46.040]  so i'm just going to play the clip and then i'm going to explain what it is we're being
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:55.360]  set up for and how it ties into fauci's future or or or if fauci can be charged for his crimes
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:35:00.840]  is the same of if these radical leftist mobs are ever disciplined so here's what happened
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:06.240]  outside of netflix again a bunch of radical leftists that don't like free speech upset
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:09.840]  that dave chapelle exists and then two or three people that like dave chapelle show
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:21.480]  up just to hold a sign that says i like jokes and they get assaulted here's the video so
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:26.800]  he's standing there with a sign that says i like dave and the radical leftist mob surrounds
[2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:43.600]  him and rips his sign off and watch what they do next so then they say oh he's got a weapon
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:47.400]  after they rip the sign off of his wooden pole and then again they just body him and
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:52.640]  get in his face and you know and you know pause it pause it real quick and rewind it
[2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:58.840]  because upon further review of this i know i said i would shut up upon further review
[2:35:58.840 --> 2:36:03.520]  of this it you know it actually looks like there's probably maybe fifty or less of these
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:07.440]  radical leftists and then there's just like fifty or more members of the media and so
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:15.080]  this is how this works every time the left announces some sort of event a protest or
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:20.440]  whatever and they get it gets mass media push and all the media companies no matter how
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:25.960]  big or small send journalists out there same thing happens in austin now i could have i
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:31.000]  could have an event in austin and we've done it dozens of times i can have an event in
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:38.920]  austin where thousands of people show up and no media will be there none except obviously
[2:36:38.920 --> 2:36:43.440]  info wars and then a couple other of independent media outlets that follow info wars and cover
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.120]  our events so you'll maybe have five ten max media it's never it's never mainstream news
[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:53.440]  it's never the local media and we have them right down here at the capital in austin and
[2:36:53.440 --> 2:36:57.000]  the local media local news is literally just caddy corner to the capital they could be
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:01.600]  there in five seconds when they saw our best and they don't send anybody so we don't get
[2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:06.320]  any coverage a leftist has an event it gets all the media and so i've seen the dynamic
[2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:12.760]  play out in austin like they had a pro mask rally a pro mask rally i mean slap me silly
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:17.520]  if i'm at a pro mask rally but i go there to cover it and it's got fifty members of
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:22.880]  the media out there mainstream media local media camera crews reporters everything and
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:27.840]  there's maybe ten to fifteen actual pro maskers they're holding the event in other words more
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:32.920]  media than than actual event attendees so it looks like that same thing is playing out
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:39.160]  there in this event there down by netflix but okay so they read he's got a sign he's got
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:42.640]  a like a broomstick or something with a sign on it he's holding it up says i like david
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:48.360]  they ripped the sign off the broomstick and then they say look he's got a weapon insinuating
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:54.240]  he brought a broomstick to the event as a weapon which is obviously there's them fabricating
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:38:00.360]  it and it's the same guy that rips it off that says it now you think about that i don't
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:08.680]  even know what you call that that that activity that action i mean again that that is beyond
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:13.240]  a liar that that's somebody punching you in the face you're staring at him he punches
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:18.320]  you in the face and then points at like a little girl playing on the swings on the playground
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:22.440]  down the road says that little girl punched you in the face says sir i just watched you
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:26.000]  slug me right in the eye i mean you're a train driver that little girl on the swing set down
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:30.360]  there punched you how dare you he rips the sign off and says look he's got a weapon
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:39.680]  a child doesn't even behave like that these are evil evil people why are they always left
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:44.160]  this i don't know but so okay they've now they claim he's got a weapon so let's pick
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:57.120]  it up from there so notice the same guy that rips his sign down and takes his sign that's
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:13.600]  assault so the guy assaults him and then yells he's got a weapon and then there's now there's
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:25.040]  the leftist cult members that don't want anybody engaging in a conversation with him they know
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:31.040]  it's not a weapon they know their liars they know their scum one guy paid 30 bucks for
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:40:00.360]  an aoc t-shirt a communist and just look at the psychotic left banging tambourines banging
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:05.240]  wooden sticks with their head how is that not a weapon so oh here's is a weapon not there
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:16.920]  though listen to them howling like demons or goons i mean you could cut that out and
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:23.320]  use it as movies as just like demonic ghoul sounds just like generic ghoul sounds and
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:30.440]  so there's some of the confrontation now again i've been in these crowds i i unintentionally
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:36.280]  created that entire genre of content with aid skrillex and and carl the cook you may remember
[2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:44.160]  in 2016 where i just exist as a trump supporter and i'm just radically attacked by a mob of
[2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:50.520]  raging liberals and got tens of millions of hundreds of millions of views and so i was
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:56.560]  like wow okay uh i guess i'll just keep doing this and now there's just compilations hundreds
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:00.120]  of compilations hundreds of hours of meat of me doing that so i know what it's like
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  to be in these crowds and i salute that gentleman you did a great job and my guess is he'll be
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:14.200]  joining us on info wars live before it's all said and done so what am i what is the conclusion
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:20.920]  i'm trying to reach here if fauci can lie under oath and if fauci can get away with
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:26.520]  crimes against the nuremberg code and nothing happens to him well guess what what what what
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:32.360]  would stop him from continuing his operations just like what happened when the aids epidemic
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:37.760]  was happening and the people he was putting on azt died see nothing about you then now
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:43.600]  the people taking these vaccines he's promoting or dying okay so you see where that's going
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:50.000]  why am i comparing it to the leftist mob if these let i've been assaulted dozens of times
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.360]  at these events i've been death-threaded i've had every kind of things happening i've only
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:58.360]  been able to get one charge finalized for sexual assault when a woman sexually assaulted me
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:02.160]  but i've been spat on i've been punched i've had things broken i've had things lapped over
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:06.280]  my head everything and they always get away with it i mean there were there were dozens
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:12.360]  of murders in the summer democrat riots of 2020 so i'm i'm proposing something but they're
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:16.280]  already doing it so i'm almost wrong with this analysis because it's already happening
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:22.080]  but let me explain if fauci can get away with it he's never gonna stop if these leftist
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:27.480]  mobs are never stopped or never disciplined they're going to just start mass murdering
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:32.360]  people that's why the teachers accuse the parents of being terrorists that's why they
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:37.440]  say hey you have a weapon there because they're they're they're getting ready justifying killing
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:42.280]  you in the streets and there are that's why i'm saying like i'm actually wrong they're
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:45.960]  already doing it they've already shot trump supporters in denver in portland there were
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:50.160]  already dozens of murders during the democrat riots of 2020 so they're already killing
[2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:54.680]  people and getting away with it but but it's about to be just radical violence in the streets
[2:42:54.680 --> 2:43:03.120]  if they're not stopped i'm sick the technocrats the social engineers the behavioral psychologist
[2:43:03.120 --> 2:43:10.080]  they're all part of the same satanic globalist control freak system that seeks to play god
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:16.000]  that seeks to turn the general population of this earth into their slaves into putty
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:21.920]  into clay in their hands that they control and chief amongst their physical attacks is
[2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:26.600]  keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:33.080]  planet and so the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their global
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:36.960]  is taking over and we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:41.680]  of mouth but it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high quality

[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:14.520]  mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com studies have
[2:44:14.520 --> 2:44:20.480]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease

[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:32.560]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:39.600]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[2:44:39.600 --> 2:44:45.760]  and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now I can have a logical and

[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:43.320]  at infowarstore.com
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:46:05.120]  I'm sitting here it's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:10.320]  on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:15.680]  and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies
[2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:20.800]  they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks and
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.720]  then I noticed that even though this is even in the associated press it's not getting any
[2:46:24.720 --> 2:46:28.880]  circulation it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:34.560]  like Instagram or Twitter it's just crazy and then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying
[2:46:34.560 --> 2:46:38.880]  there's no damage from the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody your conspiracy theorists if you
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:43.520]  say it it's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:47.240]  and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems they gave the exact reasons
[2:46:47.240 --> 2:46:52.440]  why it now happened that's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air they
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:47:12.560]  could get away with even more of this crap this is just insane these people are killers
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:24.520]  this is a good visual analogy or parable about paths less taken you can just pull up countless
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:48.280]  spots in Austin was out of the highway all right this is a first person of Alex walking
[2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:54.120]  through part of the green belt here walking with Alex Jones we're gonna call this segment
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:48:02.360]  walking with Alex Jones we'll say Austin does a pretty good job of maintaining a lot
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:07.400]  of the nature around the city it's gonna be more of a struggle with the city booming
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:29.440]  like it is but this is probably not too far outside of the actual metropolitan area
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:51.520]  so we're working on figuring these here we go well this is fake as I know these are the
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:49:05.440]  Alex Jones players right this is the Alex Jones playhouse this is hilarious folks nothing
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:11.200]  we do in your states and these guys think they're geniuses they think they're so smart they
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:22.160]  figure something out this is all again I like the way even the actors he hired don't give
[2:49:22.160 --> 2:49:45.280]  away they think they're smart they don't realize how stupid they are cuz all about him you know
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:59.680]  scripted lines and everything and he just went in there and just took over just act
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:27.200]  like he's about to eat a chicken wing go home for you kill yourself oh he's still alive sorry
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:33.840]  don't yeah I go out there and act a goddamn fool and do us all a favor and pass the hell
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:39.840]  out it's 105 degrees out there and his big ass out there about to get heat stroke nope
[2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:46.840]  so I'm sorry if that makes y'all mad before this dude man nobody's mad except you psycho
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:52.640]  and that wasn't here about a year ago the county maintenance crews just cut that for themselves
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:50:56.280]  which is smarter they're ordered of no wideness case anybody's ever got to get the power lines
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:51:03.400]  or the bridge down there so you put this in and should I tell you where to find this place
[2:51:03.400 --> 2:51:08.320]  for me my children come probably not I guess plus you don't listen to me anyways this is
[2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:13.680]  all conspiracy theory I'm gonna start showing you hidden paths around Austin I've decided
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:22.960]  just as an allegory and look at the city workers here is this is county they uh created that
[2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:26.920]  for fence post for God knows where they need them or for city works or whatever I don't
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:33.560]  know where this goes again they were down here about a year ago they widen these roads
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:38.760]  I've looked on Google Maps this is a county right away down here the proper proper lines
[2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:46.720]  right over here there's some houses back up in there so golf course on down about a quarter
[2:51:46.720 --> 2:51:53.320]  mile and right down there is Barton Creek right down there and it gets even prettier
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:59.520]  but you know what that's another that's another episode in fact next time I'll show you wanna
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:04.640]  go down there sweetheart oh my oldest daughter wants to go on down well I guess you'll get
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:14.360]  a battery's almost at zero okay I'm gonna see the water too a lot of people say oh Barton
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:21.160]  Creek is dry right now in late October I'm not dry here you see it goes underground about
[2:52:21.160 --> 2:52:26.360]  a mile as you get more into the heart of Austin and then only when it's really flooding
[2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:32.080]  is it come above surface but down here I've never seen it dry down here and again I've
[2:52:32.080 --> 2:52:40.440]  been coming to this spot for 10 years there's entrance off the highway about a half mile
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:50.120]  back up or I'll fill my spider look at those beautiful Bart's trees wherever they are Bart's
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:58.760]  family but again Alex Jones is showing you this so it's hateful and Nazi it doesn't
[2:52:58.760 --> 2:53:04.760]  exist it's censored you can't see this yeah how much did Alex pay those trees to be to
[2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:13.120]  be there right now how much did Alex pay those clouds I want to know by the way there's
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:18.440]  hundreds of spots like this oh my gosh is that a little creek see oh my gosh how much
[2:53:18.440 --> 2:53:24.200]  did you pay that creek Alex that's a that's a fake creek fake creek sweetheart how many
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:28.160]  times you've been down here with me nope it's not real pride to pay his own daughter to
[2:53:28.160 --> 2:53:35.400]  his daughter how many times we've seen other people you've never seen anyone oh Reuters
[2:53:35.400 --> 2:53:42.560]  is gonna fact check me nope it's all fake CGI love swimming in there boy it's about four
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:52.760]  feet deep over there a lot of crawdads a lot of bass a lot of perch
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:59.520]  how much did you pay that rock Alex I guess you haven't been down here what about six
[2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:06.720]  months look at those clouds actors those are actor clouds show your friends the secret
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:14.520]  spots those are the ones that look these are the trees in the creek you see in National
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:20.480]  Geographic folks these are top level trees and creek actors they're not real obviously
[2:54:20.480 --> 2:54:23.840]  I mean you heard that guy I've never I've never even heard I don't know who that guy
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:28.800]  is he's a genius he's right he found it all out I've been messed up by the Kim trolls
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:34.320]  yet yeah this is all say those little you're not supposed to watch c-span and know that
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:40.720]  there's little drop-offs of it you know they're too it's all fake yeah maybe we'll throw a
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:54:44.840]  clip of former CIA director when he was the director Brennan admitting the whole campaign
[2:54:44.840 --> 2:54:50.600]  how it's a great another example is the array of technologies often referred to collectively
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:55.160]  as geo engineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:55:01.440]  climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection
[2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:06.840]  or SAI a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:13.720]  heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an SAI program could limit global temperature
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:18.560]  increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:24.440]  economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels this process is also relatively
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:29.160]  inexpensive the national research research council estimates that a fully deployed SAI
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:34.760]  program would cost about ten billion dollars yearly admitting to your face it's secret
[2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:39.000]  maybe we should go over here give a shot of this as I mentioned it it's probably seven
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:46.920]  hundred years old I've researched some of the local University of Texas reports on the estimation
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:53.720]  age of these trees look at this wow one of hundreds like this people don't know that
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:58.680]  on the green belts but off the beaten path people don't know about somebody knows about
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:04.920]  this when they put a swing on it I've got this camera on a wide lens people don't
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:11.080]  know how big it is yeah Alex Alex tried to have that tree flown in from a different state
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:16.840]  just for this shoot right here just for this film here Barton Creek now there can't even
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:21.720]  Alex can't even go out in nature without faking things just ask that one guy who we just heard
[2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:25.720]  from who I've never seen or heard of before oh is that a cardinal oh geez how much did
[2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:37.560]  he pay that cardinal yep there it is reading its lines yep right off a script just like
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:49.640]  it was scripted folks it's rolling is Alex going to climb that tree what do you call
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:57:03.400]  these fairy flowers and yeah you got to go through a few brambles here and there you
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:07.800]  know if you want to see stuff nobody else gets to see so you just stay on the big path
[2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:12.360]  with all the dog crap and all the leftist wearing your mask kissing at you maybe I'm going to be
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:36.120]  right here I guess with the spiders
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:43.800]  the fun is part cutting across the golf course how much did Alex pay that deer to run across
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:49.480]  the screen like that unbelievable person on the one of the most studied and researched areas
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:55.240]  of human health and physiology is inflammation it's associated with cancer it's associated with
[2:57:55.240 --> 2:58:00.520]  joint problems associated with viral infections bacterial infections it's associated with death
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:05.320]  and out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:11.160]  and makes our lives better turmeric is chief amongst them all and chief amongst all the turmeric
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:16.520]  products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula my wife loves turmeric she has joint pain
[2:58:16.520 --> 2:58:20.600]  but just take a lot of it the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store for it to work
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:24.840]  she started taking this and said all we need to take one pill instead of four why is it so good
[2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:30.360]  it's not just turmeric it's concentrated with the proprietary process it's back in stock
[2:58:30.360 --> 2:58:36.600]  if you're being sold out almost five months at infowarstore.com for 40% off but supplies
[2:58:36.600 --> 2:58:39.800]  are going to sell out quick because of supply chain breakdowns and because we will not lower
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:43.720]  the quality of this product and body's is one of our best selling products because it really does
[2:58:43.720 --> 2:58:49.080]  work and people love it get yours today at infowarstore.com the globalists are bombarding us
[2:58:49.080 --> 2:58:55.160]  with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's
[2:58:55.160 --> 2:58:59.880]  all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of
[2:58:59.880 --> 2:59:07.400]  god the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why I repeat
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:14.280]  that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the
[2:59:14.280 --> 2:59:21.400]  propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and
[2:59:21.400 --> 2:59:28.520]  all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong
[2:59:28.520 --> 2:59:33.320]  and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's
[2:59:33.320 --> 2:59:37.320]  so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't
[2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:43.320]  believe in god what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe channel and we are opposing
[2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:51.480]  the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced if you are receiving this
[2:59:51.480 --> 3:00:11.160]  transmission you are the resistance all right Wayne Allen root is about to take over here go
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:18.280]  and show your with us with you here for the last five minutes i'm going to go in and get ready to
[3:00:18.280 --> 3:00:22.520]  host the war room you know i just think it's funny again i have to comment i don't know who
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:27.800]  those two commentators were that were in that video making fun of alex or claiming that he staged
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:35.480]  some event uh down at an entrance and creek um this is actually part of the problem right now with
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:41.720]  political discourse in this country yeah does anybody know who that is by the way i'm not even
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:45.880]  trying to insult the guy there's all kinds of people out there okay yeah so nobody's heard of
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:50.840]  this guy but this is actually part of the problem with political discourse in this country right
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:57.400]  now is that there never is any coming together there there never is the the the rift is so wide
[3:00:57.400 --> 3:01:04.440]  the chasm is so deep that there is not even any reaching across the aisle there's not even political
[3:01:04.440 --> 3:01:10.280]  debate i mean even intense debate would be good just to get people in the same room get people on
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:17.240]  the same frequency get people you know in front of one another or even digitally there's a there's
[3:01:17.240 --> 3:01:21.880]  a ceremony there's a natural organic human thing there but we don't even get that anymore
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:31.800]  and so that leaves people to make insane assertions and you know it again i see this
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:37.400]  on a on a small scale just that happens to me i see political commentary about myself on the
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:42.200]  internet or stuff people write that obviously i know is not accurate i'm me i know it's not right
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:45.800]  but it happens more with alex and it's like i know alex i know what he does here i know what
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:50.040]  they say about him isn't true and so but that's a perfect example and it's like i don't want to be
[3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:56.600]  that person i don't want to be the person looking like an idiot because i'm making assumptions about
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:00.360]  somebody i don't know and and that's why i wish we could have more political debate in this country
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:10.040]  but look it's just hilarious all the assumptions people make about alex jones or info wars
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:19.320]  that are just so far-fetched and outrageously incorrect and yet like the individuals in that
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:24.520]  podcast or whatever it is they think they're geniuses they think they are geniuses they think
[3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:28.840]  they are comedic geniuses they're laughing about how smart it is and they've caught alex he's
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:38.040]  paying actors to be in that uh no it's hilarious how dumb you are but you made a mistake i don't
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:42.360]  know when that was or who that was or probably about a year ago i guess when alex originally
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:48.840]  shot that footage so it's probably an older video but uh look i don't know who you are i just
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:55.160]  thought you may want to know that uh your commentary of that video is incredibly inaccurate
[3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:00.120]  except the part where he talks about the megaphone looking small in alex's hand that was true i thought
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:04.200]  that was kind of funny i think maybe even alex would have a laugh at that one that was accurate
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:09.640]  but uh all these assertions about alex jones and that he's a fake or whatever it's just
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:19.480]  this is as real as it gets ladies and gentlemen okay this media outlet is as real as it gets
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:25.640]  as real as it gets right here and you know what i'm proud of that and i'm proud
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:35.400]  of all the great people that we have working here and so remember them in this as well because

[3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:12.280]  47 years on this planet i've had a lot of loss like everybody else has and it's because it's a loss
[3:05:12.280 --> 3:05:23.240]  of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just
[3:05:23.240 --> 3:05:29.960]  throwing it all away and i see the general public ena medically induced scientifically induced
[3:05:29.960 --> 3:05:37.000]  behavioral psychologically controlled pranky and i know we're being fed into this global
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:44.120]  speaker under and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:50.360]  falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the
[3:05:50.360 --> 3:05:55.720]  globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process that that happens to collapse to
[3:05:55.720 --> 3:06:07.960]  actually end the species as we know it all right way now in route otherwise known as war the warrior

[3:06:33.480 --> 3:06:39.480]  tv studio i got my earpiece in so hopefully all of alex producers can let me know the countdown
[3:06:39.480 --> 3:06:45.240]  when i'm out when i'm in but we've never done this before so we're trying it out first time ever
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:50.600]  guest hosting for alex jones i guess i should tell you a little bit about myself uh so you know
[3:06:50.600 --> 3:06:56.520]  who wane allen root is if you don't know who i am already live in las vegas nevada that's right
[3:06:56.520 --> 3:07:02.040]  sin city i think i'm the only major conservative commentary commentator in the country who uh
[3:07:02.040 --> 3:07:07.960]  emanates and hosts uh and broadcasts out of las vegas but i listen i love vegas first of all vegas
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:13.720]  has no state income tax we have no uh capital gains tax we have no business tax we have no
[3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:20.200]  inheritance tax the sun's always out and we're not completely dominated by communists so uh i
[3:07:20.200 --> 3:07:24.680]  love it here in las vegas great place to live and of course sports betting that's my whole
[3:07:24.680 --> 3:07:30.680]  background i'm an sob son of a butcher and i at the age of 16 the media called me the next jimmy
[3:07:30.680 --> 3:07:36.440]  the greek who was the big vegas oddsmaker at the time my whole life was immersed at the age of 16
[3:07:36.440 --> 3:07:42.440]  in sports gambling and i went on to become the lead anchor man and host of five shows on cnbc
[3:07:42.440 --> 3:07:47.640]  in those days i was 26 years old i think i was the youngest guy on national tv and i was the host
[3:07:47.640 --> 3:07:53.400]  of five shows on on the network known now as cnbc then it was called financial news network
[3:07:53.400 --> 3:07:58.440]  and then i left to become an entrepreneur and i built my sports gambling and sports handicapping
[3:07:58.440 --> 3:08:05.240]  business into one of the powerhouses in the united states of america left it when i became the libertarian
[3:08:05.240 --> 3:08:11.000]  vice presidential nominee i actually was uh elected to the libertarian presidential ticket
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:16.440]  at the convention in denver in 2008 a total anonymous nobody and gave a speech in front of
[3:08:16.440 --> 3:08:21.800]  the crowd had a debate in front of the crowd and uh they named me the uh or voted me the vice
[3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:26.200]  presidential nominee with bob bar the former georgia congressman who led the impeachment
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:33.080]  of bill clinton so um that was my baptism into politics uh in an instant you know i went from
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:39.880]  a sports gambling guru uh from vegas overnight into a national political figure in the next morning
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:45.640]  i was on nil cavuto on fox news with bob bar talking about the libertarian presidential campaign
[3:08:45.640 --> 3:08:50.600]  and then i spent months traveling the country giving speeches and and talking about how obama
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:56.280]  was a deadly danger to united states but uh you know george w bush and john mccain were no bargain
[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:01.800]  either eight years of bush sucked he was not a real republican and he bankrupted the country and
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:07.640]  spent like a you know like a bankrupt sailor and then john mccain was the candidate in 2008
[3:09:07.640 --> 3:09:12.840]  up against obama and i knew he'd be a disaster because he was a rhino so i took the tack that i
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:19.240]  should join the libertarian party and and show them what a real conservative uh patriot is like
[3:09:19.240 --> 3:09:24.040]  and bob bar and i campaigned around the country and gave it our all and then i got back into
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:28.840]  business again and back into political talk radio and wound up with a nationally syndicated
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:33.480]  conservative radio show and since that i've written 15 books my most recent one by the way is a
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:39.480]  national bestseller right now it's called the great patriot protest and boycott book the great
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:44.280]  patriot protest and boycott book and and that's what i'm going to talk about in the next hour
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:49.080]  is the ideas i've got for saving america and some of the things that i believe are actually
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:53.800]  happening to america i think i've got a unique perspective for you on some of the things happening
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:58.920]  to america but i'll tell you what this book is really about it's kind of the conservative version
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:10:06.600]  of rules for radicals uh because solinsky wrote rules for radicals and he as it is like the god
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:10.680]  of the democrat party i say you know we're dealing with pure evil because rules for radicals is
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:16.040]  dedicated to the devil to lucifer can you imagine there's a real thing i'm not making this up
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:23.400]  the book is open it up page one the dedication is to lucifer the devil and that's what democrats
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:28.200]  believe in and and the main rule of rules for radicals and there's a lot of important rules
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:34.440]  in there but the main one is look in the mirror and whatever you see blame the other guy blame
[3:10:34.440 --> 3:10:40.760]  your opposition and so every time liberals look in the mirror they see what they are
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:50.360]  communists dictators intolerant hateful hate speech racism uh nazism and then they blame us
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:55.800]  trumps a nazi trumps the dictator because they see it in the mirror they see criminals when
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:11:01.320]  they look in the mirror so we're all criminals it was so funny the other day um there was a
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:06.040]  there was a columnist somewhere i think it was the la times but it was she wrote a column
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:13.800]  and the column was conservatives are so bad that uh journalists should no longer give both sides
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:21.000]  of the issue conservatives are so evil that they they do not have a responsibility journalists
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:27.320]  anymore to to present both sides of the debate or both sides of any issue in an article there
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:32.600]  should be no fairness anymore and the articles should just outright support whatever the government
[3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:38.120]  says whatever liberals believe whatever communists believe whatever the brain dead zombie with
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:44.280]  dementia joe biden believes whatever you know the backers uh the uh you know the ventriloquists
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:51.160]  who are running the puppets joe biden i think it's obama it's valerie jarrett it's susan rice
[3:11:51.160 --> 3:11:56.360]  it's george soros pulling the strings and it's the chinese communist party and the leaders of china
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:01.160]  pulling the strings that's who's running america now and whatever they say they don't even there's
[3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:06.920]  not even a reason to be responsible and show both sides whatever propaganda they put forth
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:11.720]  she says just every journalist should only cover that we we don't deserve the other side
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:17.160]  and that's solinsky she's looking in the mirror and she's seeing the pure evil of communism the pure
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:24.520]  evil of the people at pitch communism socialism marxism radicalism progressivism and she's seeing
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:30.120]  the pure evil of critical race theory that they want to brainwash every child with and and the
[3:12:30.120 --> 3:12:36.040]  pure evil of vaccine mandates which are destroying this country and ripping apart the first responders
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:42.760]  in the military the police the the border patrol uh the prison guards nobody wants this thing by the
[3:12:42.760 --> 3:12:47.720]  way just as an aside if you believe the government after they've lied to you about everything about
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:52.600]  covid and everything about covid vaccine if you believe the government's telling the truth when
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:13:01.880]  they say like 70 to 80 of americans are vaccinated lie lie a lot like pinocchio liars everyone i know
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:07.880]  is unvaccinated and and it's not like i know a few people my my group of friends uh in my cell
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:13.800]  phone i have five thousand phone numbers five thousand and and every day i get hundreds if not

[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:51.960]  and i'm telling you first of all if they didn't have vaccine mandates and they didn't threaten to
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:59.560]  fire everyone in america at gunpoint literally ruin your life and fire you and ruin your income
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:05.080]  nobody would be taking this vaccine other than a really dumb ignorant liberals but as it is even
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:10.760]  with all of those threats and coercion and intimidation of the vaccine mandates and everybody
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:16.840]  worrying how will i pay my bills i'm going to lose my salary there's no other job to hire me
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:23.080]  i'm gonna lose my pension i'm in it for 18 years and i got two years to go and i'm gonna quit or
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:27.960]  be fired and lose my pension so a lot of people give in and i totally understand that if you're
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:32.680]  watching right now you got the vaccine not only do i not hate you not only do not think you're
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:37.960]  stupid i think you're wonderful and i'm so sorry that we've come to a point in life that it's like
[3:14:37.960 --> 3:14:45.000]  1938 and a government that's like nazis or soviets or fidel castro or venezuela or zimbabwe
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:48.520]  has convinced you at gunpoint that you are going to lose everything you've ever worked
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:53.560]  for in your life unless you get the death jab and so you've taken the death jab knowing
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:58.840]  it's dangerous and it could kill you knowing it's caused injury and death i got him in my ear
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:03.160]  it's great i got the producers of my ear we could make this work i love it thank you one minute to
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:07.720]  go to break on the great alex jones show so honored to be here today way down the route
[3:15:07.720 --> 3:15:14.040]  but all these people have been coerced into taking the vaccine and so i feel for you man
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:20.200]  but even with all of that god bless you i love you i pray for you i pray you're healthy i pray
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:25.640]  i'm wrong and it's not a death jab and it's not going to kill millions but i fear i'm right
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:32.280]  but i will tell you this that i believe the amount of people who've taken the vaccine
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:38.040]  is about 50 percent of america has and 50 percent hasn't and they try and tell you it's 70 80
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:42.200]  because they know people love crowds they love you know to be around other people who do the
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:46.920]  same thing they know you don't want to be a loner they know that you want to be on the right side
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:52.280]  they try to convince you that everybody has gotten the vaccine and they have it you're not alone
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:55.960]  i'll be right back wait on the route alex jones show what if
[3:16:05.080 --> 3:16:10.120]  william in california people are asleep and program controlled i agree how do you make the

[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:21.800]  yeah go ahead hey i'm in my 60s uh and i did the work of 25 30 year olds and i worked them into
[3:16:21.800 --> 3:16:26.920]  the ground and you wanted to why and i've tested this and i've taken your b12 and let me tell you
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:33.640]  when i don't take it i pay a price i really do i take that b12 and i am electric man i can run
[3:16:33.640 --> 3:16:39.480]  10 miles i i do some pretty heavy work uh with a highway department and my friends will attest to
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:45.880]  the fact that yeah for a guy in his 60s you know pushing 70 i'm and i'm no i'm not just blowing
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:55.400]  smoke here the b12 saves my life
[3:16:56.920 --> 3:17:04.920]  i'm sitting here it's in the early morning hours and i'm looking at mainstream news reporting on
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:10.280]  the fact that even the controlled revolving door fda has come out and said that the moderna and
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:15.960]  phaser shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because he in studies they did on
[3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:21.480]  children it caused myocarditis that starts swelling and heart attacks and then i noticed that even
[3:17:21.480 --> 3:17:26.200]  though this is even in the associated press it's not getting any circulation it's not on the national
[3:17:26.200 --> 3:17:30.840]  news and it's very hard to even find on places like instagram or twitter it's just crazy and then
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:37.240]  Fauci was on tv just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody
[3:17:37.240 --> 3:17:42.440]  your conspiracy theorists if you say it it's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:46.520]  a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems they gave the exact
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:52.120]  reasons why and now it happened that's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air they
[3:17:52.120 --> 3:17:57.400]  get away with even more of this crap this is just insane these people are killers the engineers at
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:04.520]  bio pros are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer
[3:18:04.520 --> 3:18:09.800]  market since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago they come out with four new

[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:26.120]  other major chemical corporations have been using patented naturally occurring specially
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:33.640]  bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters that's how powerful these naturally
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:39.480]  occurring microbes are the bio pro system is light years better than traditional enzymes
[3:18:39.480 --> 3:18:46.040]  that only work once these bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank and now it's available

[3:18:52.200 --> 3:19:01.640]  bio pros dot com i have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul i've ever
[3:19:01.640 --> 3:19:08.920]  had in my 47 years on this planet i've had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's because
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:19.720]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[3:19:19.720 --> 3:19:27.720]  it and now we're just throwing it all away and i see the general public in a medically induced
[3:19:27.720 --> 3:19:35.080]  scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled tranche and i know we're being fed
[3:19:35.080 --> 3:19:41.720]  into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:47.320]  and then growth and then falling apart and then deteriorating collapsing and then coming back to
[3:19:47.320 --> 3:19:52.600]  life again it's just the gloves are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:20:01.800]  decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:21.160]  all right we now the root back with you yes hosting for alex jones great honor thank you alex great
[3:20:21.160 --> 3:20:25.320]  to be with your audience i know you've got one of the largest audiences in all of america and
[3:20:25.320 --> 3:20:31.800]  around the world because people respond to truth and so i hope i could do you justice here today
[3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:36.040]  you know it's funny because during the break i heard all alex's advertisements and promotions
[3:20:36.040 --> 3:20:41.080]  for vitamins and i just happen to be a vitamin guy just pure chance i really don't know any other
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:46.200]  major conservative commentator other than alex i guess who who sells a lot of great
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:50.920]  vitamins and nutritional supplements but whose whole life has been dedicated to vitamins and
[3:20:50.920 --> 3:20:55.800]  just pure chance that's my thing you know that's why covid was never a big issue with me it's
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:21:00.600]  terrible it's horrible it's a real thing covid exists it's not it's not made up i think it was
[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:06.120]  sent by china to destroy us purposely i don't even think it was a leak from a bio warfare lab
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:10.520]  i think they were losing the trade war and they were about to go broke their whole economy
[3:21:10.520 --> 3:21:14.440]  was going to collapse and they knew that if president trump was reelected they were dead
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:20.280]  and forever they were knocked out america would never they could never catch america america would
[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:27.160]  never relinquish the economic mantle to china they were falling and we were rising trump had us on a
[3:21:27.160 --> 3:21:33.800]  straight curve up and they said let's release this bio warfare weapon and destroy america and
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:39.720]  destroy the economy and put millions of people out of work and kill the gdp and boy did they
[3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:45.160]  was it like negative 40 percent worse than history and let's kill trumps reelection effort
[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:51.320]  let's destroy everything that he has that that is his mantle which is the economy is great
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:58.840]  donald trump's mantle was look what i did for the economy everybody's got a job every black person
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:04.760]  as a job every hispanic person as a job every minority as a job every gay as a job every woman
[3:22:04.760 --> 3:22:10.840]  as a job every muslim as a job my god it was the most incredible economic performance in history
[3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:15.560]  and they said let's destroy it all so they sent it this way it's a purposeful attack
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:21.320]  on the united states and western civilization and they knocked us for a loop but it's real
[3:22:21.320 --> 3:22:27.720]  therefore it is real it is a real deadly pandemic people are sick but if you take the right vitamins
[3:22:27.720 --> 3:22:31.640]  and i'm not talking about covid i don't ever want to make any claims about covid but if you take the
[3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:37.080]  right vitamins you don't worry about illness in general because you have a strong immune system
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:43.000]  that's what whole life's been dedicated to because my mom and dad died of cancer 28 days apart
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:47.400]  my mom of breast cancer my dad of lung cancer never smoked the day in his life by the way
[3:22:47.400 --> 3:22:53.240]  lung cancer and breast cancer 28 days apart on different floors of the same hospital in
[3:22:53.240 --> 3:22:57.720]  valhalla hospital uh or maybe it's westchester county medical center in valhalla new york
[3:22:57.720 --> 3:23:02.200]  i was born and raised in uh in new york westchester county so my father was on the second floor my
[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:07.880]  mother was on the third floor and i was a anchor man for cnbc then known as financial news network
[3:23:07.880 --> 3:23:13.880]  in los angeles and i was flying 3000 miles back and forth every week to uh to say goodbye to my
[3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:18.680]  parents because i knew time was short and they were dying and they died 28 days apart and it was
[3:23:18.680 --> 3:23:23.880]  the toughest months of my life and the toughest weeks of my life and those toughest 28 days of my
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:30.440]  life and i set my mind then even though it started earlier in my fascination with nutrition and
[3:23:30.440 --> 3:23:35.960]  fitness and health i work out 90 minutes a day every day i'm 60 years old and i feel like i'm 25
[3:23:35.960 --> 3:23:41.640]  i work out 90 minutes a day every day without fail um and generally start each day with 90
[3:23:41.640 --> 3:23:47.880]  minutes of workout and and uh take a hundred vitamin pills a day almost all of them immune
[3:23:47.880 --> 3:23:52.840]  building proimmune you know was that gal from fuller house i can't remember her name camera and
[3:23:52.840 --> 3:23:58.760]  something and uh she's beautiful blonde gal it was on full house or fuller house and uh now she's
[3:23:58.760 --> 3:24:03.640]  on hallmark network on all the christmas shows and she said i'm not anti-vaccine i'm just pro
[3:24:03.640 --> 3:24:09.560]  immune system and that's what i am i'm not anti-vax i'm pro immune system why would i have to worry
[3:24:09.560 --> 3:24:18.680]  about a vaccine or mass or lockdowns when i haven't had the flu in 35 years i haven't had a cold in 15
[3:24:18.680 --> 3:24:24.200]  years i don't know what illness is thank god knock on wood pray to god thank you for my health
[3:24:24.200 --> 3:24:29.960]  but nobody gave it to me i work for it you know every day health health health and conservative
[3:24:29.960 --> 3:24:35.880]  politics are my loves and sports gambling too by the way my my sports gambling website vagus
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:40.680]  winners dot com that's my other big career vagus winners dot com where we pick the winners of
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:44.840]  point spread winners of football games for millions and millions of people there there are now
[3:24:44.840 --> 3:24:49.640]  in case you didn't know this there i believe it's uh 45 million americans are going to make a bet this
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:54.520]  year on the nfl between now and the soup bowl and so i built an entire business publicly traded took

[3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:03.560]  or who's going to beat the point spread in a football game at vagus winners dot com so it's
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:08.840]  another one of my businesses just like alex i run a lot of businesses i'm an entrepreneur who loves it
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:14.760]  i'm a businessman i'm a ceo i'm on many boards of directors and i'm a conservative talk show host
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:19.400]  and a conservative commentator and best-selling author so so back to my book the great patriot
[3:25:19.400 --> 3:25:24.680]  protest the boycott book the point of my book is that we're getting our our brains hammered in
[3:25:24.680 --> 3:25:31.480]  okay they're running us over like roadkill democrats liberals communists marxist socialists
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:39.160]  because they understand intimidation and we don't we're too nice nice guys finish last my book is
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:45.960]  about the philosophy and strategy of martin luther king dr martin luther king he believes in civil
[3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:51.320]  disobedience and look what he achieved for black america with civil disobedience he said if you
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:55.960]  want us to sit in the back of the bus we're gonna sit in the front of the bus till you drag us away
[3:25:55.960 --> 3:26:01.160]  and club us and when you do that more will take our place and you do that to them more will take
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:05.480]  our place i grew up in an all black neighborhood okay i was the only white kid in a black town
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:09.880]  which is all black middle school all black high school now vernon new york on the bronze border
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:15.080]  line and and i have a great love and respect for african-american people and a great love and
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:21.160]  respect for dr martin luther king and i had a front seat at 60 years old now i saw the civil
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:27.000]  rights movement i saw the progress they made with civil disobedience and strikes and boycotts
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:32.200]  and protests and that's what we need so i wrote this book the great patriot protest and boycott
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:37.080]  book to last i'll mention of the book this is not a a sales seminar okay i'm here to educate all of
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:42.840]  you on the great alex joneshow but i wrote the book to teach conservatives how to use protest
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:48.840]  boycotts strikes and civil disobedience just like liberals have done to us for decades and inside
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:54.200]  the book i not only teach you how to do it but i gave you the names and phone numbers and emails
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:27:00.920]  and social media addresses and physical mailing addresses of all the top woke liberal ceo's in
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:06.040]  america who run the biggest companies in america so now you just open the book and you hammer them
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:11.000]  you hound them and you hammer them you call them and you call them and you email them and you email
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.960]  them and you go to their social media and you attack them never violence just like martin luther
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:21.480]  king never violence don't give them a chance to take one of our guns away don't give them a chance
[3:27:21.480 --> 3:27:27.400]  to confiscate the guns of conservatives christians and patriots and trump voters don't do that no
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:32.920]  violence we're not like liberals we're not like antifa we don't burn and loot and threaten and
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:38.440]  riot and murder like black lives matter we don't sing songs about murdering cops dead pigs in a
[3:27:38.440 --> 3:27:43.640]  blanket okay we don't think the only good cops a dead cop we love cops i appreciate the thin blue
[3:27:43.640 --> 3:27:49.880]  line so we don't ever attack we don't ever use violence but we use the dollar because we make
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:55.400]  all the money in america the great american middle class has the power you have the power
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:01.400]  to take them down and starve them and bankrupt them and bring these companies to their knees
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:07.480]  and the same thing with the government let's use money to bankrupt them and protest and strikes
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:12.360]  look at the southwest airlines pilots they did exactly what i recommend in this book
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:16.760]  and they brought southwest to their knees and southwest ceo just announced they won't fire
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:22.280]  anyone over the mandate the vaccine mandate then delta ceo said the same thing and he's a big liberal
[3:28:22.280 --> 3:28:27.400]  i've actually got him in the book the delta ceo he's in the book the great patriot protest
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:32.280]  and boycott book his phone number an e-mailer in the book people must have gone after him and he
[3:28:32.280 --> 3:28:36.280]  listened because we threatened we're not going to fly deltas or southwest anymore if you hurt
[3:28:36.280 --> 3:28:41.800]  these pilots and the pilots won't fly anymore your company can't survive without our dollars
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:46.760]  and our workers simple as that that's my philosophy when i get back i'm going to tell you about
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:53.720]  clower pivot the strategy being used to destroy the united states of america i learned in college
[3:28:53.720 --> 3:28:58.680]  waits you hear this story take two you know why do my enemies hate me so much why do the
[3:28:58.680 --> 3:29:05.000]  globalists take you so much why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:11.400]  that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for
[3:29:11.400 --> 3:29:18.520]  their world government their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:25.320]  and due process injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with
[3:29:25.320 --> 3:29:31.320]  bill gates you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:37.400]  they started a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away
[3:29:37.400 --> 3:29:43.400]  they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put it to them
[3:29:43.400 --> 3:29:47.560]  the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism
[3:29:47.560 --> 3:29:52.280]  or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[3:29:52.280 --> 3:30:01.160]  attack we have any chance of beating these people cover commander here with an important message to
[3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:09.400]  humanity i have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe
[3:30:10.120 --> 3:30:20.760]  but the injection is not ready and so i need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days
[3:30:20.760 --> 3:30:29.240]  to flatten the cans i also need you to wear masks and i also need you to only shop at mega
[3:30:29.240 --> 3:30:37.960]  corporations that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:47.320]  that only i own profitable you will then be my slaves oh and then you'll get that special shot
[3:30:47.320 --> 3:30:53.400]  of freedom from copra will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest
[3:30:53.400 --> 3:31:00.200]  of your miserable lives we've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a
[3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:05.240]  concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group
[3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:09.000]  so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:14.680]  didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up oh the global
[3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:18.680]  social credit score that china's putting in that's banning people to three hours of video games a
[3:31:18.680 --> 3:31:23.800]  week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:29.000]  brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now
[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:32.520]  they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you
[3:31:32.520 --> 3:31:37.800]  go what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about
[3:31:37.800 --> 3:31:42.840]  you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left is having fun right now with
[3:31:42.840 --> 3:31:46.760]  all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're
[3:31:46.760 --> 3:31:50.600]  all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and
[3:31:50.600 --> 3:31:55.080]  promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists

[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:13.960]  you to be strong and healthy so listen alex great stuff because we want every conservative to live
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:19.960]  to 120 or 150 you know because we got to keep fighting and while you're alive we don't want
[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:24.360]  you slumped in a wheelchair in a nursing home where they get you with covid right of course
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:29.160]  covid kills people slumped in a wheelchair in a nursing home with alzheimer's they're weak and
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:34.120]  their body's gone and their brain is gone of course covid gets in it kills them but for the
[3:34:34.120 --> 3:34:39.800]  average healthy person especially those who take the right vitamins uh your immune system strong
[3:34:39.800 --> 3:34:44.520]  enough to spend your nights worrying all day long there's no cure for covid by the way nothing
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:50.600]  guarantees you won't get covid or cold but i'm just a believer in proimmune strong immune system
[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:56.440]  all right so let's go brandon i love saying that i really do because everybody knows what it
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:35:01.400]  represents right screw joe biden that's what everybody sings and chants and every football
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:07.640]  game in america now that's the big thing you know f joe biden uh or let's go brandon one one version
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:12.680]  of the other because the guy's destroying our country but i want to give you a few solutions
[3:35:12.680 --> 3:35:16.840]  okay i told you i wrote that book the great patriot protest the boycott book it's about
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:23.800]  solutions anyone could complain the southwest pilots southwest airlines pilots they pulled it off
[3:35:24.600 --> 3:35:29.640]  you've got to fight the government you've got to fight the companies you've got to strike or boycott
[3:35:29.640 --> 3:35:35.960]  or protest or commit civil disobedience to win that's what all conservative patriots and christians
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:42.360]  must do for now on forget that turn the other cheek stuff it's a different time and place the
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:49.720]  devil is in control evil is permeating our world and you've got to fight without turning the other
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:54.760]  cheek you got to hit him strong you got to hit him hard and so i you know i i've had a lot of
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:59.400]  ideas i think i mentioned this the last time i was a guest on alex's show i said you know new york
[3:35:59.400 --> 3:36:05.000]  and san francisco and chicago they won't let you into the stores or restaurants anymore unless you're
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:10.520]  vaccinated they try to take our lives away right but in vegas they don't do that i live in vegas last
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:17.640]  vegas and uh all i could tell you is the first restaurant that tries that i will get at least
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:25.160]  a minimum i will bring 10 000 of my fans to your front door and we will lock arms and not let anybody
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:30.120]  in until you're out of business i don't care if that takes two weeks we'll come back every day or
[3:36:30.120 --> 3:36:35.560]  every night or both till you're out of business and then when number two tries it we'll do the same
[3:36:35.560 --> 3:36:39.960]  thing and after we put all them out of business there won't be a number three or a number four
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:45.960]  that's civil disobedience and my book came out a month ago and now southwest airlines they did
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:53.800]  exactly what i'm talking about god bless you bravo pilots of southwest you pulled off that civil
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:36:59.240]  disobedience and i've got a lot of ideas like that i want to throw a few of them at you um
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:07.560]  first of all how about we have conservative strike fridays maybe not every friday maybe every other
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:13.640]  friday maybe once a month but every conservative host in america and i'm a god i don't see any of
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:19.560]  these hosts as competitors are mine uh i see them as friends i see them as teammates whether it's
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:25.400]  alex jones or marco levin or sean hannity or tucker carlson i don't care who it is way now the
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:29.960]  route doesn't fear any of you you're not my competitor we're on the same team we need to
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:36.920]  all get together on a zoom call on a conference call and plan conservative strike fridays
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:43.240]  where every conservative patriot in america and every christian america to protest joe biden
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:48.200]  and what's going on in this country the open borders and the vaccine mandates and the attempt
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:53.480]  to have the iris become the nazi uh you know gestapo uh the attempt to just have the iris
[3:37:53.480 --> 3:38:00.200]  snooping our bank accounts uh the list goes on and on and on the disaster afghanistan all of this
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:07.000]  all of this critical race theory right the stolen 2020 election to protest all of it and make our
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:13.080]  voice heard what if every conservative in america calls in sick one friday a month or two fridays
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:18.680]  a month all coordinated and you don't leave your house you don't go on the road you don't buy gas
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:23.400]  you don't buy groceries you buy it on thursday in other words we're not even hurting businesses
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:28.680]  because everything we need will buy on thursday before the friday great sick out right but don't
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:34.200]  send your kids to school don't buy anything online don't buy anything and what you'll see as america
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:39.240]  becomes a ghost town on that friday and we'll do that several fridays in a row till you understand
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:45.720]  the economic power of conservatives and patriots and christians and 80 million trump voters we are
[3:38:45.720 --> 3:38:52.120]  the great silent and i want to make us now the loudmouth majority i want us to be the loudmouth
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:58.040]  majority we will put all of you out of business we'll show you how we could put you out of business
[3:38:58.040 --> 3:39:05.160]  if we stop by and stop being your customer we matter to america and so we have to show them
[3:39:05.160 --> 3:39:11.240]  that we matter and if every conservative listens to me and we could pull this off several fridays
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:18.600]  in a row and and america becomes literally a ghost town on fridays and the schools are a ghost town
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:23.000]  and the offices are a ghost town the only people that show up are the liberals now you know who
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:28.600]  you are a fire right there's 30 people in an office only 10 show up those are the 10 you got
[3:39:28.600 --> 3:39:34.600]  a fire those are the slackers who are doing nothing the liberal losers the rest of us are home
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:40.120]  nothing's going to get done without us working that's what we got to do right so those are an example
[3:39:40.120 --> 3:39:47.400]  of just a couple of ideas um i also think we got to all get together and never buy a single product
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:53.720]  made in china ever again we got to bring china to our knees and bankrupt china another idea um i
[3:39:53.720 --> 3:40:00.520]  think we need to fight like animals like cornered wolverines for voter id we're the only country in
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:06.680]  the world in the industrialized world that doesn't have voter id that's how they're stealing elections
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:10.840]  but despite everything else that may or may not have happened despite anything anybody says about
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:16.680]  voting machines and switched votes and this or that in the end the core way the election of 2020
[3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:23.160]  was stolen is so simple there was no voter id in most blue states and many battleground states
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:28.600]  and all they did was fill out millions of fake mail-in ballots because of a covid pandemic
[3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:33.640]  in coordination with the chinese right the chinese must have gotten together with the democrat party
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:39.080]  after they released this poison and said now we did the dirty work we released this poison
[3:40:39.080 --> 3:40:44.520]  horrible pandemic and people are gonna die and your nation's gonna be destroyed and your economy
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:50.840]  is going to be ruined but here's a good spot for you guys democrats trump will be gone all you need
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:56.280]  to do is mail in voting with no voter id and because the pandemic everyone will feel bad for you
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:01.240]  and they'll agree to it and that's what happened and they agree to it and no matter what a lead
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:07.080]  trump had if trump had gotten a hundred million votes which he may have by the way i think he
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:12.840]  got between 80 and 90 million votes i think biden got about 60 million they cheated massively with
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:21.720]  20 or 30 million fake fraudulent no voter id there and no signature matching uh mail-in ballots
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:27.480]  plus they were able to count them days after the election and they stopped the count on election night
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:31.720]  how dumb do you think we are then you brought in all the fake ballots in the middle of the night
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:37.480]  and in the morning or a day later or two days later oh we overcame trumps lead you know i may
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:42.840]  have been not been born yesterday i sure wasn't born in the last five minutes i'm not that stupid
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:47.880]  anybody who believes that was born in the last five minutes you're the most naive moron what
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:52.920]  we used to say in new york if you believe that you're a schmuck if you actually can look me in the
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:41:59.080]  face and say trump was leading in every one of those deep battleground states and they stopped the
[3:41:59.080 --> 3:42:04.040]  count and said we're not going to count till the morning they did it together in a conspiracy
[3:42:04.040 --> 3:42:09.080]  unheard of never had in the history of america when you woke up they had found hundreds of
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:14.840]  thousands of new ballots oh looky here and no signature matching and they counted them for
[3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:20.360]  days after the election and they were all batches of a hundred thousand is zero in favor of joe
[3:42:20.360 --> 3:42:25.800]  biden and a hundred thousand to a hundred in favor of joe biden and a hundred thousand to a thousand
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:32.920]  in favor of joe biden it was such a simple plan to steal the election so we need voter id and you
[3:42:32.920 --> 3:42:36.920]  know i'll tell you what we need homeschooling because you're gonna have to take your kids out
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:41.800]  of school now they're planning to inject with the death jab that's caused so much damage and
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:47.080]  so much death kids are five to eleven years old twenty million of them they want to do it quickly

[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:12.280]  jones today a couple more things to save america number one some ideas from me number one just
[3:48:12.280 --> 3:48:18.120]  off the top of my head these are some things i jotted down the last day uh we have to fight if
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:24.680]  we do win back the uh the house and the senate in 2022 and that's a big if because if elections are
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:29.320]  rigged it doesn't matter what the polls say it doesn't matter that everybody hates biden
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:34.760]  everybody chance let's go brandon or or screw joe biden we're still going to lose a lot of
[3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:41.720]  key races because of stolen elections but if we do win we got to get voter id and we've got to get
[3:48:41.720 --> 3:48:47.560]  the civil rights act to be updated to include political beliefs you know you can't discriminate
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:53.240]  against someone for race or gender why you know or being gay why are you allowed to discriminate
[3:48:53.240 --> 3:48:59.400]  because someone's a conservative we've got to fight that that's a way to fight it make that a civil
[3:48:59.400 --> 3:49:06.440]  right you can't ban us you can't censor us you can't fire us from a job you can't prevent us from
[3:49:06.440 --> 3:49:13.080]  renting or buying a house or getting a bank loan or getting a credit card because we're a conservative
[3:49:13.080 --> 3:49:19.240]  or a liberal by the way in america no one's political beliefs race religion or gender should
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:24.920]  ever prevent them from doing those things or how about walking in a restaurant you shouldn't be able
[3:49:24.920 --> 3:49:31.720]  to discriminate against me because i'm unvaccinated that's insane insane and here's the last one i
[3:49:31.720 --> 3:49:36.200]  mentioned homeschooling that's important too and by the way i'm not new to that because i have four
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:42.760]  kids and i homeschooled all four kids uh and one of them the oldest one went to harvard her first
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:48.600]  classroom of her life was in harvard and she's about to get her doctorate and be doctor to
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:53.480]  coda root i'm very proud of my daughter to coda root and my other three kids are just as smarter
[3:49:53.480 --> 3:49:58.360]  smarter and brighter than her so they're all doing great homeschooling works but here's another idea
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:03.880]  for you i've been divorced i'm not ashamed to admit that half of america's been divorced and
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:08.680]  everyone in america knows people that are divorced whether it's your kids whether it's your parents
[3:50:08.680 --> 3:50:13.640]  everyone's been through divorce of some guy right has experience with divorce it's not the end of the
[3:50:13.640 --> 3:50:20.920]  world it's terrible and it sucks but it's not the end of the world america needs a divorce mommy is a
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:29.800]  crazed liberal whack job a communist nut job mommy has eyes bulging out of her head and she wants to
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:36.120]  kill daddy with a knife to the throat and daddy is a nice republican businessman those two can't
[3:50:36.120 --> 3:50:42.920]  live together they can't coexist california can't coexist anymore with utah and oklahoma
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:48.120]  and texas and florida and tennessee and all the great conservative states out there wyoming and
[3:50:48.120 --> 3:50:54.040]  idio and montana we're going to need some sort of a divorce in this country i don't like to use
[3:50:54.040 --> 3:50:59.240]  the word secession because that brings back memories of the civil war and i don't want a civil war
[3:50:59.240 --> 3:51:04.040]  and i don't want to scare anybody just call it a divorce i've said this for months i'm the first
[3:51:04.040 --> 3:51:09.960]  guy in the country i said this two years ago that if trump is defeated and some commie gets elected
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:15.880]  and tries to destroy america and brainwash us and fill us with propaganda and ban us and censor us
[3:51:15.880 --> 3:51:21.160]  and open the borders i predicted all this we're gonna need a divorce we gotta have a loosely
[3:51:21.160 --> 3:51:26.360]  kind of like the e you right the european union all those countries don't hate each other they're
[3:51:26.360 --> 3:51:31.400]  all part of the european union but they all have their own government and their own laws and their
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:36.280]  own rules and and that's what you know belgium is different than france is different than germany is
[3:51:36.280 --> 3:51:41.400]  different than italy is different in spain right each state in america's gotta become its own
[3:51:42.440 --> 3:51:47.080]  country state right and and some of them will take the left and some will take the right
[3:51:47.080 --> 3:51:53.240]  and will all be under the luci loosely uh federated umbrella of the united states of america
[3:51:53.240 --> 3:51:59.640]  but we are all our own laws right because people in texas can't live under critical race theory
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:04.600]  open borders and vaccine mandates and the spending of biden and the irs let loose to
[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:10.440]  destroy everyone's lives and the military filled with transgenders the whole thing is ridiculous
[3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:16.920]  i will not and cannot live under those sick communist rules so we're gonna need some sort of a way
[3:52:16.920 --> 3:52:22.840]  to separate i would just call it a divorce right and it doesn't mean you're leaving completely
[3:52:22.840 --> 3:52:28.120]  we might share some loose things and then we might be completely separate you know when it comes to
[3:52:28.120 --> 3:52:34.040]  like each state as its own traffic laws already each state as its own some have the death penalty
[3:52:34.040 --> 3:52:39.560]  some don't why can't we go a little bit further each state has its own tax collection that has
[3:52:39.560 --> 3:52:44.040]  nothing to do ever again with the federal government and if i live in nevada where i live now i have
[3:52:44.040 --> 3:52:49.160]  zero income taxes and all i pay is a sales tax and a property tax and if you're dumb enough to live
[3:52:49.160 --> 3:52:55.880]  in california you could pay a 30 percent income tax good luck to you moron so we need some sort of
[3:52:55.880 --> 3:53:01.880]  a way to separate from these crazy lunatics that want to ruin our country and fill it with nothing
[3:53:01.880 --> 3:53:09.080]  but foreigners if you want to make california mexico jr that's fine then you can have california
[3:53:09.080 --> 3:53:16.680]  we give it to you right we let you have it but i want to keep nevada arizona utah wyoming montana
[3:53:16.680 --> 3:53:23.320]  idaho uh tennessee florida texas etc etc we're gonna have our union you have your union it's called
[3:53:23.320 --> 3:53:28.120]  a divorce once you get divorced it's terrible at first to think about it then you do it and you're
[3:53:28.120 --> 3:53:32.200]  like why didn't i do this a long time ago i you know i can't sit at the kitchen table anymore
[3:53:32.200 --> 3:53:37.480]  with this person i hate well we hate them and they hate us except they want to kill us that's
[3:53:37.480 --> 3:53:41.960]  the difference i don't want to kill anybody i don't want to censor anyone i wouldn't ban anyone
[3:53:41.960 --> 3:53:45.880]  but i you know with just minutes to go i never got to the main point i was going to tell you
[3:53:45.880 --> 3:53:49.960]  about today the next time i guess those for alex i'll lay it out the case in an entire
[3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:55.160]  you know hour or two hours or whatever guess those time i've got clowered piven but i'll give you
[3:53:55.160 --> 3:53:58.840]  the short version now what do we have left tell me in my ear how many minutes we have left
[3:54:00.200 --> 3:54:06.120]  like three four minutes three minutes and 45 seconds hey i'm pretty good three four minutes
[3:54:06.120 --> 3:54:12.200]  in this three hours three minutes and 45 seconds clowered piven is what i learned as a sob son of
[3:54:12.200 --> 3:54:17.480]  a butcher who graduated valedictorian of his class and went to columbia university got accepted at
[3:54:17.480 --> 3:54:23.400]  columbia they taught a course called clowered piven and it was two columbia college professors
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:28.520]  who were married to each other husband and wife and they wanted to destroy america as we know it
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:34.120]  and turn it into a socialist nation they said you've got to overwhelm the economy by getting
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:40.360]  everybody on welfare which builds up the debt the economy collapses under the weight of the debt
[3:54:40.360 --> 3:54:44.680]  every you know the few people at work can't support all the people on welfare and the country goes
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:51.080]  under and they tried to do this for 40 years this was obama's goal this was clinton's goal
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:56.520]  they all know rules for radicals and clowered piven they all studied the same things at their fancy
[3:54:56.520 --> 3:55:01.880]  elite ivy league schools as i did and they very well all know this plan and they tried to overwhelm
[3:55:01.880 --> 3:55:08.040]  the system but there's too many great conservatives patriots christians 80 million or so trump voters
[3:55:08.040 --> 3:55:14.680]  who will never be on welfare and food stamps i'd rather die i would die before i ever accepted
[3:55:14.680 --> 3:55:19.160]  a handout from the government that's how my parents raised me and i know most of you think the same
[3:55:19.160 --> 3:55:23.320]  way maybe all of you watch you right now think the same way so they couldn't get everyone in
[3:55:23.320 --> 3:55:29.960]  america on welfare so clowered piven failed so now they stole an election they rigged and stole
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:35.800]  an election based on a pandemic from china purposely sent our way and then in collusion
[3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:40.280]  with the chinese again all the help they wanted democrat party rigged and stole an election
[3:55:40.280 --> 3:55:45.960]  with mail-in ballots based on coven oh i'm so scared because you don't take the right vitamins and
[3:55:45.960 --> 3:55:50.840]  the right immune stimulants you morons so they scared everyone to death and all the liberals
[3:55:50.840 --> 3:55:56.120]  said we must have mail-in ballots with no voter id and no signature matching and count them for
[3:55:56.120 --> 3:56:03.000]  days after the election once they stole the election they changed modified clowered piven
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:09.560]  to make it about open borders and vaccine mandates that's my opinion this is how they're
[3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:15.400]  carrying out clowered piven with open borders and vaccine mandates if you can't get everyone in
[3:56:15.400 --> 3:56:21.240]  america on welfare just let the whole world in invite them in give them all free health care
[3:56:21.240 --> 3:56:25.720]  invite every sick person in the world to come to america and get free health care invite every
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:32.600]  poor person every dumb person every criminal right every evil person in the world empty the
[3:56:32.600 --> 3:56:39.560]  jails in guatemala empty the jails in el salvador empty the jails in hady and send all your criminals
[3:56:39.560 --> 3:56:44.120]  and thugs our way and they'll all be democrat voters and they'll all be on welfare from cradle
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:50.120]  to grave there's clowered piven and they've all got covid and he doesn't care joe biden couldn't
[3:56:50.120 --> 3:56:55.080]  care less he says there's a covid epidemic but he's letting the whole world in at the border
[3:56:55.080 --> 3:57:01.080]  to make it worse and worse sicker and sicker so that he can impose vaccine mandates and every
[3:57:01.080 --> 3:57:06.920]  time he opposes vaccine mandates remember defund the police this is defund the middle class
[3:57:06.920 --> 3:57:12.520]  defund the silent majority defund all the patriots who work for a living who voted for
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:17.720]  trump if they won't take the vaccine they lose their jobs their salaries and their pensions
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:24.840]  he just defunded the middle class he defunded all of us who lost our jobs defunded us so that
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:31.960]  combination is the clowered piven they're using that strategy to destroy the united states of america
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:37.080]  but i'm gonna go through the whole list next time i'm on the show because i've got 20 parts of it
[3:57:37.080 --> 3:57:44.120]  that are the 20 biggest scams in world history all being opposed at the same time right now wait
[3:57:44.120 --> 3:57:58.360]  our route if you only knew the power of the dark side join bill gates and together we will defeat
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:08.760]  humanity then our god see will reward us with eternal life that's basically the ethos of the
[3:58:08.760 --> 3:58:16.680]  globalists they must first play god they must first prove that they are the fittest in their
[3:58:16.680 --> 3:58:22.600]  social Darwinistic system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dump us down
[3:58:22.600 --> 3:58:27.800]  and poison us and destroy our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open
[3:58:27.800 --> 3:58:36.120]  we really deserve what's happened to us so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the
[3:58:36.120 --> 3:58:42.520]  new order even more i know i'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines the
