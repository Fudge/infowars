[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:20.320]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]  one!
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:48.280]  Here's your host, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.360]  During the biggest fire catastrophe in Canadian history, on June 2nd, there were over a hundred
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.780]  forest fires in Quebec, with ten of them out of control.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.280]  The province's fire prevention agency says it only has the ability to fight 30 fires.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.800]  This massive outbreak of fires was captured by longtime geological watchdog YouTube channel
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800]  Dutch Sensei.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.760]  Here's last night, here's today.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.000]  All of southeast Quebec just caught on fire guys, all of it.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.800]  Insane, insane, look at that, the whole thing, all at once.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.520]  Michael Janich of the Dutch Sensei channel has been monitoring earthquakes and other
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.680]  geological activity for years, successfully predicting earthquakes and issuing warnings
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.400]  when the USGS won't.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.000]  Janich has often reported on fires that break out along the edge of the Plate Craton, or
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.600]  fires that break out around volcanoes.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.840]  All the way across central Mexico from over here, following all the way across over to
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.720]  here, all fires, all at once, all yesterday, not normal.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.960]  We don't normally see this.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.960]  So that being said, I want to just show you what's there, and we'll just go zoom in from
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.800]  over here, all the way across to here.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]  Let's just zoom in in the middle.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.320]  Well, we could start over on the left side or in the middle.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.780]  You'll see a bunch of little dots on the ground.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.280]  As I zoom in, you'll see they're changed from dots to actual volcanoes.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.720]  These are all volcanoes, every single one of these, the big ones and the small ones.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.600]  And he's captured images of what appears to be directed energy weapons, sparking California
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.640]  wildfires in 2020.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.640]  But the fires from last week were not along the edge of the Craton or near a volcano.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.400]  As far as we know, the only other explanations would be that it was manmade and there was
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.000]  no sign of a directed energy weapon.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.120]  It's not just a Canadian forest fire problem anymore.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.720]  I'm going to have to say it, guys.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.520]  It looks like you got a problem going on up there that might be related to, I don't know.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.520]  What do you think?
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.520]  You think that these fires might be related to, I don't know.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]  What do you think?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.000]  Terrorism, directed energy weapon, war, the Russians, Chinese, what are ourselves?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  All the above.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  Whatever.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.260]  At this level, you're going to burn out everybody, you're going to burn out all the natural wildlife
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.260]  and everything.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.260]  Come on, man.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.560]  Even if you're an anarchist or something.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560]  Come on, guys.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.160]  Look, dude, I don't see you burning down the Federal Reserve.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.160]  Not that you want to.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160]  I'm not telling you to.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160]  I didn't say that.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.880]  There's evidence of arson in the American West Coast wildfires, and U.S. climate czar
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.880]  John Kerry just called out for his instinct rebellion mob to be more militant.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.680]  We have to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.080]  This is the biggest organizational effort that I think we have faced, certainly since
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.840]  World War II, but perhaps ever.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.120]  We got to push more.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.160]  We got to be more militant, maybe.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.800]  Just like California and Australia, these fires will be blamed on cow farts and human
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.240]  civilization.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.440]  The captured government of Canada is telling the people to stay out of the woods.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.000]  They are ignoring volunteer firemen and asking Trudeau for the military and foreign workers
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.840]  to rebuild.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.340]  The New World Order needs an excuse to lock us down one more time, and this could be it.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.740]  Getting people out of their homes is an old tactic used for stealing their land.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.260]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:07.024]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely
[00:05:07.024 --> 00:05:15.104]  popular Tooth Whitening Coral Calcium Toothpaste, full of essential oils, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:19.104]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:26.944 --> 00:06:33.784]  You now make a point of, that's an investment criteria for you.
[00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:38.904]  Well, behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:45.824]  You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors, 54% of the incoming
[00:06:45.824 --> 00:06:47.584]  class are women.
[00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:55.784]  We added four more points in terms of diverse employment this year, and what we are doing
[00:06:55.784 --> 00:07:00.984]  internally is, if you don't achieve these levels of impact, your compensation could
[00:07:00.984 --> 00:07:02.344]  be impacted, okay?
[00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:03.344]  We're doing the same thing.
[00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:08.144]  And so, it's just, you have to force behaviors.
[00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:13.624]  And if you don't force behaviors, whether it's gender, or race, or just any way you
[00:07:13.624 --> 00:07:18.344]  want to say the composition of your team, you're going to be impacted.
[00:07:18.344 --> 00:07:22.584]  And that's just not recruiting, it is development, as Ken said.
[00:07:22.584 --> 00:07:27.704]  But ultimately, it's still going to take time, but I am just as much shocked as Ken
[00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:30.024]  is that we have not done it.
[00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:39.384]  That's the most powerful banker in the world, with quadrillions under their control, of
[00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:45.984]  fraudulent fractional reserve money they've created, saying, we're going to use money
[00:07:45.984 --> 00:07:52.224]  to socially control you, and run your life.
[00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:55.984]  To force behaviors.
[00:07:55.984 --> 00:07:59.544]  Now in the Bible, we're told in Revelation that the Antichrist sets up a world system
[00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:05.504]  to monitor everything we do, to track what we do, and that we have to worship the beast,
[00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:10.464]  and comply with the beast, and follow the beast's directions, or the beast removes our
[00:08:10.464 --> 00:08:14.304]  power to eat and live.
[00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:15.384]  That's the social credit score.
[00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:18.264]  So whether you believe in Revelation or not, it believes in you.
[00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:23.584]  Whether you believe in the devil or not, the devil believes in you and is coming for
[00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:31.504]  our children, that's the primary target of all of this.
[00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:38.264]  So again, I want to thank you all for joining us here today.
[00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:46.664]  I intend to do what I did yesterday again, and I intend to open the phones up and take
[00:08:46.784 --> 00:08:55.744]  your calls, and I intend to cover the big Tucker Carlson event that just took place
[00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:56.744]  last night.
[00:08:56.744 --> 00:09:01.624]  I haven't checked in a few hours, but the last time I checked, before I did two hours
[00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:06.824]  live with Steven Crowder out of his studio today, where I am right now, Tucker Carlson
[00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:13.704]  had 68 million impressions, or people that saw at least part of the video.
[00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:17.264]  I would guess it's probably 20, 30 million that actually watched it.
[00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:23.624]  I mean, it'll be 100 million by tonight, meaning 50 million people actually watch the 10-minute
[00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:24.624]  video.
[00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:27.984]  That's the estimates with the algorithm that I've seen.
[00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.584]  Of course, people love Tucker Carlson.
[00:09:29.584 --> 00:09:30.584]  It's probably more.
[00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:35.184]  Hell, I'd imagine of the 68 million that watched it on Twitter, it's probably 80 million right
[00:09:35.184 --> 00:09:36.184]  now.
[00:09:36.184 --> 00:09:39.664]  Again, maybe the crew can pull up the actual Twitter account of Tucker Carlson and see
[00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:40.664]  what it is.
[00:09:40.824 --> 00:09:44.624]  68 million two hours ago, I bet it's 80 million now.
[00:09:44.624 --> 00:09:50.184]  Again, by tonight, I would guess it'll be 100 million, the first show.
[00:09:50.184 --> 00:09:52.544]  What says 70?
[00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:54.384]  My eyes aren't that good, guys.
[00:09:54.384 --> 00:09:57.144]  So in my ear, tell me, does that say 79 million?
[00:09:57.144 --> 00:10:07.304]  That's 75 million, 75 million impressions, tens of millions of views, bare minimum.
[00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:10.384]  That is a bellwether of the death of the corporate media.
[00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:11.384]  Not just that they're dead.
[00:10:11.384 --> 00:10:15.024]  They've been dead and hated a long time, but that the zombies are figuring out that their
[00:10:15.024 --> 00:10:19.223]  attempts to censor us doesn't prop them up.
[00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:23.904]  When the ADL and the Democratic Party and the military industrial complex called Tucker
[00:10:23.904 --> 00:10:29.664]  Carlson all these names and boycotted him and get him fired, it didn't destroy Tucker
[00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:30.664]  Carlson.
[00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:37.424]  It made Tucker Carlson bigger because things are decentralized now.
[00:10:37.424 --> 00:10:42.984]  Things are massively decentralized now and anywhere a popular voice goes, whether it's
[00:10:42.984 --> 00:10:49.024]  Rumble or Twitter or their own platform like Band.Video and Infowars.com, it's going to
[00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:52.824]  be popular because we the people are watching it and promoting it.
[00:10:52.824 --> 00:10:57.944]  So this is a true information war and the globalists are getting more and more desperate.
[00:10:57.944 --> 00:11:01.944]  That's why they're going to go to lawfare and violence.
[00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:05.184]  And believe me, Tucker knows that he needs to watch his back.
[00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:08.824]  I will just leave it at that for you.
[00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:11.624]  So here's what's going to happen today.
[00:11:11.624 --> 00:11:17.864]  We have the destruction of this dam in Ukraine and we have both sides pointing fingers at
[00:11:17.864 --> 00:11:20.223]  each other who did it.
[00:11:20.223 --> 00:11:23.184]  I believe the evidence points towards Ukraine doing it.
[00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:31.024]  I do not believe we can definitively say who destroyed the dam at this point.
[00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:36.424]  But what we do know is it supplies the water to the largest nuclear power plant complex
[00:11:36.424 --> 00:11:39.664]  in Europe.
[00:11:39.664 --> 00:11:42.504]  And it's a very serious situation.
[00:11:42.504 --> 00:11:47.184]  I'm going to break down why the evidence points towards Ukraine, but regardless, the different
[00:11:47.184 --> 00:11:51.584]  angles of this and why it's so important.
[00:11:51.584 --> 00:11:56.944]  Coming up, actually, next segment, then I'm going to also address what Tucker Carlson covered
[00:11:56.944 --> 00:11:58.284]  last night.
[00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:03.704]  And that is this UFO story with this quote, high level intelligence operative coming out
[00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:11.544]  and saying he's seen documents that there are alien bodies and alien craft in a secret
[00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:12.544]  government project.
[00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:19.024]  And even though he has the highest level security clearance, he wasn't allowed to see it.
[00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:22.264]  Now he went on to say, and they went on to say, we're going to air the newscast, it's
[00:12:22.264 --> 00:12:23.264]  been out for days.
[00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:24.264]  That.
[00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:25.264]  That.
[00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:28.844]  He.
[00:12:28.406 --> 00:12:38.406]  Is the first intelligence agent of this stature to come out and say this, that's not true.
[00:12:38.406 --> 00:12:44.045]  Colonel Corso was worked over the Roswell situation where they started this whole story
[00:12:44.045 --> 00:12:54.646]  in the late 1940s and he wrote a book 30 years ago, 30 years ago about Roswell and this same
[00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:55.965]  story you're hearing now.
[00:12:55.965 --> 00:13:02.945]  So this is a authorized official story that the deep state has been putting out for decades
[00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:07.006]  and decades and decades and decades.
[00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:11.286]  Also my grandmother, my grandmother never told me the story.
[00:13:11.286 --> 00:13:13.286]  He was dead by the time she told me.
[00:13:13.286 --> 00:13:16.526]  My grandmother lived in Roswell, that's confirmed.
[00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:19.366]  My uncle was actually born there, Steve there.
[00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:24.205]  He worked for an oil company and he worked the petroleum building in the late 1940s
[00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:29.846]  there in Roswell right after World War II when the UFO crashed.
[00:13:29.846 --> 00:13:37.045]  And my grandmother actually saw the army bringing the UFO through the middle of town on the
[00:13:37.045 --> 00:13:39.646]  back of an 18-wheeler with a tarp over it.
[00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:43.685]  Now I'll assure you folks that they don't do that unless they want people to look at
[00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:44.685]  it.
[00:13:44.685 --> 00:13:50.846]  And that's just anecdotal, but that's directly from my grandmother who, you know, saw the,
[00:13:50.846 --> 00:13:54.006]  I've seen the photos, the 18-wheeler and the troops and then the town.
[00:13:54.006 --> 00:14:01.646]  How do you do a photo op with, it's just balloon debris, but wink, wink, it's a flying saucer.
[00:14:01.646 --> 00:14:04.286]  So this is a big topic.
[00:14:04.286 --> 00:14:07.126]  This is a big, big, big issue.
[00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:12.286]  I covered some with Steven Crowder today, but in the second hour, I'm going to allot
[00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:16.286]  a lot of time to aliens and what I believe is going on and the best thinking on this
[00:14:16.286 --> 00:14:23.486]  and the CLEAR project to convince us that there's an imminent alien invasion.
[00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:24.205]  I want to be cleared.
[00:14:25.087 --> 00:14:32.087]  I'm not saying that there aren't aliens or other creatures in the universe.
[00:14:32.087 --> 00:14:33.087]  In fact, I know there is.
[00:14:33.087 --> 00:14:35.087]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:37.087]  From so many sources, not just the Bible.
[00:14:37.087 --> 00:14:43.087]  But that's the stuff that the mainline Christian church tries to shy away from when it's all right there in the Bible.
[00:14:43.087 --> 00:14:47.087]  One man's aliens, another man's fallen angel, demon.
[00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:53.087]  But there's a lot of important facets to this, and I can tell you that none of the globalists are atheists.
[00:14:53.087 --> 00:14:56.087]  They all believe in the Prometheus type idea.
[00:14:56.087 --> 00:15:00.087]  And what you basically see in the movie Prometheus is their atom story.
[00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:03.087]  And they're telling you where they think we came from and what went on.
[00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:08.087]  So to understand their psychology, it's important to understand all that.
[00:15:08.087 --> 00:15:10.087]  So that's coming up today.
[00:15:10.087 --> 00:15:15.087]  And we've just got so much more that we're going to be getting to.
[00:15:15.087 --> 00:15:29.087]  We have some spectacular clips of Kirby, the defense spokesperson, literally blaming the Russians for the dam attack.
[00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:32.087]  And then he's questioned and says, well, I don't know they attacked it.
[00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:35.087]  So it's just next level hamfisted propaganda.
[00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:38.087]  I mean, I'll give you he's got fancy suits.
[00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:40.087]  The guy knows how to wear a nice suit, got a nice tailor.
[00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:43.087]  But other than that, I mean, this guy is a lightweight.
[00:15:43.087 --> 00:15:44.087]  And these people are mailing it in.
[00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:46.087]  The question is, why are they mailing it in?
[00:15:46.087 --> 00:15:48.087]  All the billionaires are all digging bunkers.
[00:15:48.087 --> 00:15:49.087]  That's a bigger question.
[00:15:49.087 --> 00:15:51.087]  We'll ask a couple of listeners today.
[00:15:51.087 --> 00:15:53.087]  On the other side, Infowars.com.
[00:15:53.087 --> 00:15:54.087]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:57.087]  I want to welcome all the Steven Crowder viewers that are joining the broadcast.
[00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:01.087]  Sold out for more than a year.
[00:16:01.087 --> 00:16:09.087]  We now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste full of essential oils.
[00:16:09.087 --> 00:16:12.087]  Back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:18.087]  Another great product sold out for almost a year is our activated charcoal essential oil toothpaste as well.
[00:16:18.087 --> 00:16:20.087]  These are both incredible for your gums.
[00:16:20.087 --> 00:16:21.087]  Polish your teeth.
[00:16:21.087 --> 00:16:23.087]  Amazing to counter gingivitis.
[00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:25.087]  And they fund the Infowars.
[00:16:25.087 --> 00:16:27.087]  There are no fillers in these products.

[00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:03.087]  Joined by the one and only Greg Reese of the Reese Report.
[00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:07.087]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.

[00:17:16.087 --> 00:17:17.087]  Greg, what do you got there?
[00:17:17.087 --> 00:17:22.087]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter.
[00:17:22.087 --> 00:17:26.087]  And get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:31.087]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:33.087]  Absolutely.
[00:17:33.087 --> 00:17:38.087]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:41.087]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:43.087]  The real NPR of the base, right?
[00:17:43.087 --> 00:17:46.087]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[00:17:46.087 --> 00:17:47.087]  Take out your phone.

[00:17:48.087 --> 00:17:50.087]  It will take you directly to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:51.087]  Buy something.
[00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:52.087]  Support the Infowar.
[00:17:52.087 --> 00:17:57.087]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[00:17:57.087 --> 00:17:58.087]  Do it today.
[00:17:58.087 --> 00:17:59.087]  Do it now.
[00:17:59.087 --> 00:18:00.087]  Support the Infowar.
[00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:02.087]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:18:02.087 --> 00:18:05.087]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:18:05.087 --> 00:18:07.087]  It will change your life.
[00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:16.087]  The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:18:16.087 --> 00:18:21.087]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:18:21.087 --> 00:18:26.087]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:18:26.087 --> 00:18:31.087]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:18:31.087 --> 00:18:38.087]  And Infowarstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:18:38.087 --> 00:18:41.087]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:45.087]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[00:18:45.087 --> 00:18:47.087]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:18:47.087 --> 00:18:49.087]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.087]  You and your family need it.
[00:18:51.087 --> 00:18:53.087]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:18:53.087 --> 00:18:57.087]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarstore.com.
[00:18:57.087 --> 00:18:58.087]  Take action now.
[00:18:58.087 --> 00:19:00.087]  But regardless, research is info.
[00:19:00.087 --> 00:19:07.087]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:19:07.087 --> 00:19:09.087]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:19:09.087 --> 00:19:10.087]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:19:10.087 --> 00:19:13.087]  We learned today they wouldn't have it so we've made our own.
[00:19:13.087 --> 00:19:18.087]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:19:18.087 --> 00:19:20.087]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:19:20.087 --> 00:19:22.087]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:19:22.087 --> 00:19:26.087]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[00:19:26.087 --> 00:19:29.087]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[00:19:29.087 --> 00:19:30.087]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:34.087]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:36.087]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:37.087]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:19:37.087 --> 00:19:39.087]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[00:19:39.087 --> 00:19:40.087]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:19:40.087 --> 00:19:41.087]  Alex Jones for president.
[00:19:41.087 --> 00:19:42.087]  2024.
[00:19:42.087 --> 00:19:44.087]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:19:44.087 --> 00:19:46.087]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:58.087]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarstore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:19:59.087 --> 00:20:05.087]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.087 --> 00:20:07.087]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:36.719]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:41.919]  And we are live coming to you from deep in the heart of the free state of Texas, somewhat
[00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:44.520]  free for now.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.560]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and let's just start plowing straight into this.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:56.480]  There's so many angles to the Tucker Carlson phenomenon and his recent firing from Fox
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.439]  News.
[00:20:58.439 --> 00:21:02.360]  And knowing how the Nielsen ratings work, knowing how cable ratings work, I always
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:09.199]  knew that Tucker Carlson wasn't just number one on cable news with 5 million viewers
[00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:10.439]  a night or so.
[00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:13.399]  It was much bigger than what they were claiming.
[00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:16.560]  And I saw them artificially suppressing him on YouTube like they do Steven Crowder and
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.560]  so many other patriots.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.360]  They're great and reach huge audiences like they've done to us in the past.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.399]  We were still on YouTube.
[00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:27.639]  And as soon as he did a few videos after his firing, they got 20 million, 50 million, 80
[00:21:27.639 --> 00:21:28.639]  million views.
[00:21:28.879 --> 00:21:32.159]  I knew when he did his first show, he would get 100 million views or more.
[00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:39.159]  Now, remember, they say he had 5 million a night at Fox on his better nights, normally
[00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:40.320]  three and a half million.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.840]  But then magically, he goes to Twitter and he'll have 100 million views, meaning they
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.959]  at least saw the video, clicked it, didn't watch the whole thing.
[00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:57.760]  But let's say he gets half that, 50 million people watch his 10-minute monologue.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.360]  On Twitter itself, then it gets picked up and magnified everywhere else, gets played
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.040]  on national news.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.919]  People are going to see excerpts of this hundreds of millions of times more, kind of like our
[00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:14.879]  Kanye West interview on InfoWars, got about 10 million views that day and about 30 million
[00:22:14.879 --> 00:22:15.879]  the next day.
[00:22:15.879 --> 00:22:17.820]  We could see who came in and watched it and what they did.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.120]  But it was on every channel in the world, everywhere, clips of it everywhere, 10 million
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.320]  views here, 5 million views here, 3 million views there.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.040]  I mean, there's hundreds of millions of views.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.080]  You really can't calculate it unless you spent days trying to find all the links and
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]  add it together.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.000]  AI, I guess, could do it.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.639]  So what's the takeaway here?
[00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:42.000]  Not just the content of his first show, we're going to unpack that here in a moment.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.040]  But what does this mean that Rupert Murdoch has this company that makes tens of millions
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.080]  of dollars a year profit, that costs billions of dollars a year to operate, and it takes
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.280]  30, 40 people to run and operate Tucker Carlson's show.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.120]  And I got a lot of Tucker Carlson news from my sources and things like that.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.480]  And I don't really bring it up here because he's a private guy and stuff I get from him
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.439]  is obviously in confidence, but then I get it from other people that probably should
[00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:11.040]  be in confidence, but I don't really talk about it.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.919]  But I knew about it weeks before it was in the news that they came into Maine and to
[00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:23.719]  his Florida studios and it was done by Fox.
[00:23:23.719 --> 00:23:28.040]  But they literally just tore it all out, tore it out of the walls, removed it all as if
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.840]  you're just right away, as if Tucker was going to like try to use that equipment or use the
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.500]  Fox systems.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.719]  So people seen his first video and they see that it looks like his external mic is not
[00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:43.679]  turned on and he's talking to the microphone on the camera.
[00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.679]  It still sounds great.
[00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:47.159]  People say, oh, the lighting's not perfect.
[00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:51.879]  It's more endearing, but I can tell you, he's not doing that to make it look a little
[00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:55.159]  low tech on purpose.
[00:23:55.159 --> 00:23:58.639]  I know the inside baseball that he's got like two people he's working with now and he is
[00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:04.399]  totally on his own and it's having to discover how to do all this, something we've been doing
[00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:05.399]  on our own.
[00:24:05.399 --> 00:24:09.040]  I've been on my own for 25 years.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.760]  I got fired off radio, fired out of syndication when I wouldn't bow, did it all myself.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.280]  And I'm not saying, oh, I'm so smart.
[00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:21.080]  No, that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.480]  Jim Crow was not good for black people.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]  It was mean.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]  It was racist.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480]  It was wrong.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.159]  But they did the best they ever did under it because they were being openly oppressed
[00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:32.500]  and they knew it and they unified, not saying Jim Crow was good, but being openly oppressed
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.500]  made them strong.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:39.360]  It's like, you know, the great novel written by Millis that was turning the screenplay
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.879]  for Conan the Barbarian and Conan gets caught.
[00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:44.159]  He gets enslaved.
[00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:48.960]  He gets sent for 15 years in a slave camp and he survives and he's a lot tougher.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.719]  It's not good that his parents got murdered.
[00:24:50.719 --> 00:24:55.360]  It's not good that he was a slave, but he's tougher because he survived it.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.919]  The nanny state makes us weak.
[00:24:56.919 --> 00:25:01.159]  The nanny state makes us think we're pathetic and we can't be strong and never teaches us
[00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:05.840]  to flex our cultural muscles, our economic muscles, our spiritual muscles, our physical
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.760]  muscles and we become cultural zombies or magnified couch potatoes.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.159]  So to me, the biggest takeaway with the Tucker Carlson situation is the massive Streisand
[00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:24.960]  effect because I can tell you, we were reaching 25, 30 million people a day when they deplatformed
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.040]  us five years ago.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.600]  And so we had reached the pinnacle of success, bigger than Rogan, bigger than Carlson ever
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600]  was.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600]  And I'm not trying to measure things.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.960]  It's just important to understand what was culturally happening.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.040]  So they had to come in and do that.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.719]  And at first it worked and crushed us down to about 5 million people a day instead of
[00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:46.719]  25, 30 million.
[00:25:46.719 --> 00:25:52.239]  I mean, some days 50 million, but on average about 25 million, that's bigger than Limbaugh.
[00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:53.239]  What a phenomenon.
[00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:55.679]  But we had our own infrastructure, our own servers, our own backup.
[00:25:55.679 --> 00:26:00.520]  We survived and then got the OG status and kind of the folk hero status.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.320]  And I'm just not saying that to brag, I'm saying is that's really what happened now,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.320]  a folk hero status.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.080]  So they didn't learn from that and they took somebody even smarter in ways, more polished,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.919]  better looking, I would say, unless I lose 50 pounds and I'm better looking.
[00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:17.760]  But Tucker Carlson is a good looking guy and very articulate, very genuine, totally real.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.080]  What you see on TV, that's him, goofiness and all of it.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.280]  And it's all endearing and extremely smart, but also humble.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.280]  And he's been naive in the past.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.800]  He's admitted he used to buy the system.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.760]  He believed all the BS and that was a rude awakening for him.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.639]  And so they do everything they can to shut him down.
[00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:45.719]  And then his first show has 75 million views right now, 75 million.
[00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:51.320]  By tonight, I predict it will be 100 million conservatively, okay?
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.840]  And that's huge.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.320]  Now by tomorrow, he'll have 120 million views.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:04.719]  I believe it'll settle out at 190 million views by next Wednesday.
[00:27:04.719 --> 00:27:09.040]  Next Wednesday, let's check and see if it's 190 million views.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.280]  We'll see if my guesstimations are right.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.560]  And so my guesstimations are pretty good because I had looked at the counter about
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.520]  an hour and it was at 60 million.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.000]  So I was one with Crowder and I said, yeah, it's at 60, but it's 68 million right now.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.439]  Just a couple hours ago, they checked, they went, yeah, it's 67 and a half million.
[00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:28.439]  Yeah, you almost got it.
[00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:32.040]  So I'm pretty good at debt reckoning because I just can see the algorithm in my own brain
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]  of how this stuff works.
[00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:37.639]  He'll have 190 million views in this first episode by next Wednesday.
[00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:40.560]  By tonight, it'll be 100 million, I would guess.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.840]  So let's look and see.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.879]  So what does that say to them?
[00:27:44.879 --> 00:27:49.320]  Okay, you take his studio, you call him a racist, you leak a bunch of stuff on him that's
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.320]  endearing.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:59.360]  And then he gets 75 million views guaranteed, it's going to be 100 million, 200 million probably.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.399]  And what does that say about you?
[00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:07.800]  It says that if you were in the desert dying of thirst, you came across an oasis that had
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.600]  a CNN sign on the top of it, you wouldn't drink the water thinking it was poison.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.320]  Even though you're going to die without the water, you hate CNN so much, you can't make
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]  us drink it.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.760]  It's in the hotels, it's in the bars, it's in the airports, they pay to try to make you
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]  watch it.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.280]  And the supposed savior of it after a year just was fired today.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.280]  It's dead.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]  It's over.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280]  But they don't ever want to admit they've been defeated.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.840]  So they just keep reanimating the corpse.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.960]  Brian Stelter is now the moderator at the WEF with other, you know, creepy looking, creepy
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:42.080]  acting, creepy, anti-free speech garbage like Yuval Noah Harari says he's going to live forever.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.759]  He's going to be a god and all the rest of us are nothing.
[00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:47.679]  That's called being delusional, crazy person, maniac.
[00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:48.679]  You're not a god.
[00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:52.520]  You're a sack of filth, sack of maggot, slob.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.080]  So they're done.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080]  They're a joke.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.759]  We'll come back and get into the content on the other side.
[00:28:58.759 --> 00:28:59.759]  Stay with us.
[00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:00.759]  Bye, everybody.
[00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:01.759]  Bye.
[00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:02.759]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:03.759]  And I hope you enjoyed the show.
[00:33:03.759 --> 00:33:04.759]  We'll see you next time.
[00:33:04.759 --> 00:33:05.759]  Have a great week.
[00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:06.759]  Bye.
[00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:07.759]  Bye.
[00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:08.759]  Bye.
[00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:09.759]  Bye.
[00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:10.759]  Bye.
[00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:11.759]  Bye.
[00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:12.759]  Bye.
[00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:13.759]  Bye.
[00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:14.759]  Bye.
[00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.759]  Bye.
[00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:16.759]  Bye.
[00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:17.759]  Bye.
[00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:18.759]  Bye.
[00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:19.759]  Bye.
[00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:20.759]  Bye.
[00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:21.759]  Bye.
[00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:22.759]  Bye.
[00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.759]  Bye.
[00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:24.759]  Bye.
[00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:25.759]  Bye.
[00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:26.759]  Bye.
[00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:27.759]  Bye.
[00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:38.370]  Okay, let's continue with Tucker Carlson being kind of our keyhole through which we
[00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:43.970]  look into the wider world, kind of the Rosetta Stone, the skeleton key.
[00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:50.610]  So the power structure, the ADL declares massive victory, AOC declares victory, the Democratic
[00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:55.410]  Party declares victory, Biden's stumbling around, the National Press Dinner declares
[00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.810]  victory and laughs about it and says, Tucker Carlson's gone.
[00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.490]  He's gone.
[00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.410]  That's like the sun goes down at night and then you're like, it's gone forever.
[00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.410]  We beat the sun.
[00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.730]  I mean, I'm not comparing him to the sun, but like truth, people's hunger for reality.
[00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.290]  And then it comes back up in the morning.
[00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.290]  He never went away.
[00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.850]  It was just not in your view.
[00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:19.530]  And so, oh yeah, he's really gone from 5 million viewers to 100 million.
[00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.570]  Yeah, that's losing in my book.
[00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:28.530]  Man, you really licked him, ADL, you, you, wow, AOC, you really are a rocket scientist.
[00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.610]  You really kicked their ass.
[00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:35.290]  Oh, YouTube, you censored Steven Crowder and now he gets four or five million views a day
[00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.290]  on Rumble.
[00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.290]  And it's exploding everywhere.
[00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.290]  It's just.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.500]  They're delusional.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:49.500]  And their smugness is not going to protect them from the fact that it's over for them.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.500]  Now, they're not really smug. They know they've lost.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.500]  That's why they're trying to poison us, dumb us down, and distract us with all this race garbage,
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.500]  is because they know they're going to end up going to prison.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.500]  The FBI's destroyed itself. The Justice Department's destroyed itself.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500]  They're destroying our military.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.500]  They're destroying all the institutions in the hope that while they use them as a rearguard action,
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:16.500]  once society collapses, we'll be so distracted with the turmoil that they won't be brought to justice.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500]  But that's not happening.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.500]  They're getting the blame. BlackRock, the U.N., the World Economic Forum.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.500]  I've harped on this thousands of times the last two decades.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.500]  But when the new world order collapses, they want to blame it on freedom.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.500]  They want to blame it on capitalism and have us accept their new corporate, fascist, communist,
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.500]  utopia, cashless society.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.500]  But we're not. We know it's them. We know they're the ones literally engineering this.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.500]  We're not perfect either. We certainly let them do it.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.500]  We certainly are part of the problem. We're trying to get better.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:52.500]  But they love it, and they embrace destruction to act like they're in control of it.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.500]  But they're pretending.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.500]  It'd be like pretending that a bus coming down the road at 70 miles an hour is your friend,
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500]  and if you just jump out in front of it, it's going to stop.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.500]  No, it's going to run you over.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.500]  So they've pretended, just because they hijacked the government and hijacked the banks
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:15.500]  and have given themselves unlimited money, that all the rules of the universe won't come back to roost on them,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.500]  and that all their bunkers and all their security teams will not protect them from the destruction they create.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.500]  You think I want to die battling these scum?
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.500]  I just pick up dog manure in the yard and put it in the trash can.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.500]  I don't go out and, like, smash it and stab it.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.500]  I don't have an emotion towards it.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.500]  Now, if we have to have physical conflict, if they keep attacking us, we have to defend ourselves,
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.500]  then, you know, it's like dispatching cockroaches.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:47.500]  But I'd really rather skip all the murder and death and carnage part, but I get it.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.500]  You guys aren't going to give up.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.500]  You've made that abundantly clear.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.500]  We have to be smart about this.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.500]  Don't interrupt your enemy while they're destroying themselves, Napoleon once said,
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.500]  unless they're destroying you in the process.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500]  So that's really the quagmire we're in.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.500]  So let's move now on to Tucker Carlson again.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.500]  Tucker comes out, and I'm not critical of Tucker.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500]  I love him.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.500]  I agree with him about 99 percent.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.500]  But strangely enough, his first TV show.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:25.420]  that he put out, episode one from his cabin in Maine, is very thought-provoking and very powerful and totally true.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:30.420]  He talks about the evil of Lindsey Graham and the dead eyes of Zelensky.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.420]  I mean, it's poetry. Tucker's an incredible writer.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.420]  But then he says it's clear the Ukrainians blew up the dam.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.420]  And I think he's right. I think they did.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.420]  I mean, the evidence weighs that way, but we don't know that.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.420]  We don't know that yet.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.420]  Now, we know they blew up Nord Stream, because they said they'd do it,
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.420]  and now the evidence has come out in the whistleblowers and Cy Hirsch.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.420]  But I'm going to walk through what the dam means and why it is important for whatever facets in a moment.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:01.420]  And then he goes on, because, you know, Tucker's saying, hey, the government's covering up UFOs,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.420]  and the government's covering up UAVs, and this is all going on.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.420]  And then a big whistleblower, high-level intelligence comes out and says, yeah,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.420]  he's seen the documents, they got bodies, they got crap.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.420]  And from a position of, hey, they've been suppressing this, Tucker's like, well, looks like it's true.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.420]  Aliens are here.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.420]  Except I've been studying this for 30-plus years,
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.420]  and I've even got eyewitnesses in my family that have seen some things that are very telling
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.420]  that I'm going to talk about more here today on that front.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:37.420]  So it's strange that his first truly independent show, though he ran the other show as well.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.420]  That's why he got fired. He was in charge of it.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.420]  Someone on the dam, though I think he's right in the end.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.420]  And then on the UFOs, I'm going to bring it next hour.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.420]  I'm going to bring it.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.420]  I mean, I'm going to tell you from the best knowledge of ancient civilization, the Bible,
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.420]  my own research, studying the globalists in the full, exactly what's going on
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.420]  and where the aliens are, where they're coming from, what their plan is, and how to stop them.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.420]  I'm not going to talk about are there alien bodies or are there alien spacecraft.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:11.420]  You think things that can come across trillions of miles are going to crash in tin cans?
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.420]  Think so, huh? No. No, sir.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.420]  Oh, they're here, though. I made a mistake.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:24.420]  So we're going to be getting into that here in the next hour.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:32.420]  But let's start out with what's really happening with this dam with John Kirby from the Pentagon
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.420]  when he's not moonlighting over at the White House as his deputy press secretary,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:42.420]  cites reports that Russians blew up the dam, but adds that final determination has not been made.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.420]  Here it is.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:50.420]  I know there's been a lot of interest in the destruction of the Nova Kharkovka Dam in Ukraine.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.420]  And I wanted to just take a minute to address it.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:57.420]  As you might expect, we've been closely monitoring the impacts of that destruction,
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:01.420]  which has triggered massive flooding in Ukraine and resulted in the evacuation
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.420]  of at the very least thousands of Ukrainians.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.420]  We know there are casualties, including likely many deaths,
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.420]  though these are early reports and we cannot quantify them right now.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.420]  We've seen the reports that Russia was responsible for the explosion at the dam,
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:24.420]  which I would remind you took over illegally last year and have been occupying since then.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.420]  We're doing the best we can to assess those reports,
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.420]  and we are working with the Ukrainians to gather more information.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.420]  We cannot say conclusively what happened at this point.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.420]  We will certainly share more information when we can.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:42.420]  What is clear and what we absolutely can say is that the damage to the Ukrainian people
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.420]  and to the region will be significant.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:51.420]  This dam, which was built in 1956 as part of the Kharkovka hydroelectric power plant,
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.420]  sits astride Ukraine's Dnipro River.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:58.420]  It's about 30 yards high and about 100 yards or so wide,
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:03.420]  and the reservoir it protects holds about as much water as the Great Salt Lake in Utah.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.420]  So that's a lot of water.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.420]  That water helps supply southern Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula,
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.420]  as well as the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.420]  I would add we were relieved to see the statement today by the director of the IAEA
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.420]  asserting that there was no immediate risk to the safety of that plant.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:26.420]  As I mentioned, the dam also helps power the Kharkovka hydroelectric power plant.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.420]  In addition to loss of lives and livelihoods,
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.420]  its destruction could very well have a devastating impact on Ukraine.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.420]  That's enough of this crap.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.420]  So the Russians are going to blow up their own dam that supplies them with electricity
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.420]  and supplies water to the nuclear power plant, one of the biggest in the world,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:47.420]  that they're in control of, and it supplies water to Crimea they've had for 250 years.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.420]  Okay.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.420]  And this is the same Ukrainian government that tried to blow up the bridge that goes to Crimea,
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.420]  a civilian target, and the same group that obviously is involved with NATO in the U.S.,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.420]  ones that run our country, not the U.S., people that hijack our country,
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.420]  blew up the Nord Stream pipeline the very day the new European pipeline turned on.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.420]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.420]  With Victoria Nuland and Biden saying, we're going to blow it up if the Russians invade.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.420]  Okay, I mean, give me a break.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.420]  Yeah, they blew it up.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.420]  Cyhers has the witnesses.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.420]  They know where they trained the divers in a Navy facility, all of it, in Panama.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.420]  That happened.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:28.420]  So it all leans towards NATO, but the reason it really leans towards NATO is two months ago
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:34.420]  there was a report that Ukrainians fired two missiles in the dam.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.420]  Then they said, oh, it was the Russians.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:42.420]  Then later the Ukrainian general bragged, yeah, we wanted to show that we can take the dam out.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.420]  So they attacked the dam months ago, and the dam has been overflowing and having problems since then.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:52.420]  So Ukraine admits they attacked it two months ago, but now the Russians attacked it.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.420]  But it gets more ridiculous.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.420]  I've looked at the topography.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.420]  I've looked at the maps.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.420]  They admit this.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:06.420]  The main Russian forces were in that valley up to that hill ridge, holding back and defeated
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.420]  the main Ukrainian offensive that's been going on at least a month.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.420]  They never officially admit it's been done because they don't want to admit the Russians are holding it.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:20.420]  You need a force three times larger, according to infantry and tank battle doctrine going back to World War II,
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.420]  and it's held true, to break through defensive lines and then hold them.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.420]  You need a force twice as strong to take a position of armor and artillery,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:34.420]  and then you need a reserve force to come through after that force has gone through and then is regrouping.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.420]  So you've got to have the shock troops that come in, break through,
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.420]  and then you've got the regular troops that come in, and then flank the enemy,
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.420]  and then take out more of its line.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.420]  That's a simple boil down.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:49.420]  Okay, so with a smaller force than the Russians, but with more high-tech weapons,
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.420]  they tried to break through the last month.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.420]  They failed everywhere, but had huge casualties.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.420]  That's now confirmed on the Ukrainian side and the Russian side, but much bigger on the Ukrainian side.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.420]  It's just harder to have an offense than a defense, okay?
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:08.420]  And so now you've got the Russians all strung out in that valley up to that ridge where the main battle,
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.420]  and now that's all been flooded, and 90% of the flooding is on the Russian side.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.420]  That just cut off all that Russian armor and all those Russian tanks and artillery
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.420]  from roads delivering them weapons.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.420]  Now it's got to be helicoptered in.
[00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.030]  And of course, the Ukrainians are in the area, they can shoot those helicopters down.
[00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.030]  Now it's got to be airlifted in.
[00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:32.030]  So the Ukrainians just cut off the Russian forces, large parts of it,
[00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.030]  and strategically have the reason to do it.
[00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:40.030]  So they have attacked it before, they've blown up civilian infrastructure before,
[00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:47.030]  they're losing in their offensive, and this is a desperate act to cut the Russians off.
[00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:53.030]  And anybody with half a brain can simply look at this and know what's going on.
[00:44:53.030 --> 00:45:00.030]  So minutes later, John the liar Kirby, after saying we have intel,
[00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:04.030]  you know, somebody told somebody that the Russians might have done it.
[00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.030]  And again, they might have done it.
[00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.030]  They don't have the motive.
[00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.030]  Look, you can blow something up and blame it on your enemies for political reasons,
[00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.030]  like the Feds bombed a daycare center in Oklahoma City
[00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.030]  to make sure they found the one federal center that had a daycare.
[00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.030]  Oh, kids got killed.
[00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:19.030]  I mean, that's waving the bloody shirt.
[00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.030]  That's a false flag.
[00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.030]  But why would you cut off your own military when they're winning?
[00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.030]  No, they don't have the motive.
[00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:26.030]  It's the Ukrainians.
[00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.030]  But I can't say I know it's the Ukrainians.
[00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.030]  We just know it's the Ukrainians.
[00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.030]  And it might help them break through what's left because the Russians are cut off
[00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:42.030]  in their supply lines because it takes a lot of trucks and a lot of supplies
[00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:48.030]  to have major army groups up there in a major battle against NATO.
[00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.030]  It takes a lot of supply lines.
[00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:53.030]  And it will be hard with helicopters and airlifts to now get the weapons in
[00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.030]  to have a lot of the Russian equipment now bogged down.
[00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.030]  And we're talking 20 feet of water in many areas.
[00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:04.030]  So it's an evil move, a smart move by the scorched-earth Ukrainians.
[00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:10.030]  And they, though, are so dishonest, they won't admit they've done this.
[00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.030]  They'll just say Putin did it because they know the average Westerner
[00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:18.030]  can't find their ass with both hands and don't know military strategy
[00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.030]  and will actually believe that Vladimir Putin just flooded his own troops
[00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.030]  during an enemy offensive.
[00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:31.030]  So here he is when he's being confronted by a reporter,
[00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:34.030]  and he's actually saying, well, we don't have any proof.
[00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.030]  Here it is.
[00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:40.030]  Does it seem believable to you that Russia would destroy a dam
[00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:46.030]  and flood ethnic Russian villages and cut off the water supply to Crimea?
[00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.030]  I mean, that doesn't seem logical.
[00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:53.030]  It seems about as logical as blowing up one's own pipeline, doesn't it?
[00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.030]  We've come to no conclusions on this.
[00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:56.030]  We're working with the Ukrainians.
[00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:58.030]  We'll try to get as much information as we can.
[00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:04.030]  We've come to no conclusions on this,
[00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.030]  but we're working with the Ukrainians to find out what did happen.
[00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:10.030]  Okay, literally minutes earlier, he said the Russians did it.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:17.440]  And we've got people, all the famous neocons running around like chickens with their heads
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:23.080]  cut off, crystal all of them, saying that the Russians did it.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:28.320]  Remember when the Ukrainians, five months ago, launched two missiles into Poland, but
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.080]  thank God the Poles were able to shoot both of them down so they didn't detonate properly
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.080]  or you wouldn't have any pieces?
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.720]  And the tail fins were Ukrainian and they went, okay, it was us.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.680]  But Zelensky continued to say it was the Russians, trying to draw NATO into the war, who's already
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.560]  in the war, but officially in the war.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.880]  This is crazy town.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.480]  And you can take one look at Zelensky, the word is he's a raging cocaine addict and he
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.120]  is degenerating very, very quickly.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.040]  This is extremely dangerous.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.920]  So here's part of Tucker Carlson's monologue.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.960]  His first show is 10 minutes long, I think that's great.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:07.880]  Soon he'll be introducing documentaries and guests and studios, that's all being rebuilt
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.440]  right now. So look, look, look for that.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:19.400]  But man, I tell you, he's defeated 80 million views so far and probably 150, 190, 200
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:25.200]  million. I mean, man, the ADL whooped his butt, man.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.320]  My goodness, that just absolutely kicked his ass.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.720]  The New World Order is winning, folks.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.840]  They're really great. No, they're winning at killing old people and giving people poison
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.800]  shots. You know, just today I was talking to some of the crew here at Steven Crowder's
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:47.440]  operation, and I was talking to a young lady whose boyfriend's dad is a marathon runner
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.680]  and like 60 years old. And during the whole lockdown and stuff, he wanted to go visit
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:58.120]  family in California, his other son, and he took the Pfizer shot and died to sleep the
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.880]  next day with a blood clot in his brain.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.480]  And then I was talking to just some folks last night at a restaurant I was talking to,
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.880]  a restaurant I was at, and I had multiple groups come over and tell me about family
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.960]  members they had that died of blood clots after they took the shots.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.080]  It was just like, I'm just inundated with the death here.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.320]  Of course, we have the actual statistics from the insurance companies that it's the biggest
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.120]  death increase in the last hundred years, bigger than World War I.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.680]  There's a 46% overall death increase in the nations that took the shot.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.760]  World War I was about a 9% increase in death.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.160]  World War II was about a 6% increase.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:39.120]  I'm going to say that again, we're losing more people in Western countries from these
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.480]  shots than we lost in major wars.
[00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:46.490]  But the media acts like it's no big deal, so we just go on with it.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.620]  Totally evil, totally satanic.
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.620]  So here is part of Tucker Carlson's monologue.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:50:00.620]  Then we'll go into the next hour and get into his monologue, the second part on UFOs.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.620]  And I'm going to bring it.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.620]  I'm going to lay out the best thinking on what's really going on in the next hour.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.620]  Extremely important, because they've got a fake UFO invasion up their sleeve.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.620]  But here's Tucker last night.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.620]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:19.620]  This morning, it looks like somebody blew up the Kokovka Dam in southern Ukraine.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:25.620]  The rushing wall of water wiped out entire villages, destroyed a critical hydropower plant,
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:31.620]  and as of tonight, puts the largest nuclear reactor in Europe in danger of melting down.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.620]  So if this was intentional, it was not a military tactic.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.620]  It was an act of terrorism.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.620]  The question is, who did it?
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.620]  Kokovka Dam was effectively Russian.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.620]  It was built by the Russian government.
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.620]  It currently sits in Russian-controlled territory.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.620]  The dam's reservoir supplies water to Crimea,
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:56.620]  which has been for the last 240 years home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.620]  Blowing up the dam may be bad for Ukraine, but it hurts Russia more.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:05.620]  And for precisely that reason, the Ukrainian government has considered destroying it.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.620]  In December, The Washington Post quoted a Ukrainian general saying his men had fired
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:15.620]  American-made rockets at the dam's floodgate as a test strike.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.620]  So really, once the facts start coming in, it becomes much less of a mystery
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.620]  what might have happened to the dam.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.620]  Any fair person would conclude that the Ukrainians probably blew it up,
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.620]  just as you would assume they blew up Nord Stream, the Russian natural gas pipeline, last fall.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.620]  And in fact, the Ukrainians did do that, as we now know.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.620]  It's not like Vladimir Putin is anxious to wage war on himself.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.620]  Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Mr. and Mrs. Cable News Consumer.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.620]  Vladimir Putin is exactly that sort of man,
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.620]  the sort of man who'd shoot himself to death in order to annoy you.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.620]  We know this from the American media, which wasted no time this morning
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.620]  in accusing the Russians of sabotaging their own infrastructure.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:02.620]  Bill Kristol, the man who once told us that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9-11,
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.620]  immediately denounced Putin as a war criminal
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.620]  and even more savagely compared him to Donald Trump.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.620]  The rest of the pundit class made similar, clearly coordinated noises.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.620]  Putin did it! Putin did it!
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.620]  And their reasoning was simple.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:24.620]  Putin is evil, and evil people do evil things purely for the dark joy of being evil.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.620]  In this specific case, Putin attacked himself,
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.620]  which is the most evil thing you can do,
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.620]  and therefore perfectly in character for a man that evil.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.620]  That was their explanation.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.620]  No one who's paid to cover these things seemed to entertain even the possibility
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.620]  it could have been the Ukrainians who did it.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.620]  No chance of that.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:46.620]  Ukraine, as you may have heard, is led by a man called Zelensky.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.620]  And we can say for a dead certain fact that he was not involved.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:51.620]  He couldn't have been.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.620]  Zelensky is too decent for terrorism.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.620]  Now, you see him on television, and it's true you might form a different impression.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.620]  Sweaty and rat-like, a comedian turned oligarch,
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.620]  a persecutor of Christians, a friend of Blackrock.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.620]  But don't believe your own eyes.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.620]  Actually, Mr. Zelensky is a very good man.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.620]  The best, really.
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:17.620]  As George W. Bush once noted, he is our generation's Winston Churchill.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.620]  Of all the people in the world,
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.620]  our shifty, dead-eyed Ukrainian friend in the tracksuit
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.620]  is uniquely incapable of blowing up a dam.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.620]  He's literally a living saint, a man in whom there is no sin.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.620]  That's why Lindsey Graham is so attracted to him.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.620]  They're just two good people hanging out together and being good.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.620]  And like all good people, when they meet in person,
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.620]  they spend a lot of time talking about killing people
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.620]  and laughing like friends do.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.620]  Here's the pair last week.
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.620]  Free or die.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.620]  Free or die.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.620]  Now you are free.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.620]  Yes.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:51.620]  And we will be.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:52.620]  And the Russians are dying.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.620]  It's the best money we've ever spent.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.620]  Thank you so much.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.620]  No worries.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.620]  The Russians are dying.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.620]  It's the best money we've ever spent, Graham says.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:07.620]  A smile spreads across his thin, quivering lips as he forms the words.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.620]  He looks like a starving man contemplating a breakfast buffet.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.620]  The aroma of death has aroused Lindsey Graham.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.620]  Thanks so much, replies Zelensky.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.620]  He feels the same way.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:19.620]  See, there's nothing dark here.
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.620]  Just two middle-aged guys celebrating the killing of a population.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:25.620]  They don't seem like the kind of people who'd enjoy flooding villages
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.620]  or starting a famine.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.620]  In any case, who cares if they are?
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.620]  It's really not your business.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.620]  Your job is to support Ukraine.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.620]  Watch Nikki Haley, a Republican candidate for president,
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.620]  explain this principle on CNN.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.620]  A win for Ukraine is a win for all of us.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.620]  And for them to sit there and say that this is a territorial dispute,
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.620]  that's just not the case.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:52.620]  To say that we should stay neutral, it is in the best interest of America.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.620]  It's in the best interest of our national security for Ukraine to win.
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:57.620]  We have to see this through.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.620]  We have to finish it.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.620]  See?
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.620]  It's very easy to understand.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.620]  It is vitally important for you to support Ukraine
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.620]  because it's necessary for Ukraine to be supported by you.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.620]  Your support is mandatory until it's finished,
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.620]  whatever it is and whatever that means.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.620]  So shut up and support Ukraine or else you're in trouble.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.620]  Back when they still taught logic,
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.620]  statements like this were known as tautologies.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.620]  Something is true because it is.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:30.620]  The more you repeat it, the truer it becomes.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.620]  It's a self-reinforcing reality.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.620]  There was a time when tautologies were considered illegitimate arguments,
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:39.620]  not to mention hilariously stupid.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.620]  Only dumb people talk like that.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.620]  Now everybody in power talks like that.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.620]  Diversity is our strength.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:47.620]  Trans women are women.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.620]  Zelensky is Churchill.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.620]  It's all self-evidently true.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.620]  It doesn't need an explanation and don't ask questions.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.620]  Sound familiar?
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.620]  Of course it does.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.620]  That's the PAP.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.620]  They're serving us day after day in steaming lumpy...
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.620]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.620]  I'm going to come back and finish with this and then get into the UFO situation,
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.620]  which is a big deal.
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.620]  But before we go to break, please remember we're listener-supported.
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.620]  We're not subscriber-based.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.620]  We're supported by you buying products at InfoWarsTore.com,
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.620]  and they're excellent.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.620]  Now, I have not gotten back to Austin.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.620]  I've not come up with a new sale yet.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:21.620]  We're selling out of X3.
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.620]  It's our best seller.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.620]  We have to end the sale because at current sales rates in two weeks it will be gone.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.620]  And so I guess today is the last day.
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.620]  It might go another day after that.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.620]  But X3, triiodine, incredible for your immune system,
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.620]  your electrochemical activity, every cell in the body.
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.620]  It's essential.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.620]  Without it, without iodine, you die.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.620]  That's why they're targeting iodine, taking it out of the diet.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.620]  You need it, but they put the bad allergens in,
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.620]  the blocked iodine and the chlorine, the fluoride, the bromine.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:50.620]  You need this product.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.620]  It takes about two weeks to kick in on average, take a few drops a day.
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.620]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.620]  And it's 25% off.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.620]  It is your last chance.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:07.620]  Discover the power of activated iodine, triiodine, trunascent iodine

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:19.620]  This is a major enemy operation to keep pure iodine out of your body.
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.620]  This is a big deal.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:22.620]  You need to experience it.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.620]  You need to take action.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:26.620]  Those of you that have sat there on the fence, you need to experience this.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.620]  It supports the broadcast.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.620]  You can't lose.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.620]  But I know you won't lose when you get it.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.620]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.620]  Also, Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.620]  That sale is about to end.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.620]  It's discounted.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:42.620]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.620]  Our number two with so much critical information straight ahead.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.620]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:51.110]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:56.110]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:57:56.110 --> 00:58:00.110]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:05.110]  and now two books with Alex Jones? That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.110]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:13.110]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:18.110]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:22.110]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:26.110]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:32.110]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:34.110]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back.
[00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:39.110]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:40.110]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:52.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:57.110]  is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.110]  That is a hellish future.
[00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:02.110]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:05.110]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:08.110]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:14.110]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:16.110]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:22.110]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:26.110]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:29.110]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.110]  You'll also know that you helped keep Infowars on the air.
[00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:36.110]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:41.110]  I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfowarsStore.com and get a signed copy
[00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:46.110]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:49.110]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:57.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:16.110]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:27.110]  So, no matter what's coming out of Tucker Carlson's mouth, it is a big story that as we speak,
[01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:37.110]  he's got 77 million views of his 10-minute news video he shot from his main cabin's living room.
[01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:42.110]  And it just speaks to how the dinosaur corporate system is over. They can't silence us all.
[01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:47.110]  They could kill Tucker Carlson and me and Joe Rogan tomorrow and Stephen Crowder, God forbid.
[01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:51.110]  And there would just be people to replace us because folks know about the New World Order now.
[01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.110]  We know about the globalist plan.
[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:57.110]  And once you know about something and the plan to make us eat the bugs and cut off our energy,
[01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:58.110]  they're never going to stop us.
[01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.110]  Yeah, they may have some teenagers buying the BS, but nobody else.
[01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:05.110]  So, things are really, really moving quickly.
[01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:09.110]  In this short segment, I'm going to finish up with him on the Ukraine dam and that whole situation
[01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:14.110]  that they admit flooded the main Russian force that just defeated the Ukrainian counteroffensive.
[01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:17.110]  Why would you flood your own force?
[01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:19.110]  It was a desperate move by Ukraine.
[01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:24.110]  They're like, flooding civilians and not giving a nuclear power plant its cooling water is a war crime.
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.110]  Oh, we'll just blame the Russians like the pipeline.
[01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:31.110]  Remember the CIA came out and said they thought the Russians blew up their Nord Stream pipeline?
[01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:33.110]  I mean, give me a break, people.
[01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:38.110]  Tucker's only issue is he definitively says, no, we know NATO did it.
[01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:44.670]  No, we know they blew up Nord Stream as they said they would do it, and we have the eyewitnesses.
[01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:46.670]  And it's going to come out they did.
[01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.670]  So I'm just nitpicking on Tucker to say, you know, it's not admitted.
[01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:54.670]  I see no motive for the Russians to do this. Period.
[01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:58.670]  Okay, let's finish up with Tucker. Here it is.
[01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:05.670]  By this point, it's possible that American citizens are the least informed people in the world.
[01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:09.670]  Your average yak herder in Tajikistan knows who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:14.670]  It's obvious. Does he think some skinny dude in a dress is actually a girl?
[01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:18.670]  Come on. That idea would never occur to him.
[01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:24.670]  You've got to be lied to at full volume over a period of years in order to reach conclusions like that.
[01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:27.670]  And of course we have been. The media lie. They do.
[01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:31.670]  But mostly they just ignore the stories that matter.
[01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:35.670]  What's happened to the hundreds of billions of US dollars we've sent to Ukraine?
[01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:40.670]  No clue. Who organized those BLM riots three years ago?
[01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.670]  No one's gotten to the bottom of that.
[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:44.670]  What exactly happened on 9-11?
[01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.670]  Well, it's still classified.
[01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:48.670]  How did Jeffrey Epstein make all that money?
[01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.670]  How did he die? How about JFK?
[01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:52.670]  And so endlessly on.
[01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:59.670]  Not only are the media not interested in any of this, they are actively hostile to anybody who is.
[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.670]  In journalism, curiosity is the gravest crime.
[01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:07.670]  Yesterday, for example, a former Air Force officer who worked for years in military intelligence
[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:12.670]  came forward as a whistleblower to reveal that the US government has physical evidence
[01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:19.670]  of crashed non-human-made aircraft, as well as the bodies of the pilots who flew those aircraft.
[01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:22.670]  Back in about 15 seconds, and we're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.670]  We're going to come back and start here and play this, and then I'm going to respond.
[01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:26.670]  And it's going to take...
[01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:32.930]  Probably 30 minutes to give you my take on all this.
[01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:33.930]  And this is a...
[01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:39.730]  I believe my take on this is the best one you're going to get.
[01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:40.730]  And I really...
[01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:41.730]  I kind of want to make a documentary.
[01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.290]  I've wanted to for decades on the subject of, quote, aliens, by defining what is an
[01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.290]  alien first.
[01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:51.650]  I mean, technically, a meteorite that falls out of the night sky from the heavens and
[01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:53.650]  crashes in your backyard, that's an alien.
[01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:57.170]  It's an alien piece of metal or stone.
[01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.090]  It's not from this planet.
[01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:00.490]  Alien just means not of this world.
[01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:06.910]  Well, the truth is there's a lot of aliens, a lot of aliens on this planet right now.
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:10.730]  And I'm going to explain what that means when we come back.
[01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.530]  And we're going to talk about the supposed aliens they say are flying around in tin cans
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:20.450]  constantly and crashing and little stupid great men that run around, you know, getting
[01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:22.570]  school samples from us.
[01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:27.930]  What's really happening, what's really going on is much, much more complex and much, much
[01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:28.930]  more serious.
[01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:33.090]  Again, when you call your grandma that lives in another state, do you physically get in
[01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:34.770]  the car and drive her to go see her every time?
[01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:39.650]  No, you call her and you digitally down a line, send her your voice that's turned into
[01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:44.290]  zeros and ones, and then retransmit it down into her ear.
[01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:46.610]  That's how ET phones home.
[01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:48.090]  That's how you phone home.
[01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.930]  That's how the aliens are here.
[01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:55.370]  Transmission wise, energy wise, broadcast wise, and the science shows that all the aliens
[01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:56.370]  are here.
[01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.370]  They're not flying around in tin cans.
[01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.370]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:59.370]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:03.050]  All I want is your word of mouth and to tell people to tune into the show and to share
[01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:04.050]  the clips.
[01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.050]  And you're doing it.
[01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:08.370]  It's having a bigger effect than ever, and please keep us on air while still getting
[01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:09.370]  great products.
[01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:13.370]  I mean, you really need to get our full spectrum CBD oil, so good for your joints and bones
[01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.170]  and your neurological systems.
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:17.610]  You really need to get our ultimate grill oil, ultimate fish oil.
[01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.250]  You really need turbo four-star energy.
[01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.250]  Everybody needs X3 tri-ionine.
[01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.250]  It'll take everything in your body to the next level.
[01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.250]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.

[01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.250]  Get X3.

[01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:11.050]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:24.330]  All right ladies and gentlemen, I have studied the Sumerian text, I have studied the Jewish text,
[01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:29.050]  I have studied the Aztec and Mayan text, the Toltec text, I have studied the ancient
[01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:36.490]  Druid text, I have studied the ancient Slavic text, the ancient Chinese text,
[01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:43.450]  I have studied the ancient Japanese text, I have studied the ancient African text, and
[01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:51.290]  David, I went to South Africa and talked to a very ancient African tribe that also talks about
[01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:57.370]  Sirius, the dog star, and these twin stars, and their whole cosmology of these beings that came
[01:06:57.450 --> 01:07:02.330]  to earth and all the rest of it, and what the Africans who never had any contact with the
[01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:09.930]  Sumerians say in their written language that's on their cave walls from six, seven, eight, ten
[01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:14.730]  thousand years ago, and that's in their scrolls that are over a thousand years old, is exactly
[01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:23.290]  what the Sumerians say. Now I'm going to ask you, how is what they say basically identical to what
[01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:30.410]  the Sumerians say? And when the Portuguese and Spanish showed up in Mesoamerica,
[01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:34.810]  they said it was all satanic, and I don't blame them, it looked pretty horrible, it is horrible,
[01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:41.610]  all the human sacrifice, the rest of it, they destroyed just literally hundreds of thousands
[01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:46.410]  of artifacts because they wrote about it, only took a little bit back to Madrid, and I've never
[01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:54.250]  been to the Madrid Natural History Museum, or it's the History Museum, and seen the
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:08:03.260]  actual things that I've seen in photos, but I mean, the Aztecs and the Mayans had like
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:12.120]  pottery of a 747 with four engines on it, and windows on it, I mean, what is that?
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.540]  Or there's hieroglyphs in the Great Pyramid that show an Apache helicopter, and I mean,
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:22.020]  it's an Apache helicopter.
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:27.620]  So there's a bunch of stuff going on, and to try to cover this will give you a headache,
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.820]  because there's so many facets to it.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.620]  So I'm not disagreeing with Tucker Carlson to say the government could be covering up
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:38.780]  aliens, but to say they're covering up UFOs, we know that, because there's all sorts of
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:44.320]  secret government programs, they admit, where a UFO is just an unidentified flying object.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.940]  So it's always, the news always gets it wrong and says, are UFOs real?
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:51.620]  Well, of course UFOs are real.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.260]  Of course unidentified flying objects are real.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.060]  A lot of times they get identified, sometimes they don't.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.260]  But the media and the government play dumb, and I remember like 15 years ago, there were
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:06.900]  these big spy blimps over New York, and over Salt Lake City, and over Dallas, Texas, and
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:11.740]  amateur astronomers in the day would aim a telephoto, you know, telescope up and get
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.220]  video, because you can hook video cameras up to them.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.940]  I know, I've got one, I'm an amateur astronomer, and back when I had time, I used to do that
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:23.020]  every weekend, and I've taken photos on a clear night of, with my 35 millimeter camera,
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:28.100]  hooked up to a telescope I bought, and like blew it up, and it's like Saturn, you can
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.180]  see the color of Saturn, and its rings, and its moons.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:38.580]  Anyways, getting back to what I was talking about, I found those photos somewhere incredible.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:43.780]  I remember taking pictures of Hale-Bopp and all that, that was really cool, but long story
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:49.700]  short, what I'm getting at here is that, is that we know there's a lot of stuff going
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:54.780]  on in the universe, a lot happening, and we know UFOs are real, so the idiot statement
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.820]  we always hear is, UFOs for the first time are admitted to be real.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:05.340]  No, the UFOs have been going on forever, and the ancients all wrote about star men landing
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:11.100]  in craft, some were spinning like wheels and made no noise, some had fire and smoke coming
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.940]  out the bottom and landed.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:20.220]  Ezekiel describes it as a floating platform with a big man with a blue crystal see-through
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:27.860]  helmet over its face, and then it gives him something to eat that's sweet in the mouth
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.100]  that hurts the stomach, and then suddenly he's given the download.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.940]  I mean, wild stuff.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.700]  And then it's also described by other groups in the Middle East at the same time.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.060]  So this is getting written down, this is getting talked about.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.860]  You can go to the Vatican, everybody's seen these photos, paintings, they're like 500
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:51.100]  years old, some 1,000, that show what look like satellites and little men in them and
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.420]  flying saucers and all this stuff, so people were seeing this stuff back then before the
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.260]  Wright Brothers, okay?
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.880]  This stuff was going on and inspired the Italians and then the French to create hot air balloons
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.780]  because they kept seeing these flying things going around.
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:09.300]  So all of this is really happening, all right?
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.380]  This is going on.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:18.260]  But most of the stuff that we see on the flying, you know, smart tic-tacs and all this other
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:25.220]  stuff is government and corporate devices and a lot of suppressed technology that's
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.100]  out there, okay?
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.060]  That's what's going on.
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:38.100]  You have the star that leads, hovering over them, the three wise men to go to Christ and
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.100]  to see Christ there.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:43.580]  I mean, it's all hiding in plain view, ladies and gentlemen, the Immaculate Conception,
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.220]  all this stuff.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:55.220]  And it's a story that's there that the politicians don't want you to know about, that the preachers
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.740]  don't want you to know about because it removes them as the priesthood between you and God.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.420]  So the angels are creatures created by the creator of the universe.
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:09.740]  The creator made us in his image and we are master builders that anything we can conceive,
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.300]  we will be able to finally build.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.420]  And you see that.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:16.220]  We are not in our behavior, not in our godliness, but we are like what we would think of as
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.020]  gods, what ancients would think of as gods today.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:26.020]  If the ancients saw what we can do today, they would think we were gods.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:31.220]  Energy is indistinguishable from magic if someone doesn't know how it works, okay?
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:38.940]  And to make this very, very simple, less than 1% of the universe's energy is detectable by
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:47.580]  our eyes, our ears, our noses, our fingers, touch, smell, taste, all that stuff, sight.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.780]  You have the sixth sense that it's beyond the sixth sense.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.940]  You have an electromagnetic connection to electromagnetic lines.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:59.540]  If you think about a bird and insects, that's how they can be born in an egg in Canada and
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.980]  fly all the way to Mexico, in the case of geese or hummingbirds.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.220]  There's electromagnetic.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.140]  That's what you call a sixth sense, call it the seventh sense, picking up other types
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.580]  of energies and things that are out there.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:17.860]  The truth is we have hundreds of senses, okay, that are in third dimensional overlay.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:24.700]  But we only know about the five senses, but now science has quantified the sixth sense.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.780]  You know what somebody's looking at.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.580]  You know when you're in the woods, in the middle of nowhere, that somebody's staring at you.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:33.340]  You turn and you catch where they're at.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:40.860]  So and you pick up the energies of everybody else around you.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:41.860]  You pick up the vibe.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.400]  Well, that's, again, that's the clairvoyance.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.860]  That's the psychic connection.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.860]  It's all been proven scientifically now.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:50.820]  That can't be debated.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.980]  And so they want you walled off from this, not knowing how special you are, not knowing
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.820]  you're connected to the divine.
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.500]  You're not divine.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.500]  You are connected, part of it, okay?
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.140]  And the globalists tell you, you're an animal, you're nothing, but oh, we're all going to
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.140]  be gods.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.460]  I'm Noah Yvonne Harari.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.460]  You know, I'm Ray Kurzweil.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.460]  Oh, we're all gods.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.460]  We're all gods.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.780]  But you know, none of you have free will.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.780]  You're just a programmable machine.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.380]  But oh, we're all gods.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.340]  It's all conflicting.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.980]  No, you're not a dumb animal.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.980]  No, you're not God.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:24.620]  You're made by God with the potential to commune with God and discover through the dimensional
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.780]  hierarchy the face of God.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.900]  But you cannot see that face at this level.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:40.300]  But you are made by God, and God has experienced the universe through your perspective for
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.380]  his perspective.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:46.740]  So let me get back to the UFOs, and let me explain this.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.740]  We're going to come back and play some of the Tucker Carlson, and then I'm going to
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.580]  go through it.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:57.540]  But the statement by this new high-level intel officer that he's the first to ever go public,
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:04.260]  Colonel Corso and a bunch of others have said they saw the aliens, said they saw the UFOs.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:10.500]  Now we hear this exact same story from someone new, but he can't show you any photos or any
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.660]  documents yet again.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:16.500]  But there's a major cover-up, and the intel agencies all told him this is there, but they
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.500]  can't show him, and now he's gone to the attorney, you know, he's gone to the inspector
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.840]  general, and they're taking this very, very seriously because they're just slowly getting
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.900]  you ready to tell you there's aliens, slowly getting you ready for Project Bluebeam, slowly
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.180]  getting you prepared.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.700]  Are they covering up secret technology?
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:34.700]  Absolutely.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.780]  But the way they're teaching everybody from day one through Hollywood in the 50s and the
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:44.220]  40s about how the UFOs look, who the aliens are, is the same message over and over again
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:48.260]  because that's not where they're coming from.
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.260]  Take like Pacific Rim.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.020]  It's a cheesy movie, but it's a better analogy of, oh, we thought they'd come from space.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:58.180]  They came through the great fiery rift in an interdimensional gate.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.180]  Now you're talking.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:04.780]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:12.860]  popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste full of essential oils back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.980]  oil toothpaste as well.

[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.260]  We made it even stronger.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:11.820]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:16.900]  at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:23.460]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.060]  called 10-hour energy.
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:30.500]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:35.660]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.660]  it.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.460]  It is the super fuel.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.900]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:42.900]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:43.900]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:47.420]  They go good with this, but this is the king kong.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:49.020]  This is the boss.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.820]  TurboForce back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:59.300]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.580]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.260]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.260]  People said, no way.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:07.660]  He's the most powerful that ever happened.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.700]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.700]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him, but as
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.820]  soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:20.820]  It's the same thing with InfoWars, but InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.220]  Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:29.180]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners, and when you support us, we're
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.180]  unstoppable.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:34.540]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:39.660]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people, so I want to thank you for your support and
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:44.180]  encourage viewers and listeners to understand, please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.460]  We're barely hanging on.

[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.180]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.180]  to these tyrants.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:03.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.220]  in plain view.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.980]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:12.260]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.500]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:24.780]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:31.060]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:37.220]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.140]  disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.380]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.820]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:51.220]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.420]  Take action now.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.420]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:05.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:27.200]  Alright, if you've been listening to the last few segments, you're saying, Alex, wait a
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]  minute.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:36.679]  You say the ancient Egyptians and the ancient Indians, the people that are in India, the
[01:20:36.679 --> 01:20:43.960]  ancient Jews, all of these groups, the Sumerians, all reported the same thing.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:48.040]  Creatures visiting us, human-like creatures from the stars, and saying they work for a
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.879]  more powerful God.
[01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:53.400]  Saying we're here as emissaries from this all-powerful thing.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  That's even in the text.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.519]  Was it, hey, we just work for the big guy.
[01:20:57.519 --> 01:21:00.120]  Those you can say are the angels.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.679]  And that's the cosmology.
[01:21:01.679 --> 01:21:02.759]  That is the takeaway from the Bible.
[01:21:02.759 --> 01:21:05.000]  It confirms it, makes it stronger.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.919]  And you see the mark of the beast in world government, everything it predicted is now
[01:21:07.919 --> 01:21:08.919]  here as well.
[01:21:08.919 --> 01:21:13.000]  So it's not just the Bible saying that, it's echoed in all these different cultures, which
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.799]  backs up the Bible even further.
[01:21:15.799 --> 01:21:16.799]  So you're saying, well, wait a minute.
[01:21:16.799 --> 01:21:21.320]  You say we're getting all these visitors in these ships, but then you're saying, oh, but
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.240]  they're not visiting now in ships.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:28.639]  They're not little gray men that stumble around and, you know, run around in your cabbage patch
[01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:31.400]  and crash and take hands.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.200]  What I'm saying is that I've looked at the videos, I've studied them, I've talked to
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.839]  the experts.
[01:21:38.839 --> 01:21:44.120]  Almost all of this are unmanned vehicles that they have, because humans can't take the Gs
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.120]  that some of these unmanned vehicles can do.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.679]  And we know that they're coming and going at military bases, and they're messing with
[01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:51.160]  our pilots and all the rest of it.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:56.679]  And if you look at the smart tic-tac and the rest of it, the evidence is overwhelming that
[01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:57.679]  it's human.
[01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:02.759]  That doesn't mean there aren't three-dimensional craft or creatures in the third dimension
[01:22:02.759 --> 01:22:04.139]  that are coming here.
[01:22:04.139 --> 01:22:10.599]  But where you really see it is in individuals that lift the veil, taking ayahuasca or things
[01:22:10.599 --> 01:22:15.639]  like that, where no matter what culture it is, even people that aren't Christian take
[01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:20.960]  it and they get visited by demons that say, you need to kill yourself, we need world government,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.480]  you need to, you know, you need to do all this horrible stuff.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.879]  They are there.
[01:22:24.879 --> 01:22:30.400]  And that's these groups that have cut themselves off from God, created their own dimensions,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.799]  God lets them do that, their own private hells, separate from God.
[01:22:35.799 --> 01:22:40.040]  And because you have free will, you're able, like a radio station, to tune yourself to
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.599]  where they are.
[01:22:41.599 --> 01:22:48.519]  And the reason God set us up with our five senses, just the beginning of our senses,
[01:22:48.519 --> 01:22:54.599]  where we don't see all this stuff, I mean, can you imagine if you could see all the electromagnetic
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.759]  radiation, can you imagine if you could see all the other dimensions or the entities of
[01:22:57.759 --> 01:23:01.679]  the creatures that are in this dimension and without bleeding in?
[01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:07.679]  I mean, here's an example, it'd be great if you could see at certain levels...
[01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:10.690]  Microwave radiation.
[01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:14.690]  But then what would the cell towers look like? What would your cell tower look like?
[01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:17.690]  Be a big, blazing, bright object.
[01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:20.690]  What if you could see AM frequency?
[01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:23.690]  What if you could see UHF, VHF frequency?
[01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:25.690]  Well, you'd see how polluted everything is.
[01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:28.690]  You'd also see how big and powerful the sun is.
[01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:32.690]  Everybody knows that when the sun's at high noon, AM radio doesn't come in as well,
[01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:35.690]  because it blasts the full frequency range and messes up AM radio.
[01:23:35.690 --> 01:23:38.690]  You know why Elon Musk says he's not putting AM in his cars?
[01:23:39.690 --> 01:23:47.690]  He says the EV batteries, because it's an electrochemical charge, it's a particle beam,
[01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.690]  are so loud that AM doesn't work.
[01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:53.690]  And that's actually true.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:00.140]  You ever driven under power lines or been in a red light under a power line when you listen to AM radio?
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.140]  You're listening to Rush Limbaugh driving along, he's bright and clear all of a sudden.
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:07.140]  You drive under a power line and you can't hear it.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:15.140]  That's because the power line has electricity, energy charged up shooting down it.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:25.360]  So that's where I'm going with all this is, our government and corporations are creating
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.880]  alien frequencies that have never been on this earth before, and the repetition, they're
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.080]  not like the sun that slowly comes up and slowly goes down.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:41.880]  It's constant, it's ambient, it's gradual, and it still can kill you if you're tied outside
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880]  under it all day.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:48.280]  It can still kill you, even though you're supposed to have some of it to live.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.480]  Well, they've created all these devices and all these things around you that are just
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.800]  spewing different types of radiation out.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:00.560]  And again, you can't see that radiation, but it sees you and your cells see it.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.680]  And so the honeybees are down around 5G, the birds are down around it, the trees are down
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:09.360]  around it, and all the studies show it kills cells, super powerful, disrupts everything
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.360]  in your body.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:17.160]  And if you could see it, if your optic nerve could see 5G wavelength, it would look like
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160]  a sun.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.160]  It would be blinding.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.840]  You'd go, oh, I can't look at that, it's too powerful, oh, but see, your eyes are sensors
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.840]  meant to see visible light.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:30.720]  So you can't look at the pure, super powerful light, like, ah, it's too much, because you're
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.760]  dialed in to see stuff here at the ground level.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.360]  Well, you're all around stuff like that.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.360]  So 5G is alien.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.600]  It's not biological, but it might as well be an alien.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.440]  You start seeing things the way the enemy really sees it.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.280]  Or all these human-animal hybrids they've created for 30, 40 years.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.640]  They've been splotching humans and animals, and they claim they kill them at the embryo
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.640]  level.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]  No, they don't.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640]  They've been doing this for at least 30 years.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640]  We know of, they admit.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:00.560]  They've been doing animal clones and human clones for 50 years, all declassified, all
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.560]  public.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.920]  And now they're creating humanoids made out of synthetic DNA they create.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:05.920]  That's not human.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:06.920]  That's alien.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.800]  And again, they can create a random code, send it to them on a radio satellite, and
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.960]  then create a new creature out of that synthetic DNA.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.400]  They used to have movies like Species in the 90s about that.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.760]  That's fictional, but they've really done it.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.600]  But it's not aliens talking to us over the radio telescopes like that movie.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.600]  No, sir.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.520]  It's not aliens sending us a genetic code for our own destruction.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.960]  It is interdimensional groups that have always been here, marooned on this planet, locked
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]  on this planet.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.680]  God doesn't let them off of it.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.880]  And we're locked in here with them as our tester.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.360]  And they're right here, folks, and they want to do one thing.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.440]  They want to steal our technology because we're third dimensional.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:56.720]  They want us to build them their synthetic silicon system that they're able to interface
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:01.120]  with, and we're building their body in the third dimension.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.440]  And they are right there, right next to us, because we're in the fourth dimension, fifth
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.440]  dimension, sixth dimension, second dimension, and all the sub-dimensions are able to bleed
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.280]  into that in the transmission zone.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.720]  So they're right there trying to communicate with us.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.600]  What do they do at Skull & Bones?
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.880]  What do they do at these different occult rituals?
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.320]  They for days lay in coffins and ask these entities to come into them.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320]  They call them angels.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:34.000]  And they do horrible sexual things and horrible crimes, hoping they can purify themselves,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.120]  the opposite of that, so the entity, the dirty entity will be able to enter them.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.120]  And so they commit crimes.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.720]  It's like a gang will tell you to go murder somebody to be a made member.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.240]  Or MS-13 will say do a human sacrifice to be a member.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:49.600]  Or the Jeffrey Epstein model will make you rape a little girl to be a member.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.000]  They want you to prove your fealty and lower your spiritual common sense defense shields
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.920]  that God put in you because God put firewalls in you to keep these things out.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:04.280]  They need you to introduce the virus of Satanism, of child abuse, of murder into you so they
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.680]  can hack your soul.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.800]  So that's how the invasion is taking place.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.040]  Yes, there are entities with third dimensional interface.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.400]  We are a third dimensional interface of a multi-dimensional entity or being.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.080]  But the main way they attack us is not in the physical third dimensional realm, but through
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:27.840]  time, space, and different fold space interfaces.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.400]  And so that's why this whole Pentagon program that's the same story over and over again
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:38.400]  since 1947 is the same story over and over again towards a larger goal of fake alien
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.360]  invasion Project Blue Beam that will look at some of the different angles of that when
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360]  we return.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.560]  But, again, I'm not saying Tucker Carlson's wrong to say they're suppressing UFOs and alien
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.000]  stuff because they are.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.240]  But they're suppressing it so they can control the narrative on this information into the
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240]  future.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240]  Stay with us.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.960]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.960]  Do you like Rainforce?
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]  Yeah.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.960]  Yeah.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:03.960]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.960]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.980]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykowitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:12.280]  two books with Alex Jones.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.600]  That's because I use Rainforce every day.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.520]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.520]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.880]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Rainforce.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.200]  I'll take Rainforce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.720]  four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:42.440]  So it really is true that Rainforce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440]  All right.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.440]  We love you.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.440]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.800]  You can buy Rainforce, Rainforce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:59.320]  We'll be right back with our number two.

[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:04.400]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.240]  food supply.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.880]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:16.160]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.920]  we need to do about it.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:21.260]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:26.480]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.400]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:38.760]  of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.160]  Earth's surface.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:46.280]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:52.120]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:58.160]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.720]  This is their big move.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.500]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.260]  He doesn't care.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.500]  That's not his job.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.260]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.020]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:21.540]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:22.540]  They must be opposed.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.540]  And that's who he works with.
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:29.580]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:30.580]  Exactly.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.940]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:33.940]  No, we will not take my vaccines.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:37.060]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.560]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.060]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:45.660]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.220]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.220]  You're right.
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.860]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.660]  And we say no.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:33:00.820]  And we say no to your war.
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:05.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:07.460]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:29.460]  Ghosts, demons, poltergeists, it's always been with us.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:30.860]  Always been here.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:35.060]  The universe is full of life, full of free will, full of good.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:38.060]  But good doesn't interfere with other life forms.
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:40.060]  It doesn't take free will.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.660]  It's basically hidden.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:49.660]  But evil, though the minority, gets in everybody's business and always tries to take over.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:52.860]  Now, there's a new video up on InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.260]  I'm going to have it posted to the front page of InfoWars.com.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.660]  We're going to play it, actually, coming up next segment.
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:58.260]  I want to get to Tucker Carlson right now.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:02.060]  You all know Harari, the high priest of the World Economic Forum.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.860]  Every major bookstore, in caps, pushing his books.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.060]  He's God.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.460]  He's going to be a god.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.460]  The future is not human.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.060]  We're going to take your bodies over.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:14.460]  A new quote, a new video.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:23.460]  Earth will be populated or dominated by entities that are not organic, that don't have emotions.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:28.500]  And he goes on to say, we're building God.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:34.860]  And he goes on to say, the banks will decide who lives and who dies.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.860]  Well, that really sounds Nazi-like.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:43.860]  You know, he came out two months ago and said, useless eaters, just eating the world's resources.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:46.860]  Well, that's a Hitler quote, but it's like, well, he's Jewish and gay.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:49.860]  It's like, oh, well, I mean, well, then he can wear a swastika on his arm.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.860]  It's very liberal then.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:51.860]  Please kill me.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.860]  Harari, you're God.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.860]  You're the Uber mention.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.860]  You're the Superman.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:57.860]  I mean, we're literally hearing it out of these people's mouths.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.860]  Oh, it's a Jewish guy.
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:34:59.860]  It's a woman pushing it.
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:00.860]  Oh, it's a black lady.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.860]  Oh, it's okay then.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.860]  As long as it's not a white person, everything's fine.
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.860]  Another big article from the London Guardian.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:11.860]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.860]  Absolutely critical.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:14.860]  Put it on screen.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:25.860]  The most damaging farm products are organic, organic corn, organic wheat, organic soybeans,
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.860]  organic watermelon, organic squash.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:32.860]  But the worst is pasture-fed beef and lamb.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:38.860]  Cows that don't get fed fertilizer, cows that don't get fed offal, cows that don't get fed
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.860]  grain, cows that live off the land.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.860]  That's the worst thing because they fart more.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.860]  Methane's always been part of the atmosphere.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.860]  There's always been cows and goats and sheep everywhere.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:50.860]  They were just not domesticated.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.860]  The idea, see, oh, it's a lab growing meat.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.860]  That's safe.
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:02.860]  Or if it's bugs made in a big warehouse with poisonous exoskeletons, chitin, then all the
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.860]  studies give you cancer.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.860]  That and bone fractures, that is really good.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.860]  What's better than fluoride?
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:09.860]  Well, I mean, obviously, bug parts.
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.860]  Kerry's like, we got major famine going on because of the lockdowns we launched.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860]  I mean, global warming.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:18.860]  We need to cut the farms off or we're going to have starvation.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:19.860]  It's like, you know what?
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:22.860]  Your oxygen tank, you're down there at 100 feet.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.860]  You've been down there for an hour.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:27.860]  And your dive buddy comes over and points the watch and says, hey, we only got 10 minutes
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:28.860]  of air.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.860]  We got to go up.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.860]  And you look at him and say, no, no, no.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:36.860]  So he pulls out his little writing board and writes, hey, we're going to die.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.860]  We need oxygen.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:40.860]  And you go, you're out on your little board.
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.860]  No, oxygen's bad.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:46.860]  And you cut your arrows and go, I mean, that's John Kerry.
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:47.860]  We got a food problem.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.860]  Cut the food off right now.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.860]  We got an oxygen.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:53.860]  Listen, you only got 10 minutes of oxygen.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:54.860]  Well, let me just slip my oxygen cord.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.860]  Now I've got oxygen.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.860]  And hell, why just slip the oxygen cord?
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:59.860]  Why don't you stab yourself in the carotid arteries?
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.860]  Oxygen's a problem.
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.860]  Eh, eh, let it go.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:02.860]  Let it go.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:03.860]  Let it go.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.860]  Men can have babies.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:05.860]  Cut little boys' dicks off.
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.860]  It's all Hellraiser crazy.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.860]  Remember a month ago, I go, man, this surgery reminds me of Hellraiser.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.860]  I hadn't seen those shows since I was like a teenager.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:17.860]  I only saw a few of them where, you know, they rip the bones out and the meat out.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:20.860]  And I said, this transgender surgery creating artificial genitals for girls
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:22.860]  looks like Hellraiser.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.860]  You know, ripped off all the muscle off their forearms and thighs.
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:27.860]  And the crew goes, you didn't know that's the truth?
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.860]  Well, that's happening.
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:32.860]  I went ahead and finally last night watched excerpts online.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.860]  I didn't want to watch the whole thing.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:40.860]  And Penhead, the head demon, goes around forcibly cutting men's genitals off
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.860]  and giving women penises and rips the meat off where they actually do it.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.860]  I mean, these people are telling you what they're like, oh, be liberal.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:54.860]  Let us convince mentally ill girls to have their forearm meat cut off
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:00.860]  and their thigh meat cut off to then make genitals that all it has is pain
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:01.860]  and no pleasure.
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:04.860]  And Penhead's like, yes, the pain of pleasure.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860]  The pleasure of pain.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.860]  I mean, it is pure demoniac.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.860]  And then I nail it saying, this looks like Hellraiser.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.860]  And they go, you didn't know there's actually –
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.860]  the new episode is about forcing people to have their genitals cut off.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.860]  Demons ripping your genitals off.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.860]  That's what this is.
[01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:30.209]  But here's Harari saying, we're going to make aliens on earth.
[01:38:30.209 --> 01:38:34.370]  We're going to merge the machines and be a new life form, a new ruling alien class on
[01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:35.370]  earth.
[01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:37.969]  See, they're building the aliens.
[01:38:37.969 --> 01:38:40.610]  They think they're building the aliens.
[01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:46.610]  The biomedical AI merger with our flesh, the raping of humanity, and they're just getting
[01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:50.209]  started and they've got to get you used to these incredible horrors.
[01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:52.209]  So here's what's happening with Tucker Carlson.
[01:38:52.209 --> 01:38:53.629]  He's a great guy.
[01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:58.450]  He sees, okay, everything I've been told by the government's a lie, which is basically
[01:38:58.450 --> 01:38:59.450]  true.
[01:38:59.450 --> 01:39:01.969]  And so if they're saying UFOs aren't real, when we know there are a bunch of weird flying
[01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:05.769]  things going around and all these whistleblowers are going public, and now we got one saying
[01:39:05.769 --> 01:39:09.009]  that, oh, he's talked to people that have seen the documents that they're actually aliens
[01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:10.009]  and in these crafts.
[01:39:10.009 --> 01:39:13.370]  Tucker's like, well, it looks like they're covering up, this is big news.
[01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:18.129]  But it's the same story from Roswell in the late 40s with Colonel Corso, who was there
[01:39:18.129 --> 01:39:22.969]  when I was a colonel, heavily promoted everywhere by the biggest publishers, by the biggest
[01:39:22.969 --> 01:39:23.969]  movie makers.
[01:39:23.969 --> 01:39:29.429]  Oh, that was system funded because they don't want you to understand the full spectrum of
[01:39:29.429 --> 01:39:33.450]  interdimensional contact and the fact that it's always been here and these things actually
[01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:34.530]  aren't alien.
[01:39:34.530 --> 01:39:36.849]  They're part of our existence and part of our story here.
[01:39:36.849 --> 01:39:41.009]  If anything, it's the aliens, it's us put here on this planet by God.
[01:39:41.009 --> 01:39:43.849]  And there's these things that were already basically here.
[01:39:43.849 --> 01:39:49.089]  So all of this is going on, that we've probably not been here as long as this thing's been
[01:39:49.089 --> 01:39:52.849]  here, if you really read the ancient text of the Bible.
[01:39:52.849 --> 01:39:55.849]  And so they don't want, you know, it's far more complex and they're not in control of
[01:39:55.849 --> 01:39:56.849]  it.
[01:39:56.849 --> 01:40:01.410]  All they're doing is being demonically inspired by these creatures that will only give them
[01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:03.169]  hellraiser visions.
[01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:07.969]  It will only give them how to have technology for evil or how to twist something or how
[01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:15.330]  to give them something that'll hurt us down the road because it doesn't like us.
[01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:21.209]  It was put here and defeated by a more advanced version of us, right in the image of God.
[01:40:21.209 --> 01:40:23.250]  It's all right there for you to see.
[01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:31.169]  And this is just a training camp where our God, our parent, our father has put us here.
[01:40:31.169 --> 01:40:36.049]  So we think we're only living on one life so that we're in this super scared position
[01:40:36.049 --> 01:40:41.650]  of it having all these spiritual and ancestral galactic, intergalactic, interdimensional memories.
[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:46.929]  And it's all a giant three-dimensional real scenario war game.
[01:40:46.929 --> 01:40:49.849]  And they don't want you to know that.
[01:40:49.849 --> 01:40:51.650]  They don't want you to understand that.
[01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:54.410]  And they don't want you to understand they signed on the wrong team.
[01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:56.929]  These are losers, folks.
[01:40:56.929 --> 01:40:59.650]  These are, these people lost the game.
[01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:04.330]  They joined with the destructive force, the evil force, so they could have power during
[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:10.889]  the third-dimensional simulation, which again isn't like a tabletop simulation like we do
[01:41:10.889 --> 01:41:12.570]  or an electric simulation.
[01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:18.330]  It's a three-dimensional, third-dimension, genetic, universal simulation.
[01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:20.370]  It's a real simulation.
[01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:21.809]  It's just that it's forever war.
[01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.570]  You don't die when you die, folks.
[01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:26.530]  You're an electrochemical, multi-dimensional creature.
[01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:29.809]  This is only one lowest manifestation of you.
[01:41:29.809 --> 01:41:31.889]  And again, we have glorified heavenly bodies.
[01:41:31.889 --> 01:41:34.209]  There's this first heaven, the second heaven, the third heaven.
[01:41:34.209 --> 01:41:37.009]  It's all right there for you to understand.
[01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:42.030]  And again, what is the habit? A dimension.
[01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:48.630]  So, that's the truth about all this, and you can debate me all day if you want, you can
[01:41:48.630 --> 01:41:52.110]  talk about it all day if you want, but they are programming that aliens are these little
[01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:57.150]  stupid gray things that stumble around and bump into each other, and are crashing constantly
[01:41:57.150 --> 01:42:00.630]  and don't know how to wipe their butts, and they want to kidnap us at night and take stuff
[01:42:00.630 --> 01:42:05.750]  from us. And there is some evidence for some lower level creatures, they're like a biological
[01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:09.830]  android and they go around doing all this, but if you look at the experts that have really
[01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:14.389]  studied this, they concur with my just historical analysis of it, and my spiritual gut level
[01:42:14.389 --> 01:42:20.750]  approximation of it, that this whole big UFO thing is a distraction into the future that
[01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:26.030]  oh, the aliens are harassing our ships, the aliens are harassing our troops. No, that's
[01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:31.870]  the globalists with their advanced technology playing games, so they can brand contact with
[01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:38.070]  the angels and God above them as the devil, when really we're here with the devil. And
[01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:41.750]  the devil, by the way, isn't locked in here, we're not locked in here with the devil, the
[01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:46.550]  devil's locked in here with us. Okay, so I'm going to give that Yuval Harari clip, I'm
[01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:50.550]  going to give the Tucker clip as well when we come back, please don't forget, we're selling
[01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:55.750]  out of X2, I got to pull this sale, it's still up on the site, you want experience, try Iodide,

[01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:57.790]  you have to have these products.
[01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:01.790]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:09.790]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:13.790]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:16.790]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:22.790]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:26.790]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two, imagine being
[01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:29.790]  like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:33.790]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:37.790]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:40.790]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:42.790]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:45.790]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:50.790]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:45:57.790 --> 01:46:05.790]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:08.790]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:14.790]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:18.790]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:24.790]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:29.790]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:32.790]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:39.790]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:41.790]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:46.790]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:52.790]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:56.790]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com
[01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:06.790]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:25.280]  Alright, final segment of hour two, hour number three, Jam Pack coming up.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:31.640]  I gotta tell you, ladies and gentlemen, again, this is a very sophisticated PSYOP.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.480]  I don't blame anybody for wanting to think they're covering up UFOs, there's all this
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:35.800]  stuff in the skies.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.440]  They are covering a lot of stuff up.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.519]  I'm not saying there isn't a cover-up up, but this so-called high-level intelligence
[01:47:41.519 --> 01:47:45.360]  operative who I challenge to come on the show, who is admittedly heading up a government
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:50.880]  program looking into this, saying this is all being kept from him, well, that's the
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.840]  same story we've been hearing since the late 40s from these groups, and it's always the
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:56.840]  same story.
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:04.000]  Alien bodies, alien crap being suppressed so they can create the idea that there are
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.240]  these hostile aliens, this is all about to go down.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.160]  And so people think of the attack as some type of physical third-dimensional attack
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.680]  when we're being influenced by these entities much more sophisticatedly to destroy each
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:25.240]  other and to then build a silicon life-form system for them to inhabit and escape the
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.800]  phantom zone they're in is the best way to describe it, alright?
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.600]  So that's what's going on here.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.519]  And you notice the corporate media and them don't make jokes when I say all this, because
[01:48:37.519 --> 01:48:38.680]  they all know.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:42.600]  This is what they believe, they know what's going on, and they seem to think their alliance
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:49.440]  with these critters, who are basically like intergalactic cockroaches or something, is
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  going to make them win.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.000]  I mean, it's just the stupidest thing ever that they would work with some low-level scumbag
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.160]  organization that just wants to hurt everybody, and of course, it's got some high-level operatives,
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.559]  like Satan, you know, that God did create, I mean, God made it all, and they've just
[01:49:04.559 --> 01:49:07.320]  chosen to go against God.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.360]  But the average person interfacing with evil basically interfaces with what I would describe
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:17.600]  as like a drooling gremlin, and that's their main operative force, is a bunch of drooling
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:18.600]  gremlins.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.440]  I mean, who would refuse the God of the universe with unlimited power, unlimited grace, unlimited
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:25.760]  love, and that gave us everything?
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.280]  Gave us food, gave us sex, gave us everything.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.120]  The devil didn't give you that, God did.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.200]  So what type of scum would go against that?
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.880]  Well, that's who you're with when you're against God.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.200]  And just imagine, there's been a lot of species and a lot of groups and a lot of organizations
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.600]  that have decided to work with Satan, not just humans, and it really just comes down
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.920]  to that.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.200]  So that's what's going on in the universe.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.280]  There's a lot of creatures that don't want to get with the program, and that's really
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.880]  what this comes down to.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.880]  So you can get with their program, or you can get with God's program.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.920]  Satan's program, how's that working out for people?
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.640]  It's like the Blue City program.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.480]  You ask, why do the Democrats do this?
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.160]  Because they like it, it's what they do.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:13.519]  The things running them don't like to see us do well.
[01:50:13.519 --> 01:50:16.040]  They like to see our children have their testicles cut off.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.840]  They like to see our kids dead, miserable, committing suicide.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.680]  They don't like us, real simple.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.440]  And once you get that perspective, it all makes sense.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.800]  I mean, look, you're not, look at, you're on a planet in the middle of space going around
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.720]  the sun, folks.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.720]  They find new species every day.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:39.720]  You really think we're alone in intelligent life?
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:46.099]  We're in the middle of an Amazon rainforest of life in the universe.
[01:50:46.099 --> 01:50:49.580]  It's crawling out of the walls, out of the dimensions.
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:50.580]  It's everywhere.
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.259]  That's what God does.
[01:50:52.259 --> 01:50:55.940]  Total life, total free will, free for all.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.780]  The problem is a lot of entities decide to go against the program, and the program lets
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:01.780]  you do whatever you want.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.059]  That's the whole point.
[01:51:04.059 --> 01:51:06.820]  So even when they go against the program, they're with the program.
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:09.059]  See how God's got it all figured out.
[01:51:09.059 --> 01:51:13.179]  Even the Satanists always say, see, your God's a sadist, letting all this ... No, God
[01:51:13.179 --> 01:51:14.219]  just lets you do what you want.
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:19.100]  But all of God's laws are good.
[01:51:20.770 --> 01:51:25.770]  The wages of sin, going against the program, is death.
[01:51:25.770 --> 01:51:28.770]  Real simple. Go with the program, you get everything.
[01:51:28.770 --> 01:51:31.770]  Go against the program, you get to play God and destroy yourself.
[01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:34.770]  And you say, well, God's a sadist.
[01:51:34.770 --> 01:51:36.770]  I've had four children.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:44.580]  And the path of life is death, but you're reborn.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:47.700]  But to have a child is to kill a child.
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:53.620]  That's elementary truth of the universe, that the path of life is death.
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:56.020]  The path of death is life.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:00.020]  And you have children, and they could end up being bank robbers, they could end up being
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:04.060]  murderers, they could end up being, God forbid, devil worshippers.
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.380]  They could be seduced by the dark side.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:07.940]  But you want to have that child.
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:09.320]  You want to experience that love.
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:13.060]  You want to see your genetics continue and that of your wife or husband, and see what
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:18.660]  merging your genetics together and making a new entity with free will that literally
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:20.780]  is an imprint of God in the universe.
[01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:25.930]  You have that child, and you hope it does well, and you hope you make the right decisions,
[01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:28.930]  and you hope, and you pray, and you work hard if you're a good person.
[01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:31.930]  And that's all God does. God even gave us cheat sheets.
[01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:35.930]  God even incarnated into one of our little bodies and came down here and led a perfect life
[01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:39.930]  to say, hey, I'm going to put you through this. I'm going to put my skin in the game.
[01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:47.610]  Imagine, you're timeless, run everything, total control, do whatever you want, I'm going to
[01:52:47.610 --> 01:52:51.010]  cram myself down in a human body and I'm going to teleport myself into the desert.
[01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:55.050]  And I'm going to let these people literally torture me to death and show everybody.
[01:52:55.050 --> 01:52:58.730]  Then I'm going to rise again, because they've got to see it for themselves.
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.760]  And I'll give them an owner's manual, how all this works, and what's going to come in the future,
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.760]  and how the enemy's going to strike them.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:11.760]  Because God gave us free will, but God gave us a cheat sheet, an owner's manual.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.760]  And if we don't use it, it's our fault.
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:20.760]  All right, here's some Noval Noah Harari saying,
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.760]  You'll be ruled by aliens. Here it is.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:30.760]  Maybe in a couple of decades, Earth will be populated or even dominated by entities that are not organic,
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:34.760]  that they don't breathe, they don't have emotions.
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:41.760]  The potential of AI is much, much bigger than any historical revolution.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.760]  It's really a biological revolution.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:48.760]  For four billion years, all of life was organic.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:55.760]  And this is at least an idea of inorganic life forms.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:59.760]  That's the biggest thing that happened on Earth in four billion years.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:02.760]  First of all, Darwinian evolution until today was organic.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760]  Yeah.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:04.760]  And this is not organic.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.760]  But...
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:08.760]  And also, Darwinian evolution is evolution by natural selection.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.760]  Here we have intelligent design.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.760]  Yeah.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:16.760]  So not the intelligent design of the creationists and the Bible, a real intelligent design.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:20.760]  And then the AI will design maybe the next generation of AI.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:24.760]  So it's a completely different kind of process.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.760]  It's very practical.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:33.760]  Today, when you apply to the bank for a loan, and the bank basically lets an algorithm decide your fate,
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:36.760]  and the algorithm says, No, don't give this lady a loan.
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.760]  And you ask the bank...
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.760]  Stop here.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  This is all flim-flam.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:44.760]  All AI does is plagiarize and steal human data and then regurgitate it.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:47.760]  We're impressed because we're looking at ourselves in a mirror.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:50.760]  And then these guys program the algorithm and say, Oh, it's not us.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:51.760]  It's the beast.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.760]  It's the AI god.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  And worship it and do what it says, and it'll give you a good number.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  If you don't, you're cut off from the system.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:07.760]  Let he who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is the number of man.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:10.760]  666.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:16.760]  Guys, find 666, number of the beast, Iron Maiden.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.760]  Put the one online, the one on Spotify.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:24.760]  I think we have it in the computer, the original from the 80s, like a 1982 or whatever it was.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:26.760]  It's Vincent Price introducing it.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:32.760]  So I want Iron Maiden, Vincent Price, number of the beast.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.760]  I want the full intro.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.760]  It's very short.
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:45.760]  Woe to you, earth and seed, for the devil sends the beast for wrath because he knows time is short.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:49.760]  His number is 666, the number of a man.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:54.760]  Let he who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.760]  Well, we've reckoned the number, and it's their global social credit score.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.760]  It's their system.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760]  You must worship the beast.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:02.760]  You must give it your children.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  Even after they all fall down to it, a precursor of that, the devil's always building.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.760]  So each new phase is the same example of the endgame he wants, but smaller.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:14.760]  It gets bigger each time.
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.760]  You take the shot, you have a heart attack and die, or you get cancer.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  But they still want it, and they still need it.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.760]  They want to be abused by it.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  They want to be hurt.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  Hurt me bad, Satan.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.760]  Hurt me, Daddy.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.760]  Because they're scared of it.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:31.760]  They're initially so scared of evil, they decide to roll over on their back and piss like a dog.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:32.760]  They're scared.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.760]  Instead of saying, get out of my way.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.760]  Get behind me, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.760]  Why did Christ say, get behind me?
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.760]  Christ is the future, the trailblazer, the future.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.760]  Satan's in our dust.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:51.760]  Get behind me, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God of Nazareth.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:55.760]  Say that, and every knee will bow.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:58.760]  Every tongue will confess the reality of that.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:04.760]  But the masonically globalist, New World Order-controlled churches are keeping this from you.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:06.760]  They know all of this.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:09.760]  They don't want you to know it, because they've made a deal now.
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.760]  They've made a deal now.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.760]  They believe they can get advanced technology from silicon and merge with it and have their own heaven.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.760]  It's like Metaverse, but ten times more evil.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.760]  A thousand times.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:27.760]  Metaverse, they said, was just a hellscape of nausea and vomiting, and everybody hated it, including children.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  No one could even use it, and they put $50 billion into it or whatever, $80 billion.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:36.760]  It's all $80 billion for a vomit machine, for a roller coaster you can't wait to get off of.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.760]  It's all they can, this is, oh, you're God, oh, a vomit machine.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.760]  It's so wonderful.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:46.760]  No, all of it's a joke, all of it's a fraud, all of it's evil.
[01:57:47.730 --> 01:57:51.730]  All I want is your word of mouth and to tell people to tune into the show and to share the clips.
[01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:54.730]  And you're doing it and it's having a bigger effect than ever.
[01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:57.730]  And please keep us on air while still getting great products.
[01:57:57.730 --> 01:58:00.730]  I mean, you really need to get our full-spectrum CBD oil.

[01:58:03.730 --> 01:58:05.730]  You really need to get our ultimate grill oil, ultimate fish oil.
[01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:07.730]  You really need Turbo Force Shower Clean Energy.
[01:58:07.730 --> 01:58:10.730]  Everybody needs X3 Tri-Iodine.
[01:58:10.730 --> 01:58:12.730]  It'll take everything nearby to the next level.
[01:58:12.730 --> 01:58:14.730]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.
[01:58:14.730 --> 01:58:16.730]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, get X3.
[01:58:16.730 --> 01:58:18.730]  It doesn't just fund the operation.

[01:58:46.730 --> 01:58:48.730]  Please take action now.
[01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:51.730]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:54.730]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:57.730]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.730]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:58:59.730 --> 01:59:02.730]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:05.730]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:59:05.730 --> 01:59:07.730]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[01:59:07.730 --> 01:59:13.730]  InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:59:13.730 --> 01:59:16.730]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:59:16.730 --> 01:59:19.730]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:59:19.730 --> 01:59:24.730]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:27.730]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:59:27.730 --> 01:59:30.730]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:33.730]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:35.730]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:59:35.730 --> 01:59:38.730]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[01:59:38.730 --> 01:59:41.730]  We're all getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:41.730 --> 01:59:42.730]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:43.730]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:43.730 --> 01:59:45.730]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air.
[01:59:45.730 --> 01:59:48.730]  And never submit to these tyrants.
[01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:56.730]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:02.730]  Woe to you, oh earth and sea.
[02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:06.730]  For the devil sends the beast with wrath.
[02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:10.730]  Because he knows the time is short.
[02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:14.730]  Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast.
[02:00:14.730 --> 02:00:17.730]  For it is a human number.
[02:00:17.730 --> 02:00:22.730]  Its number is 666.
[02:00:26.730 --> 02:00:29.730]  I lived alone.
[02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:32.730]  My mind was blank.
[02:00:32.730 --> 02:00:38.730]  I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind.
[02:00:38.730 --> 02:00:41.730]  What did I see?
[02:00:41.730 --> 02:00:44.730]  Can I believe?
[02:00:44.730 --> 02:00:50.730]  That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy.
[02:00:50.730 --> 02:00:56.730]  Just what I saw in my old dreams.
[02:00:56.730 --> 02:01:02.730]  Were the reflections of my woman staring back at me.
[02:01:02.730 --> 02:01:05.730]  Cause in my dreams.
[02:01:05.730 --> 02:01:08.730]  It's always you.
[02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:12.730]  The evil face that twists my mind and brings me.
[02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:13.730]  We are back.
[02:01:13.730 --> 02:01:14.730]  I'm going to do a few more segments.
[02:01:14.730 --> 02:01:15.730]  Hand the baton to the great Owen Schroeder.
[02:01:15.730 --> 02:01:17.730]  We'll be back full show tomorrow in the studio.
[02:01:17.730 --> 02:01:18.730]  11 a.m. Central.
[02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:19.730]  I'd have to rehearse.
[02:01:19.730 --> 02:01:20.730]  Smith knocks out a part weekday mornings.
[02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:21.730]  8 a.m. Central.
[02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:23.730]  But I mentioned the Tucker Carlson monologue last night.
[02:01:23.730 --> 02:01:25.730]  We got into the UFOs.
[02:01:25.730 --> 02:01:27.730]  I've kind of unpacked this already.
[02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:29.730]  So let's kind of end at the beginning.
[02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:30.730]  Has it ever got to this?
[02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:31.730]  Here it is.
[02:01:31.730 --> 02:01:34.730]  Who organized those BLM riots three years ago?
[02:01:34.730 --> 02:01:36.730]  No one's gotten to the bottom of that.
[02:01:36.730 --> 02:01:38.730]  What exactly happened on 9-11?
[02:01:38.730 --> 02:01:40.730]  Well, it's still classified.
[02:01:40.730 --> 02:01:42.730]  How did Jeffrey Epstein make all that money?
[02:01:42.730 --> 02:01:43.730]  How did he die?
[02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:44.730]  How about JFK?
[02:01:44.730 --> 02:01:46.730]  And so endlessly on.
[02:01:46.730 --> 02:01:50.730]  Not only are the media not interested in any of this,
[02:01:50.730 --> 02:01:53.730]  they are actively hostile to anybody who is.
[02:01:53.730 --> 02:01:57.730]  In journalism, curiosity is the gravest crime.
[02:01:57.730 --> 02:02:00.730]  Yesterday, for example, a former Air Force officer
[02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:02.730]  who worked for years in military intelligence
[02:02:02.730 --> 02:02:04.730]  came forward as a whistleblower to reveal
[02:02:04.730 --> 02:02:07.730]  that the U.S. government has physical evidence
[02:02:07.730 --> 02:02:10.730]  of crashed non-human made aircraft,
[02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:14.730]  as well as the bodies of the pilots who flew those aircraft.
[02:02:14.730 --> 02:02:16.730]  The Pentagon has spent decades studying
[02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:19.730]  these otherworldly remains in order to build
[02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:22.730]  more technologically advanced weapons systems.
[02:02:22.730 --> 02:02:23.730]  Okay.
[02:02:23.730 --> 02:02:25.730]  That's what the former intel officer revealed,
[02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:28.730]  and it was clear he was telling the truth.
[02:02:28.730 --> 02:02:31.730]  In other words, UFOs are actually real,
[02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:34.730]  and apparently so is extraterrestrial life.
[02:02:34.730 --> 02:02:36.730]  Now we know.
[02:02:36.730 --> 02:02:40.730]  In a normal country, this news would qualify as a bombshell,
[02:02:40.730 --> 02:02:42.730]  the story of the millennium.
[02:02:42.730 --> 02:02:44.730]  But in our country, it doesn't.
[02:02:44.730 --> 02:02:47.730]  The whistleblower's account ran on a technology website
[02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:50.730]  called The Debrief, which you've probably never heard of.
[02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.730]  The Washington Post had that story,
[02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:54.730]  but decided not to run it.
[02:02:54.730 --> 02:02:57.730]  The New York Times, meanwhile, just pretended it never happened.
[02:02:57.730 --> 02:03:00.730]  On the front page of the New York Times website this morning,
[02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:02.730]  there were five stories about Ukraine,
[02:03:02.730 --> 02:03:05.730]  as well as four stories apiece about Donald Trump,
[02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:09.730]  trans people, and climate change, the usual lineup.
[02:03:09.730 --> 02:03:12.730]  There was nothing at all about how an alien species
[02:03:12.730 --> 02:03:15.730]  is flying hypersonic aircraft over our cities.
[02:03:15.730 --> 02:03:17.730]  Not one word.
[02:03:17.730 --> 02:03:21.730]  So if you're wondering why our country seems so dysfunctional,
[02:03:21.730 --> 02:03:23.730]  this is a big part of the reason.
[02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:26.730]  Nobody knows what's happening.
[02:03:26.730 --> 02:03:30.730]  A small group of people control access to all relevant information,
[02:03:30.730 --> 02:03:33.730]  and the rest of us don't know.
[02:03:33.730 --> 02:03:35.730]  We're allowed to yap all we want about racism,
[02:03:36.730 --> 02:03:38.730]  but go ahead and talk about something that really matters
[02:03:38.730 --> 02:03:40.730]  and see what happens.
[02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:42.730]  If you keep it up, they'll make you be quiet.
[02:03:42.730 --> 02:03:43.730]  Trust us.
[02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:45.730]  That's how they maintain control.
[02:03:45.730 --> 02:03:48.730]  When Western tourists first started traveling in large numbers
[02:03:48.730 --> 02:03:51.730]  to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s,
[02:03:51.730 --> 02:03:52.730]  they found that many Russians...
[02:03:52.730 --> 02:03:54.730]  Hold on, hit pause.
[02:03:54.730 --> 02:04:00.730]  Back it up to when Western citizens used to travel,
[02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:02.730]  or when Russians used to travel to the U.S.,
[02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:03.730]  they couldn't believe we had all this food
[02:04:03.730 --> 02:04:05.730]  and all this wealth and all this freedom.
[02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:07.730]  They've been told lies.
[02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:08.730]  And I'm going to come back and finish that point
[02:04:08.730 --> 02:04:09.730]  because he's totally right.
[02:04:09.730 --> 02:04:10.730]  We're being lied to about everything,
[02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:12.730]  so you can believe anything you want, basically,
[02:04:12.730 --> 02:04:14.730]  which is really dangerous as well
[02:04:14.730 --> 02:04:16.730]  because we don't know what the truth is.
[02:04:16.730 --> 02:04:18.730]  We have to go out and discover it ourselves.
[02:04:18.730 --> 02:04:19.730]  But Tucker's right.
[02:04:19.730 --> 02:04:21.730]  They are suppressing the truth about aliens
[02:04:21.730 --> 02:04:23.730]  and about spirituality and about different dimensions,
[02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:25.730]  and they know damn well what's going on.
[02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:26.730]  They're in contact with these things.
[02:04:26.730 --> 02:04:28.730]  They do horrible human sacrifices and rituals
[02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:30.730]  because these things demand we debase ourselves
[02:04:30.730 --> 02:04:33.730]  to have contact with them because they want to run God off.
[02:04:33.730 --> 02:04:36.730]  God does not get involved with hurting children,
[02:04:36.730 --> 02:04:38.730]  and so you do that.
[02:04:38.730 --> 02:04:41.730]  It's like jamming GPS when you're firing missiles at an enemy
[02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:42.730]  and they jam GPS.
[02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:44.730]  The missiles can't hit the target.
[02:04:44.730 --> 02:04:47.730]  The devil gets us to do evil stuff to kids
[02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:50.730]  because God will not be involved or around that
[02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:52.730]  and pulls back.
[02:04:52.730 --> 02:04:53.730]  So that's what's happening.
[02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:54.730]  That's why they're doing this.
[02:04:54.730 --> 02:04:55.730]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.730 --> 02:04:56.730]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.730 --> 02:04:59.730]  All I want is your word of mouth

[02:05:00.730 --> 02:05:01.730]  and to share the clips.
[02:05:01.730 --> 02:05:02.730]  And you're doing it,
[02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:04.730]  and it's having a bigger effect than ever.
[02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:05.730]  And please keep us on air

[02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:19.730]  Well, so does he.

[02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:35.730]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:39.730]  You know, Dave Mustaine wrote this classic,
[02:06:39.730 --> 02:06:40.730]  kill them all,
[02:06:40.730 --> 02:06:42.730]  Four Horsemen,
[02:06:42.730 --> 02:06:44.730]  Metallica song.
[02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:47.730]  And I'm not bragging when I tell the story.
[02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:50.730]  It just shows how distracted I've gotten.
[02:06:50.730 --> 02:06:51.730]  It was probably,
[02:06:51.730 --> 02:06:52.730]  it wasn't probably,
[02:06:52.730 --> 02:06:53.730]  it was about ten years ago.
[02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:54.730]  My ex-wife divorced me.
[02:06:54.730 --> 02:06:56.730]  And Dave Mustaine was at the house.
[02:06:56.730 --> 02:06:57.730]  He was staying with us.
[02:06:57.730 --> 02:06:59.730]  With his wife and son.
[02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:00.730]  Great people.
[02:07:00.730 --> 02:07:04.730]  And son's even bigger than Dave.
[02:07:04.730 --> 02:07:05.730]  Dave's a big guy.
[02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:06.730]  You look at him with long hair.
[02:07:06.730 --> 02:07:07.730]  He looks skinny on TV.
[02:07:07.730 --> 02:07:08.730]  He's a huge guy.
[02:07:08.730 --> 02:07:09.730]  And he goes,
[02:07:09.730 --> 02:07:10.730]  I want you to co-write my next album.
[02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:12.730]  And I want to rewrite the new Four Horsemen.
[02:07:12.730 --> 02:07:14.730]  And I want you to write it with me.
[02:07:14.730 --> 02:07:15.730]  And I went,
[02:07:15.730 --> 02:07:16.730]  Dave,
[02:07:16.730 --> 02:07:17.730]  I think you're going to be able to handle that.
[02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.730]  The next three albums,
[02:07:19.730 --> 02:07:21.730]  the next one's called End Game.
[02:07:21.730 --> 02:07:22.730]  And then the next three albums
[02:07:22.730 --> 02:07:24.730]  were all about the New World Order.
[02:07:24.730 --> 02:07:26.730]  And Dave called me a few times.
[02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:27.730]  I played phone tag with him.
[02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:28.730]  I just,
[02:07:28.730 --> 02:07:29.730]  I've gotten where
[02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:30.730]  I don't even talk to anybody anymore.
[02:07:30.730 --> 02:07:31.730]  I'm not name dropping.
[02:07:31.730 --> 02:07:32.730]  It's just,
[02:07:32.730 --> 02:07:33.730]  it's just fun to like realize
[02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:35.730]  I was like 12 years old
[02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:37.730]  listening to Kill Em All.
[02:07:37.730 --> 02:07:39.730]  That was my favorite album.
[02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:41.730]  And then to know that when the time came
[02:07:41.730 --> 02:07:43.730]  and I could write the next Kill Em All,
[02:07:43.730 --> 02:07:44.730]  I just said,
[02:07:44.730 --> 02:07:45.730]  you know,
[02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:46.730]  I took it like a flattery.
[02:07:46.730 --> 02:07:47.730]  Like,
[02:07:47.730 --> 02:07:48.730]  oh yeah,
[02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:49.730]  right Dave,
[02:07:49.730 --> 02:07:50.730]  you want me to,
[02:07:50.730 --> 02:07:51.730]  you want me to write the next few albums?
[02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.730]  Sure,
[02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:53.730]  sure,
[02:07:53.730 --> 02:07:54.730]  right.
[02:07:54.730 --> 02:07:55.730]  That he did actually write them off the show.
[02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:56.730]  So we love you Dave Mustaine,
[02:07:56.730 --> 02:07:57.730]  great guy.
[02:07:57.730 --> 02:07:59.730]  But getting back to Tucker Carlson,
[02:07:59.730 --> 02:08:00.730]  we also love,
[02:08:00.730 --> 02:08:02.730]  even more I have to say,
[02:08:02.730 --> 02:08:03.730]  I just,
[02:08:03.730 --> 02:08:04.730]  I love Tucker Carlson.
[02:08:04.730 --> 02:08:05.730]  He's totally real.
[02:08:05.730 --> 02:08:06.730]  Here he is making the key point
[02:08:06.730 --> 02:08:07.730]  at the end of his monologue.
[02:08:07.730 --> 02:08:08.730]  Because I've forgotten this.
[02:08:08.730 --> 02:08:09.730]  When the Russians came,
[02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:10.730]  including Boris Yeltsin,
[02:08:10.730 --> 02:08:11.730]  I mean,
[02:08:11.730 --> 02:08:14.730]  he was like deputy head of the Russian government
[02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:15.730]  for decades,
[02:08:15.730 --> 02:08:17.730]  but he'd never been to an American grocery store.
[02:08:17.730 --> 02:08:19.730]  And when he finally came here,
[02:08:20.730 --> 02:08:21.730]  and saw everything,
[02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:22.730]  he went,
[02:08:22.730 --> 02:08:23.730]  okay,
[02:08:23.730 --> 02:08:24.730]  I,
[02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:25.730]  I,
[02:08:25.730 --> 02:08:26.730]  I'm done with communism.
[02:08:26.730 --> 02:08:27.730]  I got to go.
[02:08:27.730 --> 02:08:28.730]  We got to have this.
[02:08:28.730 --> 02:08:29.730]  Uh,
[02:08:29.730 --> 02:08:30.730]  did you remember the Russians were like poor farmers folks
[02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:31.730]  that,
[02:08:31.730 --> 02:08:32.730]  you know,
[02:08:32.730 --> 02:08:33.730]  had been enslaved by the czar
[02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:34.730]  and enslaved by Lenin.
[02:08:34.730 --> 02:08:35.730]  And,
[02:08:35.730 --> 02:08:36.730]  and,
[02:08:36.730 --> 02:08:37.730]  and then they fought Hitler
[02:08:37.730 --> 02:08:38.730]  and lost a third of their population.
[02:08:38.730 --> 02:08:39.730]  I mean,
[02:08:39.730 --> 02:08:40.730]  I mean,
[02:08:40.730 --> 02:08:41.730]  you're,
[02:08:41.730 --> 02:08:42.730]  you're on a farm and now communists are putting in slave camps
[02:08:42.730 --> 02:08:43.730]  and now you're fighting Hitler.
[02:08:43.730 --> 02:08:44.730]  I mean,
[02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:45.730]  imagine the Russians are like,
[02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:46.730]  what the hell is this?
[02:08:46.730 --> 02:08:47.730]  Now they're fighting America again.
[02:08:47.730 --> 02:08:48.730]  They're like,
[02:08:48.730 --> 02:08:49.730]  what the hell is going on?
[02:08:49.730 --> 02:08:50.730]  So.
[02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:53.350]  And they're just like us.
[02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:56.350]  Once you got them in school and gave them physics, they're like super smart.
[02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:58.350]  They know how to make nuclear weapons and spaceships.
[02:08:58.350 --> 02:09:01.350]  But it's just how he describes this.
[02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:04.350]  But I love how – because I've asked the crew to do this for years.
[02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:06.350]  I love them to death, but they never kind of got what I was saying.
[02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:08.350]  I said I want Red Dawn intros.
[02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:10.350]  We're behind enemy lines.
[02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:14.350]  Shortwave radio, forbidden transmission because that's what this show really is.
[02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:16.350]  We're occupied by the New World Order.
[02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:18.350]  And they did a few promos.
[02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:20.350]  They're like the chairs against the wall.
[02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:22.350]  John has a long mustache.
[02:09:22.350 --> 02:09:23.350]  Star Spangled Banner.
[02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:24.350]  Here's Alex Jones.
[02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:30.350]  But Tucker's branding his show as the shortwave transmission into Russia from Voice of America.
[02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:35.950]  That his dad ran.
[02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:39.390]  And the whole program there with the secret FM transmitters into the Soviet bloc that
[02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:40.390]  his dad did.
[02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:41.390]  His dad's still alive.
[02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:44.390]  Did you know his dad helped bring down the Soviet Union?
[02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:50.830]  And then when Tucker went and tried to join the CIA they said, no, we don't have any nepotism
[02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:51.830]  around here.
[02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:52.830]  And he goes, well, it's not nepotism.
[02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:53.830]  Oh, really?
[02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:54.830]  It's not nepotism?
[02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:55.830]  You don't know who your dad is?
[02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:57.190]  Well, no, I didn't know who my dad was.
[02:09:57.190 --> 02:10:00.150]  But the point is, he was a Cold Warrior and helped bring down the Soviet Union.
[02:10:00.150 --> 02:10:03.350]  And Tucker's like, learning from the CIA, yeah, we don't hire people's kids around here.
[02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:04.950]  Well, my dad works for Voice of America.
[02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:05.950]  He runs it.
[02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:06.950]  Oh, yeah.
[02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:08.390]  Yeah, your dad works for Voice of America, kid.
[02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:09.390]  Sure, he does.
[02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:14.150]  But he had all that natural talent they couldn't suppress him, so see where he is now.
[02:10:14.150 --> 02:10:18.910]  As a free agent of liberty, kicking the CIA's ass, that's become what they claim we were
[02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:19.910]  fighting in Russia.
[02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:23.350]  So here's the conclusion of what Tucker Carlson just said.
[02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:27.110]  When Western tourists first started traveling in large numbers to the Soviet Union in the
[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:31.830]  early 1970s, they found that many Russians had a completely warped understanding of the
[02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:33.350]  United States.
[02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:38.670]  They thought that Americans lived in grinding poverty in a state of perpetual race war
[02:10:38.670 --> 02:10:42.710]  and were desperate to flee to the freedom and prosperity of the Eastern Bloc.
[02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:45.230]  They thought this because that's what they had been told.
[02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:47.710]  They had no way to know otherwise.
[02:10:47.710 --> 02:10:51.510]  The few Russians who understood what was really going on in the rest of the world had learned
[02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:55.710]  about it from listening to shortwave radio broadcasts, sometimes under the cover so the
[02:10:55.710 --> 02:10:57.750]  neighbors wouldn't hear.
[02:10:57.750 --> 02:11:01.590]  Fifty years later, it is bewildering to consider the ironies here.
[02:11:01.590 --> 02:11:04.550]  We're the ones who live in ignorance now.
[02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:09.870]  The U.S. government has managed to classify more than a billion so-called public documents.
[02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:12.470]  So at this point, we can't possibly know what our leaders are doing.
[02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:14.230]  We're not allowed to know.
[02:11:14.230 --> 02:11:16.750]  By definition, that is not a democracy.
[02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:19.350]  Yet it's fine with the media.
[02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:22.790]  Secrecy is a powerful tool of control.
[02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:24.350]  Stop asking how we got so rich.
[02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:25.750]  Here's another story about racism.
[02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:27.470]  Go eat each other.
[02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:28.630]  That's the program.
[02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:33.870]  That's how most of us now live here in the United States, manipulated by lies, silenced
[02:11:33.870 --> 02:11:35.750]  by taboos.
[02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:39.750]  It is unhealthy and it's dehumanizing, and we're tired of it.
[02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:42.950]  As of today, we've come to Twitter, which we hope will be the shortwave radio under
[02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:43.950]  the blankets.
[02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:46.310]  We're told there are no gatekeepers here.
[02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:48.590]  If that turns out to be false, we'll leave.
[02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:50.670]  But in the meantime, we are grateful to be here.
[02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:52.990]  We'll be back with much more very soon.
[02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:58.950]  And that's what he's doing up in Maine.
[02:11:58.950 --> 02:12:02.990]  I cannot wait to go up to his house and fly fish with him in Fesenheim.
[02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:07.470]  That's going to be the big, the big event of my summer, which is the summer is kind
[02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:08.470]  of getting going here.
[02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:09.470]  I need to get that set up.
[02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:12.670]  But anyways, back to what I was saying, ladies and gentlemen, out of the park.
[02:12:12.670 --> 02:12:17.510]  So I was going to say like, yeah, Tucker's plagiarizing your show on shortwave and you're
[02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:19.590]  the, you know, rebel broadcast.
[02:12:19.590 --> 02:12:21.390]  No, there's there's no plagiarizing.
[02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:25.110]  His dad ran the shortwave into Russia to do that.
[02:12:25.110 --> 02:12:29.150]  And the FM transmitters and whole secret projects bring down the Soviet Union.
[02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:31.430]  So we're sitting there saying, oh, Turner Carlson's copying Alex Jones.
[02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:32.670]  There is no copying.
[02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:35.350]  It's all one big continuum of us on the same team.
[02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:40.190]  We all inspire each other, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:40.190 --> 02:12:44.170]  And my family was fighting the Russians in Eastern Europe.
[02:12:44.170 --> 02:12:49.710]  But the bigger issue is now notice the demoralization, the race war, all the things you hear about,
[02:12:49.710 --> 02:12:54.190]  all the things you see, that's the left saying America is a big race war and America is a
[02:12:54.190 --> 02:12:55.190]  bunch of drug addicts.
[02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:58.910]  And American cities look like the blue cities because they want the world to think we're
[02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:59.910]  bad.
[02:12:59.910 --> 02:13:04.630]  So there's no hope because the propaganda that the Russians were running was being run
[02:13:04.630 --> 02:13:08.150]  out of the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment.
[02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:12.510]  The Soviet Union was run by the West and British intelligence.
[02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:15.950]  And now people are waking up to that understanding.
[02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:21.910]  It's the same cult, the same program, the same evil, and we're all rejecting it together.
[02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:22.910]  And it's beautiful.
[02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:27.190]  Please remember, I can't finance this operation without your help, and I really need your
[02:13:27.190 --> 02:13:28.190]  help.

[02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:41.750]  it's running out, 25% off.

[02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:49.030]  And yeah, we're almost sold out of the Trump political prisoner mugshot shirt.
[02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:51.790]  When it's gone, it's gone, and we're down to a couple hundred.
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:55.710]  It'll be gone in a couple days of the Alex Jones for president.
[02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:56.710]  We're like, we're going to reprint that.
[02:13:56.710 --> 02:13:59.190]  And I said, no, I told him it's a one run and it's gone.
[02:13:59.190 --> 02:14:04.990]  So you want Alex Jones for president, you want Trump mugshot, it's all at infowarestore.com
[02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.990]  or 888-253-3139.
[02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:11.230]  All right, I'm going to get in my car, I'm going to drive from Dallas to Austin, and
[02:14:11.230 --> 02:14:14.590]  word willing, I'll be on 11 a.m. tomorrow, full, I'll probably be four hours tomorrow
[02:14:14.590 --> 02:14:15.590]  here.
[02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:18.390]  But Owen Troyer's loaded for bear, ton of other big news to cover.
[02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:22.150]  He takes over now from our Austin, Texas command center.
[02:14:22.150 --> 02:14:23.550]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:27.790]  And Alex will be right here in this seat tomorrow, as he just said.
[02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:33.230]  Now I do want to hear from the audience, actually, in response to Tucker Carlson's, we'll call
[02:14:33.230 --> 02:14:36.070]  it show, he did call it Tucker on Twitter episode one.
[02:14:36.070 --> 02:14:40.230]  I don't know if that's his permanent plan, but Tucker on Twitter episode one, it's got
[02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:48.510]  nearly 100 million views on Twitter since he launched it less than 24 hours ago, and
[02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:58.430]  the Democrats in the media and the American left in general are absolutely panicked.
[02:14:58.430 --> 02:15:03.490]  They don't know what to do, they're pulling their hair out of their head, and it's a similar
[02:15:03.490 --> 02:15:09.170]  thing to how upset they are that InfoWars is still on the air because they thought they
[02:15:09.170 --> 02:15:12.930]  would silence us, they thought they would destroy us, we're not supposed to be here.
[02:15:12.930 --> 02:15:15.010]  Same with Tucker.
[02:15:15.010 --> 02:15:19.370]  They thought they destroyed Tucker, they thought Tucker was off the air, they got him, but
[02:15:19.370 --> 02:15:24.250]  he's back on Twitter, more popular than ever, so massive coping on that deal.
[02:15:24.250 --> 02:15:27.330]  But I want to take your calls on this.
[02:15:27.330 --> 02:15:29.650]  Do you buy this alien story?
[02:15:29.650 --> 02:15:33.210]  Do you buy this whistleblower saying that the US government has alien technology or
[02:15:33.210 --> 02:15:36.730]  even some non-human life form body parts?
[02:15:36.730 --> 02:15:40.370]  Do you believe any of that?
[02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:42.930]  Or do you think it's a distraction?
[02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:45.250]  Or is there another angle, is there another twist?
[02:15:45.250 --> 02:15:54.370]  I'll give you my two cents and take your calls, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.

[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:25.000]  Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.960]  want it. Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:36.800]  got you covered. Absolutely, and we couldn't do any of this without listener
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:41.760]  support. I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of The

[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:08.119]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is.
[02:17:08.119 --> 02:17:13.880]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:17.119]  better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is
[02:17:17.119 --> 02:17:22.520]  liquid energy. Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. Krill oils
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:26.039]  is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry. You want
[02:17:26.039 --> 02:17:29.720]  something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:32.520]  so good, in my view. I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:36.320]  you something. I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:45.880]  Santa Claus that night. So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:49.960]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:58.320]  whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:03.200]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down, and please go
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:07.960]  look this up. It will change your life. The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:12.080]  Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.440]  and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:23.200]  because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:29.000]  elements, so your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.920]  right into the cells, and InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:38.960]  actually has this type of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:43.200]  out for six months. It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:47.240]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad. This, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:53.640]  is powerful. You and your family need it. It's 25% off back in stock. X3 triiodine
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:58.320]  exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com. Take action now, but regardless, research is
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:04.440]  info. Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:10.360]  they've got our children drinking that. This is a psychotic death cult, period,
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.960]  case closed, out to get you and your family. We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:19.400]  made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group. It's been around about 15 years,
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:22.520]  became the biggest company in the last six. They went out, hired engineers,
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:26.280]  reverse-engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:31.760]  twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies. It reduces things to
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:35.000]  non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go paint two or
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.960]  three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:42.400]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.480]  price to leading competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:50.760]  telling you you should filter your water. You should also filter your shower water.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:54.039]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that. The
[02:19:54.039 --> 02:19:57.280]  point is, you can get the filters at InfoWarsTore.com. They're discounted right
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:03.000]  now. Finally back in stock. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:07.440]  World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:28.400]  So you've got a Pentagon, I guess, government whistleblower. They're calling
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:35.000]  it on UFOs, extraterrestrial life, unidentified flying objects, saying the
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:40.400]  U.S. government has this information and is keeping it secret, keeping it
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:49.280]  classified, even away from Congress. Now here's the, no matter what you think
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:56.480]  about UFOs or aliens, and we'll have that debate on the phone lines here when we
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:06.000]  go to it in a second, already filled. None of this information is new. There are
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.440]  probably more than 50 documentaries with so-called government whistleblowers
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:18.760]  and other agents and scientists and astronomers, farmers, all kinds of stuff
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:28.080]  out there about aliens, extraterrestrials, and UFOs. There was some park, I don't
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:30.760]  know if it's still there, it was either Connecticut or somewhere on the East
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:37.720]  Coast, where there was such a widespread aerial phenomenon, UFO event, that they
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:44.200]  built a monument because there were like 250 eyewitnesses to an alien
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:47.000]  spacecraft in the sky. They built a monument. I forget where it was. They may
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.480]  have actually taken it down since. So some government whistleblower coming out
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:54.960]  and saying, oh the government has aliens and UFO technology and they've recovered
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:59.800]  this and they're keeping it secret. There's nothing new there. What's new is
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:03.800]  now it's all of a sudden a media phenomenon. What's new is now all of a
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:09.560]  sudden we're supposed to believe it. How many government whistleblowers, insiders
[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:14.600]  have come out in the last 50 years about aliens? I couldn't even tell you. There's
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:19.160]  probably more than a hundred. All kinds of documentaries, all over the Internet,
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:25.200]  all over TV. So why now is this the story? Why now are they wanting us
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:30.160]  to talk about UFOs and alien life? Why now is it in the media? Why now is a
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:34.840]  government whistleblower making mainstream news and headlines? Is it
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:39.280]  because, is this an organic thing? Because the Internet, the alternative
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:43.800]  information sources are starting to take over and not just the TV? Is this a
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:48.160]  paradigm shift where if something big breaks on the Internet but not TV, that
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:52.640]  it still breaks? Or is something else going on? Do they want us talking about
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:59.200]  aliens and UFOs, distracted with that, when they've got whatever going on in
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:05.480]  Ukraine? They've got the Biden crime family getting exposed and the FBI
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:13.880]  worried that their informants are going to get killed if they're unmasked. So why
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:20.560]  is the alien whistleblower cover up the story now, when this information has been
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:27.880]  out for 50 years? And whistleblowers and documentaries and everything. Why is it
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:31.960]  the story now? So is this a paradigm shift that the Internet is now the
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:40.600]  source for the narrative and information? Or is this a distraction campaign to get
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:47.320]  you talking about it and not talking about the real stuff going on? Now let's
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:54.240]  let's say that this is real and the government has some quote-unquote alien
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:24:03.520]  technology or or even alien life form as they might claim. There is so much that
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:09.760]  we don't know about our own history. There's so much we don't know about
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:14.600]  ancient civilizations and their technology. You don't get taught this in
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:21.240]  the government schools. They don't want you to know about the megaliths. They
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:24.560]  don't want you to know about the pyramids. Oh yeah, they tell you about the
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:31.800]  pyramids but they don't tell you that the ancient secrets. So there's already
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:38.119]  ancient technology that we can't comprehend or understand. They could
[02:24:39.039 --> 02:24:46.600]  claim they've recovered some ancient tools that some ancient technology and
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:52.520]  just say oh this is alien we don't know what it is. So again why are they
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:57.760]  telling us about this now? Since when does the US government and the mainstream
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.920]  media want us questioning how we got here or what it's all about or secret
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.520]  history of humanity and civilization or other life forms? Why do they want us
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:11.480]  talking about it now? We're supposed to discount this stuff. This is supposed to
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:16.800]  be conspiracy theory stuff. Nobody takes this stuff seriously. Why now?
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:23.119]  Paradigm Shift distraction campaign? Or are we getting ready to see the
[02:25:23.119 --> 02:25:29.280]  Operation Blue Beam fully revealed? Which I guess would be the alternative that's
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:36.119]  the psyop. That's the distraction and Operation Blue Beam being basically a
[02:25:36.119 --> 02:25:45.760]  false flag alien event. Either holograms in the sky or they could release some
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:49.480]  human-animal hybrid out in the wild and you know they say oh look it's an alien.
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:56.200]  Some UFO or technology that we don't know about they just reveal and say it's
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:02.640]  alien. Some combination all of the above. Maybe they start using secret weapons
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:05.800]  that we don't know about and then just claim it's aliens. There's all kinds of
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:11.560]  certain outcomes that could come from this. So that's just my takeaway from the
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:17.800]  whole whistleblower alien reveal which has been out there for years but now all
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:21.240]  of a sudden we're talking about it. Is that by design for distraction or is
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:25.320]  this a paradigm shift that now the television doesn't control what's
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:30.240]  relevant what's a human interest story. So we go out to the phone lines now and
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.880]  we start with Tad in Washington. Tad you're on the Alex Jones Show. Go ahead.
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:40.200]  Hey what's up Owen. I love the products that you guys sell. I've bought
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:46.840]  plenty of them. Okay well first I want to start off with the experience I had.
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:53.480]  Me and my mother was in Salt Lake City and we were I had a storage shed and we
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:27:00.039]  left the storage shed and it's along the track. Now I was driving up the track
[02:27:00.039 --> 02:27:05.640]  well next to the track going northbound and I saw what I thought was a big
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:11.320]  giant billboard sign lit up white really bright white and all sudden it
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.920]  got closer just boom right down a railroad track. It was about maybe 20
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:22.240]  feet off the ground and it was shaped like two pyramids put together from the
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.880]  bottom on each side if that makes any sense kind of like a diamond. And I
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:31.160]  looked over at my mother and I said did you see what I just saw she said she
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:37.920]  saw a city up in the sky. Okay and then and then back in 2014 I had experience
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.320]  with a some sort of creature in my room that was beaming its red eyes into me
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:48.880]  wide up when I was asleep I woke up and saw it. You know I couldn't describe this
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:55.640]  creature it was a fallen angel. Okay now I'll tell you what these spaceships are
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.960]  they're they're either fallen angels or they're angels. You gotta remember fallen
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:06.200]  angels or extra extraterrestrials they're not of this world. A lot of these
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:09.800]  experiences that people are having they're either fallen angels or
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:16.840]  extraterrestrials. Now you take a look at Ezekiel's will if you've ever read the
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:22.360]  book of Enoch you know the fallen angels actually came down here and taught men
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:32.640]  how to do everything. War, makeup, witchcraft. Well this is this is in ancient hieroglyphs
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:39.200]  and other discoveries they've made where they're seemingly basically scraping
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.039]  UFOs into the sides of caves and giant beings into the sides of caves and they
[02:28:44.039 --> 02:28:52.320]  find caskets built for 13-14 feet foot men. Wow Tad quite a call there. This
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:57.560]  subject is hot and so are the phone lines. We'll be right back.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:02.039]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce? Yeah yeah so my name is Ken
[02:29:02.039 --> 02:29:06.240]  Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with Dr. Judy
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:09.960]  Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers and now two books
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.800]  with Alex Jones. That's because I use RainForce every day. What I always need
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.960]  is I always need some sort of boost in the morning and so you know I try to
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:24.840]  exercise, eat well, take good vitamins but the one thing that I have really found
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:30.160]  that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce in the morning
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.200]  right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:38.880]  writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is true that RainForce is
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:42.880]  something I use every day and it helps me with my writing. All right we love you.
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:46.680]  We'll be right back. Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra and TurboForce
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:51.640]  at InfowarStore.com. We'll be right back with our number two.
[02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:03.480]  In the early 1900s certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:07.600]  gases into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:13.360]  sick. Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:18.800]  convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid. Still highly toxic but containable.
[02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:23.480]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:28.320]  way to dispose of it. Lucky for them one of their major stockholders was also the
[02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:31.840]  Secretary of the Treasury who was responsible for the Public Health
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:37.360]  Service at the time. And by 1950 the US government began buying this toxic
[02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:41.800]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:47.680]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease. With
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.440]  the Alexa Pure Pro you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:31:00.320]  madness. Available now at InfowarStore.com. TurboForce is back. Sold out for
[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:05.880]  eight months and it's TurboForce Plus. We made it even stronger. The strongest
[02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:10.840]  long-term energy you're gonna find anywhere. TurboForce is back in stock at

[02:31:40.119 --> 02:31:42.860]  RainForce Ultra is great. They're two different nootropics. They go good with
[02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:47.440]  this. But this is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:53.240]  TurboForce. Back in stock. Discounted. InfowarStore.com. More power. More
[02:31:53.240 --> 02:31:56.640]  strength. More energy.
[02:31:57.039 --> 02:32:01.920]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:05.320]  because they knew that that would help Trump. Didn't they know this would
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:09.360]  backfire? We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it so
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:15.039]  we've made our own. And it says political prisoner with an image of President
[02:32:15.039 --> 02:32:19.640]  Trump. The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It'll be shipping out to you in one
[02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:25.760]  week. Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail
[02:32:25.880 --> 02:32:31.400]  background. It's a fundraiser shirt. It says Infowars.com on the back of the
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:34.119]  shirt. We also have Alex Jones for President. No, I'm not running for
[02:32:34.119 --> 02:32:37.720]  President. It's a really nice navy blue high-quality shirt. Red, white, and blue.

[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:46.520]  edition shirt. Great way to fund the operation. So get your Alex Jones for
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:52.960]  President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarStore.com or by calling

[02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.690 --> 02:33:17.490]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:17.490 --> 02:33:20.490]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:20.490 --> 02:33:33.890]  I don't know, you see what the Democrats, the left is doing to the planet, maybe you're
[02:33:33.890 --> 02:33:50.690]  looking up to the sky today and saying, beam me up, beam me up, do you guys do the gay
[02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:54.970]  crap up there?
[02:33:54.970 --> 02:34:04.530]  Are you guys chopping off your children's genitals up there?
[02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:11.970]  You guys have an injustice system up there, politically targeting opposition to the regime?
[02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:14.730]  You guys have the flags up there, can you, no?
[02:34:14.730 --> 02:34:17.290]  Go ahead and beam me up, I'll take one.
[02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:18.290]  One beam up.
[02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:22.290]  No, one way, just one way.
[02:34:23.290 --> 02:34:32.290]  The last caller said he had an alien experience, or fallen angel, or angel experience, as he claimed.
[02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:35.290]  Let's see how Joe in New Mexico can compare to that.
[02:34:35.290 --> 02:34:36.290]  We're talking aliens here.
[02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:39.290]  Do you buy this government whistleblower story?
[02:34:39.290 --> 02:34:40.290]  Do you think it's a distraction?
[02:34:40.290 --> 02:34:43.290]  Why are they telling us this now, when we've known it for years?
[02:34:43.290 --> 02:34:45.290]  Joe in New Mexico, go ahead.
[02:34:45.290 --> 02:34:51.290]  Yeah, I think it's a distraction, because when people see that on TV, they'll be hesitant
[02:34:52.290 --> 02:34:55.290]  to go do more research.
[02:34:55.290 --> 02:35:02.290]  They might run into the William Cooper's testimony, stuff like that, where it's been around for
[02:35:02.290 --> 02:35:08.290]  a while that these type of things have been happening, so it's kind of funny that it's
[02:35:08.290 --> 02:35:13.290]  being put out there by the news.
[02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:18.290]  Yeah, that's, I can't, I mean, I'm a little, because I don't want to be a total pessimist.
[02:35:18.290 --> 02:35:20.290]  I don't want to be an absolute pessimist here.
[02:35:20.290 --> 02:35:22.290]  Maybe this is just a paradigm shift.
[02:35:22.290 --> 02:35:28.290]  Maybe now you can break the narrative on the internet, and the TV is completely irrelevant.
[02:35:28.290 --> 02:35:30.290]  Maybe Tucker Carlson is proving that.
[02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:32.290]  So maybe it's genuine.
[02:35:32.290 --> 02:35:35.290]  Maybe this is another government whistleblower saying, hey, they've got secret technology
[02:35:35.290 --> 02:35:38.290]  and stuff they're not telling us about.
[02:35:38.290 --> 02:35:42.290]  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to believe anything they put on the news nowadays, so you've just
[02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:43.290]  got to take it with a grain of salt.
[02:35:43.290 --> 02:35:47.290]  I will say I had a short experience in Colorado.
[02:35:47.290 --> 02:35:48.290]  Plenty of people were there.
[02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:49.290]  It was the 4th of July.
[02:35:49.290 --> 02:35:58.290]  We were at a high school stadium outside to witness fireworks, and completely obliterated
[02:35:58.290 --> 02:36:00.290]  by the alien show that was going on.
[02:36:00.290 --> 02:36:02.290]  I mean, I'm an ex-Air Force guy.
[02:36:02.290 --> 02:36:08.290]  I've been in Afghanistan, and what was being displayed that night was unexplainable.
[02:36:08.290 --> 02:36:13.290]  And, I mean, definitely there's some stuff going on that we don't know about, and maybe
[02:36:13.290 --> 02:36:16.290]  they don't want us to wake up and tap into that energy, you know?
[02:36:17.290 --> 02:36:20.290]  This is a crazy time to be alive, that's all I can say.
[02:36:20.290 --> 02:36:22.290]  Well, no doubt.
[02:36:22.290 --> 02:36:23.290]  Thanks for the call, Joe.
[02:36:23.290 --> 02:36:28.290]  This is part of what the whole stop man-made climate change is all about.
[02:36:28.290 --> 02:36:33.290]  It's that you don't get access to cheap energy.
[02:36:35.290 --> 02:36:41.290]  You see, the individuals that think they own this planet that want to spray you like a
[02:36:42.290 --> 02:36:49.290]  cockroach to eliminate you, like you might have an exterminator come to your house and
[02:36:49.290 --> 02:36:56.290]  spray around to kill cockroaches, that's the globalists on planet Earth spraying to get
[02:36:56.290 --> 02:36:58.290]  rid of you.
[02:36:58.290 --> 02:37:01.290]  So they don't want you to have access to energy.
[02:37:03.290 --> 02:37:10.290]  So if there is different technology or different energy sources out there that the U.S.
[02:37:10.290 --> 02:37:14.290]  government knows about, they certainly can't let the people get their hands on that.
[02:37:14.290 --> 02:37:17.290]  That would just be unacceptable.
[02:37:17.290 --> 02:37:20.290]  That would empower the slaves.
[02:37:20.290 --> 02:37:23.290]  That would free the slave class.
[02:37:23.290 --> 02:37:25.290]  Can't have that now, can we?
[02:37:25.290 --> 02:37:27.290]  Let's go to Laura in Illinois.
[02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:29.290]  Laura, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:29.290 --> 02:37:30.290]  Go ahead.
[02:37:30.290 --> 02:37:31.290]  Oh, hey, Owen.
[02:37:31.290 --> 02:37:32.290]  Your show is awesome.
[02:37:32.290 --> 02:37:38.290]  I'm jealous that the last two callers got to see alien aircraft because I never have.
[02:37:38.290 --> 02:37:42.290]  But I do agree with you stating that this is just another distraction.
[02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:45.290]  We've known about this for a million years.
[02:37:45.290 --> 02:37:53.290]  And also about the ancient civilizations just utilizing their technology.
[02:37:53.290 --> 02:38:01.290]  For example, even Hitler sent his SS men down to the Black Forest and recovered a craft
[02:38:01.290 --> 02:38:02.290]  and he brought it back.
[02:38:02.290 --> 02:38:05.290]  He had his engineers reverse engineer it.
[02:38:05.290 --> 02:38:11.290]  And he brought in Indian engineers because it was in Sanskrit.
[02:38:11.290 --> 02:38:16.290]  And he had them reverse engineer it to something he called the Glock.
[02:38:16.290 --> 02:38:18.290]  And it was the bell.
[02:38:18.290 --> 02:38:20.290]  And it was a hovering device.
[02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:24.290]  And after World War II, as you know, they brought those engineers here.
[02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:27.290]  So I do know that the technology is there.
[02:38:28.290 --> 02:38:34.290]  And I don't think it's anything new, like you said, when they have these little alien invasions.
[02:38:34.290 --> 02:38:42.290]  And I do believe these ancient civilization aliens have a stake in this world because they use those points for fuel.
[02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:49.290]  So I don't think they're going to really appreciate us destroying their planet for their fuel points.
[02:38:49.290 --> 02:38:52.290]  You know, they come and go.
[02:38:52.290 --> 02:38:53.290]  Interesting, Laura.
[02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:54.290]  Anything else?
[02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:55.290]  No, you're awesome.
[02:38:55.290 --> 02:38:57.290]  I like when you're going down the street with your bullhorn.
[02:38:57.290 --> 02:38:58.290]  I was in the Army, man.
[02:38:58.290 --> 02:39:01.290]  I would love to be on that tank, but I'm like 55.
[02:39:01.290 --> 02:39:05.290]  But I would love to just blow those people away with my little bullhorn.
[02:39:05.290 --> 02:39:07.290]  You keep going, Owen.
[02:39:07.290 --> 02:39:08.290]  Thank you, Laura.
[02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:10.290]  Let's go to Nick.
[02:39:10.290 --> 02:39:16.290]  By the way, maybe we should, on Laura's request, maybe we should get dust off the truck sometime soon.
[02:39:16.290 --> 02:39:17.290]  All right, Nick in Pennsylvania.
[02:39:17.290 --> 02:39:18.290]  You're on the air.
[02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:19.290]  Go ahead.
[02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:20.290]  Hey, Owen.
[02:39:20.290 --> 02:39:25.290]  You guys are really actually the commando team out there, but I know my time is short.
[02:39:25.290 --> 02:39:28.290]  But I think there's two things happening at one time.
[02:39:28.290 --> 02:39:30.290]  You have the, yeah, the World War II, the Foo Fighters.
[02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:32.290]  You guys all been getting into it.
[02:39:32.290 --> 02:39:36.290]  Alex promised a crazy show coming, and he really did.
[02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:40.290]  Everybody's got to go back and listen to that.
[02:39:40.290 --> 02:39:47.290]  Anyway, I think a lot of this stuff is, yeah, it's used for a distraction.
[02:39:47.290 --> 02:39:52.290]  But there are also, I think there are things that are coming through other dimensions and appearing.
[02:39:52.290 --> 02:39:55.290]  They might be angels trying to help us out.
[02:39:55.290 --> 02:39:58.290]  You might sometimes get a bad spirit coming through these other dimensions.
[02:39:58.290 --> 02:40:00.290]  Man, I mean, it gets weird.
[02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:02.290]  We're really not in Kansas anymore.
[02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:03.290]  Let's think about that.
[02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:04.290]  Let's think about that.
[02:40:04.290 --> 02:40:11.290]  You know, the Bible talks about God sending plagues and other such interventions.
[02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:18.290]  You had a church that celebrates pride and trans kids get struck by lightning and burn to the ground.
[02:40:18.290 --> 02:40:19.290]  Over 150-year-old church.
[02:40:19.290 --> 02:40:21.290]  I think it was like 180.
[02:40:21.290 --> 02:40:26.290]  You have what's going on in New York today because of the wildfires in Canada.
[02:40:26.290 --> 02:40:28.290]  I don't believe they know what started them.
[02:40:28.290 --> 02:40:30.290]  Could have been lightning.
[02:40:30.290 --> 02:40:31.290]  Could have been a cigarette butt.
[02:40:31.290 --> 02:40:32.290]  Who knows?
[02:40:32.290 --> 02:40:35.290]  Of course, they're saying global warming, give us more money.
[02:40:35.290 --> 02:40:40.290]  But New York is now in a dust cloud.
[02:40:40.290 --> 02:40:43.290]  I mean, it's apocalyptic, the scenes in New York.
[02:40:43.290 --> 02:40:45.290]  Is this all a sign?
[02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:49.290]  Is this like biblical level signs from above, let's say?
[02:40:49.290 --> 02:40:51.290]  Or is it just coincidence?
[02:40:51.290 --> 02:40:53.290]  I think it's both.
[02:40:53.290 --> 02:40:57.290]  I mean, again, it's just like you're getting weird signs.
[02:40:57.290 --> 02:41:02.290]  I mean, it's really hard to discern a lot of this stuff coming at us a million miles a minute.
[02:41:02.290 --> 02:41:07.290]  But the smoke is like I think we can't forget about the weather modification.
[02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:10.290]  I mean, we've got to stop thinking about the individuals.
[02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:15.290]  You mean the exterminators spraying us with chemicals to kill us?
[02:41:15.290 --> 02:41:19.290]  We should stop calling it weather modification, and we should start saying, no, no, no,
[02:41:19.290 --> 02:41:24.290]  this is the exterminators spraying to kill us, the cockroaches here.
[02:41:24.290 --> 02:41:28.290]  You are in Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' house, damn it.
[02:41:28.290 --> 02:41:30.290]  You're on their rock floating through space.
[02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:33.290]  They've got to spray you to kill you, damn it.
[02:41:33.290 --> 02:41:34.290]  It's not working.
[02:41:34.290 --> 02:41:35.290]  So it's not working.
[02:41:35.290 --> 02:41:36.290]  It's not working.
[02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:38.290]  So just chop your kids' balls off.
[02:41:38.290 --> 02:41:41.290]  Yeah, I mean, like, yeah, they think they're God, man.
[02:41:41.290 --> 02:41:44.290]  They think they're God over man, and that's the ultimate sin.
[02:41:44.290 --> 02:41:46.290]  It's all in Revelation.
[02:41:46.290 --> 02:41:48.290]  I think we're living through the apocalypse.
[02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:52.290]  I think the Antichrist, I mean, I can explain a lot of this stuff in detail, but I know the time is short.
[02:41:52.290 --> 02:41:55.290]  But we're definitely, I mean, we've got the playbook.
[02:41:55.290 --> 02:41:56.290]  That's good.
[02:41:56.290 --> 02:41:58.290]  We got each other, and that's it.
[02:41:58.290 --> 02:42:02.290]  We're going to have to keep traveling through wait to see what happens.
[02:42:02.290 --> 02:42:07.290]  They're definitely going to try to use this thing for blue books, that kind of stuff.
[02:42:07.290 --> 02:42:13.290]  Yeah, I mean, the intelligence agencies really think they have the crown of the whole country.
[02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:14.290]  There's no king.
[02:42:14.290 --> 02:42:15.290]  They think they're the king.
[02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:20.290]  You know, I mean, it happened in the Roman Empire, the beast, which was the Roman Empire, the state.
[02:42:20.290 --> 02:42:21.290]  I mean, it got taken over.
[02:42:21.290 --> 02:42:24.290]  And here's the realization, and Nick, thank you for the call.
[02:42:24.290 --> 02:42:31.290]  There's two levels here, the American people standing up and realizing their power given in the Bill of Rights
[02:42:31.290 --> 02:42:39.290]  and the Constitution, or, and really this is probably what needs to happen first,
[02:42:39.290 --> 02:42:44.290]  Congress needs to realize they have oversight and control over all these bureaucracies.
[02:42:44.290 --> 02:42:46.290]  So they can declassify everything.
[02:42:46.290 --> 02:42:51.290]  Congress can force all the government bureaucracies to declassify everything with subpoenas.
[02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:54.290]  Now, they might not respond, and then they get held in contempt of court.
[02:42:54.290 --> 02:42:56.290]  That's what we need to see.
[02:42:57.290 --> 02:43:00.290]  Sold out for more than a year.
[02:43:00.290 --> 02:43:07.290]  We now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular Tooth Whitening Coral Calcium Toothpaste
[02:43:07.290 --> 02:43:11.290]  full of essential oils back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:44:03.290 --> 02:44:06.290]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[02:44:06.290 --> 02:44:11.290]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[02:44:11.290 --> 02:44:14.290]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[02:44:14.290 --> 02:44:17.290]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:44:17.290 --> 02:44:21.290]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[02:44:46.290 --> 02:44:51.290]  and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset,

[02:44:55.290 --> 02:44:58.290]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[02:44:58.290 --> 02:45:05.290]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:45:05.290 --> 02:45:10.290]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[02:45:10.290 --> 02:45:14.290]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:45:14.290 --> 02:45:17.290]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:45:17.290 --> 02:45:20.290]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:25.290]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[02:45:25.290 --> 02:45:29.290]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:45:29.290 --> 02:45:34.290]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:45:34.290 --> 02:45:39.290]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:45.290]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:51.290]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:58.290]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:58.290 --> 02:46:03.290]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:07.290]  and take him off the air. People said, no way, he's the most powerful that ever happened.
[02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:09.290]  They got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:12.290]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:15.290]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:17.290]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[02:46:17.290 --> 02:46:21.290]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros,
[02:46:21.290 --> 02:46:23.290]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:46:23.290 --> 02:46:27.290]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:46:27.290 --> 02:46:29.290]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:46:29.290 --> 02:46:34.290]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:46:34.290 --> 02:46:37.290]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:40.290]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:43.290]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[02:46:43.290 --> 02:46:44.290]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:46:44.290 --> 02:46:47.290]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[02:46:47.290 --> 02:46:50.290]  while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:50.290 --> 02:46:51.290]  So don't procrastinate.
[02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:55.290]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air,
[02:46:55.290 --> 02:46:57.290]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[02:46:59.290 --> 02:47:03.290]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:47:03.290 --> 02:47:05.290]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:30.359]  All right, taking your calls.
[02:47:30.359 --> 02:47:35.640]  Oh, now we're to talk about UFOs and aliens.
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:41.759]  How convenient, as the Biden crime family is getting exposed, but the corrupt DOJ is going
[02:47:41.759 --> 02:47:44.080]  to indict Donald Trump.
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.480]  Yes, look over here at the aliens.
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:50.240]  Or is it the real deal?
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.519]  Is the narrative no longer controlled by the television news?
[02:47:53.519 --> 02:47:55.359]  Let's go to Alex in Florida.
[02:47:55.359 --> 02:47:56.800]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.800]  Go ahead.
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:47:58.800]  Hey, Owen.
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:47:59.800]  What's up?
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:00.880]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:04.519]  First and second, TurboForce, such a lifesaver.
[02:48:04.519 --> 02:48:07.039]  I literally depend on it every morning.
[02:48:07.039 --> 02:48:09.759]  It gets me up within five minutes consuming it.
[02:48:09.759 --> 02:48:14.039]  And for those who are lucky and wise enough and blessed enough to have vitamin mineral
[02:48:14.039 --> 02:48:20.199]  fusion, TurboForce and fizzy magnesium, I mix all of them together in the same drink
[02:48:20.199 --> 02:48:23.080]  and talk about just owning the day.
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.080]  It's incredible.
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:25.080]  It makes you feel great.
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:26.080]  You get all your nutrients.
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:28.480]  And honestly, thank you so much.
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:30.160]  That's quite the drink and talktion.
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:31.759]  Oh, it's amazing, man.
[02:48:31.759 --> 02:48:35.720]  Then you combine that with some BrainForce Ultra, it's amazing.
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:37.439]  With the whole UFO thing, it goes both ways.
[02:48:37.439 --> 02:48:41.960]  I've studied this for the greater half of my life, and there are good factions in the
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:47.039]  government who have been trying to get this information out for decades because the technology
[02:48:47.039 --> 02:48:48.599]  is revolutionary.
[02:48:48.599 --> 02:48:53.359]  And that's what Steven Greer talks about in a lot of his work is, you know, we want to
[02:48:53.359 --> 02:48:58.560]  release this information so that way we can bring the technology to the marketplace, technology
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:00.519]  that would free us up from energy.
[02:49:00.599 --> 02:49:02.800]  Meanwhile, they want to control our energy.
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:06.279]  They want to have complete dominion over it, cut it off whenever they want.
[02:49:06.279 --> 02:49:10.080]  But if we were to get this information out and start developing it, it would only take
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:15.240]  about 10 years to transform our entire grid system, to bring all of these generators and
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:20.199]  all of this unlimited sustainable energy, all this anti-gravitic technology.
[02:49:20.199 --> 02:49:21.199]  But it goes both ways.
[02:49:21.199 --> 02:49:23.599]  Let's consider this for a second, too.
[02:49:23.599 --> 02:49:29.160]  What does that do to all of the green new energy climate change propaganda, if that's
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:30.199]  the case?
[02:49:30.199 --> 02:49:34.199]  It destroys it, and it shows how all these people talking about it were frauds.
[02:49:34.199 --> 02:49:38.160]  It was never about some sort of a carbon neutral or new energy source.
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:40.400]  It was always about controlling you.
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:41.400]  100 percent.
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.019]  That's what the carbon tax is.
[02:49:43.019 --> 02:49:47.720]  They want to tax you on everything you do and basically tax you into bankruptcy and
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:50.439]  into debt, permanent debt, slavery.
[02:49:50.439 --> 02:49:54.560]  But it goes both ways because there are good factions like, yes, it could be part of Project
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:55.560]  Blue Beam.
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:59.519]  But at the end of the day, it's hard to tell.
[02:49:59.519 --> 02:50:00.519]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:00.519 --> 02:50:04.480]  And I do believe that because we own the Internet, we are breaking stories a lot faster and the
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:06.519]  media has to now catch up.
[02:50:06.519 --> 02:50:08.800]  But I think this is a good thing.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:09.800]  I really do.
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:12.880]  And I think it was meant to be because we need to start talking about it because you
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:16.759]  have good factions on this planet who are fighting for humanity, who want us to have
[02:50:16.759 --> 02:50:21.400]  a decentralized currency, want us to come together and free the world from all of this.
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:22.400]  And that's the realization.
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:28.359]  That's the realization as humanity enters its next its next phase.
[02:50:28.359 --> 02:50:34.960]  Is it going to be a world government tyranny phase or is it going to be individual prosperity
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.640]  phase with new advancements in technology and everything else?
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:43.640]  I mean, again, you've got people in Hollywood now talking about the blood rituals, talking
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:46.039]  about the Satanism.
[02:50:46.039 --> 02:50:53.800]  There was just another actor, I think it was one of the Fast and Furious Tyrese, yeah,
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:55.720]  saying, yeah, Hollywood embraces Satanism.
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:50:56.720]  They want to normalize it.
[02:50:57.679 --> 02:51:00.400]  So, I mean, this stuff is all coming out.
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:03.400]  Let's go to Melinda in Michigan.
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:04.400]  Melinda, you're on the air.
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:05.400]  Go ahead.
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:06.400]  Hi.
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:09.880]  First, I just want to say thank you guys for what you do.
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:13.880]  And I want to give a quick shout out for the collagen and the bio PCA.
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:20.080]  I mean, gosh, I have at least 14 of your guys' products and they're all amazing, but especially
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:21.080]  those.
[02:51:21.080 --> 02:51:26.960]  In response to your question about believing that whistleblower or not, I totally do.
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:36.640]  I have the past six, seven years been reading, researching, watching so much on Open Minds
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:41.000]  on Amazon and Coast to Coast with George Norrie, his other show, Beyond Belief.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:46.640]  And there's just so many great people out there that have so much great information.
[02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:53.320]  You know, Linda Moulton Howe, Richard Dolan, Paola Harris, David Politis, David Childress,
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:54.880]  David Wilcox, David Jacobs.
[02:51:54.880 --> 02:52:00.240]  I just got done reading his book called Secret Life, which is about alien abductions.
[02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:01.240]  It was amazing.
[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:05.279]  I mean, it was a little upsetting, but I mean, he kind of went towards the narrative that
[02:52:05.279 --> 02:52:08.640]  all aliens are evil, but I mean, I don't believe that.
[02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:13.199]  That book was from the 80s and things have changed a little since then, but there's got
[02:52:13.199 --> 02:52:14.199]  to be other life out there.
[02:52:14.199 --> 02:52:15.199]  Of course there is.
[02:52:15.199 --> 02:52:21.840]  How can we be so ignorant to think that we are the only ones, you know, in all of the
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:22.840]  universe?
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:29.240]  Ah, well, now, Melinda, you're getting into the real debate now.
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:30.240]  Yeah.
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:36.720]  So I, I think they're slowly releasing little tidbits, little breadcrumbs in the media for
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:37.720]  hope.
[02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:38.720]  You know, eventual disclosure.
[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:44.320]  It could be 10, 20 years from now, but you know, they're, they got to do it little by
[02:52:44.439 --> 02:52:45.439]  little.
[02:52:45.439 --> 02:52:50.439]  Release tidbit by tidbit, otherwise people would be too, you know, they got to get people
[02:52:50.439 --> 02:52:56.240]  used to the notion, you know, for the vast majority of people who might still be asleep
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:02.000]  on the alien topic, but, um, yeah, they gotta, the media can no longer really deny the existence
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000]  of alien life.
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:07.460]  They shouldn't even call it alien though, because you know, just, they're just other
[02:53:07.460 --> 02:53:08.460]  beings.
[02:53:08.460 --> 02:53:15.580]  I mean, we're, we're human beings here on earth, but I mean, yeah, I feel like for the
[02:53:15.580 --> 02:53:19.420]  past maybe 10 or 11 years, I don't know.
[02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:23.699]  I could be, who knows, but I feel like for the past 10 or 11 years, we, there's been
[02:53:23.699 --> 02:53:26.900]  like an ascension happening for humanity.
[02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:34.380]  Um, as far as spiritually, emotionally, like we're experiencing something where our minds
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:37.779]  are opening and our third eye is just ever so slightly opening.
[02:53:38.099 --> 02:53:43.619]  Yes, but that is what's already in front of us that we can't see.
[02:53:43.619 --> 02:53:46.820]  Not something that exists on another planet.
[02:53:46.820 --> 02:53:49.939]  Melinda, thank you for the call.
[02:53:49.939 --> 02:53:57.660]  How could there not be any other intelligent life out there unless there isn't an out there?
[02:53:57.660 --> 02:53:59.660]  Let's go to Brian in New York.
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:01.500]  Brian, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:02.500]  Go ahead.
[02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:07.699]  Hey Owen, I was just calling in to let you guys know about this program that's been going
[02:54:08.619 --> 02:54:14.859]  on over the past 80 days, there has been over 3,500 of these survey flights that uses geospatial
[02:54:14.859 --> 02:54:19.859]  mapping technology, and it's been mostly over heavy populated areas, they're either planning
[02:54:19.859 --> 02:54:20.859]  or looking for something.
[02:54:20.859 --> 02:54:24.779]  I was wondering if you heard anything about that.
[02:54:24.779 --> 02:54:26.580]  They've been doing that for a long time.
[02:54:26.580 --> 02:54:32.420]  This specific story you're talking about, I'm not sure, does this tie into the UFO story?
[02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:33.859]  This is what we're talking about.
[02:54:33.859 --> 02:54:40.300]  Well, possibly, I mean, this pretty much kicked up right after all the Chinese balloon
[02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:41.980]  stuff happened a couple months ago.
[02:54:41.980 --> 02:54:48.019]  Shortly after that, the surveys really kicked up in an unprecedented number.
[02:54:48.019 --> 02:54:54.140]  There's a stream called Monkey Works, he tracks all sorts of military and air traffic, refuelers,
[02:54:54.140 --> 02:54:57.820]  cargo planes, that sort of thing, and he's been doing it for a long time, he said he's
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:02.619]  never ever seen this happen like this before.
[02:55:02.619 --> 02:55:03.619]  Really interesting.
[02:55:03.619 --> 02:55:05.500]  I'm familiar with that YouTube channel.
[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:06.500]  Thank you for the call, Brian.
[02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:08.060]  Let's go to Valerie in Kentucky.
[02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:11.060]  Valerie, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:12.060]  God bless you, Owen.
[02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:13.060]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:15.099]  Yes, I can.
[02:55:15.099 --> 02:55:18.140]  I use your iodine, love it.
[02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:19.900]  I know I got to be quick.
[02:55:19.900 --> 02:55:20.900]  It is real.
[02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:26.259]  Some of it's demonic, others are, you know, from God, the entities, I believe they're
[02:55:26.259 --> 02:55:31.580]  doing it now to create fear, you know, because COVID didn't cause enough fear and war and
[02:55:31.580 --> 02:55:39.539]  all of this, but also, too, they have to have a narrative, because when Jesus comes
[02:55:39.539 --> 02:55:44.779]  back to rapture the Church and we're gone, the Christians are gone, they're going to
[02:55:44.779 --> 02:55:47.300]  have to say that aliens did it.
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:54.259]  And I've been watching Prophecy Watchers, you can see it on Daystar, I think, and ProphecyWatchers.com,
[02:55:54.259 --> 02:56:01.019]  Gary Stearman hosts that, and they talk all about the Nephilim, it's in Genesis 6, so
[02:56:01.019 --> 02:56:05.220]  I believe that they're all talking about it now because they're going to have to have
[02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:09.500]  some narrative of when Jesus raptures the Church.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:15.420]  Everyone should pray Psalm 91, you know, that's the protection, not to be afraid of this stuff.
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:20.060]  If you have Jesus Christ in your soul, you are not going to be affected by this stuff.
[02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:25.580]  You'll be raptured with the Church, Christ's bride, and people have to watch out with their
[02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:27.140]  words as well.
[02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:28.140]  They carry power.
[02:56:28.140 --> 02:56:29.699]  Yes, that's right.
[02:56:29.699 --> 02:56:33.220]  And words are supposed to have meaning, but the left has destroyed all of that as well.
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:36.420]  Valerie, thank you for the call.
[02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:38.140]  And maybe you're onto something there.
[02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:42.099]  The government has tried to get us to fear war, they've tried to get us to fear famine,
[02:56:42.099 --> 02:56:47.060]  they've tried to get us to fear weather, get us to fear each other, get us to fear viruses,
[02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:49.300]  disease, but this is all old hat.
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:53.099]  They need something new to put us into fear and to put us into slavery.
[02:56:53.099 --> 02:56:56.060]  Maybe aliens are the new fear tactic.
[02:56:56.060 --> 02:57:03.900]  You heard Valerie talking about Survival Shield X3 extended 25% off another 24 hours.
[02:57:03.900 --> 02:57:04.900]  Supposed to end last night.
[02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:06.420]  We still got some left in stock.

[02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:27.259]  I'm going to have to move on from that and cover the other big breaking news.
[02:57:27.259 --> 02:57:31.939]  Royce White will be hosting the fourth hour today.

[02:58:58.300 --> 02:59:04.300]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:05.300]  Greg, what do you got there?
[02:59:05.300 --> 02:59:07.300]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:13.300]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:14.300]  wherever you want it.
[02:59:14.300 --> 02:59:19.300]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:59:19.300 --> 02:59:21.300]  Absolutely.
[02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:26.300]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:59:26.300 --> 02:59:31.300]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?
[02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:34.300]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[02:59:34.300 --> 02:59:35.300]  Take out your phone.
[02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:36.300]  Click that QR code.
[02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:38.300]  It will take you directly to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:39.300]  Buy something.

[02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:45.300]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:46.300]  Do it today.
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:47.300]  Do it now.
[02:59:47.300 --> 02:59:49.300]  Support The Infowars.
[02:59:49.300 --> 02:59:56.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:11.900]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the fourth hour of Info Wars. I am your host Royce White,
[03:00:11.900 --> 03:00:16.500]  your guest host Royce White here live from the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:00:16.500 --> 03:00:22.220]  I can't say how honored I am to be able to host this legendary platform. Thank you to
[03:00:22.220 --> 03:00:27.860]  Alex Jones and Owen and to the rest of the Info Wars team. If you haven't got a chance,
[03:00:27.860 --> 03:00:33.060]  you can go to my newly created channel on Banned.Video which mirrors all of my Please
[03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:37.380]  Call Me Crazy podcasts and all of my other content that will come in the future so that
[03:00:37.380 --> 03:00:44.900]  all of our Info Wars audience has a good place to go and get the content if we get canceled,
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:50.940]  if we get shut down. Alex was gracious enough to extend the Banned.Video platform to me
[03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:55.420]  to have my content mirrored there because he knows as well as I know the conversations
[03:00:55.420 --> 03:01:00.740]  that I have on my podcast like he has on his show are dangerous and a threat to the establishment.
[03:01:00.740 --> 03:01:07.340]  So you can go check that out. My podcast usually airs Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 9 p.m. on
[03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:14.940]  YouTube on Rumble. It is on all the audio platforms. But this week we did Monday, Tuesday.
[03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:18.700]  We're going to try and get one out later on tonight as well. I'm not sure. I'm just going
[03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:25.100]  with the podcast right now, kind of in a transition period, getting the studio automated and some
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:29.900]  other things so we can put content out even more. But again, I want to say thank you to Alex Jones
[03:01:29.900 --> 03:01:33.740]  and the team for allowing me to host this hour. And I also want to say thank you to all of you
[03:01:33.740 --> 03:01:39.500]  out there in the audience. I can't tell you how much of your feedback I see on a daily, weekly,
[03:01:39.500 --> 03:01:47.020]  monthly basis of having saw me on Info Wars and asking that I be able to come back and host or be
[03:01:47.020 --> 03:01:52.140]  able to host again. So I really appreciate the feedback and I appreciate the conversation that
[03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:57.020]  we're building. The tide is turning. And I want to start off by saying this. Let's just make this
[03:01:58.140 --> 03:02:04.060]  declarative statement. I'm not an Elon Musk fan boy. This hour isn't going to be about Elon Musk,
[03:02:04.060 --> 03:02:08.540]  but I want to make this very clear because I said it earlier today on Jason or what you'll
[03:02:08.540 --> 03:02:15.340]  see later on tonight on Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I'm a free speech absolutist.
[03:02:15.340 --> 03:02:21.900]  You call me the N word. OK, call me the N word. If the N word, if me being able to deal with the
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:29.340]  emotional torment of the N word on the Internet is going to supersede my understanding of the
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:33.740]  fundamental need for free speech, then I don't deserve to be an American citizen and I don't
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:40.380]  deserve to be free and I won't be free. I'm a free speech absolutist. Alex Jones needs to be allowed
[03:02:40.380 --> 03:02:46.620]  back on Twitter before we even consider believing that Elon Musk is in any way who he says he is.
[03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:54.540]  That's first. Second, pride goeth before the fall. Pride goeth before the fall. And I don't mean the
[03:02:54.540 --> 03:03:01.180]  pride of the LGBTQ. I'm not talking about their pride or their hijacking of the word pride or the
[03:03:01.180 --> 03:03:09.340]  rainbow or their their explicit war against God, their their blatant war against God. I'm not
[03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:16.300]  talking about that. Talking about our pride. All of us at home who sit back and we find a
[03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:20.300]  scapegoat or an enemy to blame things on and pretend like we didn't sign up for this. And I
[03:03:20.300 --> 03:03:25.100]  know a lot of people don't love my podcast and my content because I don't really let anybody off the
[03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:29.980]  hook. Sure, we can talk about the deep state and the administrative state and the security state
[03:03:29.980 --> 03:03:35.100]  and all of these people as long as we want to. But the reality of the situation, the reality of the
[03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:40.780]  situation as it stands today is none of this is without our. None of this is out of none of this
[03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:46.140]  is out of our control because none of it was without our consent. All it's going to take is
[03:03:46.140 --> 03:03:51.500]  for us to listen to the thought leaders like Alex Jones and Steve Bannon and the great Jason Whitlock
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:57.100]  and the list goes on and on and on. You see, I'm wearing the shirt of the great Julian Assange,
[03:03:57.180 --> 03:04:05.100]  who we hope by some some miracle or some presidency with some integrity fights to get him freed.
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:09.180]  You know, all of these great thought leaders, all of these whistleblowers, all these people
[03:04:09.180 --> 03:04:13.980]  who want to tell you the truth. All we have to do is heed their warning, listen to listen to them,
[03:04:13.980 --> 03:04:21.100]  commit to an action plan, commit to a battle plan and execute it. They're on the ropes. Pride goes
[03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:25.580]  before the fall, but the pendulum swings both ways. Our pride and their pride right now,
[03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:29.260]  their pride is out of control. They're showing it. They're overextending their hand.
[03:04:30.140 --> 03:04:34.860]  They have overextended their hand. They want to go after your children. They want your child
[03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:38.940]  to carry a dildo in his lunchbox to affirm his identity. And if he doesn't,
[03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:44.460]  they're going to start to send CPS to come get your kid and say you're abusive. They've overplayed
[03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:49.900]  their hand. Liberals don't want this. Democrats don't want this. Blacks don't want this.
[03:04:49.900 --> 03:04:55.420]  Suburban white women don't even want this. More on the other side. Stay tuned.
[03:04:58.860 --> 03:05:03.660]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:05:04.300 --> 03:05:07.500]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:05:08.220 --> 03:05:11.740]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[03:05:11.740 --> 03:05:18.460]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith
[03:05:18.540 --> 03:05:23.180]  and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:05:23.980 --> 03:05:28.380]  It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your
[03:05:28.380 --> 03:05:33.900]  past support. I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you
[03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:38.380]  do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing
[03:05:38.380 --> 03:05:43.900]  it. But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products
[03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:48.220]  that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than
[03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:52.700]  one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com. If just one percent
[03:05:52.700 --> 03:05:56.620]  more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:57.580]  Please take action now.
[03:06:07.180 --> 03:06:11.180]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to InfoWars. I'm your guest host, Royce White. For the fourth
[03:06:11.180 --> 03:06:14.700]  hour, I'm here live from the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota. And right now we're
[03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:19.740]  talking about Pride going before the fall. And I want to say this to the entire LGBTQ community
[03:06:19.740 --> 03:06:24.140]  because I do think they're on the ropes. I mean, I think the liberal establishment has become so
[03:06:24.140 --> 03:06:33.340]  desperate, has become so ripe with arrogance and narcissism and a lust for power and control
[03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:39.500]  and even dominance that they're making huge mistakes. And there's two things that are going
[03:06:39.500 --> 03:06:43.340]  to happen when Pride goes before the fall. One, they're going to overplay their hand and they're
[03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:46.860]  going to feel the rejection. Second, they're going to get desperate and they're going to try
[03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:52.380]  and escalate things to a different level. And that's some of what you heard the woman, you know,
[03:06:52.380 --> 03:06:58.940]  forward as a theory around this UFO. I won't say propaganda, but the UFO narrative that's
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:06.460]  now emerging as potentially a false flag or a distraction in some sense. Justification for
[03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:12.460]  a different level of tyranny. But I want to say something to the LGBTQ here.
[03:07:13.260 --> 03:07:18.460]  I grew up here in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's one of the most LGBTQ communities per capita in
[03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:23.900]  the entire nation. I grew up around plenty of people who were gay, who were lesbian, who were
[03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:28.380]  queer. That really wasn't talked about when I was growing up. But I guess you could say they
[03:07:28.380 --> 03:07:34.060]  now identify as queer. The trans thing, completely new phenomenon. Don't know anything about it. I'm
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:38.780]  kind of the Dave Chappelle crowd. Where did this trans thing come from? I don't remember it in the
[03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:44.540]  90s. I don't remember it in the 2000s. It wasn't until Barack Obama hit the scene that the trans
[03:07:44.540 --> 03:07:50.300]  thing became a big deal. Not a coincidence there, in my opinion. But hey, who am I? I'm just a
[03:07:50.300 --> 03:07:55.100]  conspiracy theorist or a darling of the alt-right. But I'll say this to the LGBTQ community.
[03:07:57.820 --> 03:08:03.020]  American citizenship comes before Christianity. And I say that as a Christian. I say that as a
[03:08:03.020 --> 03:08:08.220]  Catholic. And I don't mean it comes before Christianity for me, personally. But in the
[03:08:08.220 --> 03:08:13.180]  order of our society, in the order of our nation, in the order and the structure of how we are to be
[03:08:13.180 --> 03:08:19.340]  governed, our citizenship comes before our faith. We all understand that. Now, the separation of
[03:08:19.340 --> 03:08:27.340]  church and state, that was a scam. The anti-God movement that has took its, you know, unzipped
[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:34.700]  and took a piss on us all now, that was a scam, right? The blatant attack on anybody who believes
[03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:46.060]  in any metaphysical faith, that is a scam. But citizenship comes first. Nobody, nobody in their
[03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:52.300]  right mind, nobody in their sane and rational mind, nobody who understands the Constitution or
[03:08:52.300 --> 03:08:58.460]  the Declaration of Independence or the Bill of Rights, nobody with half of a brain is suggesting
[03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:08.460]  that we round up and kill or jail or genocide anybody in the LGBTQ community. Nobody's suggesting
[03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:15.100]  that. Nobody reasonable suggests that. I'm certainly not. Who you sleep with is your
[03:09:15.100 --> 03:09:19.820]  business. Who you have sex with, that's your business. That's your business. And what we all
[03:09:19.820 --> 03:09:26.220]  need to be conscious of, whether religious or not, and make no mistake about it, the divide
[03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:32.860]  right now is God or no God. God or science. God or scientism, let's be more specific.
[03:09:34.780 --> 03:09:42.460]  None of us, none of us should be willing to let the government or the establishment use
[03:09:42.460 --> 03:09:48.620]  Christianity to stick a camera in our house to ensure that we're upholding Christian values
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:54.300]  in terms of our sexual proclivities or anything else. That would be a Trojan horse. That would be
[03:09:54.300 --> 03:09:59.340]  what you call a Christian Trojan horse. And there are some people out there who are that fundamentalist
[03:09:59.340 --> 03:10:04.060]  when it comes to their Christianity. We need to be able to stick a camera in your house so
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:09.420]  we can figure out if you're a homosexual. Stop. No, we're not doing that. Okay.
[03:10:10.220 --> 03:10:15.420]  So we want to put certain guardrails around religious faith.
[03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:21.820]  Don't want to round up gay people and lesbian people. Nobody's even suggesting that. Nobody
[03:10:21.820 --> 03:10:27.420]  reasonable. Certainly not the people who they've made out to seem like the boogeyman you should
[03:10:27.420 --> 03:10:37.260]  fear. Donald Trump, Alex Jones, Steve Bannon, Royce White, I don't know, in some cases Jason Whitlock,
[03:10:37.900 --> 03:10:44.220]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson. None of these people are talking about rounding up the lesbians and gays.
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:50.940]  Do what thou will. Okay. You have to answer to God, but so do many of us for all of the things
[03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:56.780]  that we do that are immoral. It's going to be easier for a man, for a camel to pass through
[03:10:56.780 --> 03:11:01.340]  the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven. And when you say rich, we all
[03:11:01.340 --> 03:11:10.380]  like to define that as wealth, money, riches. But we have a rich and prosperous civilization.
[03:11:10.940 --> 03:11:16.540]  We are rich with technology. We're all rich with convenience. We are rich with
[03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:23.900]  any number of mechanisms to display our own ego and narcissism. We're a rich civilization.
[03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:31.500]  Your aristocratic elites have found a way to keep you cash poor while keeping you dopamine rich.
[03:11:33.100 --> 03:11:40.060]  Again, the LGBTQ, we're not coming to round you up. But when you come for our children,
[03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:43.820]  when Joe Biden stands in front of the entire world and says,
[03:11:44.540 --> 03:11:51.980]  there's no such thing as somebody else's child, you've gone a step too far. You've gone a step
[03:11:51.980 --> 03:12:01.260]  too far, way, way too far. And any of you adults out there who are LGBTQIA plus elemental P,
[03:12:02.140 --> 03:12:08.220]  XYZ, I don't know, don't really care. I have a right not to care. I have a right not to
[03:12:08.220 --> 03:12:16.780]  affirm the never ending expansion of gender identity. That's my right. That's also right.
[03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:21.980]  The same way, gays and lesbians have a right to live in this country and not be persecuted or
[03:12:21.980 --> 03:12:32.140]  prosecuted or executed for their sexuality. All of you out there who identify this way, who are
[03:12:32.140 --> 03:12:38.860]  adults, who would allow the establishment and the government to use your sexual proclivity or
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:45.740]  identity to target children, to hell with you. To hell with you. I don't feel sorry for you.
[03:12:46.460 --> 03:12:53.340]  I'm just gonna say, if they started to use black people's identity to go after
[03:12:54.700 --> 03:13:00.380]  anybody's kids, white people's kids, anybody's kids, children writ large, if they started to do
[03:13:00.380 --> 03:13:07.660]  that and I was willing to accept the benefit from that, the political expediency of that,
[03:13:07.660 --> 03:13:10.860]  that would make me a sellout. That would make me a sellout of the highest order.
[03:13:12.300 --> 03:13:17.180]  I'm not even talking about God. I mean, just in basic morals and ethics, okay? Who are the most
[03:13:17.180 --> 03:13:22.140]  vulnerable amongst us? The children. If you want to extend it far enough, children in the womb.
[03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:27.260]  We get what we're talking about here. Let's just start being honest. Let's just start being honest.
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:33.980]  If you want to get together with 10 other guys and blow loads on each other's stomachs,
[03:13:33.980 --> 03:13:40.220]  that's not my business. I'm not gonna police that. I don't have the time.
[03:13:40.220 --> 03:13:46.700]  I got my own issues. I got my own issues raising kids. I got my own problems. Family, mother,
[03:13:47.660 --> 03:13:52.060]  sisters, brothers. I got my own issues. Nobody should have time to be policing what other
[03:13:52.060 --> 03:13:57.660]  grown adults are doing in the privacy of their home, or their sex orgies, or eyes wide shut
[03:13:57.660 --> 03:14:04.300]  parties, or political DC elite swamp black male soirees. I don't have the time.
[03:14:05.660 --> 03:14:13.180]  Let's be honest about the morals and ethics, okay? It's getting way out there. It's getting
[03:14:13.180 --> 03:14:18.300]  way out there and all it's gonna breed is violence. And that's not a call to violence.
[03:14:18.300 --> 03:14:22.060]  I mean, it's just a natural, it's a natural imposition.
[03:14:23.900 --> 03:14:27.260]  When you go to attack people's children, when you go to target people's children,
[03:14:27.260 --> 03:14:34.460]  when you go to use the educational system to brainwash and condition people's children,
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:39.900]  or to make political statements, the next step is obvious. They're gonna start to use
[03:14:39.900 --> 03:14:46.860]  child protective services, which they've already been using tyrannically for decades in my opinion.
[03:14:48.860 --> 03:14:53.980]  Let alone when it came to COVID and the vaccine and the vaccine mandates. We saw that in California,
[03:14:53.980 --> 03:15:01.020]  where in family court or other situations, children were stripped by CPS from their parents
[03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:05.820]  for their stance on the vaccine. It's gonna be the same thing with the LGBTQ.
[03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:11.820]  And the school teachers are going to tell a young man that he should be a young woman. Then it's the
[03:15:12.620 --> 03:15:18.780]  gender medication or hormone blockers, testosterone blockers, whatever it is.
[03:15:18.780 --> 03:15:22.940]  The parents are gonna reject it and then CPS is gonna come knock on your door and say you're
[03:15:22.940 --> 03:15:27.900]  abusing your child because you won't affirm their identity. And that's gonna be the step too far.
[03:15:27.900 --> 03:15:32.140]  And they're gonna come to the door and there are gonna be bullets flying back through that door.
[03:15:32.140 --> 03:15:39.980]  I'm telling you guys, don't do this. Please, I'm begging you. Do not do this.
[03:15:40.860 --> 03:15:47.420]  There's rules to war. Let's engage and play by the rules of politics and war in an honorable way.
[03:15:48.540 --> 03:15:54.540]  More on the other side.
[03:15:56.540 --> 03:16:02.140]  There is a war for the future happening right now. There is a war that will control my destiny,
[03:16:02.140 --> 03:16:06.540]  your destiny, our children's destinies. And that war is something that we can win,
[03:16:06.940 --> 03:16:12.060]  but it takes dedication. It takes commitment. That's why I asked listeners respectively to
[03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:16.940]  go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while
[03:16:16.940 --> 03:16:24.220]  keeping us on air at the very same time. Infowarestore.com to get a signed or unsigned
[03:16:24.220 --> 03:16:28.780]  copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock,
[03:16:28.780 --> 03:16:34.540]  Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're gonna find anywhere

[03:16:40.140 --> 03:16:43.740]  products. And a lot of you have never shopped at Infowarestore. You've been watching for years,
[03:16:43.740 --> 03:16:47.980]  you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to Infowarestore.
[03:16:47.980 --> 03:16:52.140]  These are great products that really work and are amazing. Plus, they keep us on air.
[03:16:52.140 --> 03:16:56.620]  So again, please take action. Go to infowarestore.com today and I thank you.
[03:16:57.180 --> 03:17:02.220]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were gonna move against Tucker Carlson
[03:17:02.220 --> 03:17:05.820]  and take him off the air. People said, no way he's the most powerful that ever happened.
[03:17:05.820 --> 03:17:09.580]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they
[03:17:09.580 --> 03:17:13.020]  believed they could control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken
[03:17:13.020 --> 03:17:18.540]  off the air. It's the same thing with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled
[03:17:18.540 --> 03:17:24.620]  by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers and
[03:17:24.620 --> 03:17:30.060]  our listeners. And when you support us, we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by Rupert
[03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:36.940]  Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people. So I want to thank
[03:17:36.940 --> 03:17:41.500]  you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand. Please don't take Infowars for
[03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:46.380]  granted. We're barely hanging on. We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[03:17:46.380 --> 03:17:50.540]  while getting great products at the same time at infowarrestore.com. So don't procrastinate.
[03:17:50.540 --> 03:17:55.580]  Go to infowarrestore.com. Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these
[03:17:55.660 --> 03:18:01.420]  tyrants. Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic
[03:18:01.420 --> 03:18:06.060]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future. That is a hellish
[03:18:06.060 --> 03:18:10.300]  future. Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:18:10.300 --> 03:18:14.380]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,
[03:18:14.380 --> 03:18:19.340]  Amazon or infowarrestore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:18:19.340 --> 03:18:24.300]  after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:18:24.380 --> 03:18:29.740]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at infowarrestore.com.
[03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:34.140]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So you won't
[03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:38.940]  just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know that you help keep Infowars
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:41.740]  on the air. I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:18:42.380 --> 03:18:47.900]  or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarrestore.com
[03:18:47.900 --> 03:18:52.380]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or
[03:18:52.380 --> 03:18:56.140]  give them to the local school. This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for
[03:18:56.140 --> 03:19:01.100]  your support. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of
[03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:07.180]  you, hidden in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia,
[03:19:07.180 --> 03:19:12.380]  it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[03:19:12.940 --> 03:19:19.900]  in the world is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is
[03:19:19.900 --> 03:19:26.860]  lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide,
[03:19:26.860 --> 03:19:34.220]  chlorine, and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007
[03:19:34.220 --> 03:19:39.660]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine. Most iodine
[03:19:39.660 --> 03:19:44.060]  is bound to other elements. You don't absorb it. We have X3, all three types of the good iodine
[03:19:44.060 --> 03:19:49.900]  together that supercharges your body. X3 is now back in stock at Infowarstore.com. It's
[03:19:49.900 --> 03:19:56.540]  being sold out for over six months for 25% off. X3 back in stock. Take action now, Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:57.740 --> 03:20:05.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.500 --> 03:20:15.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:15.500 --> 03:20:20.940]  I'm your guest host Royce White live in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:20:20.940 --> 03:20:26.260]  Today we're talking about pride going before the fall before, but, but, but, but, but before
[03:20:26.260 --> 03:20:31.220]  I go into that more, I want to send a special thank you again to Alex Jones and the entire
[03:20:31.220 --> 03:20:32.220]  Infowars team.
[03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:38.860]  I want to remind you that I now have a band dot video channel or, or page.
[03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:44.180]  So be sure to go check that out, the band dot video channel where we're mirroring all
[03:20:44.180 --> 03:20:46.140]  of the podcasts of Please Call Me Crazy.
[03:20:46.140 --> 03:20:51.220]  We have a few more shows coming in the near future, the Royce White show and some other
[03:20:51.220 --> 03:20:52.220]  things happening.
[03:20:52.220 --> 03:20:53.220]  So stay tuned.
[03:20:53.220 --> 03:20:56.660]  We're getting all our digital together to make it easy for you to find me, right?
[03:20:56.660 --> 03:21:01.300]  We're going to, we're going to push forward and just dump content into the machine until
[03:21:01.300 --> 03:21:04.640]  the people in Silicon Valley say that's enough.
[03:21:04.640 --> 03:21:09.260]  And they come in and knock on my door and haul me off the same way they did Assange the same
[03:21:09.260 --> 03:21:10.740]  way they're trying to do Alex Jones.
[03:21:10.740 --> 03:21:14.580]  So I want to say thank you to Alex Jones and the entire team for all you've done over your
[03:21:14.580 --> 03:21:19.380]  lifetime, your entire body of work and what you continue to do and fighting back against
[03:21:19.380 --> 03:21:22.060]  these people.
[03:21:22.060 --> 03:21:24.740]  Pride going before the fall, please don't do this.
[03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:25.740]  Do not do this.
[03:21:26.220 --> 03:21:31.260]  I mean, as a father myself of four children, four children who are in their, their, you
[03:21:31.260 --> 03:21:34.500]  know, their, their, their, their formative years, right?
[03:21:34.500 --> 03:21:39.500]  You know, they're dead at nine, 10, 11, 12 year old age and they're coming into junior
[03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:44.180]  high bodies, changing, exploring, you know, their, their, their, you know, they're just
[03:21:44.180 --> 03:21:45.500]  going through changes, right?
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:54.540]  Willing to defend my, willing to lose my life in defense of my child, willing to lose my
[03:21:54.540 --> 03:21:58.480]  life in defense of my sovereignty as my child's parent.
[03:21:58.480 --> 03:22:02.660]  And when Joe Biden says there's no such thing as somebody else's child, I mean, how much
[03:22:02.660 --> 03:22:07.640]  more tyrannical does the government have to get for you all to understand this is not
[03:22:07.640 --> 03:22:10.280]  about civil rights anymore?
[03:22:10.280 --> 03:22:13.020]  This is, this is an anti-civil rights movement.
[03:22:13.020 --> 03:22:14.720]  This is an anti-freedom movement.
[03:22:14.720 --> 03:22:16.960]  This is an anti-inclusive movement.
[03:22:16.960 --> 03:22:19.840]  This is about dominance and control.
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:26.520]  And it's verging on, guys, seriously, it's verging, it's right on the precipice of civil
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:27.520]  war.
[03:22:27.520 --> 03:22:29.600]  Let's just stop.
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:30.600]  Stop this.
[03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:34.360]  I mean, we all know we have common, we all know there's common ground out there to fight
[03:22:34.360 --> 03:22:36.240]  back against this establishment.
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:42.040]  None of you want to be, you know, raped by the Federal Reserve and inflation and these
[03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:47.240]  international banking cartels that are going to, you know, inflate your cost of living
[03:22:47.240 --> 03:22:51.720]  beyond, beyond anything feasible.
[03:22:51.720 --> 03:22:56.400]  Nobody wants to send their tax money to the Ukraine for a war that nobody really understands,
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:02.720]  a war that is just geographically and historically inaccurate on so many accounts.
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:07.440]  You get 10 people off the street, nine of them won't know that Kiev used to be the,
[03:23:07.440 --> 03:23:10.040]  the capital of the Russian empire for hundreds of years.
[03:23:10.640 --> 03:23:14.280]  I mean, you know, nobody wants to send all their money to the Ukraine.
[03:23:14.280 --> 03:23:19.680]  You black people out there, nobody wants them to bring countless numbers of immigrants into
[03:23:19.680 --> 03:23:25.200]  your inner cities and start to give them health care and now in Minnesota pay for their
[03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:29.880]  college tuition if they make under $80,000 a year.
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:34.840]  I mean, you can't want reparations and then at the same time, send countless money to
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:39.800]  Ukraine and then, and then house every single illegal immigrant that comes from Honduras.
[03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:41.560]  It makes no sense.
[03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:43.600]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:44.600]  Okay.
[03:23:44.600 --> 03:23:48.560]  There's so many things that we could come together on and doesn't have to be on based
[03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:50.000]  on God.
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:56.280]  But many of you out there who deny God, who reject God, who, who, uh, you know, are atheists,
[03:23:56.280 --> 03:24:01.280]  let's say libertarians, even your ethics come from Christianity.
[03:24:01.280 --> 03:24:08.560]  I mean, I'm sorry to tell you your ethics, your morals, they're greatly based in Christian
[03:24:08.560 --> 03:24:11.440]  tradition in a Judeo Christian faith tradition.
[03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:12.760]  It's just what it is.
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:15.680]  I mean, let's just cut the BS.
[03:24:15.680 --> 03:24:16.680]  That's what it is.
[03:24:18.300 --> 03:24:21.300]  Let's come together along the lines that we need to come.
[03:24:21.300 --> 03:24:25.300]  And I'm not calling for some superficial kumbaya.
[03:24:25.300 --> 03:24:29.300]  Your elites mean to steal from you.
[03:24:29.300 --> 03:24:32.300]  When your government steals, everybody steals.
[03:24:32.300 --> 03:24:35.300]  And I try and tell all the people who watch Fox News
[03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:39.300]  and get caught up in all of these young black people
[03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:44.300]  pillaging and looting all these department stores
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:49.300]  or local convenience stores for under $1,000 worth of goods.
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:52.300]  When your government steals, everybody steals.
[03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:56.300]  That little $900 theft isn't even a drop in the ocean
[03:24:56.300 --> 03:25:01.300]  compared to what your Nancy Pelosi's are stealing from you every single day.
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:04.300]  $1.6 trillion?
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:09.300]  A $1.6 trillion debt ceiling increase with no cap?
[03:25:09.300 --> 03:25:12.300]  There's no cap to it. It's infinite.
[03:25:12.300 --> 03:25:14.300]  Let's get down to brass tag.
[03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:17.300]  There really is no economic crisis.
[03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:20.300]  The only economic crisis is the political elites who lead your economy.
[03:25:20.300 --> 03:25:22.300]  That's the real crisis.
[03:25:22.300 --> 03:25:24.300]  There is no debt crisis.
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:27.300]  Who's going to come calling the debts?
[03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:30.300]  Who owes the debt?
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:32.300]  This might take a sharp turn.
[03:25:32.300 --> 03:25:34.300]  That's very hard for some people to comprehend.
[03:25:34.300 --> 03:25:36.300]  I'm not saying there's not an economic crisis.
[03:25:36.300 --> 03:25:39.300]  What I'm saying is the crisis is a fugazi.
[03:25:39.300 --> 03:25:41.300]  The crisis is a fugazi because the money's not real.
[03:25:41.300 --> 03:25:46.300]  The money, the fiat currency, and this entire international global banking structure
[03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:49.300]  is an agreement that we all signed into,
[03:25:49.300 --> 03:25:52.300]  that we all agreed to the terms and conditions of.
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:56.300]  The terms and conditions are, which many may not realize,
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:26:00.300]  the central banks are going to dictate the value of currency,
[03:26:00.300 --> 03:26:04.300]  the collateral of debt,
[03:26:04.300 --> 03:26:06.300]  the collateral of loans,
[03:26:06.300 --> 03:26:09.300]  the collateral of interest and taxes
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:13.300]  and human energy and consumption and manufacturing and certain goods.
[03:26:13.300 --> 03:26:15.300]  They're going to set the cost.
[03:26:15.300 --> 03:26:17.300]  Price setting.
[03:26:17.300 --> 03:26:23.300]  Price setting by definition at this scale is a cartel-like endeavor.
[03:26:23.300 --> 03:26:25.300]  It's a cartel-like agenda.
[03:26:25.300 --> 03:26:28.300]  It's a cartel-like mechanism, organization.
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:30.300]  And that's what these bankers are.
[03:26:30.300 --> 03:26:32.300]  That's what these banks are, these central banks.
[03:26:32.300 --> 03:26:34.300]  They're a cartel.
[03:26:34.300 --> 03:26:36.300]  They're price setting.
[03:26:36.300 --> 03:26:40.300]  The real goal is to undermine the United States dollar
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:43.300]  by getting all the American people to believe that it's actually in danger.
[03:26:43.300 --> 03:26:45.300]  It's not in danger.
[03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:49.300]  The dollar is and has always been the strength of the dollar.
[03:26:49.300 --> 03:26:54.300]  The strength of the United States dollar is and has always been the United States military.
[03:26:54.300 --> 03:26:57.300]  I don't care what anybody else tells you.
[03:26:57.300 --> 03:27:00.300]  The American dollar didn't come into global supremacy
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:04.300]  until after World War II where we had military supremacy.
[03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:07.300]  The military has always been the juice behind the dollar.
[03:27:07.300 --> 03:27:13.300]  However, the problem is over time the military has been convinced or bought off
[03:27:13.300 --> 03:27:16.300]  to play along like the banks are the juice,
[03:27:16.300 --> 03:27:18.300]  like the monetary system is the juice,
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:23.300]  like Bretton Woods Conference and the IMF and the World Bank are the juice.
[03:27:23.300 --> 03:27:24.300]  They're not the juice.
[03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:26.300]  The juice is NATO.
[03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:28.300]  The juice is the American military.
[03:27:28.300 --> 03:27:33.300]  The juice is the technology and the capacity that we have to do war.
[03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:39.300]  The problem is we have to go through a middleman to be funded to do that war,
[03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:42.300]  which is why we have a 1.6 debt ceiling increase, right?
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:45.300]  Turn the money tap on for the war machine.
[03:27:45.300 --> 03:27:48.300]  Well, the truth is the war machine doesn't need the money.
[03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:50.300]  They need the resources.
[03:27:50.300 --> 03:27:57.300]  Somebody has placed themselves in between the resources and us, the citizens.
[03:27:57.300 --> 03:28:00.300]  And this is the case that the socialists and communists make,
[03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:04.300]  although the socialists and communists don't really want to give you the resources.
[03:28:04.300 --> 03:28:06.300]  They want you to eat crickets.
[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:13.300]  OK, so we have two sort of global global totalitarian communist factions.
[03:28:13.300 --> 03:28:20.300]  And we're all sitting there in the middle looking at both, judging both, analyzing both,
[03:28:20.300 --> 03:28:22.300]  trying to figure out who we should side with.
[03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:23.300]  Neither.
[03:28:23.300 --> 03:28:24.300]  Be on your own side.
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:26.300]  Be on the side of the people.
[03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:28.300]  Be on the side of freedom.
[03:28:28.300 --> 03:28:30.300]  Be on the side of the truth.
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:33.300]  The truth is you are a sovereign citizen.
[03:28:33.300 --> 03:28:41.300]  And this price setting, this cartel initiative for the banksters and the political and corporate elites is nothing more than a scam.
[03:28:41.300 --> 03:28:47.300]  It's a scam meant to get you to buy into the decline of America as a bastion of freedom.
[03:28:47.300 --> 03:28:50.300]  Resist. Resist at all costs.
[03:28:50.300 --> 03:28:52.300]  More on the other side.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:29:00.960]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:01.960]  Reiss Report.

[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:29.920]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity fed water filter has got you covered.
[03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:31.520]  Absolutely.
[03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:36.600]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:41.240]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?

[03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:53.920]  Alex Jones, Orrin Schroer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us
[03:29:53.920 --> 03:29:54.920]  on air.

[03:29:57.920 --> 03:30:04.240]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:30:04.240 --> 03:30:05.240]  the atmosphere.
[03:30:05.240 --> 03:30:08.160]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:14.520]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:18.960]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:30:18.960 --> 03:30:23.720]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[03:30:23.720 --> 03:30:24.840]  dispose of it.
[03:30:24.840 --> 03:30:29.760]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who
[03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:33.280]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:39.800]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:30:39.800 --> 03:30:42.200]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:30:42.200 --> 03:30:47.440]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:30:47.440 --> 03:30:53.840]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[03:30:53.840 --> 03:30:57.720]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:02.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:04.200]  in plain view.
[03:31:04.200 --> 03:31:06.960]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:31:06.960 --> 03:31:11.240]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[03:31:11.240 --> 03:31:16.480]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:31:16.520 --> 03:31:23.760]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[03:31:23.760 --> 03:31:30.040]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:31:30.040 --> 03:31:36.240]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[03:31:36.240 --> 03:31:40.160]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:31:40.160 --> 03:31:42.400]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[03:31:42.400 --> 03:31:47.880]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:31:47.880 --> 03:31:50.280]  X3 is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:50.280 --> 03:31:54.080]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:31:54.080 --> 03:31:55.440]  X3, back in stock.
[03:31:55.440 --> 03:31:56.440]  Take action now.
[03:31:56.440 --> 03:31:57.440]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:57.440 --> 03:31:58.440]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:31:58.440 --> 03:31:59.440]  Do you like RainForce?
[03:31:59.440 --> 03:32:00.440]  Yeah.
[03:32:00.440 --> 03:32:01.440]  Yeah.
[03:32:01.440 --> 03:32:02.440]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:32:02.440 --> 03:32:04.600]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:32:04.600 --> 03:32:08.640]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[03:32:08.640 --> 03:32:10.920]  two books with Alex Jones?
[03:32:10.920 --> 03:32:14.280]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:32:14.280 --> 03:32:18.200]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:32:18.200 --> 03:32:22.200]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:27.600]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[03:32:27.600 --> 03:32:32.920]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next
[03:32:32.920 --> 03:32:35.440]  four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:32:35.440 --> 03:32:40.880]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:32:40.880 --> 03:32:41.880]  All right.
[03:32:41.880 --> 03:32:42.880]  We love you.
[03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:43.880]  We'll be right back.
[03:32:43.880 --> 03:32:47.480]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[03:32:47.480 --> 03:32:58.480]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:32:58.480 --> 03:33:04.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:21.960]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I'm your guest host Royce White live here in the belly
[03:33:21.960 --> 03:33:26.760]  of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota guest hosting the Alex Jones show for the fourth
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:27.760]  hour.
[03:33:27.880 --> 03:33:36.560]  Just getting into an entire, an entire rant about how this, this economic crisis is really
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:37.560]  a fugazi.
[03:33:37.560 --> 03:33:40.200]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[03:33:40.200 --> 03:33:44.000]  We are in an economic crisis, but the crisis is our leadership.
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:48.640]  We're really in a crisis of leadership and ultimately a crisis of faith.
[03:33:48.640 --> 03:33:54.000]  And right now we have our faith in the system, our faith is in how things have worked since
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:34:00.340]  Brenton Woods conference, the things that led to this America, American prosperity.
[03:34:00.340 --> 03:34:01.680]  This is what we've come to know.
[03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:02.960]  This is what we've come to trust.
[03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:07.080]  This is what we've come to, to love, to need, to desire, to lust.
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:10.840]  This is, this is the cornerstone of the whole scam.
[03:34:10.840 --> 03:34:15.760]  So everybody believes it when, when the, when the, uh, the economists say we're on the brink
[03:34:15.760 --> 03:34:23.000]  of collapse or, you know, if we don't do some, some major restructuring overnight that ultimately
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:28.920]  will, will concede all of your rights, then the dollar is not going to be worth anything.
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:34.080]  Well, there are a few interlocutors as Joe Biden would, would call them.
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:41.440]  There are a few interlocutors that ensure that to be true, that, that stand as safeguards
[03:34:41.440 --> 03:34:47.080]  to the, the institutions, uh, the mechanisms and institutions that determined or that can
[03:34:47.080 --> 03:34:51.200]  determine the real value of the American dollar.
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:57.240]  And I just want to, you know, centralbank.com there's actually a website, centralbanking.com,
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:00.760]  the audacity of our elites, okay.
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:01.760]  Centralbanking.com.
[03:35:01.760 --> 03:35:05.640]  And I scroll down here and it says central bank of the year is none other than the national
[03:35:05.640 --> 03:35:06.640]  bank of Ukraine.
[03:35:06.640 --> 03:35:07.640]  Right?
[03:35:07.640 --> 03:35:15.360]  I mean, of course, now we've gotten woke politics into the banking and financial sectors, touts
[03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:20.080]  president Zelensky for being able to keep their central bank running while, uh, while
[03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:25.240]  under a hail of gunfire from, from Russia.
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:28.760]  But we know that the Ukrainians didn't really, the Ukrainians didn't really keep their central
[03:35:28.760 --> 03:35:32.360]  bank afloat, uh, uh, in that hail of gunfire.
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:41.080]  We the American people gave $200 billion to the Ukraine already and with plenty of more
[03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:45.760]  on the record, no, no telling how much money we've actually given them, um, how many black
[03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:48.200]  bags of cash we've dropped off.
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:53.640]  And then how many other people from around the world contributed to the Ukraine's, uh,
[03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:58.600]  anti-Russian slush fund and people will go, Oh, you're a Russian apologist.
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:02.040]  Putin's the aggressor, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:03.040]  Another scam.
[03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:04.040]  And we'll talk about that in the final section.
[03:36:04.040 --> 03:36:07.560]  Cause that is the most important issue on the, on the, on the table today.
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:15.320]  Um, but, but to, to, to continue on with this, this debt Fugazi, yeah, there's a debt, there's
[03:36:15.320 --> 03:36:17.120]  a debt, no doubt.
[03:36:17.120 --> 03:36:21.200]  But mostly the debt is a financialized debt that's been run up by our DC elites and our
[03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:22.760]  banking elites.
[03:36:22.760 --> 03:36:24.280]  They created the debt.
[03:36:24.280 --> 03:36:25.400]  They created the debt.
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:29.760]  They've created the crisis and they're going to, they plan to capitalize on the crisis.
[03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:33.840]  They plan to use the debt, use the crisis to take your rights.
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:36.640]  It's clear as day.
[03:36:36.640 --> 03:36:37.640]  It's just so clear.
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:40.760]  I mean, what, what are we, what are we talking about here?
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:48.520]  What we're talking about is if you had a few politicians, a few elected officials that
[03:36:48.520 --> 03:36:57.000]  use the full scope of their, their power, presidency, uh, executive orders, let's say
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:02.040]  the national debt is a matter of national security, unless the whole thing is being
[03:37:02.040 --> 03:37:03.040]  controlled.
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:06.080]  If the whole thing is being controlled, then there actually is no crisis.
[03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:09.840]  But if there actually is a crisis, then the debt itself is a matter of national security.
[03:37:09.920 --> 03:37:17.160]  And if it's a matter of national security, then executive orders are, are warranted just
[03:37:17.160 --> 03:37:22.680]  like they were when we went into Iraq without the consent of the United Nations, which in
[03:37:22.680 --> 03:37:25.200]  one instance will condemn the Uyghur genocide.
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:30.040]  And another instance over at their other branch organization, the WHO will sell out to the
[03:37:30.040 --> 03:37:31.040]  CCP.
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:35.680]  I mean, these people are running scam, counter scam, counter counter scams on you left and
[03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:38.240]  right all intended to do one thing.
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:40.080]  So you don't know which way is up.
[03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:41.600]  All you know is survival.
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:42.600]  How can I survive?
[03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:43.600]  How can I work?
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:48.480]  How can I get a paycheck that's going to be stable to feed my family and put a roof over
[03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:49.480]  my head?
[03:37:49.480 --> 03:37:53.800]  The basics, these people don't play in the basics, the basics, they ironed out.
[03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:57.440]  They ironed that out in 1913 when they set up the federal reserve.
[03:37:57.440 --> 03:38:01.840]  And again, this whole thing is intended to get the American people to believe that we
[03:38:01.840 --> 03:38:09.080]  need some, some, some, uh, network of international banks and financial institutions to ensure
[03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:13.240]  the value of our nation and our citizenship.
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:16.080]  What a scam, what a scam.
[03:38:16.080 --> 03:38:20.340]  We have everything we need for the United States dollar and for the United States economy
[03:38:20.340 --> 03:38:27.880]  and for the United States, uh, manufacturing base or, or, uh, you know, any, any of it
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:31.600]  to be thriving.
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:36.920]  Democracy is standing in the way politicians are standing in the way crony capitalists
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:42.200]  are standing in the way Marxist professors are standing in the way we have everything
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:46.400]  we need to be prosperous.
[03:38:46.400 --> 03:38:48.560]  We have everything we need to be powerful.
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:51.200]  We have everything we need to be sovereign.
[03:38:51.200 --> 03:38:54.640]  We have everything we need to be self-sufficient.
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:39:01.720]  We have the people, we have the scientific, uh, uh, you know, we have the scientific ingenuity.
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:04.080]  We have the military capacity.
[03:39:04.080 --> 03:39:13.960]  We have the strategic geographical location position militarily and, and agriculturally.
[03:39:13.960 --> 03:39:16.920]  We have everything we need here.
[03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:18.240]  Who put us on this story?
[03:39:18.240 --> 03:39:25.280]  Who put us in this story arc where, where our financial stability depends on oil from
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:28.560]  the Ukraine oil from Russia.
[03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:29.560]  Okay.
[03:39:29.560 --> 03:39:36.240]  Who put us on this trajectory where the stability of the American dollar depends on the manufacturing
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:43.080]  impulse of the Chinese or the price setting of the Chinese or, or the, uh, the, the foreign
[03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:49.520]  relations and foreign policy of the European monarchies or the whims or the impulses of
[03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:53.080]  the Brazilians or, or whatever, so on and so forth.
[03:39:53.080 --> 03:39:55.000]  We don't need any of these nations.
[03:39:55.000 --> 03:39:58.720]  I mean, when it's all said and done, we don't need them.
[03:39:58.720 --> 03:40:02.040]  They need us more than we need them.
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:06.560]  I love the fruit cantaloupe and I was at the, at the store the other day and I got one of
[03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:10.920]  those big tubs of, of, of cantaloupe.
[03:40:10.920 --> 03:40:17.520]  And I, I, uh, realized that on the container, it said Honduras, that the cantaloupe came
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:18.520]  from Honduras.
[03:40:18.520 --> 03:40:21.840]  I love cantaloupe.
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:26.840]  I'm not willing to, to, I'm willing to give up cantaloupe.
[03:40:26.840 --> 03:40:32.640]  Are you, are you willing to give up whatever it is that you enjoy to, to restabilize this
[03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:33.860]  nation?
[03:40:33.860 --> 03:40:35.960]  It's going to cost you more if you don't.
[03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:37.280]  And that's the whole scam here.
[03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:44.080]  I mean, that's like the drug dealer, the local drug dealer mocking you for your addiction,
[03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:47.680]  your addiction to all these, all these luxuries, right?
[03:40:47.680 --> 03:40:56.200]  All these, these sort of extra bonus, wealthy aristocratic wine society, like a conveniences.
[03:40:56.200 --> 03:41:00.600]  I'm willing to give up cantaloupe in order for America to be sovereign.
[03:41:00.600 --> 03:41:01.600]  We don't need Honduras.
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:07.200]  I surely don't like the prospect that all these South American immigrants are coming
[03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:12.520]  here illegally because some type of international collaborative we have to import cantaloupes
[03:41:12.520 --> 03:41:16.520]  or whatever scam we got running about whatever imported good.
[03:41:16.520 --> 03:41:19.280]  And I'm not saying that's the heart of the immigration crisis at all.
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:27.560]  I'm just saying this whole international democratic liberal order, you trade us, your autocrats
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:32.720]  and your dictators for our democratic rule or our democratic worldview.
[03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:36.800]  We'll bring our military and ensure the safety of our United States dollar as the reserve
[03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:37.800]  currency.
[03:41:37.800 --> 03:41:43.480]  And in exchange, you help us build this narrative that there's this huge international collaborative
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:48.720]  of nations that are now going to point out, single out other nations and go to war with
[03:41:48.720 --> 03:41:53.220]  them to take their stuff and their natural resources whenever they want.
[03:41:53.220 --> 03:41:57.040]  This is a Ponzi scheme of biblical proportions.
[03:41:57.040 --> 03:42:03.040]  This is exactly why Jesus Christ went into the temples and turn the tables over the same
[03:42:03.040 --> 03:42:04.040]  thing.
[03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:05.440]  The exact same thing.
[03:42:05.440 --> 03:42:10.500]  The only difference then they were using God to run the racket.
[03:42:10.500 --> 03:42:18.320]  Now they're using science and Karl Marx and basic natural resources, Maslow's hierarchy
[03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:20.720]  of needs to run the racket.
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:25.180]  A new guy, a new psychosocial God, right?
[03:42:25.180 --> 03:42:28.100]  LGBTQ, black rights, the whole nine.
[03:42:28.100 --> 03:42:29.100]  This is all a scam.
[03:42:29.100 --> 03:42:30.260]  All we have to do is say no.
[03:42:30.260 --> 03:42:34.940]  All we have to do is elect somebody who has the balls and the spine to go in there on
[03:42:34.940 --> 03:42:38.580]  day one and say, this is a matter of national security.
[03:42:38.580 --> 03:42:40.620]  We are going to secure our borders.
[03:42:40.620 --> 03:42:46.540]  We are going to secure both borders and we're going to secure our naval space and our air
[03:42:46.540 --> 03:42:50.840]  space and let the rest of you figure it out.
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:54.480]  Old statement, but it can be done more on the other side.
[03:42:55.900 --> 03:42:58.900]  Sold out for more than a year.
[03:42:58.900 --> 03:43:03.900]  We now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular tooth whitening
[03:43:03.900 --> 03:43:08.900]  coral calcium toothpaste, full of essential oils back in stock and
[03:43:08.900 --> 03:43:09.900]  info or store.com.

[03:43:13.900 --> 03:43:15.900]  essential oil toothpaste as well.
[03:43:15.900 --> 03:43:17.900]  These are both incredible for your gums.
[03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:18.900]  Polish your teeth.
[03:43:18.900 --> 03:43:21.900]  Amazing to counter gingivitis and they fund the info.
[03:43:22.900 --> 03:43:24.900]  There are no fillers in these products.
[03:43:24.900 --> 03:43:27.900]  These are fluoride free next level toothpaste.
[03:43:27.900 --> 03:43:33.900]  10,000 of each tube limited run available exclusively at info or store.com
[03:43:33.900 --> 03:43:36.900]  and your purchase funds, the operation.

[03:43:38.900 --> 03:43:42.900]  So the coral calcium tooth whitening and the activated charcoal essential
[03:43:42.900 --> 03:43:46.900]  toothpaste are now both back in stock at info or store.com.
[03:43:46.900 --> 03:43:50.900]  I thank you for your support, but regardless, these are great products you need.
[03:43:50.900 --> 03:43:51.900]  So take action now.
[03:43:51.900 --> 03:43:56.900]  Go to info or store.com for both this great toothpaste back in stock.
[03:43:56.900 --> 03:44:00.900]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:44:00.900 --> 03:44:04.900]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:44:04.900 --> 03:44:06.900]  There is a bulletin from PBS news.
[03:44:06.900 --> 03:44:09.900]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:44:09.900 --> 03:44:12.900]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:44:12.900 --> 03:44:17.900]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:44:17.900 --> 03:44:20.900]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:44:20.900 --> 03:44:24.900]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:44:24.900 --> 03:44:27.900]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[03:44:27.900 --> 03:44:28.900]  It just can't happen.
[03:44:28.900 --> 03:44:30.900]  We need to go into the capital.
[03:44:30.900 --> 03:44:32.900]  Death, death, death.
[03:44:32.900 --> 03:44:34.900]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:44:34.900 --> 03:44:36.900]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:44:36.900 --> 03:44:38.900]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:44:38.900 --> 03:44:40.900]  You silenced those voices.
[03:44:40.900 --> 03:44:44.900]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:44:44.900 --> 03:44:51.900]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[03:45:14.900 --> 03:45:17.900]  I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:45:17.900 --> 03:45:21.900]  I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:45:21.900 --> 03:45:26.900]  The one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[03:45:26.900 --> 03:45:30.900]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:34.900]  I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:45:34.900 --> 03:45:38.900]  It really is true that brain force is something I use every day.
[03:45:38.900 --> 03:45:40.900]  It helps me with my writing.
[03:45:40.900 --> 03:45:41.900]  We love you.
[03:45:41.900 --> 03:45:42.900]  We'll be right back.
[03:45:42.900 --> 03:45:46.900]  Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:46.900 --> 03:45:48.900]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[03:45:56.900 --> 03:45:59.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:45:59.900 --> 03:46:04.900]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words plan for our future.
[03:46:04.900 --> 03:46:05.900]  That is a hellish future.
[03:46:05.900 --> 03:46:09.900]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:46:09.900 --> 03:46:12.900]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:46:12.900 --> 03:46:15.900]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:15.900 --> 03:46:18.900]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:46:18.900 --> 03:46:21.900]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:46:21.900 --> 03:46:23.900]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[03:46:23.900 --> 03:46:26.900]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:46:26.900 --> 03:46:29.900]  a signed copy, at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:29.900 --> 03:46:33.900]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:46:33.900 --> 03:46:36.900]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:46:36.900 --> 03:46:38.900]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:46:38.900 --> 03:46:42.900]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:46:42.900 --> 03:46:45.900]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[03:46:45.900 --> 03:46:48.900]  to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy
[03:46:48.900 --> 03:46:51.900]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[03:46:51.900 --> 03:46:53.900]  or give them to the local school.
[03:46:53.900 --> 03:46:54.900]  This is an Infowar.
[03:46:54.900 --> 03:46:56.900]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:46:57.900 --> 03:47:02.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:47:02.900 --> 03:47:04.900]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:23.800]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front line report.
[03:47:23.800 --> 03:47:32.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:35.320]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.320 --> 03:47:38.920]  I'm your guest host, Royce White, live from Minneapolis, the belly of the beast.
[03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:46.280]  I want to say thank you again to the entire InfoWars team, Alex Jones, Owen, everybody there
[03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:52.920]  for allowing me to host this hour and be able to continue to share my thoughts and ideas and
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:57.640]  beliefs on this platform with this incredible audience. I appreciate the audience and all your
[03:47:57.640 --> 03:48:03.400]  feedback. Please remember to go check the Band.Video channel, subscribe, like the channel,
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:07.640]  go watch some of the videos, leave some comments. We got that up and running now to mirror all of
[03:48:07.640 --> 03:48:14.440]  the podcast material happening on Please Call Me Crazy. That's my podcast. It premieres Monday,
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:20.760]  Wednesday, Friday at 9 p.m. I'm on episode 56, fast approaching episode 100, fast approaching
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:28.520]  a million downloads on the audio platforms, Apple, Spotify, what is it, Google Play, Amazon.
[03:48:28.520 --> 03:48:34.280]  We have yet to be centered on the audio platforms, which is a great sign of an optimistic sign for
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:42.280]  the times to come. And you can go see myself and Alex Jones. I interviewed Alex Jones for
[03:48:42.280 --> 03:48:47.000]  episode number 18, which was pulled down from YouTube, removed from YouTube without great
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:53.400]  explanation as to why. You can go see that interview still on Rumble or you can listen
[03:48:53.400 --> 03:48:57.640]  to it on the audio platforms. It was a legendary one. I thought Alex Jones shared a lot of
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:03.880]  some deep insight. I'm going to get Alex Jones back on soon to the podcast, and we won't even
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:08.280]  bother with YouTube because, hey, I guess I'm going to get a strike if I have Alex Jones back
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:14.200]  on the podcast. Maybe we'll wait to get Alex Jones in studio to drop that bomb on YouTube and
[03:49:14.200 --> 03:49:19.480]  big tech. Because, hey, Joe Rogan can have Alex Jones in studio three times, but the black guy in Minneapolis,
[03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:24.920]  Minnesota, he can't. I don't know. Who knows with these people? Anyway, thankful to Alex Jones and
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:32.200]  the entire crew for allowing me to be on and host this hour. But let's get down to brass
[03:49:32.200 --> 03:49:38.600]  tack here. I think I laid out well how this entire debt crisis is a fugazi. Who sets the price? They
[03:49:38.600 --> 03:49:43.720]  set the price. They set the price. They set the terms. They set the narrative. The narrative is
[03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:48.600]  that the United States dollar is losing its power because China is going to take supremacy and the
[03:49:48.600 --> 03:49:56.360]  rest of the world is all in on this China-centric global economy. Let them have it.
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:04.360]  Let them have it. All we need is a politician, a leader with some spine and some balls who will
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:12.680]  make these matters, these economic matters, the issue of the economy a matter of national
[03:50:12.680 --> 03:50:17.640]  security, which it most certainly is, and become self-sufficient. We have everything we need to do it.
[03:50:18.360 --> 03:50:30.840]  We can restart our supply chains in 24 months. We can restart any supply chain within 24 months
[03:50:30.840 --> 03:50:38.760]  in this country. Easy, easy. In the meantime, our military can safeguard. Our military can withstand.
[03:50:38.760 --> 03:50:43.560]  Nobody's attacking us here. You can't attack America on America's soil. Everybody knows that.
[03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:50.360]  You need a nuke. You need a nuke, or maybe you need some strange UFO invasion. Don't put it past
[03:50:50.360 --> 03:50:56.680]  our own political elites, our own crude capitalist political corporate financial elites to be
[03:50:56.680 --> 03:51:03.320]  involved in a scam that would actually bring military destruction, a genuine military destruction
[03:51:03.320 --> 03:51:12.440]  from up above, I guess, UFOs, as a false flag, as a justification as to why America faces actual
[03:51:12.440 --> 03:51:17.160]  invasion in the future. Everything's on the table now. Everything's up on the bar.
[03:51:17.160 --> 03:51:20.680]  We got to be ready. As citizens, we got to be prepared. We got to be informed.
[03:51:20.680 --> 03:51:24.600]  We got to be ready to answer the call of citizenship and fight for freedom.
[03:51:25.240 --> 03:51:32.440]  But if all things stay the course, our military is just fine. Our military can guard against
[03:51:32.440 --> 03:51:39.080]  any threat. There's nobody invading America. There's nobody landing on the beaches of Miami
[03:51:39.080 --> 03:51:46.840]  or the beaches of Virginia or the beaches of San Jose or Los Angeles or anywhere else.
[03:51:48.200 --> 03:51:52.760]  The beaches of Maine, the cliffs of Maine, nobody's making landfall on American soil.
[03:51:52.760 --> 03:51:58.520]  They know they can't. Of course they can't. 700 million guns. And that is the key to our
[03:51:58.520 --> 03:52:04.520]  sovereignty. That was the brilliance that America's founding fathers put in our Constitution.
[03:52:04.520 --> 03:52:10.360]  And it's why this world order has gone out of its way to undermine the Second Amendment and to
[03:52:10.360 --> 03:52:15.640]  undo the Constitution, because they know it's the last thing that stands in their way for all-out
[03:52:15.640 --> 03:52:23.000]  global authoritarian governance. Go ahead, make landfall. Make landfall on American soil. You'll
[03:52:23.960 --> 03:52:30.120]  face a hail of gunfire every couple of blocks, every few square miles, because as much as these
[03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:36.520]  liberals, as much as these Democrats, as much as these black bourgeoisie sellouts in the inner
[03:52:36.520 --> 03:52:45.000]  cities think that they're anti-white, they're anti-Republican, wait till the CCP shows up.
[03:52:46.200 --> 03:52:51.240]  See how the CCP showed up in the Congo? Wait until the CCP shows up and they show you just
[03:52:51.240 --> 03:52:56.920]  how racist the Chinese elites can be. When they show you black folks, then we'll see
[03:52:57.640 --> 03:53:06.440]  how willing you are to accept post-World War II democratic liberal order transhumanist
[03:53:07.560 --> 03:53:12.600]  fourth industrial revolution chains. Everybody says it in theory, oh, this is great.
[03:53:13.320 --> 03:53:19.720]  Give me an apartment in a line city. Give me an apartment in a line city and a Tesla,
[03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:23.000]  which I don't need to drive because I'm in a line city. So why do we even need electric
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:26.680]  vehicles? That tells you it's a scam right there. Give me a line city apartment.
[03:53:27.320 --> 03:53:36.040]  And give me a cricket burger and give me a glory hole and a dildo. And I'm great. I'm fine.
[03:53:37.160 --> 03:53:43.000]  This is life. Yeah, well, that's what they put on television. But your average working class
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:49.960]  black person or any working class person who may vote Democrat, when the tyranny really hits,
[03:53:49.960 --> 03:53:55.640]  they'll reject it. They'll reject it. Americans do not do well with authority
[03:53:56.280 --> 03:54:00.200]  in general. I mean, it's just baked in. And I believe in that part of us is baked in.
[03:54:00.200 --> 03:54:03.160]  Don't get me wrong. We'll believe a scam as long as it benefits us.
[03:54:03.880 --> 03:54:09.640]  As long as the narrative in the scam benefits us, we'll play along. But when it starts to get overt,
[03:54:09.640 --> 03:54:14.680]  people reject it. They reject it on face value. And I believe in the spirit of the American people
[03:54:14.680 --> 03:54:19.320]  will prevail in that way. So with that being said, nobody's making landfall. They know there's too
[03:54:19.320 --> 03:54:26.200]  many guns. They know nobody's air air force is invading our airspace. Nobody has the submarines
[03:54:26.200 --> 03:54:30.120]  we have. Nobody has any of the military capacity that we have.
[03:54:30.300 --> 03:54:37.259]  The military is going to be fine while we get the manufacturing back online, while we
[03:54:37.259 --> 03:54:47.660]  sever all ties with the CCP, while we close the gaping hole in our foreign policy and
[03:54:47.660 --> 03:54:53.740]  national security by getting our antibiotics made by the Chinese.
[03:54:53.740 --> 03:55:01.980]  This whole thing is a post-colonial cuck carrying water for the crown and the European monarchy.
[03:55:01.980 --> 03:55:08.380]  They need Russian oil. They need to fear the Chinese coming across the Eurasian world island
[03:55:08.380 --> 03:55:17.660]  and invading and pressuring Europe. They need NATO. We don't. We don't need NATO. We don't
[03:55:17.660 --> 03:55:21.859]  need NATO to protect us. We don't need any of the other countries in NATO to protect
[03:55:21.859 --> 03:55:31.220]  us. And finally, if what we're going to do is protect the entire world based purely on
[03:55:31.220 --> 03:55:37.820]  freedom and democracy or individual rights, then it's conspicuous that the same political
[03:55:37.820 --> 03:55:46.220]  elites who make that claim do everything to undermine those rights right here at home.
[03:55:46.220 --> 03:55:49.820]  It's a rightful reason to be skeptical in the things they proclaim around why they're
[03:55:49.820 --> 03:55:55.179]  doing what they're doing. They're not going to the Ukraine to make it a shining beacon
[03:55:55.179 --> 03:56:01.099]  of democracy. That's the whole lie. It's been the lie since World War II. They're in
[03:56:01.099 --> 03:56:05.740]  the Ukraine in a geopolitical game of risk to pressure the Russians to prevent the Chinese
[03:56:05.740 --> 03:56:13.420]  from coming through the Eurasian world island into Europe to uphold the military dominance
[03:56:13.420 --> 03:56:19.300]  that we inherited from the British Empire after World War II. That's what we're doing
[03:56:19.300 --> 03:56:24.619]  in the Ukraine. We're upholding the Mackinder World Island Theory. It's exactly what we're
[03:56:24.619 --> 03:56:28.699]  doing in the Ukraine. And everybody with half a brain knows it. And if you get the right
[03:56:28.699 --> 03:56:33.140]  person on the right day from within the machine, they're not even shy to say it. They just
[03:56:33.140 --> 03:56:40.859]  hope that you spend more time on Pornhub than you do on, you know, the Federal Register.
[03:56:40.859 --> 03:56:45.699]  That's the reality. The establishment hopes that you spend more time on Pornhub than you
[03:56:45.699 --> 03:56:49.900]  do on the Federal Register. Well, me, I spend more time on the Federal Register. That's
[03:56:49.900 --> 03:56:58.099]  just me. You know, I hope you'll do the same. I hope you'll continue to look for the truth,
[03:56:58.099 --> 03:57:02.060]  to see the truth. And understand when you go into those polls in 2024, it's not the
[03:57:02.060 --> 03:57:06.460]  be all end all, but it's a great start. And then we need to elect somebody and hold somebody
[03:57:06.460 --> 03:57:09.519]  accountable to make drastic changes on day one.
[03:57:09.519 --> 03:57:13.340]  But in order for them to do that, in order for them to make those drastic changes, they
[03:57:13.340 --> 03:57:18.340]  have to feel like you're ready for them. They have to believe that we're ready for
[03:57:18.340 --> 03:57:22.740]  them, that we'll support those drastic changes, that we'll support what many will call is
[03:57:22.740 --> 03:57:26.859]  radical. There's nothing more radical than losing your freedom and your citizenship to
[03:57:26.859 --> 03:57:31.699]  a global government, a government that doesn't know your name, that doesn't know your child's
[03:57:31.699 --> 03:57:39.420]  name, that doesn't know anything but tyranny and ambition for more power and control.
[03:57:39.420 --> 03:57:44.220]  That's it for me, Royce White here in the belly of the beast. The fight continues, Godspeed.
[03:57:45.300 --> 03:57:51.300]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce+.
[03:57:51.300 --> 03:57:53.300]  We made it even stronger.
[03:57:53.300 --> 03:57:57.300]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:57:57.300 --> 03:58:04.300]  TurboForce is back in stock at Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:58:04.300 --> 03:58:10.300]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:58:10.300 --> 03:58:12.300]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:58:12.300 --> 03:58:18.300]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:58:18.300 --> 03:58:24.300]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:58:24.300 --> 03:58:27.300]  It is the super fuel.
[03:58:27.300 --> 03:58:30.300]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:58:30.300 --> 03:58:32.300]  There are two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[03:58:32.300 --> 03:58:36.300]  But this is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[03:58:36.300 --> 03:58:41.300]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarstore.com.
[03:58:41.300 --> 03:58:44.300]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:58:46.300 --> 03:58:51.300]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[03:58:51.300 --> 03:58:53.300]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:58:53.300 --> 03:58:55.300]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:58:55.300 --> 03:58:59.300]  We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:58:59.300 --> 03:59:04.300]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:59:04.300 --> 03:59:09.300]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:59:09.300 --> 03:59:12.300]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[03:59:12.300 --> 03:59:15.300]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[03:59:15.300 --> 03:59:20.300]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:59:20.300 --> 03:59:22.300]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:59:22.300 --> 03:59:23.300]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:59:23.300 --> 03:59:26.300]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[03:59:26.300 --> 03:59:28.300]  Alex Jones for president, 2024.
[03:59:28.300 --> 03:59:31.300]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:59:31.300 --> 03:59:33.300]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:59:33.300 --> 03:59:41.300]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowars.com
[03:59:41.300 --> 03:59:45.300]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
