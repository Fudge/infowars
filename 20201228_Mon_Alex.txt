[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  It's Monday December 28th. The year is 2020. I am your host Alex Jones. We are live. We
[00:11.920 --> 00:20.220]  are broadcasting worldwide. We are witnessing America and President Trump's last stand.
[00:20.220 --> 00:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a drill. This is going toe-to-toe with the new world
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.880]  order and Trump has now been forced to sign a deal with the devil.
[00:27.880 --> 00:32.280]  The crepit multi-millionaire speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:32.280 --> 00:40.200]  What took so long, what took so long is because we could not get our Republican colleagues
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.880]  to crush the virus. I couldn't understand it. Why would they not want to invest in the
[00:46.880 --> 00:54.840]  science that has told us so importantly that it required testing, tracing, treatment, separation,
[00:54.840 --> 01:00.880]  sanitation, total fraud, and the rest? Creepy Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
[01:00.880 --> 01:07.240]  We all know that President Trump has made the economy a mess by how he treated the pandemic.
[01:07.240 --> 01:13.280]  We all know that President Biden is entering his presidency in an economic deep hole caused
[01:13.280 --> 01:19.880]  by President Trump. And their minions of anti-America media filth have persevered and
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.280]  bamboozled America into accepting the crumbs of a long and chaotically negotiated stimulus
[01:26.280 --> 01:31.960]  package benefiting everyone the world over, except the people paying for it.
[01:31.960 --> 01:38.400]  I think as he leaves office, I understand he wants to be remembered for advocating for
[01:38.400 --> 01:46.240]  big checks, but the danger is he'll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior
[01:46.240 --> 01:48.520]  if he allows this to expire.
[01:48.520 --> 01:52.440]  He did tell us that he alone would fix the country's problems. What he didn't mention
[01:52.440 --> 01:55.920]  was that it would create many of those crises and then act like he solved them.
[01:55.920 --> 02:02.400]  We have an extraordinary narcissist, pathologically narcissistic in the White House. He said, well,
[02:02.400 --> 02:08.480]  yes, I know there were intense negotiations. You passed a $908 billion bill. It has, you
[02:08.480 --> 02:12.640]  know, extending unemployment. It has direct payments. It has this, that and everything
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.560]  else. But you know what? I've now decided that I'm going to jump into the game and
[02:17.560 --> 02:24.200]  I want $2,000. Well, I want $2,000. The American people want $2,000. They need it, given the
[02:24.200 --> 02:30.000]  economic crisis. So what we need to do is have the president sign that bill today right
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  now.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.120]  I think the fact that the president, as you said, deep six this bill and then went off
[02:34.120 --> 02:40.080]  to Mar-a-Lago to have his holiday when unemployment benefits ran out yesterday and you look at
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.800]  what is in that bill on the COVID relief sides, $400 million for food banks. How many times
[02:44.800 --> 02:50.360]  have we talked about the lines of Americans sitting in their cars, stretching miles, sometimes
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.360]  down highways?
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.640]  I don't know what kind of game he's playing. I don't know what the Republicans are going
[02:55.640 --> 03:01.720]  to do. But you know, they're all frightened of him and he's intimidated them. They don't
[03:01.720 --> 03:07.800]  have any guts. And so let's see if he's going to make them come up with support for the
[03:07.800 --> 03:09.360]  $2,000.
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.920]  It was vetoed for nonsensical reasons. This whole section 230, which has nothing to do
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.440]  with national defense or the NDA. Somebody just got in the president's ear and convinced
[03:18.440 --> 03:19.440]  him.
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.880]  Neglecting a United States rocked by COVID shutdowns and economic disaster, the career
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.400]  politicians broke the stalemate and put a gun to the head of the American taxpayer and
[03:30.400 --> 03:32.320]  their duly elected president.
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.960]  The reason you get these massive bills is that Congress is supposed to break those down
[03:35.960 --> 03:40.000]  into 12 bills during the year, but they're lazy and they don't. So they throw it all
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.480]  together at one bill at the end of the year and essentially challenge any president to
[03:44.480 --> 03:47.800]  either sign it or shut the government down. I think the president was sending the message
[03:47.800 --> 03:52.800]  that Congress is broken and it is. I think a lot of us were relieved he did sign the
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.880]  bill because I don't think it was a plan if he didn't. But I don't think he's happy
[03:56.880 --> 03:57.880]  about it.
[03:57.880 --> 04:03.360]  The Democrats pushed the stimulus into the Christmas season, knowing full well that President
[04:03.360 --> 04:08.440]  Trump would have no other option than to sign it or bear the brunt of carrying the
[04:08.440 --> 04:14.680]  burden of allowing 12 million Americans to lose their jobless benefits. Billions of foreign
[04:14.680 --> 04:20.360]  aid will now pour out of our tax dollars, filling the coffers of new world order pet
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.440]  projects.
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.400]  When was the last time you spoke with the president about this?
[04:25.400 --> 04:30.840]  I don't speak with the president. Why not call him and say, Mr. President, let's work
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.800]  out a deal. It's not going to be everything you want. Not going to be everything I want.
[04:34.800 --> 04:40.120]  But there are so many Americans right now who are in desperate need. Let's make a deal.
[04:40.120 --> 04:45.640]  What makes me amused, if it weren't so sad, is how you all think that you know more about
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.640]  the suffering of the American people than those of us who are elected by them to represent
[04:50.640 --> 04:52.040]  them at that table.
[04:52.040 --> 04:58.720]  I implore you, my fellow Americans, to send your $600 check back to the pit of hell.
[04:58.720 --> 05:05.240]  This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed and understand about the value
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.600]  of essential vitamins and minerals, meaning if you don't have them, you die long term.
[05:09.600 --> 05:13.680]  It's for new listeners. The power structure works around the clock to try to debilitate
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.960]  you and try to make you sickly. Please research, because this is life and death, vitamins that
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.520]  are essential and minerals that are essential. Just type that into a search engine. You will
[05:23.520 --> 05:28.240]  see the top universities, CDC, all of them telling you this, but you won't see this on
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.240]  the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies to understand
[05:33.240 --> 05:37.400]  how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world on a routine
[05:37.400 --> 05:38.400]  basis.
[05:38.400 --> 05:43.760]  We now have back and stock, Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.400]  your body's immune system, back and stock, sold out for months. It is essential, it is
[05:48.400 --> 05:53.520]  vital, and it is 50% off, so you have no excuse but to get it for yourself and your family.
[05:53.520 --> 06:04.200]  Winter Sun, back and stock 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[06:04.200 --> 06:11.640]  Start your engines, my friends. It's Monday, December 28th. The year is 2021. We have several
[06:11.640 --> 06:17.640]  very informative guests that are going to be joining us coming up today, and I'm going
[06:17.640 --> 06:23.120]  to lay out just exactly where we are on planet Earth in the fight against the globalist.
[06:23.120 --> 06:28.960]  As first President Trump of the weekend tweeted out a very powerful video titled Man in America
[06:28.960 --> 06:36.720]  2020 Has Been a Year Like No Other. Here is that report.
[06:36.720 --> 06:49.440]  2020 has been a year like no other. Everything we know, everything we trust, and everything
[06:49.440 --> 07:01.640]  we've come to rely on has changed. So how can we expect the US election to be any different?
[07:01.640 --> 07:08.160]  Mainstream media are telling us the race is over. Biden won. Time to move on. Nothing
[07:08.160 --> 07:16.520]  to see here, folks. But in your gut, you know something's just not right. From the strange
[07:16.520 --> 07:23.400]  patterns on election night, to the weeks of suspense, to the reports of fraud that evaporate
[07:23.400 --> 07:33.640]  faster than Biden's memory. It just doesn't add up. Stay with me, and you'll see just
[07:33.640 --> 07:38.960]  what's going on behind the scenes in this election. And why the greatest threat we're
[07:38.960 --> 07:45.920]  facing right now is not an invisible enemy invading our bodies, but one that's invading
[07:45.920 --> 07:54.560]  our country and our minds.
[07:54.560 --> 08:01.760]  Welcome to Man in America. I'm your host, Seth Holhouse. Let me ask you, how do you
[08:01.760 --> 08:06.640]  know what's happening in the world right now? How do you know what's going on in this country,
[08:06.640 --> 08:11.280]  or even your city? I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you've probably turned
[08:11.280 --> 08:16.120]  into mainstream media, which includes social media. Perhaps you watch Tucker in the evenings,
[08:16.120 --> 08:20.840]  or read New York Times Sunday morning, or check Facebook on your lunch break. So how
[08:20.840 --> 08:24.920]  do you know what's going on in the US election? What did you think on election night when
[08:24.920 --> 08:30.400]  historically red states and battleground states were stalled while blue states were immediately
[08:30.400 --> 08:36.520]  called for Biden? Or when Fox called Arizona was so many votes still out, of course, for
[08:36.520 --> 08:43.320]  Biden. And how about the late night ballot dumps that were somehow all for Biden? And
[08:43.320 --> 08:48.240]  the batches of pristine mail-in ballots also all for Biden. And then there were the burst
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.920]  water pipes and the power outages and the computer glitches and issues with Sharpie
[08:52.920 --> 09:00.000]  pens and lost USB drives that somehow all favored Biden. And then we have the hordes
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.520]  of dead voters once again, all for Biden. The dead people really did vote for Biden.
[09:05.520 --> 09:10.240]  I fact checked it. And what are the odds that all the last minute changes to our election
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.760]  process in voting laws in the name of COVID also favored Biden? And how about all the
[09:15.760 --> 09:21.240]  counties with more votes than eligible voters or where they got more mail-in ballots than
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.920]  they even sent out? In Pennsylvania, they sent 1.8 million mail-in ballots and got back
[09:26.920 --> 09:33.200]  2.5 million. And last but not least, we've got Dominion, the voting system with ties
[09:33.200 --> 09:39.040]  to socialist Venezuela that was programmed to manipulate votes for Biden while sending
[09:39.040 --> 09:46.160]  our data to China, Iran, and Russia. And when the system crashed because of the Trump landslide,
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.560]  key battleground states simply decided to stop counting and head on home.
[09:51.560 --> 09:57.520]  When has this ever happened before in U.S. history? This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[09:57.520 --> 10:03.360]  Every one of these reports should be serious grounds for investigation. Thousands of poll
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.920]  workers, postal workers, election officials, and honest Americans, both Republican and
[10:07.920 --> 10:13.800]  Democrat, have come forward with photos, videos, and first-hand stories, affirmed by sworn
[10:13.800 --> 10:19.840]  affidavits documenting massive voter fraud. Social media has been flooded with them, yet
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.640]  mainstream media keeps asking, where is the evidence?
[10:24.640 --> 10:31.360]  Once everyone is gone, because it's clear, they are going to pull ballots out from underneath
[10:31.360 --> 10:39.960]  a table. Watch this table. Do you see the gentleman in the red? I said he just pulled
[10:39.960 --> 10:45.520]  one out. So what are these ballots doing there, separate from all the other ballots?
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.120]  And why are they only counting them whenever the place is cleared out with no witnesses?
[10:49.120 --> 10:50.120]  Where is the evidence?
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.680]  I'm here with Elliot right now at his wedding, and we were taking the trash out, and I wanted
[10:54.680 --> 11:00.320]  to show you guys what we found in the trash can at St. Ann's, which is a polling place.
[11:00.320 --> 11:11.760]  Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Trump. Trump. And there's
[11:11.760 --> 11:19.400]  more ballots in this trash can. But we will say we did find one Biden. Where is the evidence?
[11:19.400 --> 11:24.360]  Can you calculate how much of a vote that accounted for for Biden and how much for
[11:24.360 --> 11:25.360]  Trump?
[11:25.360 --> 11:30.560]  Close to 600,000. I think our figures are about 570-some-odd thousand that all those
[11:30.560 --> 11:32.280]  spikes represent over time.
[11:32.280 --> 11:33.280]  For Biden.
[11:33.280 --> 11:34.280]  Correct.
[11:34.280 --> 11:35.280]  And how much for Trump?
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.280]  I think it was lower than 3200.
[11:38.280 --> 11:46.680]  Now, hold on. Didn't they just drag us through a baseless four-year witch hunt into Russian
[11:46.680 --> 11:53.800]  election interference over far less evidence? And isn't it their job to be digging for evidence?
[11:53.800 --> 11:59.920]  Wouldn't Nixon have gotten away with Watergate if the media didn't dig for evidence?
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.480]  Not only aren't they digging for it right now, but they're burying it in a giant game
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.320]  of whack-a-mole, along with their comrades over at Twitter, Facebook, and Google.
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.040]  Of course, they had their fact-checkers debunk everything first. These arbiters of truth
[12:14.040 --> 12:20.760]  who have more conflicts of interest than flavors of ice cream in Nancy Pelosi's freezer.
[12:20.760 --> 12:26.440]  Even President Trump's tweets are so-called fact-checked and censored, and his press conferences
[12:26.440 --> 12:28.160]  are interrupted and cut off.
[12:28.160 --> 12:34.360]  Okay, here we are again in the unusual position of not only interrupting the president of
[12:34.360 --> 12:39.120]  the United States, but correcting the president of the United States.
[12:39.120 --> 12:44.920]  Think about what this means. The president of the United States of America is being censored
[12:44.920 --> 12:52.160]  by U.S. companies. This whole thing reeks of corruption. And not just corruption, but
[12:52.160 --> 12:59.600]  treason. It's such a joke that I'd be laughing if it wasn't so serious. But it is serious.
[12:59.600 --> 13:06.040]  Because let's assume for a moment that just a fraction of the fraud reports are true.
[13:06.040 --> 13:12.480]  If mainstream media and social media didn't let you see or even talk about them, how would
[13:12.480 --> 13:19.080]  you even know? Think about it. If our election was stolen and our government was overthrown
[13:19.080 --> 13:24.920]  and yet they kept it all hidden, how would you know?
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.680]  If mainstream media can completely control public opinion and the flow of information,
[13:30.680 --> 13:37.840]  including from our president, does the truth even matter? What if I told you that every
[13:37.840 --> 13:45.000]  single one of our mainstream media, including Fox, is being used as a tool to manipulate
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.920]  public opinion and steer the outcome of the election?
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.000]  Perhaps a year ago, you might have called me a conspiracy theorist. But considering we've
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.440]  all been living in a twilight zone lately, you're probably starting to realize that
[13:58.440 --> 14:05.640]  anything's possible. Just try to wrap your head around this. How did the media so accurately
[14:05.640 --> 14:12.680]  predict the long delays in counting votes and the red mirage before the blue wave? And why
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.560]  did they spend months downplaying the risks of mail-in ballots while sowing the seeds
[14:17.560 --> 14:23.880]  that Trump would claim voter fraud and refuse to concede? Do they have a crystal ball? Why
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.040]  did Hillary Clinton tell Biden not to concede under any circumstances all the way back in
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.560]  the summer? Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances.
[14:34.560 --> 14:40.120]  Why did they spend the last four years using every possible tactic to undermine Trump's
[14:40.120 --> 14:46.360]  presidency in the most relentless smear campaign the world has ever seen? And why did every
[14:46.360 --> 14:52.760]  single mainstream media rush to coordinate Biden and cement him into the public mind?
[14:52.760 --> 14:59.760]  And how do you understand why he told voters, I don't need you to get me elected?
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.800]  It never mattered that he hid in his basement all summer. It never mattered that only five
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.360]  people turned up to his rallies. And it never mattered that he couldn't even string a sentence
[15:09.360 --> 15:15.760]  together. It never mattered that the majority of Americans chose President Trump on November
[15:15.760 --> 15:21.240]  3rd. And it doesn't matter that their fraud is more obvious than the stains on Monica
[15:21.240 --> 15:27.160]  Lewinsky's dress. Because when you control every single channel of information, nothing
[15:27.160 --> 15:34.680]  else matters. Right now, big media, big tech, big government, the full video that you just
[15:34.680 --> 15:41.640]  saw is being posted as we speak to ban.video and reposted in the live show feed at infowars.com.
[15:41.640 --> 15:47.240]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. The name of the video is Man in America 2020 has been a year
[15:47.240 --> 15:51.160]  like no other. Be sure to share it. We'll be right back on the other side of cover
[15:51.160 --> 15:55.160]  all the latest breaking news. Take your phone calls and several guests during this critical
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.160]  juncture in history.
[15:56.160 --> 16:03.160]  You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard the
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.680]  very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of
[16:07.680 --> 16:13.800]  this world. They are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[16:13.800 --> 16:19.400]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to
[16:19.400 --> 16:25.000]  the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA
[16:25.000 --> 16:32.320]  vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[16:32.320 --> 16:40.120]  were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual
[16:40.120 --> 16:47.320]  inserts for the mRNA vaccines. And then remember, you've been warned. This is the equivalent
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.000]  of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.960]  are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in
[16:55.960 --> 16:56.960]  the end.
[16:56.960 --> 16:59.960]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding.
[16:59.960 --> 17:00.960]  How you doing, Alex?
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.520]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother, how are
[17:04.520 --> 17:05.520]  you?
[17:05.520 --> 17:10.560]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've been using
[17:10.560 --> 17:14.880]  it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I
[17:14.880 --> 17:21.360]  see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula
[17:21.360 --> 17:29.520]  has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[17:29.520 --> 17:31.680]  So people might want to take a look at that.
[17:31.680 --> 17:38.400]  All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high end products that
[17:38.400 --> 17:41.840]  they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor itself like 300
[17:41.840 --> 17:45.200]  bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like
[17:45.200 --> 17:46.200]  50 bucks.
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.680]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced
[17:50.680 --> 18:00.240]  this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[18:00.240 --> 18:23.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us on
[18:23.160 --> 18:31.120]  this live December 28th, Monday broadcast. I am your host Alex Jones and I intend to
[18:31.120 --> 18:37.160]  open the phones up here today and to take your phone calls on the state of the world,
[18:37.160 --> 18:42.160]  the election, globalism, the permanent medical tyranny lockdown that's being announced, people
[18:42.160 --> 18:47.560]  being arrested all over the United States, all over the world for daring to go outside
[18:47.560 --> 18:51.000]  or daring to open their business, but all the big globalist businesses can all stay
[18:51.000 --> 18:59.280]  open. This is the most obvious, flagrant authoritarian attack that the world has ever seen. It's
[18:59.280 --> 19:06.320]  just absolutely completely and totally stunning. So let me give the number out to respond to
[19:06.320 --> 19:13.020]  Trump signing the emergency relief bill. It's really just a foreign globalist, pork
[19:13.020 --> 19:18.160]  barrel operation or the pardons or any of that. You're welcome to call in and we can
[19:18.160 --> 19:23.040]  all get our brownie points with Twitter and Facebook criticizing Trump. But that all really
[19:23.040 --> 19:28.040]  becomes a distraction from the world government, Bill Gates, the UN, the forced inoculations,
[19:28.040 --> 19:35.480]  the COVID systems, Joe Biden, the chai comms and what they're carrying out against we,
[19:35.480 --> 19:41.520]  the people. And the fact that we're facing a world government and we're facing massive
[19:41.520 --> 19:48.720]  election fraud, stealing from us our right to vote and doing it in front of everyone
[19:48.720 --> 19:55.120]  setting that precedent. I mean, Donald Trump could be a bad guy. And if they stole the
[19:55.120 --> 20:00.200]  election from him, that's wrong. And that's dangerous. And it means we're in a technocracy
[20:00.200 --> 20:06.320]  of fraud, a digital globalist dictatorship. And so people can go, Oh, look, he pardon
[20:06.320 --> 20:10.880]  this guy that stole over a billion dollars from the government. Okay, great. I think
[20:10.880 --> 20:14.880]  that's a terrible idea. Jared Kushner's written all over it. Wonderful. We can talk all day
[20:14.880 --> 20:19.840]  about it. Go ahead. I don't like Jared Kushner. I don't like some of the things they've done.
[20:19.840 --> 20:25.400]  The issue here is he didn't pardon Assange yet. And that's disgusting. But all of that
[20:25.400 --> 20:30.080]  is a side issue to Joe Biden, a chai comm agent who says he's going to shut down our
[20:30.080 --> 20:35.760]  oil industry and shut off the coal industry, which will absolutely devastate our economy
[20:35.760 --> 20:39.520]  and make it impossible to even do business in this country. And we will be like Venezuela.
[20:39.520 --> 20:46.600]  And it's all being done by design. We're going in to bondage. This is a foreign globalist
[20:46.600 --> 20:52.520]  takeover. And if Trump's got something up his sleeve, he needs to play it. The truth
[20:52.520 --> 20:56.680]  is he does have something up his sleeve. They proved total fraud all over the country. The
[20:56.680 --> 21:01.520]  last report we played showed that to you in great detail. There's so much evidence coming
[21:01.520 --> 21:06.440]  out daily that just what comes out every day should overturn the election. And it's been
[21:06.440 --> 21:15.560]  coming out for a month and a half. I mean, we're coming up on two months. The inauguration
[21:15.560 --> 21:21.240]  is in 23 days. The coronation of the chai comm puppet. There's they've built the stage
[21:21.240 --> 21:26.360]  there. Biden says he's not going to have one. It's going to be virtual. Well, then why is
[21:26.360 --> 21:31.080]  the stage being built? Well, because Trump has refused to move out. Trump has refused
[21:31.080 --> 21:35.800]  to go. He's told his age, everybody, don't start packing the furniture, the clothing
[21:35.800 --> 21:44.160]  or stuff that's ours. We're not leaving. Well, what do you expect President Trump to do?
[21:44.160 --> 21:51.980]  President Trump shouldn't leave. President Trump shouldn't go. If it's fraud, he should
[21:51.980 --> 21:56.920]  fight on and that's what he's doing. So I like the fact Trump's doing that. I don't
[21:56.920 --> 22:02.760]  want Trump to step down. We elected President Trump in one way or another. Either by overturning
[22:02.760 --> 22:09.680]  the election and showing it's a fraud and getting Congress to act on January 6th and
[22:09.680 --> 22:16.680]  not certify it for Biden or whether we end up impeaching Joe Biden or getting him arrested
[22:16.680 --> 22:22.160]  to chai comm agent one way or another, he will be removed. And that's what I said in
[22:22.160 --> 22:27.680]  my speech a few weeks ago in DC that made national headlines claiming I said, kill Joe
[22:27.680 --> 22:31.960]  Biden. Really, why haven't I been arrested? Why? Because that's not what I said. Secret
[22:31.960 --> 22:37.760]  Service hasn't called me. The last thing I want is for Joe Biden to get assassinated.
[22:37.760 --> 22:41.520]  That's how they can turn lemons and eliminate. That's how they can make that guy a victim
[22:41.520 --> 22:48.880]  and a good guy when he's a bad guy. Then we'll have Kamala Harris, probably worse. Secret
[22:48.880 --> 22:54.560]  Service knows I'm on record not once, not twice, but three times getting crazy people
[22:54.560 --> 23:01.000]  arrested who were actually stockpiling weapons and planning to kill presidents. These crazies
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.160]  have sent us letters and called us before and said, I'm going to kill George W. Bush.
[23:05.160 --> 23:08.520]  I'm going to kill Obama. You know what I do? I pick the phone up and I call the Secret
[23:08.520 --> 23:14.760]  Service. And when the Democrats were all over the news saying that they were going to kill
[23:14.760 --> 23:18.920]  Trump, I made a big deal about it on air and the Secret Service called me and said, send
[23:18.920 --> 23:25.000]  us your information and Trump told you to give us a briefing. They had the former head
[23:25.000 --> 23:35.000]  of the CIA assassination squads on TV saying, we're going to kill this guy. That's real.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.780]  So again, we're entering the phase of false flags. A lot of questions about what really
[23:39.780 --> 23:44.320]  happened at the bombing in Nashville. We've got Joe Scowze and World Affairs Brief who's
[23:44.320 --> 23:49.520]  got a lot of excellent analysis joining us on that front. Tom Pappert will look at the
[23:49.520 --> 23:55.600]  days to come and the so-called stimulus relief package that Trump says he's redlined. He's
[23:55.600 --> 23:59.640]  going to send back. He signed it, but red lines that they promise they'll change. We
[23:59.640 --> 24:04.640]  have $2,000 every American. At least that is money. We're going to have inflation to
[24:04.640 --> 24:08.200]  the American people. At least we're going to tax Americans to pay other Americans. At
[24:08.200 --> 24:13.160]  least it's Americans. Most of it goes to offshore globalist operations. So I'm not
[24:13.160 --> 24:17.960]  defending what Trump did. I don't like less sort of two evils, but the media trying to
[24:17.960 --> 24:21.840]  stonewall the fact that he tried to get the Port Merrill cut out and a lot of bad stuff
[24:21.840 --> 24:26.640]  cut out is just another example of what horrible, disgusting criminals they are. But I won't
[24:26.640 --> 24:31.560]  explain something. I'm not in the business of defending President Trump. I've done nothing
[24:31.560 --> 24:37.160]  but gotten persecuted for supporting Trump because he's a nationalist and a patriot and
[24:37.160 --> 24:42.080]  it does what he thinks is best with what he's got. And I've gone through nothing but hell
[24:42.080 --> 24:47.120]  and I've almost been basically bankrupted defending this republic. But don't worry for
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.000]  all of you that like to nitpick on Trump and say you should have done this better or should
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.920]  have done that better when he's in the arena. Don't worry. You're going to probably get
[24:54.920 --> 25:00.080]  Joe Biden and hell on earth and they're never taking their boot off of our neck again. They
[25:00.080 --> 25:07.400]  have said that they are on record and it's going to be hellish. So let me ask you this
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.880]  question. What is the most important development in the world? It's the COVID ongoing lockdown.
[25:12.880 --> 25:18.400]  100 million is designed to break us forever. China is open for business. They're bragging
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.040]  that we'll never be open because we didn't quote handle COVID right. It's totally made
[25:24.040 --> 25:29.640]  up, totally hyped. PCR tests are fake. It's all admitted. This is strategic technocracy.
[25:29.640 --> 25:34.120]  And if we don't stop that, we have no damn future. And we need the state legislatures
[25:34.120 --> 25:38.480]  and the people to rise up and not comply and start saying no because they only are going
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.840]  to keep clamping down. We have all the documents I'll be covering coming up. But I want to
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.520]  open the phones up to ask first time callers and people to disagree, agree. It doesn't
[25:47.520 --> 25:51.880]  matter what your view is on the world and what you think the number one item is. I don't
[25:51.880 --> 25:59.720]  think the number one item is Iran. I don't think the number one item is even the Clintons
[25:59.720 --> 26:05.120]  being corrupt and I want to see them go to jail. The number one issue is not Trump's
[26:05.120 --> 26:10.680]  stupid parts, which I disagree with. These latest ones is terrible. The number one issues
[26:10.680 --> 26:16.040]  world government, new world order, technocracy, passports to travel to leave your house, digital
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.760]  IDs, total control. It's not coming. It's here. So I want to know what you think the number
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.080]  one issue is and what we should do about it. It's the election fraud, the globalist takeover,
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.880]  the COVID-19. It all goes together to wreck the economy so that we would not support Trump.
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.600]  It didn't work. We still reelected him. So now they stole it. But that shows how weak
[26:34.600 --> 26:39.400]  they are. And they're actually in a bad position if we don't just accept what they've done.
[26:39.400 --> 26:52.520]  All right, toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789. Alex, again, 877-789-2539. We will take your
[26:52.520 --> 26:58.520]  phone calls. Coming up, stay with us. It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities
[26:58.520 --> 27:02.920]  all over the world, not just the U.S. They encourage people to live in tents. Cities is
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.680]  homeless and they use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime. It's because the globalists
[27:07.680 --> 27:13.680]  admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course, the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[27:13.680 --> 27:17.280]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to
[27:17.280 --> 27:20.880]  think of a civilization that gets better. They don't want you to think of civilization
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.560]  that gets progressively worse. The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge
[27:25.560 --> 27:30.560]  private mistakes. They are separate from us. Their children go to private tutors. They
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.760]  admit this. Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other so that
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.760]  we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure. The infrastructure
[27:40.760 --> 27:46.440]  that's left under 5G is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks. This is all their
[27:46.440 --> 27:50.960]  admitted plan. The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.880]  gone operational. It's a post-human future. You better find out about it right now.
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.560]  Winter Sun has been sold out for months. It's now back in stock. It's the highest quality
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.160]  vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere. You take it out of the tongue for maximum absorption
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.560]  or just put it in your mouth and drink it down. It's absolutely an essential vitamin
[28:10.560 --> 28:15.040]  meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die. The system
[28:15.040 --> 28:17.880]  doesn't want you to know this. They don't want you to know that they've lowered the
[28:17.880 --> 28:22.480]  allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly
[28:22.480 --> 28:26.680]  and easy to control. But now we have Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K that helps

[29:50.880 --> 29:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:20.880 --> 30:37.880]  We are back live. Thank you so much again for joining us on this December 28, 2020 transmission.
[30:37.880 --> 30:45.280]  It's really amazing. We're about to be in the year 2021 and we are under a planetary corporate
[30:45.280 --> 30:53.920]  world government revolution of a scientific elite and that's how they describe themselves
[30:53.920 --> 31:04.320]  that believe they're going to just rewrite the entire genome of the planet and establish
[31:04.320 --> 31:14.080]  this world government to carry out that operation. And so this is really, really a big deal.
[31:14.080 --> 31:21.480]  This is not a game. This is not a joke. And I took off a couple of days last week, really
[31:21.480 --> 31:28.640]  just Friday and Saturday. Well, I didn't come in and work Saturday, but I took off more
[31:28.640 --> 31:34.760]  than I normally do. And I don't want to say I have a sense of peace about this, but we
[31:34.760 --> 31:42.200]  really are a decadent, lazy, stupid world. And so the globalists are the worst of us.
[31:42.200 --> 31:46.000]  They call themselves the guardians of the watchers and they're doing all this, they believe
[31:46.000 --> 31:52.040]  because it's their job. But if you study them, they're the most hateful, unhappy people
[31:52.040 --> 31:59.680]  there are. And they're into the most degenerate things as well. But it really is true that
[31:59.680 --> 32:10.520]  the public is very sheep-like and very greedy and very stupid and loves to be lied to and
[32:10.520 --> 32:17.560]  domesticated. And so because of that, and all the bad things we've allowed to happen
[32:17.560 --> 32:21.320]  to others and because we've allowed ourselves to become disposable and our children and
[32:21.320 --> 32:27.200]  our old people become disposable, and because the public is so drugged out and in such a
[32:27.200 --> 32:34.640]  stupor with all the big pharma drugs and all the illegal drugs and all the alcohol, they
[32:34.640 --> 32:38.680]  pretty much got us where they want us. And when I sit up here, I'm not on a high horse,
[32:38.680 --> 32:41.480]  you know, I've done things I shouldn't do, I've drank too much, I've done things like
[32:41.480 --> 32:46.720]  that. When I'm pointing a finger at you, I'm pointing three more back at myself. But I
[32:46.720 --> 32:52.440]  can tell you, our worst analysis is coming true. That means everything else they said
[32:52.440 --> 32:57.120]  they're going to do, they're going to do, and that means killing all of us. So their
[32:57.120 --> 33:06.960]  timetables, by the way, are now becoming public. And I could sit up here and, you know, distract
[33:06.960 --> 33:12.880]  off and read off all the stuff in the pork barrel package and get mad about $15 million
[33:12.880 --> 33:16.680]  for shrimp on treadmills. You know, they've got, that's a real thing happened 10 years
[33:16.680 --> 33:22.520]  ago, that's similar things are in this legislation. But at the end of the day, that's really all
[33:22.520 --> 33:27.600]  just window dressing. It's all just outrage about something we've already allowed that
[33:27.600 --> 33:40.320]  we have a sleep at the switch, criminal establishment at the mid level. And at the top, people like
[33:40.320 --> 33:43.960]  Chuck E. Schumer, you think, well, Schumer is just a senator, he's a puppet. Yeah, but
[33:43.960 --> 33:49.080]  if you study Schumer, he's in the inner club. And I mean, that dude really hates everybody
[33:49.080 --> 33:55.400]  and wants to kill you. I mean, he is a monster. You say, why does he want that? He wants total
[33:55.400 --> 34:02.320]  power and he hates reality. He hates God. He's a Satanist, a true Satanist. And he wants
[34:02.320 --> 34:11.360]  to invert reality. His protoge, a man he worshiped. Anthony Weiner is his idea of a God. All
[34:11.360 --> 34:19.920]  right. So you really just have to come to grips with the fact that we've let monsters
[34:19.920 --> 34:30.440]  get control. And they're mad scientists. And what do you know about folklore? Going that
[34:30.440 --> 34:35.400]  hundreds of years. When the first science fiction books were written like by Jules Verne's
[34:35.400 --> 34:44.480]  and others. What a mad scientist like to do. They like to cut people up and rearrange them
[34:44.480 --> 34:50.600]  in different shapes. They like to do horrible things. They like to defile women and children
[34:50.600 --> 34:58.520]  particularly. And all it is is a continuation of all the human sacrifice and all the devil
[34:58.520 --> 35:03.800]  worship that's been in every other culture. When those cultures decline and then fall.
[35:03.800 --> 35:17.880]  So we're following the absolute exact path that people follow for total collapse. And
[35:17.880 --> 35:26.320]  the Satanist, the cult, the globalists, the spiders, they are just organizing their governmental
[35:26.320 --> 35:33.680]  system in and around that collapse to control that collapse and to use that collapse as
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.320]  a consolidation of their power. So they're trying to play the part of God. They're judging
[35:40.320 --> 35:45.560]  us for our sins, even though they are the main conductor, whether it be of the train
[35:45.560 --> 35:57.360]  or of the symphony that are directing the symphony of vandalism, destruction, carnage.
[35:57.360 --> 36:06.400]  So I want to go to Manuel, Diana, Brent, Seth, Kurt, Joe, Wendy and others. We'll do that
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.240]  on the other side. It's funny we got a lady named Diana calling in. I don't like Marvel
[36:11.240 --> 36:16.040]  comics. I don't like these modern movies. They're all full of propaganda and very, very
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.760]  boring and have really stupid plots. A lot of men are kind of arrested development and
[36:22.760 --> 36:27.600]  spend their lives obsessing with it. But I got taken by some friends last night to see
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.320]  the new Wonder Woman movie. And I've seen the other two been basically forced to watch
[36:32.320 --> 36:37.880]  those as well. They were unwatchable. This one was next level propaganda. It was like
[36:37.880 --> 36:44.840]  a hallucination, flicker rates, everything. This is the future of mind control and a very
[36:44.840 --> 36:51.800]  positive message on the surface, a very negative one deeper into it. But it was very well done,
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.760]  very, very cheesy at one level, very sophisticated another. I mean, this is Stanley Kubrick level
[36:56.760 --> 37:05.840]  2.0. Very, very sophisticated. So when you go see that movie, you are basically being
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.880]  mind controlled. That was very, very evident with what was going on. I mean, they've got
[37:11.880 --> 37:18.520]  like 10 things going on at once. And when you do that, it puts somebody into a dream
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.440]  like state particularly. So this is beyond suspended disbelief. This is beyond lowering
[37:23.440 --> 37:30.160]  your brain waves to a near sleep state. This is beyond daydreaming. This was full on hallucination.
[37:30.160 --> 37:34.920]  And I was conscious of it second to second. But still, my brain was you need to stop watching
[37:34.920 --> 37:43.160]  this. This is not good. So it was next level, absolutely next level. And the whole theme
[37:43.160 --> 37:49.240]  is there's an end of world event coming. And we're the ones making it happen because we
[37:49.240 --> 37:54.400]  want too much. Because of our desires, we've got to give our will over to something else
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.640]  to stop it. But it tricks you, your will has been given over to this anti Christ character.
[37:59.640 --> 38:03.600]  But then you've got to denounce him, but give your will to another collective that is the
[38:03.600 --> 38:12.480]  goddess Diana. And but you've still given your will over. And it is and men are bad.
[38:12.480 --> 38:15.840]  Women are going to lead us out of this. And that's what the Carnegie Endowment was set
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.520]  up to do was to end the human species as we know it, not just going to end men, they're
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.320]  going to end women as well and make us create corporate creations that are patented and
[38:24.320 --> 38:32.440]  controlled. The globalist are God. And that's already here with the mRNA, mutinogenic, recombinant
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.800]  systems that actually mutate your entire body in live time when you take it. So again, lots
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.280]  of cheesiness, lots of kid stuff, lots of mindlessness, lots of 80s nostalgia, but that's for the
[38:43.280 --> 38:49.920]  that's just for your conscious brain behind it. All the other manipulations taking place.
[38:49.920 --> 38:57.920]  So I'll do a more in depth review later, but it was definitely definitely mind control
[38:57.920 --> 39:04.120]  and caliber of material. I definitely would not take it on LSD. All right, we're going
[39:04.120 --> 39:09.520]  to go to break. Come back with your phone calls on the other side and talk about where
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.520]  we're going. And this is the sun came up this morning. Where I tell you we're going. You
[39:14.520 --> 39:18.040]  already know you're going there because the globalist have seized the planet and we're
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.160]  on the train. They're the conductor and they're taking it straight to hell. There's a way
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.840]  to get off. But you have to address them face to face. You have to admit how much trouble
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.720]  you're in. I admit it. You admit it. You have to pray to God to deliver us. Then we've got
[39:31.720 --> 39:35.520]  to stop complying. But the global straight jacket, the force inoculation, the tracker
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.880]  chips, they're all here. It's all being announced. It's all being announced. And so, wow, it's
[39:41.880 --> 39:47.680]  all fulfilled. Isn't it? It's actually happening. What is the most important issue now 23 days
[39:47.680 --> 39:56.600]  from the inauguration of our new king? The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased,
[39:56.600 --> 39:59.040]  but I'm going to tell you all now. If you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try
[39:59.040 --> 40:04.280]  it. I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.120]  I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping. But
[40:08.120 --> 40:11.720]  as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite. And all the Infowars products
[40:11.720 --> 40:16.360]  are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other
[40:16.360 --> 40:22.360]  people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that
[40:22.360 --> 40:25.680]  person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today. You know, I'm going to spend
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.480]  my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer. I'm
[40:29.480 --> 40:32.720]  going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very
[40:32.720 --> 40:35.720]  often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate,
[40:35.720 --> 40:38.920]  you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.560]  one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know
[40:42.560 --> 40:45.800]  what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's
[40:45.800 --> 40:49.600]  why you need to go to Infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[40:49.600 --> 40:53.040]  Don't buy into the group. Think don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid's
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.040]  bad and the turbo force is good. Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction
[40:59.040 --> 41:03.680]  movie where if you've had a cold, it can be locked up in your home. You can be taken away.
[41:03.680 --> 41:09.280]  It can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.960]  your very DNA. That's where you are in the year 2020. Global government of the United
[41:13.960 --> 41:18.520]  Nations. All these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're
[41:18.520 --> 41:24.680]  doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19. That's what
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.320]  Klaus Schwab and others have said. Think about how it's saying that as, oh, a big tech's
[41:29.320 --> 41:32.520]  got to track you. They've got to trace you. They've got to control you. You've got to
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.640]  have absolutely your house. Why? You've got to have secret police come disappear you because,
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.800]  my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance of killing you. Give your ability to
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.720]  do it now, cancer or heart attack. This is their takeover. Imagine on America's dystopic
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.480]  hit, killed by the fear of the common cold. Yeah, that's fair monitoring. That's mind
[41:52.480 --> 41:53.480]  control.
[41:53.480 --> 42:00.480]  Hey, Alex. How you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense? Yes,
[42:00.480 --> 42:06.120]  sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.720]  fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on that show and
[42:11.720 --> 42:17.000]  give him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show, I'm gonna
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.120]  tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look, I'm 64
[42:23.120 --> 42:29.320]  years old, going on 20 thanks to this info store products. And by the way, I bought $800
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.040]  worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.600]  So what my my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.440]  getting a couple bottles of living defense? Now you got to follow that up with the micro
[42:43.440 --> 42:49.000]  VX. I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.240]  your call. We had no idea and I go to you a year later and you're here telling people
[42:53.240 --> 42:58.880]  about living defense, living defense, living defense, in four store dot com. Just in time

[44:17.440 --> 44:26.200]  media government coverups. You want to stop tyranny will so does he lie from Austin, Texas
[44:26.200 --> 44:34.840]  broadcasting world wide. It's Alex Jones. You know, if you're an American, you've been
[44:34.840 --> 44:38.000]  brought up that America's bad. America's terrible. It's the worst place on earth. We're the
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.200]  most oppressive people anywhere. And statistically, it's actually the opposite. But we're never
[44:42.200 --> 44:45.880]  taught about the evils and corruption that goes on in other places where tyranny is in
[44:45.880 --> 44:51.760]  charge. But when you look at historical tyranny through the last few thousand years and then
[44:51.760 --> 44:58.200]  current tyrannies and tyrannies the last 100 years, every form of tyranny, every form
[44:58.200 --> 45:02.960]  of abuse, every form of oppression and in really nasty stuff and the worst people being
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.560]  in charge is in the UN is in the world government is in the corporate governance is in the communist
[45:08.560 --> 45:19.240]  Chinese. And we are looking at America's deathbed watch here with 23 days to the inauguration.
[45:19.240 --> 45:23.280]  And Biden's incredibly weak. He can barely talk. He's a communist Chinese agent on record.
[45:23.280 --> 45:28.040]  His whole family has sold things out. He didn't win the election, but he's got the political
[45:28.040 --> 45:33.200]  machine, the mainstream media and the Republican leadership that's sick of President Trump
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.600]  because he's been making the decisions and actually been the president and their little
[45:37.600 --> 45:43.560]  committee system of running things has been out of business the last four years. And so
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.160]  this is all about these men and women having power to sell this country out, something
[45:49.160 --> 45:56.600]  they've been doing for 30, 40 years under the globalist program in their own admissions.
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.200]  And then they're going to try to blame the ongoing collapse on Trump as you've seen and
[46:01.200 --> 46:10.840]  COVID-19 or even John Hopkins admits, we've had as many deaths this year as last year.
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.400]  Some years in the last decade, we've had more deaths than we've had so far. And we've got
[46:15.400 --> 46:20.640]  a statistician degree statistician with the numbers and early in the new year, we will
[46:20.640 --> 46:27.760]  have you the actual numbers by statistician of the last decade, comparing year to year.
[46:27.760 --> 46:33.320]  And it looks like this will be the third worst year for death. And you would expect to be
[46:33.320 --> 46:42.360]  number one, because 10 years ago, our population was 320 million. It's about 370 million now.
[46:42.360 --> 46:51.760]  If you count the 50 million illegals that are in this country. So pretty amazing information.
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.720]  And when John Hopkins put that report out, they had snopes and everybody go, oh, it's
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.320]  false. So they go, well, all the years numbers aren't in. But at the study, they looked at
[47:01.320 --> 47:05.320]  that. They looked at last year, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.280]  more already than it will be this year. So they averaged in the rest of the year and
[47:09.280 --> 47:15.880]  found still about the same deaths. But they said, well, it's not totally scientific down
[47:15.880 --> 47:23.280]  to the person. Well, nothing is with statistics. So that's how they spin the fact into something
[47:23.280 --> 47:29.520]  that they can then obfuscate. I want to take your phone calls, Manuel and everybody else
[47:29.520 --> 47:35.720]  is patiently holding. I'm going to be in DC on January 5th and 6th. There's going to
[47:35.720 --> 47:42.720]  be rallies both days at Freedom Plaza. I will be there. And I've actually had the organizers
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.480]  of this event invite me to speak at both of those events. And that's good. There's different
[47:47.480 --> 47:53.560]  organizers than the ones last time. And I also spoke at the Jericho event, but it doesn't
[47:53.560 --> 47:59.080]  matter who speaks. That isn't what matters. What matters is millions of people on the
[47:59.080 --> 48:05.040]  streets there in DC. And I'm sorry, this is bigger than Donald Trump. It's bigger than
[48:05.040 --> 48:11.040]  you. It's bigger than us individually. It's about all of our collective right to vote
[48:11.040 --> 48:15.240]  and not have a foreign multinational technocracy come in and steal our election. And so you
[48:15.240 --> 48:19.480]  can say, oh, I don't like his pardons. Well, I don't either, some of them. Or, you know,
[48:19.480 --> 48:22.920]  Trump could have done better on this, or I don't want $2,000. He should veto the whole
[48:22.920 --> 48:29.520]  thing. Yes, I get it. But he was the elected president. The globalists came after him.
[48:29.520 --> 48:34.000]  He tried to restore power back to the nation. He got us out of these wars. The list of good
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.920]  things way outweighs the list of bad things. But this is a debate about purism. Only perfect
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.960]  person with Jesus Christ. The issue is we elected him again, and this giant gas-fletting
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.480]  fraud is taking place. So this is about a foreign multinational takeover. And the globalists
[48:51.480 --> 48:58.080]  conquering our nation. That's what we're fighting. That's why I'm going to DC. That's why even
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.880]  if Trump threw in the towel, which he hasn't, isn't that great? Every day, more fraud comes
[49:02.880 --> 49:07.640]  out, more evidence. They want this to be over. They want to certify it. They want us to be
[49:07.640 --> 49:12.000]  quiet. We're never going to be quiet about all the incredible fraud. We're never going
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.720]  to shut up, and we're setting up our own media systems, and we're spreading the word, and
[49:15.720 --> 49:20.720]  we're not backing down. And people are donating their time, their money, their energy to fight.
[49:20.720 --> 49:25.120]  Because in the words of John Paul Jones, the founder of the U.S. Navy, when a ship was sinking,
[49:25.120 --> 49:30.520]  fighting a ship twice the size it is, they hailed across on their bullhorn, do you want
[49:30.520 --> 49:36.560]  to give up? He said, surrender. I've only begun to fight, and he ended up taking the
[49:36.560 --> 49:42.920]  ship. His ship sunk. He took the main ship and was victorious. And that's where we are.
[49:42.920 --> 49:46.560]  We're not going to get anything better lying down. The globalists don't want to conquer
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.280]  us. They want to kill us. They want to get rid of us. They see us as roaches on the planet.
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.400]  They've conquered through fraud. They know their Ponzi schemes coming down. They know
[49:55.400 --> 50:01.800]  their giant bubble is imploding, and they don't know what to do. So they need to have
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.480]  the implosion and say it's caused by COVID-19. That's what the Rockefeller Foundation said
[50:06.480 --> 50:11.320]  10 years ago. That's what Klaus Schwab said five years ago in his first great reset meetings.
[50:11.320 --> 50:20.760]  He's the head of the U.N. Agenda 2030 operation. He headed up for a decade the U.N. Sustainability
[50:20.760 --> 50:28.680]  Global Governance Project. This is a planetary takeover. The excuse to lock you in your house,
[50:28.680 --> 50:32.680]  take your wages, dumb you down is they're saving the earth while they're killing the
[50:32.680 --> 50:37.800]  earth with all the genetic engineering and the rest of it. They're literally mad scientists
[50:37.800 --> 50:44.840]  hitting you with something so insane as travel passports making you take vaccines that aren't
[50:44.840 --> 50:50.400]  even vaccines that reprogram every cell in your body. That's the real world. Not some
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.160]  Marvel comic movie where there's a global government and they're trying to put something
[50:54.160 --> 51:00.160]  in a vaccine that mutates everyone and makes them be controlled, which it is. This isn't
[51:00.160 --> 51:08.240]  a movie like that. This is the real world. You're living in the real in game. Just like
[51:08.240 --> 51:16.040]  I made the film in game in 2007 and the film had 50 million views on Google video when it
[51:16.040 --> 51:19.240]  came out and they got rid of it a year later and deleted it. It didn't matter. It's got
[51:19.240 --> 51:24.480]  5 million views on YouTube. It needs 100 million views. It's free on YouTube, but it started
[51:24.480 --> 51:30.480]  going to number one on Amazon when in game came out the Marvel comic movie about inter
[51:30.480 --> 51:36.160]  plantinary extermination, a movie about genocide. Here's my movie about global government
[51:36.160 --> 51:42.120]  technocracy using the threat of plagues to actually launch real plagues. And because
[51:42.120 --> 51:47.320]  everybody's searching in game on Amazon, that pissed them off. So they took it down off
[51:47.320 --> 52:00.200]  of Amazon and they said it's racist. Yeah, that's in game on, if you're looking on TV,
[52:00.200 --> 52:06.440]  that's in game on man.video. That's a great place to share 187,000 views, but I've typed
[52:06.440 --> 52:09.800]  in in game blue river liberal enslavement into YouTube. Most people, that version is
[52:09.800 --> 52:13.960]  that's easier to share with people as they can see the particular video I'm talking about.
[52:13.960 --> 52:17.920]  They do bury it. It's very hard to find very hard to search, but those are the two places
[52:17.920 --> 52:23.240]  you can find it. But imagine a film that's against global depopulation that actually
[52:23.240 --> 52:27.960]  starts exposing the Nazis and the British royal family funding them. And then the left
[52:27.960 --> 52:33.440]  comes and says, we want it taken down. It's racist. But again, if you're the real anti
[52:33.440 --> 52:38.120]  humanist, not just racist, you want to exterminate people, you want to bring in this world government,
[52:38.120 --> 52:46.520]  you want to carry all of this out. You have to pose as if you're the guys fighting environmental
[52:46.520 --> 52:50.320]  degradation, you're the guys fighting racism and tribalism, because you're the ones actually
[52:50.320 --> 52:54.160]  destroying the earth. You're the ones actually promoting all this evil. We're going to go
[52:54.160 --> 53:00.200]  to break and I promise go to Manuel, Diana, Brent, Seth, Chris, Joe, Wendy, Mike, Scott
[53:00.200 --> 53:05.520]  and others. Manuel is going to be in DC on the six. We'll talk to him and then Mike first
[53:05.520 --> 53:11.760]  when we come back briefly. It is the last day to get Christmas specials with the free

[53:37.840 --> 53:46.000]  4.9 stars, 97% reviews, 711 reviews total. That's on a third party site. Third party
[53:46.000 --> 53:53.000]  site. The left didn't believe those reviews were real. They had the FBI investigate the
[53:53.000 --> 54:00.000]  third party, one of the top major groups, power reviews. That's a little inside baseball.
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.920]  That's the kind of stuff we get around here. Jones has fake reviews on a site. And so they
[54:03.920 --> 54:09.800]  send the FBI would subpoenas after a major trying to find something. That's the fine
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.760]  tooth comb we're under folks. They said your reviews are fake. Meanwhile, the borders are
[54:14.760 --> 54:19.680]  wide open. North Korea's got death cams. Child molesters are running rampant. Don't worry.
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.480]  The FBI is investigating if our power reviews are real. That's right. They are real. Burn

[55:32.720 --> 55:37.360]  is here and I am committed to you to fight against the globalist harder than ever. So
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.200]  thank you so much for keeping info warrants in the fight without your support. We couldn't
[55:41.200 --> 55:53.360]  do any on it.
[39:24.140 --> 56:20.640]  you might want to find out who this super villain is. You see, he believes because
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.640]  he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do
[56:24.640 --> 56:29.120]  it. You might want to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles.
[56:29.120 --> 56:35.120]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism
[56:35.120 --> 56:40.160]  in his own works. So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize
[56:40.160 --> 56:49.360]  for you. Take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[56:49.360 --> 57:02.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:02.480 --> 57:24.000]  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing you and many other people DC on January 6th.
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.600]  I feel like it's probably the last stronghold for us as Americans to protect our freedoms.
[57:29.600 --> 57:34.240]  Well, that's right. And if there are five million people there, which we could easily
[57:34.240 --> 57:39.840]  do, there was close to a million that first one that that that message will repudiate
[57:39.840 --> 57:44.720]  on record their lie of Joe Biden and his stupid virtual inauguration that they're going to
[57:44.720 --> 57:46.480]  try to have 14 days later.
[57:46.480 --> 57:53.920]  Oh, exactly. I feel like the fake news media and fellow MPC Americans, they they're expecting
[57:53.920 --> 57:59.520]  a specific archetype of Trump supporters to be there in DC. But I feel like they'll be
[57:59.520 --> 58:06.560]  greatly shocked at the intellectual diversity that will that will come crashing through
[58:06.560 --> 58:08.080]  in DC on January 6th.
[58:08.080 --> 58:11.680]  Well, they are shocked. I mean, they tried to always say the Tea Party was racist.
[58:11.680 --> 58:16.000]  So the blacks, Hispanics and Asians wouldn't go. That started to fail about eight years ago as
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.440]  people went were totally accepted and loved. And then now under Trump, you go and you'll
[58:21.440 --> 58:25.120]  have an overrepresentation of some of these rallies of blacks, Hispanics and others. And
[58:25.120 --> 58:30.000]  the media, that's what put them into total race based panic mode to say Trump is Hitler,
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.920]  because they don't know what to do. I mean, look, Trump got three times more black men to vote for
[58:33.920 --> 58:38.000]  him than any Republican ever. That scares the living snot out of the establishment.
[58:39.520 --> 58:46.000]  Oh, yeah, of course it does. I've attended a recent anti lockdown protest here near New
[58:46.000 --> 58:50.720]  York City. And when I wear my MAGA hat, I get a lot of people telling me that I'm brave and
[58:50.720 --> 58:56.800]  that I'm clear, that I have courage. And just other people yelling at me that I'm a sellout to
[58:56.800 --> 59:02.560]  my race, that I shouldn't be wearing that hat. And it's bothersome. It bothersome that you can't
[59:02.560 --> 59:07.040]  express yourself in this country anymore. Well, they got to think, I mean, if you got brown skin,
[59:07.040 --> 59:13.040]  since when is the Democratic Party that's out of the KKK, since when do they speak for you?
[59:13.040 --> 59:17.120]  And if you're not for them, you're bad. I mean, that that's so cultic. It's so evil. But people
[59:17.120 --> 59:21.200]  like you, my friend are trailblazers. They're standing against it. God bless you, Manuel.
[59:21.200 --> 59:25.040]  I just want to say this. I want to explain it again. I know everybody knows this, but this is
[59:25.040 --> 59:30.880]  really a talking point. This is bigger than Trump. Thank God he hasn't conceded. We need to keep
[59:30.880 --> 59:36.160]  exposing the fraud, keep showing the evidence. And then no matter what happens, Trump is still our
[59:36.160 --> 59:41.600]  president. And I think he should have that talking point because it's true that the power structure
[59:41.600 --> 59:48.720]  in the system has occupied America and put in their puppet and that Trump should then travel
[59:48.720 --> 59:54.480]  around the country rallying the legislatures, state houses and others. And he should have a
[59:54.480 --> 1:00:00.560]  nightly TV program where he could have more ratings than Fox talks to the public. I mean,
[1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:06.240]  Trump cannot go away. And yes, he's made huge mistakes. And yes, he's had to make compromises
[1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:13.040]  like on this legislation, this relief package. And we can spend all day talking about how that's
[1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:18.160]  wrong. Great. You're going to have Joe Biden via fraud and the chai comms, the globalist. And so
[1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:26.800]  I just hope there's as much energy and concern by Ann Coulter and others when Joe Biden is gutting
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:31.680]  the country and we're in a total depression. I just hope that we can get some criticism of the
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:36.640]  Democrats because I get it's avant garde to talk about Trump and where he should have done better.
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:40.080]  And it's just he shows how good people are and how superior they are.
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:48.560]  And I agree, we need Trump to pardon Assange. I don't I don't like this latest pardon of this
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:53.360]  guy that swindled Medicare Medicaid stuff of over a billion dollars. It's disgusting,
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:55.840]  all with Jared Kushner and the rest of it. It's disgusting.
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:03.920]  I'm saying the big issue is the new world order, the world government, the forced inoculations,
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:09.440]  the travel passes, all of us coming in. Trump's had big rallies with no mask. Trump said,
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:12.800]  you shouldn't be mandatory to have vaccines. Trump said you shouldn't have travel passes.
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:17.360]  We need him to speak in his last 23 days. If this is the last 23 days,
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.760]  now out against that and say it's a fraud and say it's wrong.
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:28.160]  His head of code response, Atlas said all that, but then he resigned.
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:35.920]  And now Fauci just running around out there running things. This this is outrageous. We need
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:40.480]  Trump to mobilize, organize and to declare war on the globalist one way or another and
[1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:44.400]  use his bully public while she'll has it. He's using it more and more, but one tenth what he
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:56.400]  should, we need resolute action now back in 60 seconds. Christmas 2020 is here, but we'll soon
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:02.400]  be gone. But I want to encourage all of you to recommit in the year 2020 and I'm talking to
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:08.800]  myself when I say this to exercise and treat our bodies better and to take high quality supplements

[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:53.360]  This is the highest quality you're going to find out there infowarstore.com infowarstore.com
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:03:05.840]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:14.720]  live from the infowarstore.com studios it's alex jones we had some of the most orwellian footage
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:22.000]  out of new york new jersey california of swat team raids on salons on restaurants that don't stay
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.200]  closed right next to big chain stores that do stay open because that's how the democrats now can
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.480]  pre-program these maps where they gerrymandered where oh your business has got to be closed
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:38.560]  but uh but this other business can be open i mean this is total tyranny now notice black lives
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:45.120]  matter got 10.6 billion dollars from the left to quote protect black people from the almost non-existent
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:50.320]  crime of cops killing black men 14 black men a year get shot illegitimately by the police
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:56.240]  police balloon those numbers to 500 it isn't the 2000 plus killed by black men on black men
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:01.760]  every year in chicago but every life matters it's a red herring though ladies and gentlemen
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:08.320]  because when you actually look at the covid lockdown starving millions around the world
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:13.280]  most of them africans are talking about millions of dead but see the media focuses on 14 dead people
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:20.560]  instead of the millions of dead people i don't care what color well they are it's wrong but but
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:26.800]  my point about getting into black lives matter is everybody's upset at the cops just they quote
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:32.160]  or hunting down black men in this fantasy world because they take each sad event and balloon it
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:38.320]  up and turn into a huge tragedy has fallen said one man dies it's a tragedy 10 000 dies the statistic
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:41.920]  it's totally true he also said i don't care who casts the votes i care who counts them
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:46.560]  boy doesn't show biden know that don't the chikoms know that helping out still the election so
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:52.320]  here are the police you want to go after the police you want to say the police the bad guys
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:58.400]  they are in blue jurisdictions when they carry out illegal orders like this i mean all over the
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:03.040]  country sheriff departments and police departments have said we're not going to go shut down a barbershop
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:09.440]  or a little mom and pop restaurant for this covid thing when it's an overblown hoax and we're not
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:14.160]  going to do it when right next door the big box store is full it's a consolidation of the economy
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:19.920]  to bankrupt us to bring in a universal income the u n admits it we've covered it we've done reports
[1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:25.520]  on it it's a fact claus swab at the devos group that heads up the u n program says it's about
[1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:31.440]  getting you on welfare it's about controlling you so you have to take inoculations i said years ago
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:36.640]  they'll release a bio weapon or the threat of a weapon say you got to take a vaccine to be able
[1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:41.680]  to have a job or travel and then tie it to your welfare check that you take the vaccine well now
[1:05:41.680 --> 1:05:46.880]  they're just gonna make you have a welfare check because you were not essential and then you wait
[1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:54.080]  what is it six months since the last stimulus money and it's six hundred dollars six hundred dollars
[1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:02.960]  90 plus percent went to foreign banks people say why are we being screwed so hard because we put up
[1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:08.160]  with it i mean the globalists have gotten away with anything now now they're just like
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:16.640]  and that's really where we're at there is a feeding frenzy there is a free-for-all there is
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:28.720]  an orgy there is a Tasmanian devil level event of looting and destroying this country because
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:34.000]  it's the globalist mission to bring america down not just in cloward and piven not just in the great
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:40.880]  reset which is the great leap forward but in the u n codified world government plan this is the free
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:47.920]  for all and the democrats and their minions are just the locust or the army ants eating us to the
[1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:56.720]  bone baby we're being eaten to the bone right now now i'm smart i'm bragging i'm smart i'm gonna
[1:06:56.720 --> 1:07:02.160]  become more successful in this climate because i was pre-positioned for it the globalists run
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:06.960]  the operation they're really gonna do good but for the average person it's over your college
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:12.320]  degrees are worthless you're gonna you're already being poisoned to death by the gmo the 5g and now
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:19.520]  the mrna mutinogens that mutate your whole body i mean that we're they aren't going zero to 60
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:25.840]  they're going zero to a trillion miles an hour we went into warp we're in warp right now i mean
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:30.640]  one year will be like a hundred years now and it's going to normalize just your neighbors are all
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:34.320]  dying of cancer and there's all the it's like oh it's all part of the covet nightmare we got used
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:44.000]  to all the dead oh covet 2.0 covet you know 2021 2022 they've got major hollywood films like songbird
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.680]  coming out in the year 2023 covet 22 has been released and no one's allowed to go outside and
[1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:55.680]  tens of millions are dead who were shot and killed for leaving their houses and then you turn on
[1:07:55.680 --> 1:08:01.920]  chucky sure and he's like we will arrest you if you leave your home we need more arrest release the
[1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:12.320]  child molesters release the child molesters and then put the woman that opens her salon in jail
[1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:17.120]  you ain't got to go to new york to find that happening go to texas to find that happening
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:21.520]  because we don't value freedom we don't value unborn babies we don't value born babies we don't
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:26.080]  value old people we don't value ourselves so guess what the new world order doesn't value us
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:34.160]  and god will let us have what we want we forsake ourselves god didn't forsake us
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:41.120]  we took all the blessings and threw them out the window because we had a game of tennis to
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:45.120]  play or golf to play or we were going to go out cool with our friends and get drunk again
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:49.520]  and so who cares let somebody else handle it okay everything will be taken from you now
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:53.760]  everything and they're gonna do it in increments where you join along you'll be taken care of
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:57.600]  and then oh it's a little harder but you still join you still keep complying
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:01.280]  while you're being strangled all right let's go to
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:06.000]  mike in arizona mike you're on the air go ahead
[1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:12.560]  hey alex how's it going just watching the world government takeover plan happened
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:15.760]  at the end of it they kill everybody so i mean i'm just gonna watch it all happen i
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:23.040]  guess sit or take it you know well the reason why i'm calling um uh i'm not quite so sure
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:31.440]  how dedicated vice president pence is going to be i'm concerned about the electoral electoral
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:37.440]  college count coming up in congress on the sixth well that's right he already on the he already
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:42.800]  last week on the 23rd could have killed the whole deal and hand the electoral stuff trump
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:47.920]  he doesn't have the political will and so yeah i mean i would expect betrayal on the sixth as well
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:55.280]  yeah that's scary the thing that made me think about it was you know back when daddy bush's
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:01.360]  funeral and they all got some of them got envelopes and he and his wife got one i'm like
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:09.360]  that's weird so i don't i don't know i don't know what made me think about that yesterday either but
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:16.720]  i'm really concerned about you know when that comes up on the sixth well people like pence
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:23.040]  think playing politics and surviving and getting more power personally means you're smart no that's
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:27.440]  not leadership leadership is going against the grain when you know society's in trouble
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:32.720]  and sacrificing yourself if need be to save the group it's the opposite of collectivism
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:38.400]  it's individual action for the collective it's called leadership and uh so far we've not seen
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:43.120]  that from pence or the evil turtle hell his wife's on the chai comp payroll what do you expect
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:52.400]  yeah i'm just really concerned about it plus um ever since he was selected and and i saw him speak
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:59.040]  you know after trump picked him for vice president he just seems too slick and polished just like all
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:04.800]  the other traitors and in the uh government well i don't go off how slick somebody is uh
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:09.040]  it's trump to be pretty slick but but but i go after all his actions and he's got a lot of good
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:16.240]  rhetoric but when it comes to delivering mic pence in the clinch right when you right when you need
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:22.240]  him right when he could stop it all and be a leader he he doesn't he absolutely is a no show
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:28.480]  and uh just tries to hide back in the woodwork thank you mike we're gonna go to break and come
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:32.080]  back and i'm gonna try to take five or six calls the next segment i want to get to all these calls
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:36.560]  this hour because we have several guests coming up as well but when we come back we'll talk to diana
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:42.000]  we'll talk to wendy uh and many others right on the other side but that caller raised some really
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:51.920]  good points yeah um all we're seeing is betrayal and i don't want to get lost in the shuffle there
[1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:58.640]  with all this betrayal um you're welcome to bring it up what i'm saying is global government
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:05.440]  china as the model world cashless society world id to travel to go to a restaurant to have a job
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:11.840]  it was all set up by the rockefellers it was all tested by bill gates we told you when this all got
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:17.200]  launched 11 months ago that this would be here by the winner now here it's here and how do we know
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:22.960]  because it's all been pre positions it's all scripted in every country it's the same because
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:29.680]  it's the un calling the shots it's world government telling us how to respond and how to track people
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:34.560]  and how to arrest people and how to lock people in their houses and how to make people take shots that
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:40.240]  mutinogenically change all their cells so it's not just the un's running things in world government
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:43.840]  they're coming to put something in us that they say is going to make us real sick and
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:48.240]  change our bodies forever and that scientists look at the vaccine and say it'll sterilize you
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:55.600]  world government's coming the un's coming to sterilize you the resistance not video the resistance
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:04.640]  not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:13.520]  not video info wars dot com news wars dot com ban dot video and hundreds of other urls we've
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:21.600]  launched have been banned that's why every month we launch a new url before they ban it but
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:29.040]  sorrows and bill gates and the gloves are on our tail but the new website is the resistance
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:35.360]  dot video the resistance dot video they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can
[1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:41.200]  defeat them so the new url that links right to ban dot video and all of our videos and all of our
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:46.160]  documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:53.120]  dot video share the link the resistance dot video the resistance dot video mountain patriot in
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.160]  colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as far as i can we're in
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.840]  such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:08.960]  force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:15.440]  the other day and i see that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:23.200]  dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:29.040]  zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that if all i know is with dna force
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:35.040]  we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:39.040]  prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:43.840]  and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:56.640]  together and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug you're listening to the alex
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:12.880]  jones show i got a tiger by the tail explained to see i won't be much when you get through with me
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:20.080]  i'm losing weight and i'm turning by the tail welcome back we're one of your phone calls here
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:27.120]  in just about 30 seconds i want to be 100 clear i'm saying some really scary frightening things
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:32.640]  here on air but everything i'm telling you is on record i mean the un all of them say we want to
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.520]  depopulate the earth at least 80 we want to come out with vaccines to sterilize people and they come
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:43.120]  out with this mRNA vaccine and the scientists top ones put reports in and file lawsuits to the EU
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:47.760]  staying right here in the ingredients it says it attacks this this protein an autoimmune response
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:51.920]  that'll attack the placenta uh what the hell are you doing you're gonna have adverse reactions
[1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:57.280]  and now you're having people getting paralyzed and dying and getting super sick and it's just
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:04.880]  back of the newspaper so they're making their move and i just have to tell you like it is and
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:11.200]  i feel like i'm not doing enough just being here on air just calmly talking about all this this is
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:17.280]  so otherworldly and i knew this was all coming and so imagine i knew it was all coming most of
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:22.000]  you research the same stuff i have you know what i know you a lot of you know more than i know and
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:30.640]  we have to resist this and we have to just say no to it and not even get caught in the regular
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:41.040]  low-level political slime or quicksand that's real issues but are side issues that all flow
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:47.920]  that are symptomatic of the underlying globalist disease in our own domestication and our own
[1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:53.360]  separation from the land our own separation from god our own separation from reality that allows
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:59.520]  this to happen let's go ahead dr diana in michigan you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:08.480]  hello hi welcome hi um i just wanted to say that um lin wood did post on twitter last night at
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:15.520]  10 54 p.m the statement from the president in regards to his signing the covid relief package
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:21.360]  and if you click on that um on the statement from the president from the white house um he cites the
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:27.200]  impoundment control act of 1974 and that the act provides that whenever the president determines
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:33.280]  that all are part of any budget authority will not be required uh required to carry out the full
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:39.600]  objectives or scope of programs for which is provided yada yada basically um in other words
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:44.320]  he is sending a strong message that makes clear to congress that the wasteful items need to be
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:50.480]  removed and that he's sending back to congress the red line version item by item accompanied by the
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:55.440]  formal recession request to congress insisting sure sure and you know i mean i get why you're
[1:17:55.440 --> 1:18:00.640]  calling in i'm glad you did the big debate is how he sold us out and he said it was a bad bill
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:05.120]  but then he signed it when and then a lot of folks feel really good criticizing him and then
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:10.080]  everybody comes and defends him and says he line itemed it with a red line and they've told him
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.600]  that if he signed it that they're going to give us 2000 a piece instead of 600 and all of it is
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:22.240]  rearranging deck chairs in the titanic um we need to arrest the globalists we need the globalists to
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:27.440]  be put on notice that we understand they're violating the Geneva convention the nuremberg code
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:31.840]  and are involved in a planetary medical tyranny takeover but you're absolutely right he fought
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:37.520]  the bill he tried to get the foreign pork out they've got the numbers to overriding if they have to
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:42.800]  show he's gotten the two thousand dollars in it and signed it because he at least i guess you know
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:47.360]  if he's going to get raped along with us might enjoy it i don't agree with that i'm stating what he
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:54.240]  did uh and that's where we are i just know this in 23 days all these republicans that love to
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:59.600]  criticize trump because he's not as pure as they wish he was they're gonna have joe biden in there
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:04.080]  and i just hope they go after joe biden i'd oh but they'll get banned off twitter real quick and
[1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:10.000]  they do they won't probably be doing that uh so that's why in culture and all these people continue
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.280]  to just attack trump constantly and never cover all the real issues going on is because that's
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:22.320]  how they survive and don't get deplatformed can i um plug for something well let me just tell you
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:26.640]  we're not screening your call ma'am we you're live on air we really appreciate you you can talk about
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:33.920]  whatever you want um okay i want to plug your info wars mask although i know that we are all
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:39.440]  against mass and that it's just basically a a symbol of you know conformity and enslavement
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:43.440]  but i want to say every time i go out wearing it when i go out to you know shop the grocery
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:49.120]  stores and whatnot at least one person every single time compliments me on the massive milk
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:55.760]  oh alex jones i love them and i let them know go to band that video b a n n e d that video because
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:20:02.160]  sometimes when i say band that video they think b a n d so i make sure to clarify that but almost
[1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:07.280]  every single time i go out i get compliments on that so it's definitely spreading the word
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:11.920]  and you know so it doesn't inhibit my breathing i wear underneath my nose and it's kind of like
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:16.400]  lets people know that i don't really believe in the mask either i'm wearing it just because i have to
[1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:23.440]  live in uh governor whitmer's horrible state but um i do want to say i did see one other person
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:29.200]  wear it um at first earlier this year when you first came out with it and i literally got brought
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:36.800]  to tears because i saw another person that believes like i do and i didn't feel all alone out in this
[1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:42.320]  world and it meant so much to me to see someone taking action so i went ahead and ordered one for
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:49.600]  myself and i swear i got and i just had a baby too uh on the 7th of december and i was mastering
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:55.200]  the whole time of you know like when i was in the hospital and i just had to make sure that i'm
[1:20:55.200 --> 1:21:01.520]  putting that message out there and it really makes an impact and we like have big long conversations
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:06.480]  with like the workers at these different grocery stores and other customers and stuff and it really
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:11.760]  is a feeling of empowerment to see that there are other people out there thinking like you
[1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:16.480]  that you're not all alone so even though i don't believe in the mask it's a great statement
[1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:21.680]  to get it out there to the rest diana i'm so glad you got through god bless you and congratulations
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:25.760]  on that new wonderful life that you have brought into the world and i only wish the best for your
[1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:31.680]  new baby i'm glad she called this is bigger than alex jones and this is one of my frustration
[1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:37.760]  points uh in my mind that people don't seem to get and when i've been general talked about
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:44.160]  Pharisees i'm not talking about any particular individual i'm talking about the way a Pharisee
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:51.760]  brain works is very one-dimensional like you say the master of fraud and cause bacterial pneumonia
[1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:57.120]  you say they don't protect you you say they're a symbol of slavery then what are you doing
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:04.560]  selling mask well when we launched them i made the decision to print it with info wars.com so if
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:09.520]  you're on a plane or in a restaurant where it's a private place and they're making you do it and
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:15.760]  you need to go there for whatever reason you wear it to fight back and then use the abuse
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:21.280]  like a judo move they attack you you use their momentum to throw them through the wall now
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.760]  a Pharisee doesn't have two-dimensional or even third-dimensional or four-dimensional thought
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:31.440]  processes it's a very neurotic neuroses where it's only one dimensional the left's the same way
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:40.800]  and they will say oh it's a big thing jones there's been articles jones sells mask but he says mask
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:46.640]  for a fraud well yeah and when we did it the crew said she was we put mask up with info wars on it
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:52.080]  so if you have to wear a mask and absolutely and last night uh when i went to the movie theater
[1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:57.120]  you're supposed to wear them to go in it's a private place we wore info wars mask and it caused
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:03.920]  conversations and so you you use it against them and then i talked to everybody i saw in the movie
[1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:10.880]  theater it was amazing almo draft house horrible socialist globalist on it they love it you go
[1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:16.720]  in all the lights are turned off it's like dystopic they're sitting there with wanting to you know
[1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:22.400]  with a thermometer a laser thermometer uh to you know to all get into theater and i said to the guy
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:27.200]  i said you know the same amount of people who died this year that died last year right you know this is all fraud
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:31.600]  he goes i know but we're just doing to keep you safe oh if i never existed i'd be safe it's all a
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:36.480]  fraud to shut down the economy you won't even have your job soon buddy this is a global takeover
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:41.200]  and and and then people that own alamo are horrible leftist globalist worst people you can even imagine
[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:45.280]  but but i went there just to check it out because i hadn't been to a movie the last 11 months and it
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:52.960]  was just a disgrace well be right back stay with us it's not a secret why and leftist controlled
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:57.760]  cities all over the world not just the us they encourage people to live in tense cities is
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:03.040]  homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime it's because the globalist admit
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:09.440]  under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course the gray reset they want to lower expectations they don't
[1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:12.880]  want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere they don't want you to think of a
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  civilization that gets better they want you to think of civilization that gets progressively
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:22.960]  worse the globalist fly around in private jets they have huge private mistakes they are separate
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:27.600]  from us their children go to private tutors they admit this now they want us to lock down
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:34.000]  telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.600]  infrastructure the infrastructure that's left under 5g is going to control robot autonomous cars
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:44.400]  and trucks this is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:49.040]  is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post-human future you better find out about it
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:55.760]  right now we are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the united nations the big
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:00.080]  corporations the globalists big tech and big pharma are all pushing the cub is the most deadly
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:05.920]  thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:09.920]  then you can actually die from it that's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes
[1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:14.960]  meanwhile all these top scientists and and researchers and former Pfizer head medical
[1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:20.320]  officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine especially the mRNA ones are basically
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:25.200]  bioweapons that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:29.440]  when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.840]  the time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record it does that geon
[1:25:33.840 --> 1:25:38.560]  berets narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but they tell you safe and effective no one's
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:43.040]  getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:46.960]  deadly so they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly

[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:35.440]  being received but i wanted to get the unvarnished view on the election uh you know the fraud coming
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:40.160]  out really where these gentlemen think things are going what they think of the pardons what they think
[1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:47.280]  of trump signing on uh to this recovery bill uh and what we're going to do they actually get
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:52.320]  joe biden in there so i want to thank you both for coming on let's go to uh let's go to patrick
[1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:57.040]  howley uh first and just get front and center what do you think the most important issue is right
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:03.680]  now patrick well alex i believe the most important issue is january sixth i predict victory i expect
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:08.320]  victory that's how the team is going forward with this rudy juliani jenna ellison everybody and
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:14.960]  there is republican um willpower to fight this and you're gonna see congressman matt gates you're
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:21.360]  gonna see madison cawthorne um challenging this electoral college certification applying pressure
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:26.080]  on vice president mike penns to do the right thing and use his constitutional authority the ball
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:33.200]  is live on the field and president donald trump signing off on this stimulus um he made it very
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:39.120]  clear that a quid pro quo as part of this is that republicans are committed to fight on january sixth
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:44.000]  so that's what we're focused on i predict victory we're gonna be in washington bc and we're gonna
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.880]  make sure that the people's voices are heard about the massive voter fraud that we've uncovered
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:53.680]  that this man hasn't covered the national files uncovered and we are going to make our voices
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:58.880]  heard to the world tom are you that optimistic i mean i know that biden can hardly talk he's a
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:04.560]  chai com agent he's trying to steal the election he's very weak trump is strong we have incredible
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:09.120]  evidence of fraud but it's this weird parallel universe where they're over there saying no evidence
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:14.000]  no evidence you president elect president elect and trump's saying hey folks don't start moving our
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:20.320]  stuff out we're not leaving i mean this is an talk about nail biting this is crazy well that's
[1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:24.400]  exactly what it is alex it's nail biting it's never happened before in our country and i hope it
[1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:30.000]  never happens again as you said trump has all of the cards he has all of the evidence the problem
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:34.160]  is we can't get a venue so it seems i mean obviously we saw him meeting with lindsay
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:38.560]  graham over the weekend we saw him meeting with other folks over the weekend it seems as though
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.600]  there's been some horse trading i'm not party to it i hope it's real i hope the january 6 will be
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:48.800]  successful i know that we've reported a national file we have two sources close to the trump legal
[1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:54.000]  team in direct communication with the president regularly who confirmed that tommy tuberville
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:59.680]  before mitch mcconnell started leading on him was 100 on board to do this he just didn't want to
[1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:05.120]  say it publicly for fear of reprisal from the turtle man mitch mcconnell so it will be interesting
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:10.480]  to see whether or not mitch is more powerful than trump on january 6 and then it will be interesting
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:16.880]  to see of course whether or not vice president pence and the requisite 50 or 51 senators will do
[1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:27.920]  the right thing explain the process either you or either pappert or howley of the fact that we
[1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:33.760]  have checks and balances and when congress sees electoral fraud like this they can decertify it
[1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:38.560]  i mean this is in the constitution and and and it just said that there's no evidence of fraud
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:44.080]  is the ultimate gaslighting that's right and republicans have put forward alternative slates
[1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:50.000]  of electors that are constitutionally viable on january 6 uh tom you know you're a big expert on
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:54.960]  the the process you know obviously we've had a lot of long conversations of robert's rules of
[1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:58.960]  order type conversations but you know i'm feeling confident um do you mean do you want to explain
[1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:03.920]  the process well sure i mean there's really two remedies right now and that is on january 6 and
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:09.200]  we saw this in 26 17 by the way uh they tried to do this to trump but they couldn't get a senator to
[1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:14.320]  object a sitting u.s representative in the new congress that will come in on january 3 needs
[1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:19.120]  to have in writing a written objection we've got this from mo brooks that written objection then
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:24.640]  needs to be mirrored in the senate if it is with tommy tubberville or any number of people rand paul
[1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:28.480]  i'm looking at you ted cruise looking at you these are all of our heroes right why haven't they agreed
[1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:33.680]  to do this that's a very good question but then if they have a senator agree the two chambers break
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:38.720]  off and go meet and discuss the allegations of fraud what they should do whether they should
[1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:44.240]  strike these electoral votes what the proper thing to do and in all likelihood nancy polosi's house
[1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:49.520]  will say no arizona's sharpie ballot markers were fine that was just how elections were meant to be
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:54.960]  according to the founding fathers uh meanwhile if the republicans have a spine which we'll see if
[1:31:54.960 --> 1:32:00.000]  that happens that's the big question uh they'll come back and say no arizona must be thrown out
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:04.880]  it's then entirely up to vice president mike pence as the presiding officer of the joint
[1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:10.320]  session of congress he gets to decide what to do with that information alex so mike pence can say
[1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:17.680]  all right i'm siding with the senate on this one uh we're gonna toss out arizona he can do that or
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:24.560]  pence can do the safe thing the expected thing and he can say there's no agreement i do not want
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:31.040]  to cast a tie breaking vote therefore arizona stands so again i it's very precarious alex that
[1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:36.000]  a lot of this depends on people like mike pence who i'm not saying he's a bad guy but any plan
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:41.120]  that relies on one person uh that's a big critical failure let's go further let's go further why don't
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:47.120]  we see trump putting pence on the hot seat we know they met on the 22nd the details of that were
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:51.520]  not released but it was reportedly about the fact that pence could have already done this on the 23rd
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:57.040]  uh i think trump should be stronger at the bully pulpit uh exposing the fraud he's at least started
[1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:03.200]  to do some of that uh but uh i mean i really think this is going too slow and and i expect
[1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:09.200]  that if pence was really planning this he would be out talking about it he would be out challenging
[1:33:09.200 --> 1:33:13.920]  it he would be out talking about the fraud he's not doing that that's why i think massive pressure
[1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:19.040]  millions of millions in dc regardless of what happens we never accept this election we never
[1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:23.200]  accept this fraud we never let them control the narrative that that they're trying to put up
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:28.160]  it's based on fraud that's why even if trump uh conceded i'm going there on the 6th i'm going
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:34.000]  there on the 20th because we have to say no to the chicon puppet occupied government of joe
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:39.040]  biden uh patrick yeah and you know mike pence should resign if he's not going to do the right
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:43.600]  thing on january 6 he should resign for the good of the american people and we can get a new vice
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:48.240]  president in there i think it's very important to realize that ted Cruz was all lined up to argue
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:52.400]  the supreme court case that came to a supreme court case it was a great strategic play by the
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:58.240]  trump team using your attorney general ken paxton to bring the lawsuit when states sue other states
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:03.520]  that immediately gets documented at the supreme court elito and thomas did the right thing and
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:08.960]  ruled that this they should have heard this case but the supreme court let us down but when you
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:14.480]  have 18 states challenging an election that's the closest that we've come to a legitimate
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:19.760]  secession scenario since the civil war the voices of the people will be heard and if these
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:24.240]  politicians don't do the right thing on january 6 the american politics will never be the same if
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:27.600]  the republicans think they're going to keep this republican party and anybody's going to vote for
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:32.480]  pence or mcconnell after this a third party could rise from that but i'm committed to victory i know
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:36.560]  tom's committed to victory obviously the team and we've and there are great people like matt gates
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:41.200]  who are going to drag this out and there are two hours with you they're just not getting attention
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:46.160]  what about louis gomer from texas great congressman he's suing pence to force this out in the open
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:51.600]  the washington times is reporting and almost no one else well you've gotten the effort from louis
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:56.960]  gomer you have the amistad project suing mike pence i mean it's starting to be where there is a
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:01.360]  clear and open and public division between the president and the vice president as well as the
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:06.720]  president and his political party so if they manage and i still have to hope this is not going to
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:12.160]  happen alex but if they do manage to get their globalist chai com puppet on the throne uh we're
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:17.360]  going to be in such a fascinating scenario where it's no longer a tool party system if anything
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:23.440]  it's a party within a party but as you said alex more than 50 of the country at this point seems
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:28.320]  to believe the election was stolen it was fraudulent this guy is going to go into office
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:34.400]  at 12 01 p.m on january 20th with half the country believing he's illegitimate that's never happened
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:39.600]  before in our country and if the republicans think that's okay they're not going to have a job come
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:45.440]  the next election we're doing a list right now of all the republican senators who are up in 2024
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:51.680]  among them are people like rand paul john toon who is bullying tuber bill not to do this uh marco
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:57.200]  rubio and i can personally attest alex to these people to these politicians i may not make sure
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:02.800]  you lose in 2022 but you're going to need way more money than you ever thought was possible to keep
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:07.120]  from being primaried that's right and then the media spends it mcconnell spends it oh you want
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.680]  democrats to win no just like we ran trump just like we've run other people we want folks in there
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:16.560]  that are americans that fight against foreign takeovers because again this is a foreign multinational
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:21.440]  takeover and i agree with patrick and i agree with you tom let's talk about secession here
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.720]  because you could say if biden got in and turned the economy on and left people alone there wouldn't
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:32.080]  be secession he says he's gonna cut the the coal power plants off stop the oil drilling that'll
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:36.560]  kill the economy uh he says he's gonna keep us locked down for years forced inoculations that's
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:42.880]  gonna force a damn uprising so i mean we are headed towards a an explosive situation and i pray
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:46.480]  that's not the case that's where we're going we'll be right back with our guest stay with us national
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:54.640]  fall dot com fox has betrayed president trump as i predicted they would they've always been part of
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:59.600]  the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep trump from rightfully
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  taking office for second term ontarian 20th the system is going to drop the hammer harder than
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:09.840]  ever on this republic they are going to explode gas prices they're going to shut down our coal
[1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:14.880]  power plants they're going to cut off the energy source to us so it's impossible for factories to
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:20.000]  move back here this is economic domination this is economic war we are being consolidated we're
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:25.280]  being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states they're consolidating
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:31.040]  power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:36.000]  ownership of all the infrastructure and property this is a monopolistic takeover that's what the

[1:40:49.600 --> 1:41:04.960]  the resistance.video you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:11.680]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:24.160]  you know earlier today I aired a video that Trump tweeted out over the weekend
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:30.000]  started the show and I'd forgotten when I was watching it they had a clip of Brian Williams the
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:35.760]  guy that said he got shot down in a helicopter none of it happened fact-checking the president
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:40.880]  saying there is quote absolutely no evidence of election fraud the arrogance of the system putting
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:44.000]  a known complete stolen valor fraud
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:54.480]  on TV saying that to fact-check the president and that new video I saw earlier today of Schumer
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:42:01.840]  going we need testing testing testing and arrest arrest arrest let the child molesters out let the
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:07.120]  criminals out but lock you up because you open your salon I mean these are authoritarian crazy
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:13.520]  people but we let them run things and so there's no limit what they're going to do we're talking
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:18.800]  to great writers over at national file.com that has been really a tip of the spear along with
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.760]  the gateway pundit on ferreting out the the voluminous election fraud I want to go back to
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:30.080]  Patrick and then you peppered in closing here with call it a civil war call it a cold war
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:36.800]  call it secession I mean out of survival mechanism we individually have to secede from the lockdowns
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:42.160]  and say I am essential just as as Jeff Bezos says I'm essential too or just as Hillary is
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:48.480]  or my bakery is or my gas station is or my my salon is and then none of the globalists follow
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:52.720]  their own lockdown garbage they admit it's a power grab I'm gonna cover more of that next hour
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:57.760]  with the documents but uh when we talk about secession or civil war in 18 states Patrick you
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:03.040]  were getting into that going to the supreme court and just being totally rejected went on the face
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:08.240]  of it the legislature didn't pass law for the 80 million fake ballots mail-in ballots I mean
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:13.200]  on the face of it this election is a fraud so it's just this revolution of tyranny what do you
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.600]  expect to happen if they are able and I'm not being defeatist here folks go to DC it's more
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.440]  important than ever to say no to the fraud no to the chai comms no to the global because we're
[1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:25.040]  going to just we're going to keep occupying DC we're going to keep resisting more and more from
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:29.840]  here on out this is just the beginning one way or another but in a way stealing it from Trump
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:34.160]  and doing all these lockdowns and not backing down and being caught in all these lies and
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:39.520]  having spokespersons like brian williams Patrick it seems like a perfect recipe for civil war
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:44.720]  what do you think the establishment's thinking well alex first of all I want to make clear
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:49.360]  because I just uh got a text you know nobody's considering uh replacing mike pence in the
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:55.360]  short term as a strategy but mark my words that was looked into that was researched absolutely
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:00.320]  no one has a free pass if they're going to go against president donald trump president donald
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:05.440]  trump is the republican party president donald trump is this movement and the american people
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:09.040]  are desperate to keep him in here uh mike pence is never going to be able to run for president
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:13.440]  or do anything get elected dog catcher if he doesn't come through for us so look here's what's
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:19.680]  going to happen on january 6 is great independent media like tom and alex jones are going to show
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:25.840]  the world in real time all of the evidence that the courts have not been making public to the
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:30.160]  people and the supreme court won't even hear and i know matt gates is going to fight and i
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:37.280]  know we can drag it out for hours upon hours upon hours and create a maximum pressure scenario
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:43.920]  and that's why what we're doing is going to really make an impact if we're actually going to win
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:48.960]  this thing and i am committed as we all are as all americans are to actually winning we don't
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:54.560]  want to just prove well i agree the only thing that's futile is not resisting resistance is victory
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:59.120]  this is a foreign takeover more important than ever to protest to be engaged but pressure on
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:03.680]  congress i agree and the globalists are weak they lost this election they had to steal it
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:09.200]  in front of everyone and i i think the evidence is clear mich mcconnell had made deals beforehand
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:14.000]  they knew the fix was in the supreme court went along with the mail-in ballots i mean this this
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:19.040]  was all preplanned and and so the american people i think need to be educated about that
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:25.600]  i agree alex and i i would back to your question i think that what we're going to see is an
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:29.360]  individual succession movement and we've already i think seen the beginning of this
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:33.280]  when the federal government sat on its hands for eight years under obama while half the
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:37.760]  country legalized pot i don't have a problem with pot personally but it's very weird to see
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:42.960]  states blatantly flip off the federal government and get away with it then under trump we've seen
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.440]  even more of that with all of these sanctuary counties where you can immigrate illegally kill
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:52.480]  as many people as you want and they can't do anything about it because you're in a sanctuary
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:57.360]  and again the federal government just lets them so it's about time that these legislatures that
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:01.840]  we've all been meeting with and talking to and some of them are really great people in arizona
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:07.120]  and in georgia they have some great legislators there it's time for these people to really declare
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:12.480]  themselves a sanctuary state where everything joe biden says is null and void inside of it
[1:46:12.480 --> 1:46:17.600]  and it's time for individuals to do the same joe biden's word means nothing inside this studio i
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:22.480]  will never wear a mask i will never comply with his demands i am free from joe biden it's done
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:27.200]  that's right we must declare our declaration of independence whether trump gets back in
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:32.240]  or whether they fraudulently put and shoehorn in biden the blue states and blue cities are
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:37.040]  going to continue with cancers keeping things closed undermining us i know you guys know about this but
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:43.360]  even tucker carlson's aired the clips they have multiple communist chinese leaders and sociologists
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:51.760]  and others on national chinese tv at communist conclave saying ha ha ha the virus has shut them
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:56.800]  down they will never come out again america is destroyed america is over ha ha ha we control
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.760]  the highest levels of their government uh they're open for business they're not wearing mask anymore
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:06.560]  for six months basically and and the whole world's investing in china saying america will never
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:11.040]  reopen because the globalists control the blue cities and blue states and are saying it's an active
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:15.840]  war they're keeping us shut down we've got to get this out to the american people that this is the
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:22.480]  their destruction not the virus but the fraudulent lockdown from the virus patrick yeah fda documents
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:28.320]  quietly admit and cdc documents quietly admit that the tests are bogus you can test positive
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:34.000]  without actually having covet whatever covet is at this point it is an absolute fraud it is the
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:39.440]  biggest wealth grab by the elites that we've ever seen and how is it not a conflict of interest
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:44.480]  for jeff bezos who's a government contractor amazon's a major government contractor the federal
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:49.200]  government is providing guidance for the government to shut down small businesses that compete with
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:55.360]  bezos thus increasing the profits of whole foods amazon and everything else bezos is doing to to
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:00.320]  to rig our economy so if we care about the free market we would want government to actually act
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:05.280]  as as good faith actors and stop bezos from what he's doing and open up this country but
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:09.120]  unfortunately so much of our government is subverted we're going to find out on january 6
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.600]  who are the good guys and who are not the good guys well that's absolutely right it's called
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:18.080]  racketeering when corporations or groups get together to shut down their competition fraudulently
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:22.320]  but when government does it it's called fascism and and we have the government saying you're not
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:28.080]  essential but all the big billion dollar companies are this is outrageously criminal and when i
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:32.800]  watched the left pretending like they're part of the cult going along with it i mean i went to a
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:36.000]  movie theater owned by leftist last night called elmo wrapped house hadn't been out the movie in
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:41.200]  like 11 months and they had the lights all turned off down to one light this big theater up at the
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:47.040]  counter and and and everything's all dusty and dirty and he has a little uh thermometer and
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:51.760]  wanting our just scan us and all getting into the theater of it they know it's about collapsing
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:57.280]  america they know it's about a weird sick this dystopia and their leftist power but the average
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:03.120]  leftist is going to be destroyed in this that's exactly right i mean they have this great fantasy
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:07.680]  that when the good the revolution comes you know they'll get to go work in uniform design or something
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:12.400]  like that for the great Stalinist regime that they're ushering in no they have no use for these
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:18.000]  people i mean if your job is to be a good little covid goose stepper when you take people's temperatures
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.320]  you're not going to have a job you're not going to be needed in their society if you're lucky
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:27.680]  you'll get to sit at home on your 1200 a month credit and take your weekly covid shot and
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:32.160]  be tested every six hours and that you'll just resign yourself to that that's the best these
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:36.960]  people can hope for meanwhile on our side we need to as he said alex individually just
[1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:41.600]  refuse to comply with this stuff and at some point it will become clear certain geographic
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:47.520]  regions east texas central kansas are a whole lot better to live in than the big blue cities that
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:53.440]  have run amok and ruined our country you know tom and i fight like clarence darrow on a daily basis
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:58.880]  to avert these mask mandates even to the point where a lady you know i walked in the door and
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:02.560]  she said you if you're going to walk in that door you need to have a mask and i said look
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:08.640]  we don't need to dwell on the past i've already walked i'm here right now and i challenged her
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:15.280]  policies and the fact that i had already done it meant that there that she had no recourse in her
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:21.360]  company handbook in order to throw me out so if you just go ahead and do it then that messes up
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:26.400]  their hr handbook we win every single one i've never lost oh yeah no no most of the time most of
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:30.080]  the time i don't wear the mask but if you're going out with quote you know you know people that are
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:34.960]  kind of not afraid but don't want any trouble you're out for a nice night you you can play because
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:38.240]  it's their property but you're absolutely right but but imagine i've been to that theater probably
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:43.600]  50 times at night over the years it's all lit up it's all nice the lights are all off like is it
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:48.960]  open you go in and it's like you're going into a gateway to hell and that's the left they're all

[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:45.520]  it's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the us
[1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:49.760]  they encourage people to live in tents cities is homeless and they use drugs and alcohol and
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:55.440]  engage in petty crime it's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course the
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:53:01.200]  gray reset they want to lower expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:04.480]  everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better they want you
[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:09.440]  to think of civilization that gets progressively worse the globalists fly around in private jets
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:15.280]  they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to private tutors they
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:21.680]  admit this now they want us locked down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:27.120]  out physically building a pro-human infrastructure the infrastructure that's left under 5g is
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:32.560]  going to control robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all their admitted plan the public's
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:37.440]  finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post human
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:52.960]  future you better find out about it right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:57.040]  all right my final question before you come back with your calls for these great gentlemen
[1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:01.760]  patrick howley and tom pappert is this because you're smart guys and i'm trying to externalize
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:08.240]  this thought i have that that i constantly have it's almost like we're buzzards sitting here
[1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:13.200]  surveying all the carnage reporting on it in live time and not doing enough to go out and
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:16.880]  engage it and do something and i know you guys are in the field so am i we're doing more than
[1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:22.080]  probably anybody else out there but i still feel like watching these crimes watching world
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:27.280]  government watching all this fraud it's just it's just sick people say what's it like alex being
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:30.720]  vindicated about world government the un and medical journey i'm like i don't feel good
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:35.840]  being vindicated telling your kid don't play in the street and then you come home and your child
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:40.880]  got run over it's like oh you're vindicated your kid's dead i know i don't feel vindicated at all
[1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:48.400]  what do you call that paradox of just how dystopic this is and the sick feeling i constantly have
[1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:55.600]  that i'm not doing enough well you know alex that's what it is it feels like i mean we haven't
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:01.120]  lost there's multiple paths both to victory for president trump and for us as the force of human
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:06.080]  good but now that the enemy is here they made it through the gates they were in the trojan horse
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:11.600]  shaped like a covid vaccine and nobody noticed it feels like we haven't done enough up into this
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:16.320]  point i mean that's especially irrational for you alex you've been working on the same fight
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:21.120]  since before i was born and yet here we are it just feels like could we not have done something
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:26.160]  to wake up more people could we not have got on another loud speaker and screamed at the top
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:30.960]  of our lungs again but i mean i i feel like the only way to avoid that the only way i found to
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:36.560]  avoid that and i've definitely had the same emotions is to just keep chiseling away at this
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:41.920]  marble until we can see totally great it's hard to see the public not understand how much games
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:46.960]  are there in patrick i mean this is insane yeah well you know as soon as you take the red pill
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:51.680]  you can't untake it and alex you've you've read pill probably more people than anybody once you
[1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:56.880]  realize that you're in a matrix of deception and malevolent people who are coming at you
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.840]  you realize that you're in real time and it's a war scenario and it's not just oh it's tuesday
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:06.160]  it's wednesday what's my routine you realize you're in real time and this is serious stuff people
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:11.520]  are waking up to that i think january six is going to change the world i do i you know i want to win
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:16.560]  that's you know ball in the field get it into the end zone anyway you shake it january six is
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:21.840]  going to change the world and anybody who doesn't stand with donald trump be it doug ducey who is
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:27.120]  born douglas roscoe to the teledo organized crime family before he came became an ice cream oligarch
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:31.840]  i've got an article coming about him i've got an article coming about herald rivera mr al capone's
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.120]  vault and all the stuff he's done over the years if you're not gonna stand with us with an in victory
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:40.800]  you're not going to be part of our movement going forward we are fighting to win
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:49.520]  win very well said gentlemen this is just such a historic moment and what you just said patrick
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:54.480]  is we're not malevolence so we project the fact that we're gregarious and friendly on them but the
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:59.920]  more you study this is a collection of psychopaths 30 seconds or one minute each how would you
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:05.520]  describe in one minute pampered the globalist well what you started to say is accurate it's a
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:11.840]  collection of psychopaths who have figured out that they can leverage blackmail extortion bribery
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:16.560]  everything you can get to keep a seat in power no matter what country is the global hegemon if
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:20.800]  it's the united states that's great if it's china who cares i think that that is the globalist they
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:26.560]  are power drunk they're sick and they don't they have no loyalties to anything but power well they
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:31.120]  might have loyalty to ball to mollock that's right and uh you know these are these are baby
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:36.080]  killing satanists they are overseeing a genocide of little babies they're sick people they have a
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:40.480]  religion they believe that they're you know descended from the nephaline bloodlines it's a
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:44.640]  satanic luciferian cult but you know what the rank and file the politicians who do they're
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:49.040]  bidding for them are some of the dumbest people ever if there was an IQ test for members of congress
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:53.280]  half of them would be deemed mentally inadequate these people don't intimidate me we're going to
[1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:58.080]  challenge them like never before oh i agree we we've got major populist movements pro-human
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:02.800]  movements trump is only way bolson our is only one wave and so this is a fight this is going to go
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:07.120]  back and forth they're going to get blows in we're going to get blows in the key is exposing them
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:11.040]  epstein the new world order global government no one even knew this years ago now it's out in the

[2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:01.840]  change sometimes we still will be forced to we have to physically support mom and pops you have
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:08.960]  to understand it's a war we have to go to the you know resell shop or or goodwill to get our
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:11.760]  clothes i've actually sort of doing that they have a lot better clothes they're in a better
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:16.080]  selection you find at the mall and just have to start getting out of the corporate system
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  because the corporate system has aligned with the globalist against america thank you joe we love
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:26.720]  you wendy in michigan thank you for holding go ahead thank you for taking my call alex i'm a
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:35.280]  long-time listener over 10 years um i uh patriot can you hear me yes ma'am okay good just want to
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:41.440]  make sure i'm a patriot i'm a registered nurse and um i've always known that there's issues with
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:47.760]  vaccines and i just want to say that the vaccine is the biggest issue we're facing right now we
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:56.960]  have fellow americans lining up for this dangerous uh bio weapon and um you know i've been trying to
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:03.440]  share this information as a nurse and as a mom and as a human being for decades with people
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:11.760]  and here we are um at the time where we're getting forced inoculations and i just think that the
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:17.760]  election is a distraction because no matter who's in office um this vaccine is being rolled out and
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:21.920]  people are going to die you know friday footage came out on info wars dot com and i'm at the cover
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:27.600]  it of a female nurse being arrested because she spoke up in a hospital about the vaccine
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:33.200]  bad reactions and it's the the police are twisting her arm behind her back i mean again this is so
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:38.880]  evil this is so crooked this is so bad oh but the media doesn't criticize cops when they do that
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:46.080]  oh no because they want that hearing right exactly it's it's thickening and um you know i
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:52.720]  when i walk into the hospital i walk past the employee um vaccine room and i just see people
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:03:00.320]  lining up and um you know some of my fellow co-workers um are just waiting to get their
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:06.880]  term to you know get the vaccine um and you know they're just lining up for their own demise and
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:11.440]  i you know it's just a sad time and when you were saying you feel like you know you haven't done
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:15.680]  enough and obviously you've done more than pretty much almost anyone in on this planet
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.160]  you know i've spent so my whole life trying to share information about vaccines with people
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:24.000]  and as a nurse you know people look at you like you have three heads when you speak about the
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:30.880]  dangers of vaccines and the safety issues and you know i've that's something that i uh took on
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:38.080]  readily didn't care um i quit a job six months ago because of the uh forced uh testing that they
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:42.720]  were doing at the job they wanted to do the forced covid testing just to drive up the numbers and
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:49.840]  you know here we are and so i'd love to see in the future your show maybe focus on or one of
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:55.920]  a new show maybe focus on how we start setting up new systems and societies to get outside of the
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:02.880]  mainstream society and um what you're saying is 100 percent that the answer we should all just
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:09.440]  be focusing on communities neighborhoods towns organizations uh free association groups where
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:15.600]  we want a pro-human future where we want traditional values uh where we honor uh life where we honor
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:20.640]  children where we honor goodness uh because they've overtaken the churches and control most of those
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:26.000]  and so we need something that i don't even use the word secular but something that's just human
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:30.720]  and saying we reject death we reject the wages of the new world order god bless you and i appreciate
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:34.000]  your call i take a talk for an hour all these callers are amazing but we don't get to them we
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:41.040]  don't go the next person but this is it i'm in such a position of influence and i'm so burned out
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:45.200]  now and exhausted and overwhelmed that i just don't feel like i'm doing the good enough job i'm not
[2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:49.600]  whining but but yeah like okay jones you probably reached more people than anybody else with this
[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:55.600]  it's probably true make maybe david i but it's not a competition yes it's true so i'm in this
[2:04:55.600 --> 2:05:01.200]  incredible position and then i rack my brain how do i do this like what is the right answer
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:07.040]  like am i being a wimp not calling for violence because they're violently hitting us with 5g
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:11.840]  they're violently coming with mrna vaccine and but then you can't even direct the violence and
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:16.240]  then they'll spin it the wrong way so i don't want violence i want civil disobedience though
[2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:21.680]  and then i gotta think okay well how do you do that well i'm going to dc uh and and as they
[2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:28.160]  escalate against us we're gonna have to escalate against them but here's the good news we're not
[2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:32.560]  gonna have to wait for the stuff to get so bad people are gonna revolt it's gonna get bad real
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:37.920]  quick the dam's broken the bottom fell out folks hell's been opened up and i was studying serial
[2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:45.680]  killers last week just because i was praying and and and i had this whole crystal moment
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:48.560]  you know where all these thoughts come together and i could see a whole path of victory
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:54.480]  and it was we need to start a movement like we've done with other movements of taking clips of
[2:05:54.480 --> 2:05:58.880]  bill gates and other globalists saying weird sick stuff about the population and world government
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:05.360]  and then cutting it in to interviews with serial killers where they talk about their compulsion to
[2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:10.080]  kill people their compulsion to control people their compulsion and and and how it sexually
[2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:13.920]  excites them to torture children to death and then we just cut that in with clips the global
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:18.960]  is showing people the same mannerisms and very similar speech patterns because that's really
[2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:24.480]  what it is and and you just have to come to grips with these are really bad people and even i have
[2:06:24.480 --> 2:06:28.640]  to come to grips with and i say okay as a man they're they're coming violently at us they've
[2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:34.480]  set the whole thing up they've given themselves liability protection what do we do well at this
[2:06:34.480 --> 2:06:39.200]  point we expose these monsters and we expose them as hard as we can and believe it they're not happy
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:47.680]  but they've got a compulsion to do this to us and i think the most important thing is just pray to
[2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:55.840]  god to deliver judgment upon them whatever god's judgment is just pray god i pray that you rise up
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:07:02.080]  good people full of liberty to educate others and to try to heal the land we also pray that you
[2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:08.800]  bring judgment upon the leaders of the new world order but god then comes back and you already
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:14.400]  know the answer this is judgment on on on everyone and they'll be judged as well they've been given
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:18.800]  over to pure evil they want to kill us they want to hurt us they want to torture us first as mad
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:26.400]  scientists do we're facing mad scientists the highest IQ psychotics and once you know that you
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:33.440]  know everything the nazis were run by mad scientist well the nazis were set up by ibm and british
[2:07:33.440 --> 2:07:43.440]  intelligence us and us eugenicist and british eugenicist set up hitler that that's fact he was
[2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:51.440]  just a he was just a tool he was promised they had a peace treaty he was promised all of europe
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:55.280]  ever the eight was going to be the king of europe under the european union all of it that's all
[2:07:55.280 --> 2:08:03.360]  he didn't the mainline entry bugs but they double crossed hitler the globalists are sick man they're
[2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:09.840]  so macchiabelle and uh brought in their liberal world order that ht wells had planned and hitler
[2:08:09.840 --> 2:08:16.000]  was just simply the dialectic system to to to bounce off of but when you actually study the left
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.720]  they're more hitler than hitler could ever imagine because hitler came to kill you you knew it when
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:24.880]  the left comes to kill you you don't ever know it grant in arizona thanks for holding go ahead

[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:52.720]  mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:57.040]  far as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:02.880]  make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:06.880]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:15.280]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:21.360]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:28.800]  at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:32.960]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:36.160]  because there's a lot of expensive product that was really only cost them like 50 bucks
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:41.120]  and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:12:03.120]  thanks thanks for the plug you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:27.360]  well it's a fight against good and evil it's a world government run by satan and now it's out in
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:32.960]  the open i appreciate joel scowson world of first brief dot com is the editor-in-chief joining us
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:38.080]  from a marine corps officer naval aviator comes from a family that's been from the very beginning
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:43.600]  warning of the global scourge since the 50s is uncle clion scowson and so he understands
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:49.280]  conspiracy and how trump doesn't understand it and how trump is manipulated means well and can
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:54.800]  really give you accurate predictions uh right up there with the very best on what he thinks is
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:01.760]  about to unfold what is about to happen he predicted trump would lose via the fraud you now see that
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:07.520]  unfolding uh trump's not conceding where that's going uh scowson's got some points about the
[2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:14.320]  situation of course uh with the bombing with the rv in nashville and the economy and so much more
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:19.920]  so scowson thanks for joining us well it's always good to be with you alex and especially in this
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:26.400]  holiday season where we try to find some peace and uh and goodwill where do you want to start first
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:30.720]  i mean well what would you call this point in time in history we're in because there's a giant
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:35.840]  awakening on one hand but then also just a giant globalist takeover happening and many people
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:40.000]  submitting what would you call this historical point and just get into get into trump the election
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:45.600]  whatever you want to cover well alex this is the turning point in american history it's actually
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:50.400]  been going on for the past 20 years mostly through control of the public schools and the
[2:13:50.400 --> 2:13:56.800]  dumbing down of our our youth and children uh with uh lack of knowledge on the correct
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:02.320]  limitations on lawmaking correct limitations on government power and so we've been raising a lot
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:07.600]  of socialist and uh and pro-government individuals for many generations and it's all coming home to
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:13.120]  roost but of course it took a massive election fraud to change this and it's been clearly out in
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:19.600]  the open for anyone to see even the news media has had to change their wording just slightly
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:24.720]  as you remember as uh trump was beginning to explain the election fraud at the beginning
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:29.520]  they would always say anyone who was claiming fraud and there is no evidence for this and there
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:34.240]  is no evidence you heard that time and again and then after the videotape of the georgia
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:41.280]  fraud occurred which was clear to everyone to see they all started changing to one word they said
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:47.680]  that evidence of widespread fraud is not evident widespread fraud they had to admit some fraud
[2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:50.720]  but of course they're all claiming that it's not enough to make a difference and that's
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:55.600]  where the courts have gone as well as i've explained in the world affairs brief i believe
[2:14:55.600 --> 2:15:01.920]  trumps lawyers have sabotaged his legal case against fraud in no case have those lawyers
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:07.600]  ever presented the quantitative data that was clearly available by statistical analysis of
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:14.080]  the Edison data upon which which you know coalesces everything from dominion to other voting systems
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:19.360]  that presents to the news media and clearly you could tell how many numerically how many votes
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:25.280]  were switched for trump switched against trump to biden how many votes were disappeared to trump
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:31.920]  and all of the ballot dumps that were 90 for trump all of that was visible from the data
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:38.480]  but none of that ever got to the courts allowing them to say easily yes you've made a good case
[2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:43.360]  that there's irregularities in the voting system but nothing that we believe would have ever
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:50.240]  returned the results of the election and so we have now one last chance going forward and this
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:55.520]  is what i'd like to talk about and that is the january 6 certification of the electors before
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:16:01.120]  the joint session of congress now the epic times and other conservative sources have been putting
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:05.760]  forth the information that how many people are coming on board how many representatives are
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:11.120]  now going to challenge that this is totally irrelevant alex totally irrelevant it doesn't
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:18.800]  matter how many people are coming on board it only takes two or three republicans rhino republicans
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:25.840]  in the senate to block any acceptance of the trump electors now there are dual electors in all of the
[2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:31.840]  states that have been challenged in this electoral process and trump electors and
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:37.440]  biden electors the joint session of congress can in fact protest and accept the trump electors but
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:41.920]  i don't think it's going to happen and here's why when they bring these up and they're probably
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:46.880]  going to bring up some state like arizona which is a challenge state to the joint session you have to
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:51.520]  have a vote of whether or not you accept the biden electors or the trump electors
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:58.320]  and then debate that and none of that will come take place if you have senator mit romney who
[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:03.920]  will surely vote against donald trump or susan collins or lisa murkowski or the two democrats
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:09.680]  if they continue to skew the election in georgia and don't allow david perdu or um
[2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:15.840]  miss luffler to return to their seats in the senate it's going to be very easy to block it
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:20.640]  doesn't matter how many people are in favor of the trump electors all it takes is two or three
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:26.480]  to block and i think that's what's going to happen in the senate is there any past the victory now
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:34.000]  for trump well the courts have said after january six we'll take up a few of these remaining cases
[2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:44.400]  and i'm very doubtful that they will uh take them up favorably because um the basic problem is they've
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:49.920]  put off taking up these court cases till after january six so that it will be a done deal in
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:55.680]  terms of the electoral court then they can say the point is moot they can see the public sentiment
[2:17:55.680 --> 2:18:02.880]  and go against it as you know there was this supposed leak from the supreme court which i'm
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:07.760]  a little bit doubtful of stating that john roberts you know had a yelling and screaming session
[2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:14.480]  threatening conservatives into uh uh not taking up the texas case for fear of rioting the united
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:20.880]  states if we ever you know allow trump to be reelected well the supreme court came out the
[2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:27.200]  next day and said uh there was no such yelling match because uh the the supreme court justice
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:31.760]  happened met in person for weeks because of covet 19 everything is done by zoom meeting
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:36.800]  but another person had said well it's very possible they did meet in person because
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:42.000]  john roberts wouldn't have wanted to put this on zoom which is not a secure form of communications
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:46.320]  that could have been tapped and leaked to the american people what he was saying on that so i
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:52.960]  think there's good arguments in both cases but this much i do know alex that john roberts is a
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:58.640]  controlled individual by the deep state and he did in fact and would in fact always vote against
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:04.960]  trump to make sure he's not reelected so whether or not the leak was true or not um is really not
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:13.280]  uh relevant we know from john roberts bast his homosexual past et cetera they've got dirt on
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:18.240]  him and they can call on him to vote for the globalist position every time he wants so i don't
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:24.800]  hold out any hope for the courts um reinstating donald trump especially after the electoral
[2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:30.960]  college uh challenge has failed and i think it's going to fail do you agree with me it's
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:35.840]  regardless important to go did he see the six to protest to show the power of the people the show
[2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:41.360]  we don't accept joe biden in the process of moving to remove him and and to try to block his agenda
[2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:48.640]  into the future absolutely alex we need to protest we need to be in fact we're already seeing people
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:54.800]  starting to mount their resistance to the biden administration you know during the trump administration
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:02.160]  uh conservative fundraising and conservative causes dwindled uh for lack of financial resources
[2:20:02.160 --> 2:20:05.760]  because everyone thought that trump was going to stay there let's talk about that yeah people
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:11.120]  think that i defended trump because i was being paid we've almost gone bankrupt under trump we
[2:20:11.120 --> 2:20:16.000]  can't pay the bills i mean we used to have a lot of money before trump and and then people think
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:20.080]  like i'm defending trump because i'm getting money no i was doing it because he at least
[2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:24.400]  wasn't a globalist even though he's had a lot of problems and then now i wonder what it's going to
[2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:29.120]  be like though under biden i i don't think they're going to just sit back once he gets in i think
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:33.120]  they're going to come down on us come down on the american people with both feet they've said
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:36.480]  they are that they planned to never let their foot off our neck with the covid lockdown so let's
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:41.200]  talk about that and how to fight back and what trump should do with 23 days left while he still has
[2:20:41.200 --> 2:20:45.840]  the bully pulpit joel scowls and world affairs briefs our guests stay with us last year's dictionary
[2:20:45.840 --> 2:20:52.320]  has a very simple definition of terrorism other dictionaries have similar ones terrorism is the
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:59.680]  threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason it's basically
[2:20:59.680 --> 2:21:04.720]  scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them that's exactly what all this overblown
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:10.400]  covid 19 garbage is you see the headlines from cnn abc knows doctors say it's worse than they ever
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:16.400]  thought covid more devastating than ever imagined they told us that two and a half million people
[2:21:16.400 --> 2:21:22.960]  would be dead just eight months ago within three months okay it's a quarter million if you count
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:28.560]  all of the people that died of other things we're talking 96 that comorbidity these are real numbers
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:33.920]  these are real facts this is the chicken little event we all run our houses never come out and are
[2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:38.960]  taught we're not essential all the big box stores in amazon take over the planet rebuke it stand up

[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:17.040]  up and was pretty young when I started trying to read some of the history books laying around the
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:22.640]  house 10 years old they were fascinating by the time I was 20 I understood some of them
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:27.280]  but it's one thing to read the globalist planning all this is another thing to now be deep into it
[2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:32.640]  and now another plan accelerates from here on out jonescowson at worldoffirstbrief.com is our
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:37.600]  guest he's the editor-in-chief over there does a great job worldoffirstbrief.com jonescowson.com
[2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:44.880]  we also sell his great books on strategic relocation and also on how to build the secure home he's
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:48.960]  one of the leading experts if not the leading expert on that he's recognized by the survivalist
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:55.920]  community and also we did the strategic relocation dvd which is made four or five years ago but
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:00.560]  still just as accurate as ever the safe places around the country so we're proud of that film
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:06.880]  also available then fullwarstore.com we're seeing a mass exodus out of the cities now we did a
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:11.120]  special with him a few months ago that's very very popular and it's gotten hundreds of thousands of
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:17.360]  views on our site and millions on youtube but going back to jonescowson I don't need to ask
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:20.880]  the questions you just did a great briefing the last nine minutes segment exactly where I wanted
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:29.440]  to go so where do you want to go next well the question on everybody's mind is is there any hope
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:35.440]  anymore you know what can we look forward to how can we fight this now we have to protest we have to
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:41.040]  continue to fight first of all I want to address the fact of Donald Trump running in 2024 I think
[2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:45.200]  this is unfortunate not because Donald Trump doesn't have a good heart and doesn't really have the
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:51.280]  best interest of the country at heart but he simply is unprepared he lives by briefings he's never
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:58.480]  going to get the proper briefings to come up to speed on how this deep state operates I mean
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:04.640]  he continues to prepare for a war with Iran even though Iran is not the biggest sponsor of terror
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:11.200]  in the world the US deep state is you know he killed General Soleimani of Iran labeling him as
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:16.640]  the biggest sponsor of terror in the world which wasn't true he was in fact the biggest sponsor of
[2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:22.080]  the fighting forces in Iraq in Iran that were fighting US backed terror in Syria including ISIS
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:27.920]  and was responsible for the defeat of ISIS not the US forces who continued to try to save ISIS
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:35.760]  and so unfortunately we've got to make sure that we get someone into our camp who will run for
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:39.680]  office and it's going to be very difficult because anyone who has come on board already
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:46.640]  defending conspiracy facts will be ineligible to vote or to run for president because the
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:51.600]  republican establishment and the media will crucify them but even Doug Collins for example
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:56.720]  who's going to run of Georgia who's going to try to run for governor to get rid of governor camp
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:04.960]  there believes the foolish intelligence about Soleimani and Iran and so even though he's a
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:13.040]  very solid conservative in terms of anti-abortion and pro you know Christian rights etc he is weak
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:19.120]  on foreign policy because he believes the republicanist or the deep state intelligence
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:24.080]  briefings that Donald Trump was giving so it's very very difficult look at Ted Cruz for example
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:31.120]  Ted Cruz is an attack dog when it comes to getting before the senate and grilling people and getting
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:36.480]  boring down to the truth but he'll never touch conspiracy and unless you touch conspiracy
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:41.200]  you really don't know where he stands on the deep state or how much he knows about the deep state
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:46.800]  so it's going to be very difficult to get a champion that in fact will serve the crucial
[2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:54.640]  needs it's not enough to follow the Hannity and you know portion of attacking conservative values
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:59.280]  or backing conservative values and attacking democrats on the general things the crucial
[2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:04.720]  issue of our day is conspiracy it is the secret combinations of power that control this government
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.920]  that control this election that control the courts that control a good portion of commerce unless
[2:28:09.920 --> 2:28:14.880]  you clean that out and get someone into office who really understands this conspiracy issue
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:20.960]  we're just going to be spinning our wheels again and let's pull back let's pull back and elaborate
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:26.640]  on that because what you're saying is so central if you don't know how the world operates we don't
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:32.320]  know the globalist agenda we don't know who they are you're like a person going out into a cave
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:36.720]  without a flashlight you're going to fall and break your neck the globalists all write what
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:41.520]  they're doing they write books they brag about it they establish world government they have their
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:46.240]  systems of control and then you talk to the average politician that's even a christian it means well
[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:51.200]  it's like you're speaking martian to them if you don't understand the globalist agenda you have no
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:56.480]  way of defeating it if you understand it you defeat it but at least with info wars and your work at
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:29:04.720]  a countless others the public is really waking up to it very very quickly yes the question is what
[2:29:04.720 --> 2:29:09.120]  can they do things i had a subscriber write me the other day and he said you know all the information
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:14.160]  that you present is is almost all negative i said well that's because it's reality said but
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:21.280]  what we want are solutions and i said look i have solutions to everything i have and i've talked about
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:26.320]  in the world affairs for for briefs in in the last world affairs brief this friday i talked about
[2:29:26.320 --> 2:29:33.280]  the omnibus bill for example now one of the primary solutions you need to do is you need to stop omnibus
[2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:39.600]  spending bills you need to make it illegal to pass a bill that you have law changes and you
[2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:45.200]  have spending from all across the board in one bill because it makes it impossible to explain
[2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:51.120]  that to to newbies you got a six thousand page bill that has anti-free speech legislation billions
[2:29:51.120 --> 2:29:56.160]  to foreign countries all sorts of scams no one read the whole thing that should be illegal
[2:29:57.360 --> 2:30:02.800]  that's right and you change law in those bills so that instead of voting on the law change which
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:07.520]  needs to have a separate bill every time you change law you need to have a separate bill
[2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:12.560]  but in terms of spending you need to have a separate bill for each agency of government
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:18.320]  so that you can go through it in detail and attack the spending in that agency and not have to worry
[2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:23.920]  about an abortion portion or planned parenthood billing or defense spending in the same bill
[2:30:23.920 --> 2:30:28.240]  because then the leaders of the republican party can twist your arm and say look i know you object
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:32.640]  to this and ask but we're not going to get these good things unless you vote for the whole bill
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:38.320]  which includes all the bad things that's what should be illegal having all of this stuff lumped together
[2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:42.640]  and that would do sure and congress should not exempt itself from insider trading the list goes
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:47.520]  on and on joe let's just be honest the bottom's fallen out there's been resistance thanks for
[2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:52.720]  the your work and countless others in the decades past that trump was able to get in we held him off
[2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:58.960]  at some levels but really it's the moral decline of society that is allowing this to happen and
[2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:04.000]  just as night follows day we're just going on a very very dark road i mean it's not negative to
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:09.520]  know the truth if i'm driving down a road and the map tells me it's a dead end that's a good
[2:31:09.520 --> 2:31:14.080]  so i don't drive off the road down a cliff that's not negative that's reality uh if the doctor says
[2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:17.360]  you better stop drinking all that vodka your liver's gonna fail that's not negative that's
[2:31:17.360 --> 2:31:20.880]  reality if somebody's shooting heroin up and the doctor says you're gonna kill yourself that's not
[2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:26.720]  negative it's reality so just give people the the reality of of what you expect to see under biden
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:31.440]  because all the intel shows they plan to fully gut this country and bankrupt it for consolidation
[2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:37.600]  well i think they tend to do it more slowly than we think i mean they have the power especially if
[2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:42.320]  they get control of the senate to ramrod a lot of things and it'll go faster if they do that if we
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:47.520]  gain control nominally of the senate's or keep control of the senate nominally we'll slow things
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:51.520]  down a little bit but a lot is going to get through in terms of your omnibus spending bills and
[2:31:51.520 --> 2:31:56.560]  and this mantra of keeping the government alive and keeping it going nobody really knows how
[2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:02.240]  to do a government shutdown properly and keep it operating under the essentials and blocking the
[2:32:02.240 --> 2:32:08.400]  stuff i mean trump has never done that properly and uh it has always given up but the point is i
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:12.080]  think they're going to be slower they're going to be gun control it's going to go slowly but it's
[2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:17.920]  not going to lead to a civil war situation where people go to arms to stop gun compensation that's
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:24.320]  a ways down the road they may yet wait till war comes to do that as i've long anticipated but the
[2:32:24.320 --> 2:32:30.240]  point is they want to continue to boil the slog frog a little faster but still slow enough that it
[2:32:30.240 --> 2:32:36.640]  doesn't gain uh resistance and things and we won't have a lot of antifa BLM uh taking to the streets
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:43.040]  if biden is elected that'll be held off as well but the most important thing to remember is this
[2:32:43.040 --> 2:32:49.840]  this is the bottom line i don't believe we'll ever win another election again because the
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:55.360]  dominion voting the machines won't be removed the fact that we lost this battle that they covered it
[2:32:55.360 --> 2:33:00.880]  up on the election fraud means that it will be institutionalized forever in the united states
[2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:06.000]  so i don't think we'll ever win electorally what does that mean it doesn't mean we give up it means
[2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:12.640]  we have to accelerate our efforts to in to to find the true sheep in in life the people who sense
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:17.600]  something's wrong and educate them about the seriousness of the deep state and we need to
[2:33:17.600 --> 2:33:23.760]  then prepare for the takedown we need to prepare for war we need to prepare for increasing uh camps
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:29.360]  and increasing uh government the cover 19 is the rollout of the camps the tracking the singer
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:33.680]  police but it's still years ahead until they actually move in mass but it is coming and i
[2:33:33.680 --> 2:33:37.680]  my wife agrees everybody agrees it's now time to move the country side around other people
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:40.320]  it's now time to pull out folks we'll be right back stay with us
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:51.120]  the year 2021 is almost here and so we're launching our new year's specials right now

[2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:47.440]  your support we couldn't do any of it not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the
[2:34:47.440 --> 2:34:52.720]  world not just the us they encourage people to live in tents cities is homeless and to use drugs
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:58.640]  and alcohol and engage in petty crime it's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:03.920]  of course the great reset they want to lower expectations they don't need to think of having
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:07.920]  sanitary systems everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better they
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:12.400]  want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse the globalist fly around
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:17.840]  in private jets they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:23.680]  private tutors they admit this now they want us locked down telecommunicating with each other
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:29.040]  so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure the infrastructure
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:34.720]  that's left under 5g is going to control robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all their
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:39.440]  admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:46.320]  operational it's a post human future you better find out about it right now hey alex how you doing
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:52.240]  man is this the guy that called in about living defense yes sir yes sir i've been trying to get
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:57.680]  a hold of you since monday when i heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:04.400]  utah i said man i gotta get on that show and give him an update i said if i ever get a chance to be
[2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:10.800]  on alex's show i'm gonna tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:18.160]  now look i'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this info for store products and by the way i bought
[2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:24.400]  800 dollars worth the other night so i'm doing what i can brother so what my my contingency is
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:29.680]  why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living
[2:36:29.680 --> 2:36:36.240]  defense now you gotta follow that up with the micro vx i learned that so it's like god working is so
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:42.000]  amazing we didn't know we didn't screen your call we had no idea and i go to you a year later and
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:47.600]  you're telling people about living defense living defense living defense you must guard your humanity
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:52.560]  you must guard your children's humanity you must guard the very genetic code of the planet
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:58.000]  the globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world but they are the ones
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:02.640]  that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet they are the ones that are
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:09.840]  now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth for the GMO crops and now they've moved
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:17.040]  on to their main target humanity with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines they are recombinant
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:26.000]  DNA from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:33.440]  systems go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:38.400]  this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:42.800]  little green men the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:50.480]  us it's all the same in the end you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:06.160]  all right callers i really appreciate you holding i'll take your calls ahead of
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:14.240]  drill salente taking over in the war room with oan shroyer we are back live broadcasting
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:20.480]  worldwide dos kowson we're one of the smartest guys i know his predictions are about 98 percent
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:26.320]  accurate here with us and a lot of people get mad at me when i say it's a major uphill battle for
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:32.160]  trump it was a long shot a month ago it's a super long shot now i'm just not gonna lie to you uh
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:35.600]  there's the other side that's bailing on trump and attacking him because they think he said
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:40.480]  politically dead ducks and now they want to garner brownie points with twitter or whatever
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:45.040]  that's all foolish and stupid i think we should see trump as what he was a speed bump to these guys
[2:38:45.840 --> 2:38:50.080]  and so and we should thank god for balsenaro and other nationalist leaders and we should
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  move forward with that model of doing these hellmarys to get a better type trump person in there
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:01.360]  but regardless we have to start and you hear the callers calling in they're saying we want to move
[2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:05.520]  to a community we want to get out of 5g we want to get away from all the satan worshipers
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:09.200]  we want to go we want to go the problem is good people move somewhere they make it nice
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:14.240]  the satan worshipers move in uh they're like locust following a new fresh crop to eat so
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:18.800]  this is a very sophisticated thing isn't it joll it's a process there is no perfect way to live
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:25.440]  perfect place to go uh because the whole world's under the control of satan well that's right and
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:30.080]  all of these major conspiracies including the ones that control russia and china are also controlled
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:35.440]  by satan and he promises them that they're all going to win but he intends the angle american
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:42.480]  globalist to win eventually and use the others as as counter forces so that they can justify larger
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:48.560]  and more expensive armies to you know fight these illusory enemies but what you said is exactly true
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:53.440]  alex i want to emphasize that when i'm saying that you need to practice or prepare for the
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:59.040]  takedown i'm not saying you stop fighting and stop trying to win the battle for the hearts and minds
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:05.600]  of good people don't spin your wheels trying to convert innately liberal people and i mean ill
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:10.960]  liberal people who want to use government power to take away your fundamental rights uh they have
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:16.240]  this soft spot in the heart for the poor but they never understand that that there's very few worthy
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:21.760]  poor that there's an awful lot of a bad judgment in life because of moral corruption because of
[2:40:21.760 --> 2:40:30.000]  public schooling because of lack of standards in our life but if you if you keep seeking for a
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.480]  silver bullet to save it so that you won't have to prepare you are a fool you must prepare because
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:41.600]  i'll tell you the takedown is coming and when war comes toward the end of this decade with
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:46.720]  russia and china preceded by an emp strike there will be no electricity for a year and a half
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:52.320]  and why do i say that i used to say six months but finally a person in the power company called
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:57.920]  me up and he said look joel we don't have any big transformers stockpiled in the united states none
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:03.280]  they're all made in china and if you think when war starts we're going to get into those huge power
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:08.480]  transformers the transform the major transmission and couldn't uh couldn't a mass coronal ejection
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:16.640]  do the same thing without without an emp well not really they're not as powerful as the emp is
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:20.560]  especially if you get eight or nine emp strikes above the united states remember the coronal
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:25.360]  ejections from the sun come in toward the poles and they're ameliorated they don't get as far as
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:30.320]  south they get into candidates that are but not as far south to really cause a lot of powerful
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:35.920]  damage in the united states they could theoretically but we know that the emp strike is coming as we're
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:40.720]  sitting ducks with his power grid that's right we're sitting ducks and they're not going to be
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:46.800]  prepared and i'll tell you if they did only one thing and spend a billion dollars in stockpile
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:52.720]  all the transformers that they need and shield them electronically so they won't be destroyed in
[2:41:52.720 --> 2:41:57.120]  this emp strike they could get back up and running and notice there's been legislation to do that
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:03.040]  inexpensively but oh we don't have money for that we've got it for for shrimp on treadmills and
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:10.320]  gender studies in in kenya that's right but people must realize you've got to get ready to get out
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:15.840]  of the major cities because they will be death traps during an emp strike remember that emp
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:20.480]  strike will be followed 15 minutes later by physical nuclear strike on us military forces
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:26.800]  and without power there will be rioting and pillaging within three to five days and it will
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:32.480]  start to move out through the various residential sections of the cities until it gets even to
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:37.840]  some of the suburban areas you've got to be ready and have preparations to get out of the city
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:42.400]  before that happens and that's one of the reasons why i published my world affairs brief i tracked
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:48.240]  this stuff i'm hoping to be able to warn my subscribers when this war is coming and so that
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:53.600]  and people can get a free sample copy of this world affairs brief last friday's edition by emailing
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:59.440]  me at editor at world affairs brief dot com but you need to get strategic relocation you need to
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:05.040]  understand where the safe places why the cities are a death trap because of the pop high population
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:09.680]  densities it's not that there are really any safe places unless you get out in the middle
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:13.920]  of the nevada desert where you're 200 miles from anything but that's no way to live and most people
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:19.760]  can't live in that way and it's very difficult to establish a retreat when you've got to drive
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:24.160]  two hours to a home depot to get building supplies so there are compromises involved
[2:43:24.720 --> 2:43:30.000]  the best compromise generally is an hour's drive out of any major metropolis so it's too far for
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:36.160]  people to walk and getting into rural areas where you can have some security built informal networks
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:41.040]  of people that will support you that are good people they don't have to be survivalists they
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:45.520]  don't have to know what you know but they've got to be good people who in a crisis will begin to
[2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:51.600]  support you all too many people keep calling me and saying and i do a lot of consultation they say
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:56.960]  where can i find a pre-built survival community of all like-minded people and i tell you it does
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:03.840]  not exist and it wouldn't be good if it did exist because it would get targeted anytime you build a
[2:44:03.840 --> 2:44:08.400]  uniform community that wants to take over the electoral values of the rest of the community
[2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:12.320]  they band together to fight you that's right i don't want to operate like the left but it's time to
[2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:18.720]  be honest about who we are but be very calm and just quietly take over uh not just like the left
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:22.400]  does not be deceptive but not telegraph what you're doing kind of have to be informal
[2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:27.520]  yes but we're not going to be able to take over electorally that's what i'm saying democracy
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:33.200]  i just meant in certain areas we can take over yes you can have majorities again you never take
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:38.240]  over completely but you can have new majorities and i think that's the only benefit in the war
[2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:42.720]  that comes it will drive good people out of the major cities there'll be no more jobs for them
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:49.040]  to keep them there and they will hopefully clear those of us that warned of all this coming or
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:53.600]  those of us to survive will be listed to more than ever at that point we've already seen that
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:57.440]  paradigm where i know you're listed to more than you were 30 years ago i know i am now
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.040]  we're not pleased by that you know it's a sad byproduct but i mean aren't you seeing your
[2:45:01.040 --> 2:45:06.400]  credibility rise is everything you talk about as unfolding oh yes i've had increased subscribers
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:11.840]  by the thousands in the past few months just as this uh as it became plain to everybody that the
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:17.040]  deep state really does control much more than people had anticipated and it's not a bunch of
[2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:24.080]  bomba holdovers in the trump administration these are lethal deadly people within the government
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:31.120]  and that they control every major law enforcement agency in the country and so it's uh it's very
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:36.880]  very difficult so what i'm saying is while you fight these battles and continue to educate good
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:43.440]  people and and get them on our side because we will need every person to take a stand this
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:48.320]  covid thing is dividing the world between those who see and those that are blind and unfortunately
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:55.440]  i am very very sad to say that the majority of americans are blind to this obvious uh conspiracy
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:46:00.400]  well please join us again soon about the covid conspiracy and maybe next week if you'd like in
[2:46:00.400 --> 2:46:05.680]  the new year uh jones scowes and god bless you we appreciate you thank you very much elix thank you

[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:34.240]  trump doesn't understand a lot of stuff and i told you he's not invincible uh but we have lost money
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:41.040]  we have seen the the funding we have contract under trump because people thought everything was fine
[2:46:41.040 --> 2:46:47.680]  everything was wonderful trust the plan go back to sleep and i'm sorry folks that's just not the
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:53.600]  way it works and we need your support because i am spending all the capital we've got behind the

[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:47.040]  brother how are you i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:52.000]  been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:59.120]  that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:06.880]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:12.960]  people might want to take a look at that if all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:17.760]  these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:21.600]  doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:26.880]  cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:38.880]  what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:43.920]  fiction movie where if you've had a cold it can be locked up in your home you can be taken away
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:49.680]  you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:55.120]  very dna well that's where you are in the year 2020 global government the united nations all
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:59.920]  these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it they even admit that they're doing it for power
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:06.000]  and control and that they're not even worried about kevin 19 that's what claus swapped with others

[2:50:59.360 --> 2:51:03.600]  we're going through this process we're being tested yes it's negative but it's good to discover it
[2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:08.720]  fight back against it and that's the process of being tested that's red pills don't get black

[2:51:34.480 --> 2:51:40.000]  the pharmaceuticals when i got out of the hospital in 12 days because i was on the the uh
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:44.400]  nascent iodine and it helped my body get together and healed and they said i've hit there i'm the
[2:51:44.400 --> 2:51:48.800]  fastest healing patient they've ever seen in the history of the surgeries that they had to do on me

[2:52:00.240 --> 2:52:06.240]  regular iodine this is pure iodine and that's why it helps people so much absolutely and as far as
[2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:11.840]  what's coming you know i've lost a lot of friends and family trying to uh warn people and get them
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:18.880]  informed but now i've switched over to saving souls and warning people a little but they don't
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:24.960]  want to listen they want to be victims and then be heroes and everything else you know so new week

[2:53:57.280 --> 2:54:04.000]  living word jesus is what christ is the life tree now the one that we're dealing with right now that
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:11.120]  you are having trouble with is the devil body and all these people that like china and all the
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:19.680]  globalists that's just part of the devil's body and you have the power to call michael the art angel

[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:21.680]  can't understand the behavior that the globalists is doing that's right they're manipulating our
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:27.440]  bodies they know what they're doing we just sit here and take it because again we're we're thinking

[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:50.880]  and you are in my prayers all the time um i'm from the spirit of the john paul jones i was on the
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:57.840]  fast attack submarine providence commissioning crew in 1985 and on our captain's door it said
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:01:04.400]  i wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast for i intend to go in arms way
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:10.000]  and i think info wars you guys are that ship and you're in that same we appreciate your brother
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:15.920]  brother but absolutely that's really our unofficial motto around here is that we intend to go directly
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:21.200]  in just like you've done for our country brother what are you making what's happening uh well here
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:27.200]  in bokeh i mean it's all shutting down on the streets you know the small businesses and uh
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:30.880]  bokeh is a trend setting area if you ever kept up you know you know what i'm saying it's like
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:36.480]  trends were set here and that's not a trend we want to set right our small businesses collapsing
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:41.600]  uh well think about it's just like the mRNA being over the top and then saying small businesses
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:46.640]  60 percent are out of business probably forever and they're like oh that's normal that's good no
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:52.560]  it's a damn war on us my god it's obvious it's war it we're in a bog of a geek moment when our
[3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:57.360]  june was christ christian that was talking to our june that's where we're at uh and i don't know
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:01.600]  how to go from there that you know but i mean obviously we love peace and we pray for peace
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:07.440]  you know but i was born in philadelphia and i know the history and i could touch the liberty bell
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:15.200]  when i was a kid in 1976 and to me you know everything you're saying reaches my heart well
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:21.360]  it's like patrick henry didn't want a war but he said the war has already begun it has it has and
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:25.840]  it is a spiritual war and that's why i pray a lot and i'm probably unorthodox from a lot of your
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:30.720]  listeners but i am american and i'm a buddhist but i chant and i know what the chinese did to the
[3:02:30.720 --> 3:02:36.720]  buddhist they took guns and little kids hands and they made them shoot their parents you know this
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:40.160]  is this and they're still doing then this is they're right they target the buddhist a lot of
[3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:43.760]  great buddhist a lot of loving people that's what the chai comms have done they they hate it
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:49.200]  god bless you sir i appreciate your call all right thank you tom amazing steven ohio go ahead
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:55.600]  thanks for holding steve welcome hey thanks for seeing one call alex yes sir first time caller
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:03:02.160]  the thing i wanted to mention was inflation really happening at such a rapid pace three weeks ago i
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:11.440]  went to buy 20 rounds of 55 sticks and it was 1199 this week it's 2199 so that has absolutely
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:18.000]  doubled in price so i agree with joel scowl's in there in regards to getting prepared now is the
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:22.320]  time to get your ammo get your guns get your storeable food like you mentioned earlier in the
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:28.720]  broadcast take the momentum and use it in a defensive way gas 600 bucks is a slap in the face
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:37.600]  take it if you don't need to pay rent buy some ammo help your neighbor use it to throw it back in
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:43.520]  their face get your ammo because they don't have to do a gunband they'll just tax it so high as
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:49.600]  joel bine wants to that the manufacturer won't be able to produce the way they're suing they're suing
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:55.760]  every major gun manufacturer the very law firm that's suing me the democrats fund sued remington
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:04:00.080]  our oldest gunmaker out of business that's who we're fighting and thanks to you supporting us
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:04.880]  we're still on air two plus years after and they said our mission is to silence them and the senators
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:10.000]  that are behind it said we believe in ending his free speech they said to save america alex jones

[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:53.920]  my people but we don't in moldova they just toppled the leftist government because they were all
[3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:58.160]  orthodox christians need to look that up they toppled the leftist government in moldova that
[3:04:58.160 --> 3:05:03.920]  just happened i know my church openly talks about the mark of the beast we're not infiltrated and you
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:10.400]  have to study effective resistance methods throughout history the three most successful one the ninjas in
[3:05:10.400 --> 3:05:18.480]  japan north britain the scotland with budica and also hate to offend any jewish people but the resistance
[3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:25.120]  in south lebanon against israeli imperialism nationalism transcend sectarianism nationalism
[3:05:25.120 --> 3:05:29.840]  is what you're talking about i'm my family is orthodox christian but we're part of a secular
[3:05:29.840 --> 3:05:35.600]  nationalist party that's the solution you have the knowledge we're obliged to create
[3:05:35.600 --> 3:05:41.440]  off the grid sustainable systems what you need to do is how we formed our militia overseas
[3:05:41.440 --> 3:05:46.000]  they're not going to want me to tell you this this is important you do mr jones go do a speaking
[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:53.360]  tour go do a speaking tour but you refuse to go unless the people have rifles and run security
[3:05:53.360 --> 3:05:59.440]  and just by doing that tour you will create a militia well brother i hear you i'm out of time
[3:05:59.440 --> 3:06:04.880]  and i apologize to jack in missouri we'll get jack's name and number we'll call him back tomorrow

[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:33.040]  positive things are happening as negative as they are but the key is we just keep fighting and never

[3:07:12.720 --> 3:07:21.280]  the globalists are on our tail but the new website is the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:27.040]  they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them so the new url that
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:31.840]  links right to band dot video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:37.360]  reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance dot video share the link the

[3:20:15.600 --> 3:20:22.720]  you know these are you know i've been at this business now for 40 years again in 1980 what's
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:28.240]  going on now is unprecedented in world history 2020 i mean who would have ever believed this
[3:20:29.360 --> 3:20:38.000]  what's going on and more and more censorship going on everywhere around the world so when i
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:43.200]  say do what you can to support info wars that's not hard air and so all you're saying is so you
[3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:51.200]  know sale you know i think now there's nothing to do yeah my my stuff on on youtube and and
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:59.440]  linkedin is censoring it left and right and i don't even say anything that's you know off the
[3:20:59.440 --> 3:21:06.240]  charts it's what they don't want to hear just as you well know that twitter has put out a release
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:15.360]  was a week and a half ago that you can't say anything anti-vax vaccination that was rushed
[3:21:15.360 --> 3:21:21.600]  right through and well yeah that's the other thing you know just remember when it first started
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:27.280]  it was that nurse you know fainting all the other things now you're getting hardly any reports
[3:21:27.280 --> 3:21:31.840]  of adverse reactions so they did a good job in getting that out of the news
[3:21:31.840 --> 3:21:43.760]  and that's her poor woman you know and and so this is really a time for freedom so do you
[3:21:43.760 --> 3:21:50.800]  can to support info wars and and as well with the trends journal you know we're fighting out there
[3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:57.440]  and if we don't fight we're going to die they're killing us they kill the spirit i don't this is
[3:21:57.440 --> 3:22:03.920]  one of the saddest times of my life whatever the stuff you know that's terrible in my life you know
[3:22:03.920 --> 3:22:13.840]  it is we all have overall i've never felt so blue and went out the other night uh saturday night
[3:22:15.760 --> 3:22:21.040]  we went to a place that was so packed before that you went there you couldn't get any of that's
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:26.320]  too packed let's get out of here there were four of us in the whole place a place that could hold
[3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:38.960]  holds probably about 140 people four people streets are dead dead oh it'll come back oh it'll come back
[3:22:39.760 --> 3:22:45.360]  no it won't come back people's lives are being destroyed when you put your whole life into
[3:22:45.360 --> 3:22:59.120]  working to building your restaurant your business gone gone yeah some of the stories
[3:23:02.560 --> 3:23:11.200]  christmas sales are below forecast this is from today's wall street journal holiday sales grew
[3:23:11.200 --> 3:23:19.120]  but not as much us retail sales rose 2.4 percent they were looking much higher but online grew
[3:23:19.120 --> 3:23:30.160]  47 percent isn't that great so you have amazon getting richer and among those that fared well
[3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:35.520]  you ready it's right from here so i'm not making this stuff up right in front of your wall street
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:51.840]  journal amazon walmart and target the big's getting bigger the great reset is on and all
[3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:59.680]  we are are plantation workers in the global plantation of slave landia are you allowed to
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:06.640]  eat inside a bubble but you can't eat inside a restaurant it makes perfect sense because
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:15.520]  kovat air gets in a bubble it doesn't go anywhere but when kovat where it's in a restaurant oh then
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:22.240]  it spreads and again what is the infection rate in restaurants when you have this little low life
[3:24:22.240 --> 3:24:32.080]  arrogant moron daddy's boy quomo closing down the restaurants in new york city close down
[3:24:33.840 --> 3:24:38.960]  1.5 percent infection rate that's according to new york state data
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:48.400]  and the stupid clip of him saying santa is going to bring him a present because he was so good
[3:24:48.400 --> 3:24:55.200]  good yeah in new york has one of the highest highest rates around the country of death rates
[3:24:55.760 --> 3:25:02.640]  and they give his guy a book where he looks just like satan man satan closest come to town
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:08.880]  rocker fella center draws smaller crowds can't believe it
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:18.320]  it can etiquette small businesses suffer oh that's only from the wall street journal too can't
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:31.200]  believe it store traffic plunges can't believe it restaurant safety net phrase as winter sets in
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:39.760]  more than 110,000 restaurants and bars have closed for good or fallen dormant since the pandemic hit
[3:25:39.760 --> 3:25:51.040]  not since the pandemic hit since sick politicians since egomaniacs narcissists little boys and girls
[3:25:51.040 --> 3:25:58.320]  born on third base and thought they had a home run would be nobody if daddy wasn't they had to get
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:03.040]  him there or they weren't a member of the club closed down societies
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:11.360]  yeah you should take it up here you know what besides your nose
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:20.960]  110,000 could you add 110,000 restaurants and now that number is even bigger than all the people
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:34.960]  that are affected by that so who's on euro star that's the railroad in europe almost no one can't
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:50.800]  figure it out so here's the deal you see what bitcoin is it's almost a 27,000 we wrote when
[3:26:50.800 --> 3:26:56.800]  it was 12,000 in the magazine that it broke through its breakout point it was ready to rise
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:02.720]  why because they're pumping in all this cheap money
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:12.400]  could it go down yeah it could go down to another go back down to 10,000 the game is rigged they're
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:18.720]  all rigged yeah the futures markets you get the bigs in there they short the markets they bring
[3:27:18.720 --> 3:27:29.760]  everybody down quomo what a disgusting human being and so many people buy it where i am up here
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:34.960]  they love quomo they love we don't want to know the facts none of us want to know the facts we
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:42.640]  only like him because we're too stupid to think for ourselves gold we're looking into 2021
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:48.560]  gold's down a bit today still traveling in the 1870 1880 range
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:58.880]  i forecast gold is going to be in the 2100 range 2100 above in 2021
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:06.160]  silver right forecasting is going to spike higher percentage wise than gold
[3:28:06.160 --> 3:28:14.960]  gold when you throw out your cell phone or your keyboard whatever is silver in it there's no stockpiles
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:21.120]  silver goes into the dump and the ratio is silver to gold's way out of balance right now and they're
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:27.120]  going to use more they use more and more silver for you know solar paneling and alternative energy
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:33.840]  so this is some of the trends i want to look to at 2020 and we're going to come back we're going to
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:43.840]  come back and this is a time you better prepare for the worst you better have that food you need
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:50.880]  and anything else that you want because this thing's going to go down hard and fast
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:59.760]  when winter sets in as it's already doing ski places can't open up limited limited amounts of
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:05.200]  people and not only the united states around the world the mountains over there in italy and
[3:29:05.920 --> 3:29:13.840]  germany switzerland people that depend on this their whole line the whole stream of income gone
[3:29:15.840 --> 3:29:22.640]  so again prepare for the worst and info wars can help you do that they have the products
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:29.200]  that you need to help you survive in these tough times ahead and when we come back we're
[3:29:29.200 --> 3:29:33.760]  going to go with some real hot trends that you're going to want to know about and prepare for it
[3:29:37.680 --> 3:29:43.040]  mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working
[3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:47.440]  as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to
[3:29:47.440 --> 3:29:53.360]  make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:57.360]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin
[3:29:57.360 --> 3:30:05.040]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ion of four
[3:30:05.040 --> 3:30:11.280]  similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want
[3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:17.680]  to take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end
[3:30:17.680 --> 3:30:22.080]  products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor itself
[3:30:22.080 --> 3:30:25.520]  like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost
[3:30:25.520 --> 3:30:30.640]  them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's
[3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:40.160]  what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug it's not a secret why and leftist controlled
[3:30:40.160 --> 3:30:44.960]  cities all over the world not just the us they encourage people to live in tents cities is
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:49.680]  homeless and they use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime it's because the globalists
[3:30:49.680 --> 3:30:56.400]  admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course the gray reset they want to lower expectations
[3:30:56.400 --> 3:30:59.520]  they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere they don't want you to think
[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:04.080]  of a civilization that gets better they want you to think of civilization that gets progressively
[3:31:04.080 --> 3:31:09.760]  worse the globalists fly around in private jets they have huge private mistakes they are
[3:31:09.760 --> 3:31:14.640]  separate from us their children go to private tutors they admit this now they want us to lock
[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:20.560]  down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a
[3:31:20.560 --> 3:31:25.680]  pro human infrastructure the infrastructure that's left under 5g is going to control robot
[3:31:25.680 --> 3:31:30.640]  autonomous cars and trucks this is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening
[3:31:30.640 --> 3:31:35.600]  because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post human future you better
[3:31:35.600 --> 3:31:43.680]  find out about it right now the post industrial world that's what george herbert walker bush

[3:31:51.520 --> 3:31:57.280]  agenda 2030 which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the debauchery

[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:08.800]  and the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle good versus evil
[3:46:08.800 --> 3:46:14.720]  and stopping abortion we must start valuing human life again we must start saying that we
[3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:21.920]  are not expendable that we are not disposable that we are essential until we do that we are all
[3:46:21.920 --> 3:46:40.400]  slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god-given human rights now
