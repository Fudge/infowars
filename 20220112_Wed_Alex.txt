[00:00.000 --> 00:21.120]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and has free-floating anxiety
[00:21.120 --> 00:27.040]  in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand it, and then their attention
[00:27.040 --> 00:33.200]  gets focused by a leader or a series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis.
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.040]  They literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere.
[00:38.040 --> 00:46.720]  Mass psychosis, also known as group mind, mob mentality, or herd mentality.
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.520]  Before modern civilization, we lived in herds, and in order to survive in the herd, we conform
[00:52.520 --> 00:54.400]  to the herd.
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.000]  This is where mass psychosis all stems from.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  The most popular examples of explaining mass psychosis are typically angry mobs and violent
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.760]  riots, but these are merely the end results.
[01:07.760 --> 01:13.160]  Mass psychosis begins when the individual mind starts to identify as a member of a group
[01:13.160 --> 01:16.200]  based on any unifying factor.
[01:16.200 --> 01:19.280]  The unifying factor doesn't even need to make sense.
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.080]  For many people, the feeling of unity is enough.
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.280]  Our ego mind innately craves acceptance, and by default will instinctively conform to whatever
[01:29.280 --> 01:32.120]  group it perceives to be the majority.
[01:32.120 --> 01:38.080]  In order to successfully conform to the group, the individual must put aside personal intuition
[01:38.080 --> 01:41.240]  and follow the guidance of the group.
[01:41.240 --> 01:46.440]  This makes a person highly controllable and spiritually stifles the individual, which
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.040]  causes them to crave group acceptance even more.
[01:50.040 --> 01:56.360]  Man's disposition for mass psychosis has been written about for millennia, most notably
[01:56.360 --> 01:59.200]  in ancient scripture and philosophy.
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.400]  And we all experience this as human beings, whether we reflect upon it or not.
[02:04.400 --> 02:09.760]  Plato argued that due to the nature of group mind, democracy always leads to tyranny and
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.080]  subjugation.
[02:11.080 --> 02:17.160]  His concern was the lack of good leadership, and philosophized on ways of solving this.
[02:17.160 --> 02:23.760]  In 1895, Gustav Le Bon published The Crowd, wherein he explains the key processes for
[02:23.760 --> 02:29.520]  cultivating mass psychosis, anonymity, contagion, and suggestibility.
[02:29.520 --> 02:35.360]  This work is known to have influenced world leaders, businesses, and tyrants, of which
[02:35.360 --> 02:39.320]  the ethics has been written about for decades.
[02:39.320 --> 02:46.080]  And yet AP and Reuters outrageously claim that mass psychosis does not exist.
[02:46.080 --> 02:52.480]  And it is, in fact, the corporate media apparatus to which they belong that makes this all possible,
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.800]  waging psychological warfare against a group of the population who believes the media would
[02:57.800 --> 02:59.760]  never lie to them.
[02:59.760 --> 03:07.680]  This is why the term mass psychosis is arguably a better term than group mind, or mob mentality.
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.800]  A change in the field of consciousness occurs, a devolution from divine inspiration into
[03:13.800 --> 03:19.400]  primitive hierarchy, which has no place in a civilized society.
[03:19.400 --> 03:22.200]  And yet here we are.
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.800]  Without mass psychosis, today's leaders would have no power.
[03:26.800 --> 03:34.240]  Just like advertising, everything about politics is about cultivating mass psychosis.
[03:34.240 --> 03:40.160]  Whereas the individual pursuit of happiness has inevitably led to beauty and innovation,
[03:40.160 --> 03:44.200]  creating and controlling groups of people, which has been the biggest power play on earth
[03:44.200 --> 03:50.320]  for all of recorded history, almost always leads to death and destruction.
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.760]  The science and study of mass psychosis could be used to enlighten humanity by educating
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.320]  the individual about the power and potential of the human mind.
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.880]  But today, the very same corrupt media being used by wealthy elites to divide and enslave
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.920]  us says there is no such thing as mass psychosis.
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.760]  Mass psychosis is humanity's burden to outgrow.
[04:14.760 --> 04:18.040]  It is why we accept the lesser of two evils.
[04:18.040 --> 04:22.640]  Many of us are well aware of the frailty of man and the civilized world.
[04:22.640 --> 04:27.720]  The great psychologist Carl Jung's warning to the world was that the individual must
[04:27.720 --> 04:30.920]  come face to face with their own shadow.
[04:30.920 --> 04:36.080]  In order to accomplish this, one must liberate themselves from the collective.
[04:36.080 --> 04:43.880]  And until enough of us do, society will continue to be led by tyrants and ignorant mobs.
[04:43.880 --> 04:48.280]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars is leading the way to expose the globalist.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.200]  Tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[04:55.200 --> 05:01.520]  The main transmission starts in 60 seconds.
[05:01.520 --> 05:06.400]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[05:06.400 --> 05:08.400]  the globalists are doing right now.
[05:08.400 --> 05:10.120]  This is their big offensive.
[05:10.120 --> 05:11.520]  This is their takeover.
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.520]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[05:15.520 --> 05:19.560]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[05:19.560 --> 05:20.560]  in the open.
[05:20.560 --> 05:23.120]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed.
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.520]  But they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut
[05:27.520 --> 05:29.360]  down people telling the truth.
[05:29.360 --> 05:32.760]  So listen, Paul Rees, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[05:32.760 --> 05:34.480]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.280]  And when you buy products at InfowarsStore.com, you keep us on air.
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.080]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[05:42.080 --> 05:45.600]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.200]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body that if there's
[05:49.200 --> 05:52.360]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[05:52.360 --> 05:57.000]  They're all back in stock at InfowarsStore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on the air.
[05:57.000 --> 06:25.080]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:27.000 --> 06:35.800]  We've been getting a lot of psychic turbulence, as I know all of you have been the last few
[06:35.800 --> 06:39.720]  weeks because we are going over the top right now, all of us together.
[06:39.720 --> 06:45.240]  The globalists are attempting their total criminal big pharma biomedical state takeover.
[06:45.240 --> 06:48.880]  But humanity is not having its will broken by this.
[06:48.880 --> 06:50.720]  Humanity is awakening.
[06:50.720 --> 06:57.640]  The great reset is an attack on the great awakening, the great third phase of the Renaissance
[06:57.640 --> 07:02.680]  launched 576 years ago.
[07:02.680 --> 07:07.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be completely honest with all of you.
[07:07.720 --> 07:11.720]  I've been cracking up on air, not cracking up making jokes.
[07:11.720 --> 07:17.800]  I've been breaking down on air and I'm just going to be honest again and just say that's
[07:17.800 --> 07:20.400]  what everybody should be doing.
[07:20.400 --> 07:26.200]  If you're not freaking out, if you're not extremely uncomfortable, if you're not going
[07:26.200 --> 07:33.280]  through a lot of real introspection and if you're not really shaking at the very foundations
[07:33.280 --> 07:47.600]  of your psyche and your soul and your will, then something is totally wrong with you.
[07:47.600 --> 07:52.360]  Now this morning, just the news that came out today is even more devastating than the
[07:52.360 --> 07:54.880]  day before, that was more devastating than the day before.
[07:54.880 --> 07:58.880]  It's just every day it's all coming out in the open and then you see the head of Pfizer
[07:58.880 --> 08:03.320]  quarterbacking this eugenics attack, the greatest mass murder in human history and it's just
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.400]  getting started, laughing and giggling and declaring it's a genetic revolution to fix
[08:08.400 --> 08:13.640]  humanity and fix all of our DNA and that it's a forced takeover for our own good.
[08:13.640 --> 08:20.040]  I mean this is a dystopic science fiction movie of all science fiction movies and we're
[08:20.040 --> 08:23.400]  living in this horror.
[08:23.400 --> 08:28.600]  Now here's what's happened and this is why we've reached the point of the event horizon
[08:28.600 --> 08:31.840]  or no return.
[08:31.840 --> 08:35.200]  They are not getting away with this right now and there's no way they're going to get
[08:35.200 --> 08:43.600]  away with it unless they launch a giant nuclear war or unless they do a big cyber attack
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.760]  and claim terrorists did it and take down most of the power grids and let civilization
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.600]  degenerate for a few months and basically collapse because a couple months of no power
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.760]  you're going to have a road warrior situation and it'll be very hard to ever reverse it.
[08:57.760 --> 09:01.600]  So you think we're winning and I think we're winning on the surface politically, it looks
[09:01.600 --> 09:03.640]  like it.
[09:03.640 --> 09:07.240]  My spider sense is never been at this level.
[09:07.240 --> 09:11.440]  I told you it was 10 times what it previously was yesterday.
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.400]  It's like 20 times today and so I just pray to God to give us strength and discernment
[09:17.400 --> 09:24.160]  and give us a calm spirit and to please help me be a calm, nice person, please Jesus and
[09:24.160 --> 09:27.600]  I just think everybody needs to understand that this is a spiritual attack, this is good
[09:27.600 --> 09:37.200]  versus evil and what we are witnessing is the beginning of the rise of the Antichrist
[09:37.200 --> 09:38.480]  and everything else that's going to follow.
[09:38.480 --> 09:44.040]  I mean you are now entering the great birth pains, I don't know if they'll go five years,
[09:44.040 --> 09:47.920]  ten years, twenty years, they intend to have their world government in total place within
[09:47.920 --> 09:56.600]  eight and eighty percent of us dead and those are all official numbers.
[09:56.600 --> 10:02.640]  When I look at this news, I start having an anxiety attack.
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.280]  If I was given a letter that had a thumb drive in it and I put the thumb drive in and it
[10:08.280 --> 10:11.600]  was my neighbor butchering a child in their basement, I would start hyperventilating,
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.720]  I'd probably throw up, I'd call the police, I would have a panic attack.
[10:16.720 --> 10:20.280]  I don't have panic attacks a lot in my life, I've been in car wrecks where people I was
[10:20.280 --> 10:24.560]  with had arm cut off, blood spring everywhere, totally calm, I've been in all sorts of stuff
[10:24.560 --> 10:32.080]  but this mass evil on this scale, if you aren't completely freaked out, there's something
[10:32.080 --> 10:39.880]  extremely, extremely wrong with you, absolutely wrong with you.
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.440]  So the reason I'm saying all this is, I have all this show planned, I have all these clips,
[10:44.440 --> 10:50.560]  all these documents, all these incredible things and I am having trouble doing the show and
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.240]  again I don't say that as some type of big event on air, like oh look he's having trouble
[10:55.240 --> 10:56.240]  with the show.
[10:56.240 --> 11:03.520]  But this information is all confirmed and what it signifies is the end of civilization
[11:03.520 --> 11:09.760]  as we know it, there's a 40% increase in worldwide death indexed by nations that give the Pfizer
[11:09.760 --> 11:18.520]  or Moderna shots, major insurance companies confirm 40 to 40 plus percent death increase
[11:18.520 --> 11:26.080]  in 145 nations and that's just the start, they really did it and I have family that
[11:26.080 --> 11:32.120]  rebelled against me just for rebellion's sake and that took it and they look so sick and
[11:32.120 --> 11:37.080]  so bad now and that's the thing I haven't talked about because it's personal and it
[11:37.080 --> 11:42.560]  just, it just tears my guts out.
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.640]  And then there's the frustration level of seeing the left that are so deceived spiritually,
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.080]  they think this is all funny and cute, they're getting Pfizer money, down to low level YouTubers,
[11:51.080 --> 11:57.840]  they have a few thousand views, I mean it's just watching the people go along with it
[11:57.840 --> 12:06.400]  and get hurt by it so bad, it is the great delusion.
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.680]  You know almost every time we hear a Greg Rees report, I say well that was his best
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.640]  report, well all of them have just been over the top but the one that we just aired the
[12:15.640 --> 12:18.840]  first five minutes at some stations don't carry is so incredibly powerful, we can put
[12:18.840 --> 12:22.720]  that on screen, I'm going to ask listeners to go and get it and share it, got 13 thousand
[12:22.720 --> 12:26.200]  views, went up a few hours ago, needs 50 million views.
[12:26.200 --> 12:38.040]  The truth about mass psychosis and it's just short five minutes, crystalline veritas.
[12:38.040 --> 12:46.680]  So let me just, let me just try to say this very calmly then because I was out there right
[12:46.680 --> 12:51.560]  off the show trying to write a show headline and what's happening is so incredible that
[12:51.560 --> 12:57.600]  I was just, it hit me like this is actually happening and I know you know that, I know
[12:57.600 --> 13:04.480]  I know that but has it sunk into your cells that there's a 40% death increase worldwide
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.360]  for the first time since they started counting those numbers a hundred years ago with the
[13:08.360 --> 13:15.760]  scientific fashion, 40% death increase and it's not from COVID-19, you can take those
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.320]  numbers out, they're not even 1% of it.
[13:19.320 --> 13:31.520]  We are watching premeditated mass murder.
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.760]  So let me tell you what's going on.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.120]  Now this already happened months ago but now the official government came out to cover
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.200]  their ass and did this and that's in the spars drill they did a few years before they launched
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.080]  this that once it comes out they're killing everybody then they've got a way to spin it
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.560]  and claim it's an accident and then that collapses civilization and collapses confidence which
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.560]  is good to quote lower the carbon footprint because when the public finds out that they've
[13:57.560 --> 14:05.920]  been killed they're going to now die slowly and they've got this all actually worried
[14:05.920 --> 14:07.440]  out it's so sophisticated.
[14:07.440 --> 14:13.240]  That's why in certain regions and certain areas they give you saline.
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.280]  In others they give you the standard mutagenic injection and in others whether it's Pfizer
[14:18.280 --> 14:23.800]  or Moderna it's confirmed I have the articles here they soup it up to be hyper mutagenic
[14:23.800 --> 14:28.120]  where you'll have cancer within weeks.
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.640]  Very aggressive cancer and so that way they can try to mess with the studies and go we
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.560]  don't know why these people are all fine these are all dying.
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.840]  This has been well planned out and I've been studying in in depth for long before they launched
[14:40.840 --> 14:50.600]  it but now to be inside of it this is just incredible the balls to do this.
[14:50.600 --> 14:54.320]  Now on my own end I can tell they're getting ready to make a move against everybody before
[14:54.320 --> 14:58.840]  the midterms because I haven't talked about the dirty tricks and the things that are going
[14:58.840 --> 15:03.280]  on against us just that I know of and it's not that I'm personally worried about mere
[15:03.280 --> 15:08.880]  info wars I care about the operator the crew it lets us know the timetable we're in right
[15:08.880 --> 15:15.080]  now and also just adds to the urgency of every broadcast could be our last I will never
[15:15.080 --> 15:21.120]  quit I will never surrender when I throw fits on air and you know say I want to quit it's
[15:21.120 --> 15:26.240]  because at that moment I do because I'm so sick of focusing on this evil but we have
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.360]  to stop it and the Bible says the beginning of knowledge comes with great sorrow and with
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.400]  great knowledge comes great sorrow but I'd rather be alive and informed and know what's
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.120]  going on and know who God is than be deceived by these people which is much worse but I'm
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.520]  going to do my best when we come back folks it's just I haven't scratched the surface
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.440]  it's just unbelievable it's all confirmed they are mass murdering people all around
[15:50.440 --> 15:53.840]  you and they've got all these people to sign on to do it is that they're doing well who
[15:53.840 --> 16:00.200]  aren't able to now admit what they've been part of and that's part of the Psyop Christmas

[17:26.520 --> 17:30.000]  into your cells and despite the fact that the product is going to sell out the next
[17:30.000 --> 17:37.200]  week or so we're going to keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days so again
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.600]  I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6 2022 we're going to run this

[17:55.280 --> 18:05.120]  the info war 360 win at infowarstore.com get our great bag of it here I mean this is from
[18:05.120 --> 18:10.040]  people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communist well that's where some of the best
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.160]  coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than
[18:15.160 --> 18:19.240]  Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls
[18:19.240 --> 18:22.680]  communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.600]  coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.040]  buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.200]  never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more
[18:34.200 --> 18:37.560]  per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's
[18:37.560 --> 18:45.920]  wake up America Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally in fact I'm gonna tell you
[18:45.920 --> 18:51.840]  a little story we had like that I think you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's infowarstore.com
[18:51.840 --> 18:54.920]  and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find us you don't want to see
[18:54.920 --> 19:06.080]  that's fine there is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling
[19:06.080 --> 19:13.240]  class not in communist China not in Mexico not in the United States not anywhere is there
[19:13.240 --> 19:19.080]  a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central
[19:19.080 --> 19:24.800]  banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look
[19:24.800 --> 19:29.320]  into say the Anglo-American establishment the founder of the Bilderberg group the trilateral
[19:29.320 --> 19:34.480]  commission the United Nations the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers until
[19:34.480 --> 19:40.160]  10 years ago the media said the control corporate media the Bilderberg group didn't exist well
[19:40.160 --> 19:45.200]  now the Bilderberg group is public its former head still on the steering committee is Klaus
[19:45.200 --> 19:50.920]  Schwab and he has set up the great reset at global government and if as a liberty movement
[19:50.920 --> 19:55.720]  worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian
[19:55.720 --> 20:01.680]  corporate takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat em easily leading
[20:01.680 --> 20:24.680]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:24.680 --> 20:31.920]  welcome my friends to the final days of the american republic the final days of civilization
[20:31.920 --> 20:38.960]  as we know it the great reset the great calling i remember general stubble bind former head
[20:38.960 --> 20:47.320]  of the army warning me in person and then many times on air that they had this plan
[20:47.320 --> 20:52.160]  ready through the vaccines to start the depopulation and his wife of course was a medical doctor
[20:52.160 --> 21:02.160]  that served heads of state and there's a hollywood movies made about him he ran the secret
[21:02.160 --> 21:10.000]  government projects and he's dead now you think bert stubble bind told the truth yeah
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.200]  he told the truth and he had to basically hide out in the jungle when he released the
[21:16.200 --> 21:24.040]  information because they tried to come and killing they never came back to the u.s. after
[21:24.040 --> 21:32.560]  that after they came on my show they had to leave so that's the type of sacrifice people
[21:32.560 --> 21:41.360]  have made to bring you this information this isn't a game folks we knew first that it was
[21:41.360 --> 21:49.160]  nanoparticles they were synthetically releasing thanks to general flinn former head of defense
[21:49.160 --> 21:55.200]  intelligence former national security advisor you think these people just make stuff up
[21:55.200 --> 22:02.000]  like this can risk their lives no ladies and gentlemen the house of cards is collapsing
[22:02.000 --> 22:12.560]  EU government officially admits covid vax destroys immune system meanwhile the house
[22:12.560 --> 22:19.160]  oversight committee has released thousands of pages of documents proving Fauci completely
[22:19.160 --> 22:25.760]  committed perjury when he claimed he was never involved in gain of function research the
[22:25.760 --> 22:35.800]  DARPA and Pentagon documents released by project Veritas confirm not only did Fauci secretly
[22:35.800 --> 22:45.440]  develop covid-19 but they knew that iver mcdonough was the miracle treatment before they released
[22:45.440 --> 22:51.520]  covid-19 I wrote that right before I went live 25 minutes ago we should probably add
[22:51.520 --> 22:58.880]  that the congressional slash DARPA Pentagon documents because that's a huge story in and
[22:58.880 --> 23:04.560]  of itself and then each piece of that is massive and that's only the tip of the iceberg congress
[23:04.560 --> 23:14.120]  released last night thousands of pages of documents that they've had the oversight committee
[23:14.120 --> 23:20.280]  about the giant illegal program run by bill gates Fauci and Peter dasik for Obama going
[23:20.280 --> 23:27.680]  back 12 years ago about a year into Obama's administration it's a big scandal in 2015
[23:27.680 --> 23:33.680]  this is very well-known stuff this is like them on the news saying the buccaneers have
[23:33.680 --> 23:39.520]  nothing to do with Tampa Bay everybody knows you're like you're gaslighting me the buccaneers
[23:39.520 --> 23:45.640]  are in Tampa Bay no they're not they're in Wisconsin you're like no that's Green Bay
[23:45.640 --> 23:51.480]  the level of lying is insane but that's all they've got is the gaslighting and just hoping
[23:51.480 --> 23:55.400]  you don't check into the fact that you've been lied to or that you signed on to a fraud
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.920]  and that you've now been hurt and maimed and may die because that's just too scary that
[24:00.920 --> 24:04.800]  they broke the social contract with you that'd be like if kids started getting on school buses
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.520]  in the morning and the school bus drivers suddenly all over the country just pulled guns out
[24:08.520 --> 24:12.320]  and started shooting kids people wouldn't know how to deal with that because that's the social
[24:12.320 --> 24:18.040]  contract being broken and it's the same thing when big pharma and all the news and congress
[24:18.040 --> 24:23.160]  and are telling you this shots good take it but then it makes you sick and erases your
[24:23.160 --> 24:29.400]  immune system and then the Pentagon it turns out knew that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
[24:29.400 --> 24:37.160]  but it's particularly ivermectin is good throughout infection when you're sick and helping you
[24:37.160 --> 24:47.600]  not be sick so we have crime upon crime but the big news is courage is what courage is
[24:47.600 --> 24:54.640]  what it's infectious globalists told me many years ago jones they'll never wake up their
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.480]  animals they don't care you're a fool keep trying they'll destroy you and yes some of
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.120]  the public are like rats they they are trying to destroy me trying to save them but it matter
[25:02.120 --> 25:05.600]  a large group of people of every race color and creed care about the truth and when they
[25:05.600 --> 25:15.120]  are faced with the hard facts they are waking up and taking action so i bet on humanity
[25:15.120 --> 25:21.240]  i bet on you and so far despite the biggest gaslighting hoax in history in this takeover
[25:21.240 --> 25:25.120]  and all the attacks and all the censorship and all the bullying it's backfired and you're
[25:25.120 --> 25:30.320]  not submitting yet again you're getting out of that comfort place that coma you were in
[25:30.320 --> 25:37.480]  and you're waking up and getting pissed and i salute you so i'm gonna calm down i'm getting
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.600]  calm now i'm gonna come back next segment and cover all this news in a linear line all
[25:42.600 --> 25:55.840]  this news in a linear line as best i can but it's huge i mean just that piece that congress
[25:55.840 --> 26:00.600]  has the power to release classified information if that committee sees fit and they did that
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.480]  fousy ran it and suppressed treatments and created the virus and went to the pentagon
[26:05.480 --> 26:10.920]  and wanted to release it in 2017 and 2018 we told you that a year ago those documents
[26:10.920 --> 26:15.400]  were out then from people inside the project that were compartmentalized and went oh my
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.880]  god we did this on purpose i'm gonna release this to whistleblower groups and they did
[26:19.880 --> 26:29.160]  it and it was all real we went and checked and confirmed it was all real and now it's
[26:29.160 --> 26:37.000]  all confirmed not just by whoever gave it to project veritas probably congress itself
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.560]  and then congress wants it's safe for them to release it after james o' keith hit the
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.800]  barbed wire with all the death threats and attacks he's under then it gave them the courage
[26:46.800 --> 26:50.720]  for the right thing i can tell you about james o' keith he's in the same boat i'm in grand
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.040]  juries open all over the place trying to indict him for something i told you back up
[26:54.040 --> 27:03.040]  with that diary of joe biden's daughter his sex slave it looks like that that they rated
[27:03.040 --> 27:09.200]  him to get information about phyzer and peter dazik and fouchy and the pentagon documents
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.280]  they were not rating him over that he wasn't even involved in it really you know they
[27:13.280 --> 27:17.840]  gave it to him and he didn't want the diary and never published it others did that's on
[27:17.840 --> 27:22.880]  record but he's had to put a video out saying he will never commit suicide and i want to
[27:22.880 --> 27:28.520]  say the same thing i'll ever commit suicide because i'm not trying to brag here i'm bringing
[27:28.520 --> 27:32.680]  this up so you understand what a victory is it takes james o' keith feeling willing to
[27:32.680 --> 27:37.480]  get put in prison or die it takes alex jones being willing to get put in prison or die
[27:37.480 --> 27:45.440]  it takes joe rogan waking up it takes tucker carlson waking up that's what men are supposed
[27:45.440 --> 27:53.000]  to do no matter how high the punishment could be because we have children to defend and
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.600]  we have a civilization to defend and we're not going to be like all the establishment
[27:56.600 --> 28:02.360]  lawyers and globalists that phyzer and the inside globalist death cult thought would
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.680]  go along with this and they could gaslight us in a submission yeah you may have manipulated
[28:06.680 --> 28:10.920]  and brainwashed half the public into going under stock home syndrome but you didn't work
[28:10.920 --> 28:21.800]  on us all you did was get us fighting mad so i intend to bring these people to justice
[28:21.800 --> 28:28.160]  legally and lawfully and they intend to stage terror attacks and power outages and civil
[28:28.160 --> 28:31.760]  wars and all this other crap to try to smoke screen but i just want to ask everybody that
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.200]  works for the system you know you're signed on with evil people and you know they don't
[28:37.200 --> 28:41.560]  run this country with any legitimacy and you know going down the road they've built is
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.280]  going to destroy civilization so it's time for everybody to repent and turn back to
[28:46.280 --> 28:52.640]  god and start doing the right thing and not just being macchiavelli of what you think

[33:34.000 --> 33:41.600]  order the house of cards has collapsed the problem is they wargamed all that and spars
[33:41.600 --> 33:47.080]  john hobkins rockefeller un drills three years before they launch the attack and that's
[33:47.080 --> 33:55.320]  part of their plan though it's not going exactly the way they want it so here's the headlines
[33:55.320 --> 34:05.120]  ladies and gentlemen they are incredible. GOP oversight committee house oversight committee
[34:05.120 --> 34:10.880]  releases fouchy emails further proving he covered up lab leak and then it gets even
[34:10.880 --> 34:16.560]  more intense what's in the documents ivermectin works throughout all phases of covid according
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.640]  to leaked military documents for those that don't know the u.s. military is the biggest
[34:21.640 --> 34:28.640]  tester of drugs and chemicals and compounds out there there's two ways to get drugs basically
[34:28.640 --> 34:34.480]  approved have an approved for the fda or by the pentagon for emergency use and look at
[34:34.480 --> 34:44.560]  continues right here with all the other giant developments that have now come out that again
[34:44.560 --> 34:51.760]  major insurance companies report forty percent increase in deaths higher than any other previous
[34:51.760 --> 35:00.280]  death grouping in modern history and then you have a major canadian document out of
[35:00.280 --> 35:05.640]  a major university in a hundred plus countries a hundred forty five nations showing exact
[35:05.640 --> 35:12.760]  same numbers forty to forty five percent increases in death worldwide where the shots are given
[35:12.760 --> 35:16.020]  the country's whether or not given which is only just a few nothing's happening nobody
[35:16.020 --> 35:24.160]  said it's all there and it gets worse how many times did i tell you this because i was
[35:24.160 --> 35:29.040]  reading the literature interviewing top scientist i mean it wasn't hard to figure this out like
[35:29.040 --> 35:33.760]  hey don't take cyanide here's how it kills you you can go read a paper on how it kills
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.320]  you in about thirty seconds well you can also go to top scientist about why they never made
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.740]  a common cold vaccine because it causes autoimmune responses and all sorts of organ failure but
[35:42.740 --> 35:49.240]  if you make a super virus and then you inject into people the spike protein or order the
[35:49.240 --> 35:55.080]  body to manufacture it that creates colonies of toxic spike protein that your body then
[35:55.080 --> 36:01.120]  attacks throughout yourself eating holes in your capillaries and in your veins and arteries
[36:01.120 --> 36:08.200]  and in your other tissues and that's just that area the cancer causing nature of this
[36:08.200 --> 36:15.840]  is spectacular and we knew exactly what would happen we had all these scientists on a year
[36:15.840 --> 36:22.320]  and a half ago and then it came out last year early last year that they posted on the cdc
[36:22.320 --> 36:27.760]  website all the things they predicted it would do including cancer mycocarditis heart attacks
[36:27.760 --> 36:34.120]  it's all right there they knew months before they rolled it out in america so see here's
[36:34.120 --> 36:38.080]  how my brain works when i read you this over the top article headline that's all over the
[36:38.080 --> 36:44.320]  news today we could just cover the surface of it and it would be important but we're
[36:44.320 --> 36:48.080]  not going to just cover the surface here i'm going to explain why they're doing this now
[36:48.080 --> 36:54.320]  and how it's in the spars 2023 2028 battle plant which we did a hour and a half long
[36:54.320 --> 36:59.560]  video on last year i guess about eight months ago that now has five million views at bandot
[36:59.560 --> 37:04.720]  video i'll just tell you the number of views so you can find it more easily but just type
[37:04.720 --> 37:12.120]  in spars and it'll come up for you spars drill so here's the big news of the day on top of
[37:12.120 --> 37:17.160]  the documents coming out from congress proving fouchy created the weapon released it created
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.520]  the vaccines that actually hurt you i mean it's it's insane blocked treatments they already
[37:21.520 --> 37:28.640]  knew could treat people i mean this is incredible eu warns repeat boosters could weaken immune
[37:28.640 --> 37:37.080]  system oh bloomberg how many people you know taking off face book and instagram and youtube
[37:37.080 --> 37:45.800]  and twitter for vaccine this info that these mRNA shots do tend to block a natural virus
[37:45.800 --> 37:50.440]  or even artificial virus of this type for a few months but then it's like taking heroin
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.520]  you need more and then you have no immune system left and that's in the studies we didn't
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.400]  just pull that out of our rear end or anything oh but fizer writes the guidelines for big
[38:00.400 --> 38:06.440]  tech of what's allowed to be said and what isn't so now remember what happened about
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.520]  six months ago we had the cdc and fda scientist in three different rounds majority of them
[38:12.520 --> 38:19.960]  resign when they voted to not approve the injections for children remember twelve and
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.800]  up and then for five and up and they would not approve boosters and said what and said
[38:24.800 --> 38:33.480]  what it will erase your immune system it turns off the killer t's the main bulk of your military
[38:33.480 --> 38:40.040]  your infantrymen hiv attacks the key lymphocyte it's the like the brain bug in starship troopers
[38:40.040 --> 38:46.280]  that gives the orders hiv kills those they're the ones that go out and identify an enemy
[38:46.280 --> 38:50.720]  like a scout and then go and give the orders back they're like a scout and a general but
[38:50.720 --> 38:55.080]  the killer t is what you see when you have an infection and that puss is pouring out
[38:55.080 --> 39:00.240]  of it that's your body rushing troops and those are white blood cells to kill they're
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.160]  like amoebas they are amoebas they just goop goop goop viruses bacteria rotten stuff you
[39:05.160 --> 39:12.600]  name it and then all that puss is them dying and and defecating all the poison out that's
[39:12.600 --> 39:18.720]  what that is they just like pack them be me me me me me me me me me so we knew what was
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.960]  going to happen so this doesn't kill your killer t's it just turns them off and they
[39:24.960 --> 39:28.360]  don't know how long they just know starting off in trials a year and a half ago in England
[39:28.360 --> 39:35.800]  they're still off looks like they turn them off till they die that's not very good right
[39:35.800 --> 39:45.640]  that's not very liberal or loving so EU warns repeat booster shots weaken immune system we
[39:45.640 --> 39:49.200]  knew this from the Israeli studies we know from the British studies we knew it from our
[39:49.200 --> 39:57.560]  own scientist in the government boards who were pro vaccine pro big pharma everything
[39:57.560 --> 40:02.520]  saying my god this isn't a vaccine it makes people really sick in a racist immune systems
[40:02.520 --> 40:10.240]  in one of the FDA meetings at the top board when we covered this at nauseam they said
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.880]  you will discredit vaccines for generations you will discredit the scientific community
[40:15.880 --> 40:21.480]  you will destroy confidence in the government and in institutions do not do this and they
[40:21.480 --> 40:27.240]  said we're doing it because they want the collapse of civilization you understand why they wouldn't
[40:27.240 --> 40:30.920]  give her by something makes them sick and kill them slowly while they'll all go to prison
[40:30.920 --> 40:36.720]  they'll all they don't care they're psychotic you think the guy in 12 monkeys when he releases
[40:36.720 --> 40:47.400]  the bio-weapon at the airport cares he's gonna die you're dealing with psychotic human exterminist
[40:47.400 --> 40:53.400]  so this is not new news here that's why we've told you thousands of times it erases your
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.600]  immune system and we played you clips of their people admitting it but giggling at Pfizer
[40:58.600 --> 41:06.560]  going where the studies do show the CEO says the studies do show it turns off immune system so you
[41:06.560 --> 41:13.000]  will need most shots always after but it is all right we have a super shot we give you soon
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.360]  where you take it and it fixes all your DNA and you'll never get sick again so we'll make I mean
[41:20.360 --> 41:27.720]  that's how the CEO talk those are things he's actually said and and well he's like yeah we're
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.840]  gonna have a universal vaccine soon so that all the problems with this one are fixed and what did
[41:32.840 --> 41:39.960]  what did the head of Pfizer say yesterday that's get that clip ready for next segment what do you
[41:39.960 --> 41:50.480]  say he said it doesn't work he said yeah it doesn't really work he said oh two shots don't really do
[41:50.480 --> 41:58.760]  anything they don't work quote two doses of vaccine off a very limited protection if any if any oh
[41:58.760 --> 42:12.000]  if not even oh oh oh oh oh oh but he's got an answer for you and what was it more shots which
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.960]  actually erases your immune system see how it works and I told you 20 two months ago with top
[42:18.960 --> 42:25.080]  scientists and top insiders from the UN that this was to erase your immune system and give you
[42:25.080 --> 42:29.200]  cancer and attack your ovaries and attack your testicles and that they would then tell you
[42:29.200 --> 42:35.640]  they're gonna have new advanced super shots to fix the damage of this and they've done it I mean
[42:35.640 --> 42:44.200]  you talk about a maniac the head of Pfizer was on TV we play yesterday saying we're going to fix
[42:44.200 --> 42:51.200]  the human DNA everyone Pfizer is going to fix you you all are not working right we're going to fix

[46:55.080 --> 46:57.080]  and support free speech in the fight for liberty
[46:57.080 --> 46:58.080]  at the same time
[46:58.080 --> 47:00.080]  at InfoWarsTour.com
[47:00.080 --> 47:03.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[47:03.080 --> 47:05.080]  of the new world order
[47:05.080 --> 47:07.080]  It's Alex Jones
[47:18.080 --> 47:21.080]  Nobody connects the dots like Info Wars
[47:21.080 --> 47:24.080]  Nobody has had a bigger effect
[47:24.080 --> 47:26.080]  and more devastating victories
[47:26.080 --> 47:28.080]  against the new world order crime syndicate
[47:28.080 --> 47:29.080]  than we have
[47:29.080 --> 47:31.080]  And again, I don't say that when I report to you
[47:31.080 --> 47:32.080]  thump in my chest
[47:32.080 --> 47:33.080]  I tell you, we are bloodied
[47:33.080 --> 47:35.080]  We are under attack
[47:35.080 --> 47:37.080]  We are in the darkest, deepest
[47:37.080 --> 47:38.080]  dungeons of the enemy
[47:38.080 --> 47:39.080]  fighting them right now
[47:39.080 --> 47:42.080]  and only your prayer is keeping us in position
[47:42.080 --> 47:44.080]  You're like the gravity in the universe
[47:44.080 --> 47:46.080]  that God's created that holds a star in place
[47:46.080 --> 47:48.080]  Without your continued support
[47:48.080 --> 47:49.080]  and spiritual support
[47:49.080 --> 47:51.080]  we are not going to make it
[47:51.080 --> 47:53.080]  And that means all of us together
[47:53.080 --> 47:55.080]  I cannot stress to you enough
[47:55.080 --> 47:57.080]  how incredible a moment this is
[47:57.080 --> 47:59.080]  that I understand it's hard to deal with
[47:59.080 --> 48:01.080]  I'm getting chills all over my body
[48:01.080 --> 48:03.080]  I mean, folks, they are
[48:03.080 --> 48:05.080]  literally mass murdering people
[48:05.080 --> 48:06.080]  with soft-kill weapons
[48:06.080 --> 48:07.080]  in front of us
[48:07.080 --> 48:09.080]  all over the place right now
[48:09.080 --> 48:13.080]  And again, that's the smaller weapon
[48:13.080 --> 48:15.080]  because the evidence is arriving
[48:15.080 --> 48:17.080]  that if you know about this early enough
[48:17.080 --> 48:18.080]  and take iRomectin in cycles
[48:18.080 --> 48:19.080]  it can basically block it
[48:19.080 --> 48:20.080]  And of course the military
[48:20.080 --> 48:22.080]  knew that this weapon was being developed
[48:22.080 --> 48:23.080]  and they were looking at what treated it
[48:23.080 --> 48:26.080]  This is before it got released
[48:26.080 --> 48:28.080]  because they knew that the globalists
[48:28.080 --> 48:29.080]  were cutting this crap up
[48:29.080 --> 48:30.080]  and I'm not lionizing the military
[48:30.080 --> 48:33.080]  that's what the documents show
[48:33.080 --> 48:35.080]  So there's going to be ways to mitigate this
[48:35.080 --> 48:37.080]  but do you know what it means
[48:37.080 --> 48:40.080]  when they are launching it
[48:40.080 --> 48:41.080]  and when they've rolled it out
[48:41.080 --> 48:42.080]  and when they block the treatments
[48:42.080 --> 48:43.080]  and block the truth
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.080]  and when they engage in this whole exercise
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.080]  to see what they can get away with
[48:47.080 --> 48:49.080]  it's a test
[48:49.080 --> 48:52.080]  by this multinational crime syndicate
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.080]  and everybody thinks about the world
[48:53.080 --> 48:55.080]  as the Chinese, the Russians
[48:55.080 --> 48:56.080]  and the Americans
[48:56.080 --> 48:58.080]  that has very little to do with it
[48:58.080 --> 49:00.080]  if you actually get to the higher levels
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.080]  And Ian Fleming was the number two in OSS
[49:04.080 --> 49:07.080]  and he was number two in MI6 after that
[49:07.080 --> 49:09.080]  and he was involved in founding the CIA
[49:09.080 --> 49:12.080]  and he wrote the James Bond books
[49:12.080 --> 49:14.080]  The James Bond movies are cheesy and stupid
[49:14.080 --> 49:16.080]  and I'm not talking about those
[49:16.080 --> 49:17.080]  the books
[49:17.080 --> 49:20.080]  and the books are all about globalist creating
[49:20.080 --> 49:22.080]  bioweapons to exterminate the whole population
[49:22.080 --> 49:25.080]  and they're 99% of it and they re-emerge
[49:25.080 --> 49:28.080]  and it's all about powerful corporations
[49:28.080 --> 49:30.080]  playing countries off against each other
[49:30.080 --> 49:31.080]  to consolidate control
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.080]  and Fleming gave interviews saying
[49:33.080 --> 49:35.080]  this is how the world really works
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.080]  he goes the rich and powerful meet
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.080]  at private estates and other areas
[49:39.080 --> 49:41.080]  and they plan the future of the world
[49:41.080 --> 49:43.080]  and he wrote books about it
[49:43.080 --> 49:46.080]  James Bond isn't really fighting the Russians is he
[49:46.080 --> 49:48.080]  or even the Chinese
[49:48.080 --> 49:52.080]  it's always Specter playing them off against each other
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.080]  and Specter's real folks
[49:55.080 --> 49:56.080]  blow fell the cat
[49:56.080 --> 49:58.080]  look at Klaus Schwab
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.080]  Klaus Schwab's the head of the Bilderberg group
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.080]  and the dude before him looked just like him
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.080]  with a bald head and a white cat and everything
[50:07.080 --> 50:10.080]  See I used to think Hollywood was incredible
[50:10.080 --> 50:12.080]  with their fiction when I was younger
[50:12.080 --> 50:13.080]  and didn't know stuff
[50:13.080 --> 50:15.080]  and then I met the Goddies in New York once
[50:15.080 --> 50:18.080]  and they acted just like gangsters in a movie
[50:18.080 --> 50:21.080]  because the movie's about how they act
[50:21.080 --> 50:22.080]  and not the other way around
[50:22.080 --> 50:24.080]  and it's the same thing with these globalists
[50:24.080 --> 50:27.080]  they literally have bald heads and cats
[50:27.080 --> 50:32.080]  I mean you just cannot make this up
[50:32.080 --> 50:33.080]  okay
[50:35.080 --> 50:38.080]  and so we have the actual supervillain
[50:38.080 --> 50:41.080]  who has this alter ego of this loving businessman
[50:41.080 --> 50:44.080]  that says you're gonna own nothing and have nothing and like it
[50:44.080 --> 50:48.080]  trying to crash the world economy
[50:48.080 --> 50:55.080]  and our military is about to go into a war with the Russians
[50:55.080 --> 50:57.080]  and there's globalists in Russia
[50:57.080 --> 50:59.080]  and there's globalists in the US working together
[50:59.080 --> 51:01.080]  to get us into a fight with each other
[51:01.080 --> 51:03.080]  that's how Specter operates
[51:03.080 --> 51:05.080]  I'm gonna stop right there
[51:05.080 --> 51:08.080]  we have a very special guest who's got firebomb repeatedly
[51:08.080 --> 51:11.080]  Tommy Robinson's gonna be joining us 15 minutes into the next hour
[51:11.080 --> 51:13.080]  he's got incredible exclusive breaking news
[51:13.080 --> 51:15.080]  and his new film is gonna premiere soon
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.080]  we've got exclusive clips of The Rape of England
[51:17.080 --> 51:20.080]  the new film coming up 15 minutes to the next hour
[51:20.080 --> 51:23.080]  and then I'm gonna start part one today
[51:23.080 --> 51:25.080]  I've been having to talk and do a lot of research
[51:25.080 --> 51:27.080]  and just get my ducks in a row on this
[51:27.080 --> 51:29.080]  because it's so unbelievable
[51:29.080 --> 51:31.080]  I'm gonna be revealing tomorrow
[51:31.080 --> 51:34.080]  some of the industrial level espionage
[51:34.080 --> 51:36.080]  being carried out against us
[51:36.080 --> 51:39.080]  which just lets you know the next level of the attack
[51:39.080 --> 51:40.080]  is beyond censorship
[51:40.080 --> 51:42.080]  and beyond trying to get grand juries to indict people
[51:42.080 --> 51:44.080]  and beyond
[51:44.080 --> 51:46.080]  it's beyond that
[51:46.080 --> 51:48.080]  and again people say
[51:48.080 --> 51:50.080]  well Jones how are you handling the stress of them doing all this to you
[51:50.080 --> 51:53.080]  we're all in the same damn ship together
[51:53.080 --> 51:55.080]  and it's sinking
[51:55.080 --> 51:57.080]  and my children are on board this with you
[51:57.080 --> 51:59.080]  I'm not doing well
[51:59.080 --> 52:02.080]  do you understand though you're not doing well
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.080]  and we can fix the damn ship folks
[52:04.080 --> 52:07.080]  but you've got to admit it is sinking
[52:07.080 --> 52:10.080]  so I'm sitting here looking at all this incredible news
[52:10.080 --> 52:12.080]  you see this entire stack of news right here
[52:12.080 --> 52:14.080]  is government documents, government reports
[52:14.080 --> 52:16.080]  congressional release documents
[52:16.080 --> 52:18.080]  everything
[52:18.080 --> 52:21.080]  I'm gonna cover it in the first 15 minutes to the next hour
[52:22.080 --> 52:24.080]  Canadian University reports
[52:24.080 --> 52:26.080]  British government reports
[52:26.080 --> 52:28.080]  in fact guys I can't find it in my stack
[52:28.080 --> 52:30.080]  the British Medical Journal reports one that's waking up so many people
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.080]  that the vaccine turns off your immune system on the first shot
[52:33.080 --> 52:35.080]  gives you a negative immune system on the third shot
[52:35.080 --> 52:37.080]  absolutely linked to infertility cancer
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.080]  that was in my stack I forgot to have that at home
[52:39.080 --> 52:41.080]  I think
[52:41.080 --> 52:44.080]  so I want to go over all this
[52:44.080 --> 52:46.080]  and explain what's in the Fauci documents
[52:46.080 --> 52:48.080]  because we already know what was in them
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.080]  it already came out eight, nine months ago
[52:50.080 --> 52:52.080]  but now Veritas got the documents
[52:52.080 --> 52:54.080]  and now Congress said no those are real
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.080]  here's these
[52:56.080 --> 52:58.080]  it's the same documents
[52:58.080 --> 53:00.080]  I haven't talked to James other than text messages
[53:00.080 --> 53:02.080]  he hasn't told me who gave it to him
[53:02.080 --> 53:04.080]  but I mean it came from Congress
[53:04.080 --> 53:06.080]  that came from Congress
[53:06.080 --> 53:08.080]  I'm gonna leave it at that because I have other sources
[53:08.080 --> 53:10.080]  so good luck FBI
[53:10.080 --> 53:12.080]  trying to indict him for having secret
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.080]  Pentagon documents because it came from Congress
[53:14.080 --> 53:16.080]  and I can just tell you that
[53:18.080 --> 53:20.080]  now
[53:20.080 --> 53:22.080]  let's just pull back here a little bit
[53:22.080 --> 53:24.080]  and just let this settle in
[53:24.080 --> 53:26.080]  we're gonna look at what's really in these documents coming up
[53:26.080 --> 53:28.080]  and we're just gonna hit five points
[53:28.080 --> 53:30.080]  because there's hundreds in them
[53:30.080 --> 53:32.080]  but five of them
[53:32.080 --> 53:34.080]  they created the virus
[53:34.080 --> 53:37.080]  months before it was released they prepared the vaccine makers to begin manufacturing it
[53:37.080 --> 53:39.080]  and then to act like they just suddenly
[53:39.080 --> 53:41.080]  you know a week into it had the new vaccine
[53:41.080 --> 53:43.080]  total proof of premeditation
[53:43.080 --> 53:45.080]  they approached the Pentagon
[53:45.080 --> 53:47.080]  to try to frame President Trump to get him on board with it
[53:47.080 --> 53:49.080]  in 2017 he said no
[53:49.080 --> 53:51.080]  one reason they flipped out at Flynn
[53:53.080 --> 53:55.080]  and a bunch of other key points
[53:55.080 --> 53:57.080]  that I want to make on that subject
[53:57.080 --> 53:59.080]  but separately I'm gonna tell you this right now
[54:01.080 --> 54:03.080]  they are financially trying
[54:03.080 --> 54:05.080]  to shut down our capability
[54:05.080 --> 54:07.080]  and receive money from you
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.080]  and that's why I'm all in
[54:09.080 --> 54:11.080]  I sold my house and I'm doing all sorts of other stuff
[54:11.080 --> 54:13.080]  to get all the capital I've got
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.080]  for the big fight going into the future
[54:15.080 --> 54:17.080]  in this year with 300 days today
[54:17.080 --> 54:19.080]  out from the midterms we're 300 days out now
[54:21.080 --> 54:23.080]  they're gonna pull the terror attacks
[54:23.080 --> 54:25.080]  they're gonna pull the cyber attacks
[54:25.080 --> 54:27.080]  they're gonna pull pipeline shutdowns
[54:27.080 --> 54:29.080]  you name it to try to mess up that election
[54:29.080 --> 54:31.080]  they're gonna have more viral releases and say we gotta have mail-in ballots again
[54:31.080 --> 54:33.080]  they're already doing it
[54:33.080 --> 54:35.080]  it's very easy to know what they're gonna do
[54:35.080 --> 54:37.080]  because they're pre-programming it in the news
[54:37.080 --> 54:39.080]  this is the most important part of our lives
[54:39.080 --> 54:41.080]  your life, my life
[54:41.080 --> 54:43.080]  this is the most important part of the fight
[54:43.080 --> 54:45.080]  this is when we've everything else has been skirmishes
[54:45.080 --> 54:47.080]  up to this point
[54:47.080 --> 54:49.080]  this is the big main geopolitical battle
[54:49.080 --> 54:51.080]  and so
[54:51.080 --> 54:53.080]  I am spending a half my time
[54:53.080 --> 54:55.080]  just getting funding with the satellite uplinks
[54:55.080 --> 54:57.080]  the bandwidth, the crew, the run the operations
[54:57.080 --> 54:59.080]  to pay for all the stuff to keep us on air
[54:59.080 --> 55:01.080]  I don't need to spend half my time doing that
[55:01.080 --> 55:03.080]  I need the money there
[55:03.080 --> 55:05.080]  I mean I could sell a couple cars
[55:05.080 --> 55:07.080]  I could sell whatever I've got and I've got that in line
[55:07.080 --> 55:09.080]  but that takes time and energy
[55:09.080 --> 55:11.080]  you need to get products now
[55:11.080 --> 55:13.080]  storeable foods, water filtration, air filtration
[55:13.080 --> 55:15.080]  high quality supplements
[55:15.080 --> 55:17.080]  the booster immune system
[55:17.080 --> 55:19.080]  historic t-shirts
[55:19.080 --> 55:21.080]  films, books to wake yourself up
[55:21.080 --> 55:23.080]  and help wake up others
[55:23.080 --> 55:25.080]  whatever you do I want to thank you all for your support
[55:25.080 --> 55:27.080]  but I want to encourage everybody that's been on the fence
[55:27.080 --> 55:29.080]  or bought this or bought that
[55:29.080 --> 55:31.080]  I need everybody to go to m4store.com
[55:31.080 --> 55:33.080]  right now
[55:33.080 --> 55:35.080]  and we need to raise millions of dollars
[55:35.080 --> 55:37.080]  because I'm several million dollars
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.080]  in the negative that's what the news puts out
[55:39.080 --> 55:41.080]  fake news that I've got hundreds of millions of dollars
[55:41.080 --> 55:43.080]  total crap, total lies, total BS
[55:43.080 --> 55:45.080]  okay
[55:45.080 --> 55:47.080]  just to simplify it
[55:47.080 --> 55:49.080]  and I've told you
[55:49.080 --> 55:51.080]  how much money I have and it's not much
[55:51.080 --> 55:53.080]  and it's just enough to have in my account and run things
[55:53.080 --> 55:55.080]  I don't give a rat's ass about money
[55:55.080 --> 55:57.080]  or status or any of this crap
[55:57.080 --> 55:59.080]  I'm treating these psychotic, neural water people that are after us
[55:59.080 --> 56:01.080]  and this is real and this is historic
[56:01.080 --> 56:03.080]  and we told you everything first
[56:03.080 --> 56:05.080]  it's why they hate us and want to destroy us
[56:05.080 --> 56:07.080]  and I'm not a victim, I'm victorious
[56:07.080 --> 56:09.080]  I've already had an incredible life
[56:09.080 --> 56:11.080]  I've already taken on tyrants, I've already had great victories
[56:11.080 --> 56:13.080]  thanks to you and all of us together
[56:13.080 --> 56:15.080]  and I thank God for the opportunity to be where I've always wanted to be here
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.080]  fighting these tyrants, you understand that
[56:17.080 --> 56:19.080]  but now
[56:19.080 --> 56:21.080]  this is the big fight
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.080]  and I don't want to go in there
[56:23.080 --> 56:25.080]  politically and financially
[56:25.080 --> 56:27.080]  I don't want to be crushed and dehydrated
[56:27.080 --> 56:29.080]  and cross-eyed in this most important battle
[56:29.080 --> 56:31.080]  I need to go in there
[56:31.080 --> 56:33.080]  ready and fired up
[56:33.080 --> 56:35.080]  I'm using the analogy of a business and operation
[56:35.080 --> 56:37.080]  hydrated and strong
[56:37.080 --> 56:39.080]  and with a good night's rest
[56:39.080 --> 56:41.080]  because I love this time
[56:41.080 --> 56:43.080]  I'm ready for this time
[56:43.080 --> 56:45.080]  I hate what's happening but I love the fact that
[56:45.080 --> 56:47.080]  we've got a chance to fight back against these people
[56:47.080 --> 56:49.080]  but this is it

[57:03.080 --> 57:05.080]  because this is it
[57:05.080 --> 57:07.080]  this is their main assault
[57:07.080 --> 57:09.080]  this is the new world order takeover
[57:09.080 --> 57:11.080]  this is the take down of our economy to break your will
[57:11.080 --> 57:13.080]  and we've got a good chance of stopping these folks
[57:13.080 --> 57:15.080]  and we've got a lot of tricks up our sleeves
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.080]  and a lot of back up infrastructure
[57:17.080 --> 57:19.080]  not just for us but other people
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.080]  if this goes to the next level
[57:21.080 --> 57:23.080]  of this thing in information warfare
[57:23.080 --> 57:25.080]  what we're going to do, believe me
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.080]  there's a lot of stuff we've done that we never got credit for
[57:27.080 --> 57:29.080]  for a reason that a lot of tricks up our sleeves
[57:29.080 --> 57:31.080]  but I need money

[1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:13.080]  you got me running out of my mind
[1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:17.080]  you got me thinking that I'm wasting my time
[1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:19.080]  you know Harrison Smith put a tweet out last week
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:21.080]  that really said it all
[1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:23.080]  he said think about playing a board game like risk
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:25.080]  and he listed a few other board games
[1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:27.080]  that are about global domination
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:29.080]  and imagine conservatives are like pieces
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:31.080]  at the start of the game spread out everywhere
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:33.080]  and there's not one
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:35.080]  consolidated place where we've got a mass
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:37.080]  to then be able to have a base
[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:39.080]  to launch an attack and take over the
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:41.080]  but the globalists have taken over the cities
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:43.080]  they've taken over the banks, they've taken over the academia
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:45.080]  all of it, they have their bases
[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:47.080]  even though they're selling political death
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:49.080]  even though they're selling
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.080]  sand in the Sahara desert
[1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:53.080]  they're going to force you to take it
[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:57.080]  because people don't even know they're in a fight
[1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:59.080]  they don't even know that they're in a war
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:01.080]  and so what did Harrison Smith say
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:03.080]  he said we've got to have a base
[1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:05.080]  you've got to have a place that you're mass
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:07.080]  and that's why they target every base we've got
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:09.080]  they infiltrated
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:11.080]  and took over the NRA and destroyed it basically
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:13.080]  and I haven't talked about the inside baseball
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:15.080]  because it's so sad, it's still straggling along
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.080]  barely alive
[1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:19.080]  but that's a whole other show
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:21.080]  they tried the same stuff with us
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:23.080]  intelligence, agency, tactics, you name it
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:25.080]  and we survived by the grace of God
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:27.080]  and loyal people
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:29.080]  but it's been hell, it's been rough
[1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:31.080]  I mean
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:33.080]  anyways
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.080]  let's just say, when all this stuff comes out
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:37.080]  if we ever survive this, it's going to be unbelievable
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:41.080]  so we need a base of operations ladies and gentlemen
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:43.080]  I had his tweet here but
[1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:45.080]  he makes a really good point
[1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:47.080]  but
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:49.080]  here's another meme I saw that I think is
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:51.080]  really, really important
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:53.080]  first we overlook evil
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:55.080]  then we permit evil
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:01:59.080]  then we legitimize evil
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:01.080]  then we promote evil
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:03.080]  then we celebrate evil
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:05.080]  then we persecute
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.080]  those who still call it
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:09.080]  evil
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.080]  and that's Isaiah 5.20 says
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:13.080]  whoa, or look out
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:15.080]  unto them who call evil good
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:17.080]  and good evil
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:19.080]  and if that is at the left
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:21.080]  I don't know what else
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:27.080]  so
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:29.080]  this is a very, very
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:31.080]  important time
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:33.080]  to say the least
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:35.080]  and
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:39.080]  I remember
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:43.080]  I remember
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:45.080]  listening to Dr. Yiddan and Dr.
[1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:47.080]  Wolfgang Wudard
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:49.080]  18 months ago
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:51.080]  they were already saying we've looked at what's in this vaccine
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:53.080]  it's not a vaccine
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:55.080]  it's going to cause blood clots, heart attacks
[1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:57.080]  infertility, everything that happened
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:02:59.080]  because they're scientists that do this
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:01.080]  for a living they know
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:03.080]  and then sure enough, the CDC documents said the exact same thing
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:05.080]  they knew it and did it
[1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:07.080]  so I was freaked out then
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:09.080]  but if you go back 22 months ago
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:11.080]  I was like yeah, they're going to try to force inoculations
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:13.080]  and use that as the reason to clamp down
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.080]  and create a global ID because
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.080]  in their own documents they were admitting all that
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:19.080]  but one area
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:21.080]  I was wrong about was that
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:23.080]  they would roll out an immediate shot
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:25.080]  that would cause massive illnesses
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:27.080]  right away in death
[1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:29.080]  but they did
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:31.080]  and I started to figure that out
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:33.080]  when it started over a year ago in the UK
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:35.080]  I went oh, that way everybody that gives their kids
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:37.080]  the shots, themselves the shots
[1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:39.080]  they learn when they get traumatized, they stock home out
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:41.080]  I call it stock coming out
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:43.080]  I'm not a psychologist, I just notice these things in life
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:45.080]  and give them names
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:47.080]  but they stock home out, stock home syndrome
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.080]  they say oh, I'll take five more
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:51.080]  since I'm feeling sick, God I feel really bad
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:53.080]  after I took that, I'm dying
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:55.080]  but there's more
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:57.080]  so Harrison Smith says it all
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  on his tweet, I'll put it up on screen again
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.080]  that
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:03.080]  just picture the USA like a map and risk
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:05.080]  or total war
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:07.080]  first thing you see is the conservatives
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.080]  while still powerful
[1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:11.080]  and numerous are spread way too thin
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:13.080]  to be effective
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:15.080]  the first move would be to consolidate forces
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:17.080]  expansion
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:19.080]  only comes after you have secured a base
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:21.080]  and that's what communists do
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.080]  they take a country over
[1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:25.080]  and suck it dry and they call it exploitation
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:27.080]  they use it to invade the next country
[1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:29.080]  always
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:31.080]  more and more and more, that's why
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:33.080]  democrats get a city, suck it dry, collapse it
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:35.080]  use it to take the next city
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:37.080]  and even send out their vagabonds
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:39.080]  their leftists are like zombies
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:41.080]  but they leave when the left tells them
[1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:43.080]  Austin is now trendy
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:45.080]  and they all run to Austin like zombies and destroy it
[1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:47.080]  doing the same thing they did that destroyed California
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:49.080]  but that's how they work
[1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:51.080]  they're very scientific
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:53.080]  this is war
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:55.080]  but being aware of it gives you the upper hand
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:01.080]  everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:03.080]  has only been the build up
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:05.080]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:07.080]  this is their big offensive
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:09.080]  this is their takeover
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:11.080]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:13.080]  because now they've revealed themselves
[1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:15.080]  now their world government, their permanent martial law
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:17.080]  their medical tyranny is out in the open
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.080]  their depopulation agenda
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:21.080]  has been exposed
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:23.080]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:25.080]  to go across the planet
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:27.080]  and shut down people telling the truth
[1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:29.080]  so listen Paul Revere's
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:31.080]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:33.080]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear
[1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:35.080]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com

[1:05:55.080 --> 1:06:17.080]  is if you don't take action
[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:27.080]  it's because you care
[1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:29.080]  it's because you're not going to adapt to the tyranny
[1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:31.080]  by submitting to it
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:33.080]  you're going to adapt to the tyranny by overcoming it
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.080]  and defeating it
[1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:37.080]  and you're going to take on the pain of the children
[1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.080]  you're going to take on the pain of the innocents
[1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:41.080]  and you're going to take on all the responsibility
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.080]  that it takes to do whatever you've got to do
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:45.080]  to crush these people
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:49.080]  because those aren't tears of sorrow
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:51.080]  those are tears of burning commitment
[1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:53.080]  and you're intellect
[1:06:53.080 --> 1:06:55.080]  and you're mind firing up
[1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.080]  like big blast furnaces
[1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:59.080]  to forge the intellectual and political
[1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:01.080]  and economic and spiritual
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:03.080]  weapons
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:05.080]  to defeat the new world order
[1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:07.080]  I don't know about you
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:09.080]  but my furnaces are white hot
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:11.080]  and they are busy
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:13.080]  and they are working around the clock
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:15.080]  and my wheels are spinning
[1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:17.080]  I always found in my life
[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:19.080]  when I start stumbling
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:21.080]  and getting upset
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.080]  and that bad is actually because
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:25.080]  my whole mind is working
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:27.080]  sometimes now I'm focused sitting in a room in the dark
[1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:29.080]  thinking about the new world order how to beat them
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:31.080]  and I'll just get totally dizzy
[1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:33.080]  and almost pass out and get nauseous
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:35.080]  and it's because I am just totally facing everything
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:37.080]  and people go, oh Jones you look old
[1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:39.080]  you look worn out
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:41.080]  absolutely I am wearing myself out fighting this
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:43.080]  I intend to wear myself all the way out
[1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:45.080]  I'm not trying to put potions on my face
[1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:47.080]  and have pretty hair and candy ass around
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.080]  and live longer
[1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.080]  in this system
[1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:53.080]  that's not who I am
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:55.080]  I'm 110% going up against these people
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:57.080]  and I'm taking it all on
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:07:59.080]  I'm not trying to not have responsibility
[1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:01.080]  I'm not trying to not care
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:03.080]  I'm not trying to be you little sociopathic Hollywood people
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:05.080]  I want it all
[1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:09.080]  and that doesn't mean I want the jets
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:11.080]  and the fancy cars
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:13.080]  and the castle on the hill
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.080]  because all that without liberty is empty
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.080]  I mean I want to experience it
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:19.080]  I want to actually be the one on the other side of evil
[1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:21.080]  that says I'm not with you
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:23.080]  and I'm going to give you a real run for your money
[1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:25.080]  you understand that
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:29.080]  I look at that
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:31.080]  CEO
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:33.080]  of Pfizer and I hate him more than Bill Gates
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:35.080]  cool he is an arrogant murdering criminal
[1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:39.080]  and I look at him on TV going oh yeah
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.080]  there's almost no help in the shots
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:43.080]  if any unless you take more
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:45.080]  and then he brags
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:47.080]  how he just took over 15
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:49.080]  plus more biotech companies
[1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:51.080]  now he's going to fix your DNA
[1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:53.080]  and we're all broken but this guy's going to fix us
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:57.080]  I mean imagine if your wife told you
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:08:59.080]  your husband you know you're broken
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:01.080]  I'm going to fix you
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:03.080]  only I can you'd be like you've gone crazy
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:05.080]  but it's some creepy
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:07.080]  most corrupt
[1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:09.080]  pharmaceutical company in world history
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:11.080]  pays the biggest fines
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:13.080]  and your government signed secret agreements
[1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:15.080]  that's cooked this crap up at the Wuhan lab
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:17.080]  and tried to set the Pentagon up
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:19.080]  by having his agents
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:21.080]  go to Trump
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:23.080]  and others and get them to sign on to open air
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:25.080]  releasing COVID-19
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:27.080]  and then when Trump didn't sign on
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:29.080]  they went ahead and did it themselves
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:31.080]  but oh Trump would still be in office
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:33.080]  if they could have gotten him to sign on
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:35.080]  because then they could blackmail the hell out of him
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:39.080]  see that's why they don't like this show
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:41.080]  we don't just tell you
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.080]  a year before anybody else exactly what's happening
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:45.080]  and it turns out exactly as we told you
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:47.080]  and all the Pentagon documents and the congressional documents
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:49.080]  and all of it
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:51.080]  we are telling you how the rest of it works
[1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:53.080]  and that's what they don't want you to get a grasp on
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.080]  they want you to join
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:09:59.080]  in on their corruption
[1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:01.080]  this was a giant
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:03.080]  14 year
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:05.080]  plus
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:07.080]  Manhattan project level
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:09.080]  corporation
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:11.080]  run by Obama he's as high up as we go
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:13.080]  in Bill Gates
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:15.080]  who all hang out at Jeffrey Epstein's house
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:17.080]  on his island
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:19.080]  cooking this up and then shopping it around
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:21.080]  to get the U.S. government to sign on to it
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:23.080]  because the globalists are what
[1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:25.080]  they're China files
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:27.080]  they want China to take over
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:29.080]  so they were going to cook it up over in China
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:31.080]  get Trump to sign on to open air releasing it
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:33.080]  claiming it's a bat study
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:35.080]  blame Trump for its release
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:37.080]  they didn't do what to this country
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:39.080]  but it didn't go exactly the way they wanted
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:41.080]  and now the Pentagon and DARPA and Congress
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:43.080]  have released all the documents
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.080]  and that's good because that's what I told
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:47.080]  Rand Paul and Senator Cruz
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:49.080]  and Josh Hawley and Cotton
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:51.080]  and all the rest of them
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:53.080]  I said if you do not release all this
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.080]  and you've heard me say it
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:57.080]  it's not about us bragging that we're powerful
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  it's dangerous to have this power
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.080]  so they want to shut us down
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:03.080]  you notice Tucker Carlson went after him
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:05.080]  on January 6th with Cruz
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:07.080]  saying that's an FBI operation which it is
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:09.080]  see those of us that are moral
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:11.080]  have to understand that we're doing this
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:13.080]  just the right thing to do
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:15.080]  we've got to let the other people that sit on the fence
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.080]  like Ted Cruz and others
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:19.080]  and Rand Paul for that matter
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:21.080]  no hey you went along with the poison
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:23.080]  shot buddy it's coming out it's poison
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:25.080]  you better get on the right side now
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:27.080]  and stop all this and we'll forgive you
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:29.080]  but you've already starting to cross the line
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:31.080]  that if you don't get out and expose this now
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:33.080]  and help bring these people down and stop the killing
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:35.080]  then you're going to be held responsible
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:37.080]  and it's not because we want to hold you responsible
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:39.080]  it's not because we want to be over
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.080]  Senator Paul or we want to be over Ted Cruz
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:43.080]  we just want you to protect the people
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:45.080]  and not be jerks
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:47.080]  and not have Ted Cruz
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:49.080]  it looks like selling out a Texas
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:51.080]  U.S. refinery to Pemex
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:53.080]  down in Houston
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:55.080]  can't you guys just stop it
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:57.080]  I mean look I was sent a photo yesterday
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:59.080]  I forgot to send you guys
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:01.080]  a photo
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:03.080]  of
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.080]  Big Mike
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:07.080]  Big Daddy
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:09.080]  with Rand Paul's wife out of the party
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:11.080]  and I mean
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:13.080]  it looks like
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.080]  Michael Jordan is standing next to his wife
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:17.080]  I mean it looks like
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:19.080]  she's like an eight foot tall linebacker or something
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:21.080]  and I mean obviously
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:23.080]  this is part of their little sick joke
[1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:25.080]  we have a four star admiral that
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:27.080]  runs health and human services and it's a man
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:29.080]  yeah it is a man folks
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:31.080]  we've known it we've seen it
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:33.080]  the scientists have seen it
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:35.080]  look at the shoulders, look at the body
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:37.080]  she walks around with her
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:39.080]  flaccid, unerrect genitals
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:41.080]  are like six inches long
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:43.080]  I mean it's just a joke
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.080]  it's all a joke on us
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:47.080]  because these are transhumanist folks
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:49.080]  and this is just the beginning of making us
[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:51.080]  accept what they do
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:53.080]  and what they say and how they operate
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  the whole trans thing was a
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:57.080]  CIA
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:12:59.080]  operation
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:01.080]  and
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:05.080]  DARPA is heavily involved
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:07.080]  and Obama was raised by the CIA
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.080]  and his nanny
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:11.080]  was a quote transgender
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:13.080]  so
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:15.080]  that's what all this is ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:17.080]  it's all just a big joke on us
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:19.080]  and I don't hate some man
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:21.080]  because he wants to have long hair
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:23.080]  and all this but
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:25.080]  I don't even have photos of
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.080]  of him
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:29.080]  when they were boyfriends
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:31.080]  there in Chicago
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:33.080]  and I mean it's big Mike
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:35.080]  and again imagine the power the globalists have
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.080]  over people that
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.080]  you got a first lady with these adopted kids
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:41.080]  that isn't even a woman
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:43.080]  didn't even have the genitals removed
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:45.080]  and they go Caitlyn Jenner
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:47.080]  is the greatest woman in America
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.080]  in Time Magazine stealing that from real women
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:51.080]  this is the murder of reality
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:53.080]  truth and this is the fraud
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:55.080]  let me just show you the photo
[1:13:55.080 --> 1:13:57.080]  this photo is absolutely insane
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:13:59.080]  this is a real photo when I saw this last night
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:01.080]  I couldn't believe it
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:03.080]  and I went and looked it up and it's
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:05.080]  absolutely true overhead shot
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:07.080]  please guys
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:09.080]  there you go
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.080]  Alex Jones caught looking at Tranny's again on his phone
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:13.080]  there's one right there
[1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:15.080]  with
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:17.080]  Rand Paul's
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:19.080]  wife
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:21.080]  right there and another senator's wife
[1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  and again this is how they all get together
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.080]  and it's all friendly and there she is with big Mike
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:27.080]  and the point is they represent the political group
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:29.080]  that came and broke his ribs at his house
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:31.080]  and tried to kill them in the streets
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:33.080]  and tried to shoot them at the baseball game
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:37.080]  and here we are with big Mike
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.080]  Lord of the King Cobra's got a King Cobra in the pants
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:43.080]  and it's just all
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:45.080]  a sick
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:47.080]  joke
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:49.080]  all a sick joke
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:51.080]  in our face ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:55.080]  infowars.com
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:57.080]  tomorrow's news today
[1:14:59.080 --> 1:15:01.080]  it's all a fraud it's all about teaching
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:03.080]  you a fraud it's all about making you
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:05.080]  submit to a fraud
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:07.080]  I mean Obama
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:09.080]  is married to a six foot
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:11.080]  three woman
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:15.080]  that's got shoulders as big as an NFL
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:17.080]  linebacker
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.080]  and goes to the beach with a giant
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:21.080]  penis in their pants
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:27.080]  and the reason I'm covering all this
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:29.080]  is it's just an example of how it's all
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:31.080]  like let's go out to break with the head of
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:33.080]  Pfizer saying the vaccine may not
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:35.080]  even work at all but don't worry he's got more shots
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:37.080]  for you than a racer immune system
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:39.080]  here it is
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:41.080]  very exciting
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:43.080]  as you can now see
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:45.080]  here's the video of the CEO
[1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:47.080]  another area that we announced today
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:49.080]  a partnership
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:51.080]  would be are there are diseases
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:53.080]  these are diseases
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:55.080]  mainly that
[1:15:55.080 --> 1:15:57.080]  they have as a cause
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:15:59.080]  Christmas 2021

[1:20:33.080 --> 1:20:35.080]  well Tommy Robinson
[1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.080]  has really fought
[1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:43.080]  the tyrants and the globalist takeover
[1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:45.080]  unlike anybody else
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:47.080]  in the UK and then all over Europe now
[1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:49.080]  and he's been put in prison
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:51.080]  multiple times for exposing
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:53.080]  giant child
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:55.080]  kidnapping sex rings
[1:20:55.080 --> 1:20:57.080]  that were confirmed per town
[1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:59.080]  to include thousands
[1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:01.080]  of men and in some cases
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:03.080]  of girls being gang raped
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:05.080]  as young as 6, 7 years old
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:07.080]  and then being murdered and butchered
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:09.080]  and sold in kebab shops
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:11.080]  to get rid of their bodies
[1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:13.080]  he first talked about that over a decade ago
[1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:15.080]  it now came out in the news
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:17.080]  in the UK
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:19.080]  they always call it Asian men
[1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:21.080]  but it's Pakistani men
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:23.080]  but there's also Anglo men
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:25.080]  white men that are some of the managers
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:27.080]  it turns out you know about the royalty
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:29.080]  and the pedophilia that are having the Muslims
[1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:31.080]  manage these harems
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:33.080]  of sex slaves
[1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:35.080]  there's Tommy a few years ago
[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:37.080]  when he'd been in solitary confinement
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.080]  in a basically majority Muslim prison
[1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.080]  they put him in trying to kill him
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.080]  so he's been through hell
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:45.080]  he recently got firebomb that was confirmed
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:47.080]  the media tried to erase history
[1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:49.080]  he's got a new film coming out
[1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:51.080]  will play you the trailer
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:53.080]  that deals with the rape of England
[1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:55.080]  that's why it's called the rape of England
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:57.080]  that's coming up next segment
[1:21:57.080 --> 1:21:59.080]  it gets you on
[1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:01.080]  I know you've had to travel around for your own safety
[1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:03.080]  they tried to acid attack your family
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:05.080]  we showed footage of them
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:07.080]  and if they come to your house and they're going to kill you
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:09.080]  now you've been firebomb
[1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:11.080]  we'll show some of those images in a moment
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.080]  I mean they are really scared of you
[1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:15.080]  and now the good news is
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:17.080]  everything you exposed 13-14 years ago
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:19.080]  for folks that don't know you got a tanning salon
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:21.080]  next door to a kebab sex shop
[1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:23.080]  they were running
[1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:25.080]  and you have now been totally vindicated
[1:22:25.080 --> 1:22:27.080]  by the police
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:29.080]  it's good to be on Alec
[1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:31.080]  it's good to speak to you again man
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:33.080]  where to start
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:35.080]  because you've been off the radar quite a bit
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:37.080]  and then I hear about your house getting attacked
[1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:39.080]  firebombings I mean they are really after you
[1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:41.080]  so
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:43.080]  just watching that video there of me with Tucker Coleson
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:45.080]  reminded me as well because I watched that video recently
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:47.080]  I come out of solitary confinement
[1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:49.080]  I've done two stints of solitary confinement
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:51.080]  in the space of 12 months
[1:22:51.080 --> 1:22:53.080]  I spent months and months on end
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:55.080]  so it took me quite a while to get back to myself
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:57.080]  and the purpose
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:22:59.080]  of putting me in solitary confinement
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:01.080]  the purpose of that imprisonment
[1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:03.080]  was to stop the public being aware
[1:23:03.080 --> 1:23:05.080]  of the level of the rate G had
[1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:07.080]  that's happening in our country
[1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:09.080]  now I don't like to let them win
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:11.080]  and every one of their tactics
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:13.080]  was to break me and stop me
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:15.080]  so I wanted to come back with something that was a punch back
[1:23:15.080 --> 1:23:17.080]  so I spent time
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:19.080]  making a film I spent 12 months
[1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:21.080]  sitting down with the girls
[1:23:21.080 --> 1:23:23.080]  taking they were kidnapped
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:25.080]  I've got multiple victims
[1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:27.080]  I've sat them down and I've listened to their story
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:29.080]  for 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:31.080]  sometimes twice, sometimes 3 times
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:33.080]  I've built a database
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.080]  of the men who raped them
[1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:37.080]  I have 200 names in this one town alone
[1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:39.080]  and then I've cooperated the stories
[1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:41.080]  with it from one victim
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:43.080]  that doesn't know another victim
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:45.080]  and once we've got 3 victims
[1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:47.080]  we then go after the perpetrator
[1:23:47.080 --> 1:23:49.080]  but in this story and in this investigation
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:51.080]  that's took us 12 months
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:53.080]  we have allegations of corruption against the police
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:55.080]  we understand from every victim
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:57.080]  we speak to that there is a level
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:23:59.080]  of police working with the gang
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:01.080]  that is why
[1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:03.080]  in the town I've looked into of Telford
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:05.080]  we have the police
[1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:07.080]  investigation identified
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:09.080]  200 men they only prosecuted
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:11.080]  11 so whereas the rest
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:13.080]  of the world is looking on thinking that
[1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.080]  Britain has started to deal with this rate
[1:24:15.080 --> 1:24:17.080]  G had against our daughters
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:19.080]  what they've done is they've took a town
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:21.080]  and in each town they've given a handful
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:23.080]  of convictions, a handful
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:25.080]  when we have hundreds of men
[1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:27.080]  my investigation on the shoestring
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:29.080]  has clearly identified
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:31.080]  hundreds of men
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:33.080]  and we've got the victims
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:35.080]  and at the end of each story
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:37.080]  so I've put this into a 5 part series
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:39.080]  because I want to let each girl
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:41.080]  tell their story
[1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:43.080]  they deserve that, they've been failed by society
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  failed by the police
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:47.080]  failed by every single agency
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:49.080]  that was put there to protect them
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:51.080]  and I want to give that girl a voice in the platform
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.080]  and I want to let the British public make their mind up
[1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:55.080]  so I go and find the men
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:57.080]  the men who are alleged to have raped them
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:24:59.080]  and I give them their right to reply
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:01.080]  I go and find the police officers
[1:25:01.080 --> 1:25:03.080]  and I give them their right to reply
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:05.080]  the police officers where there's allegations
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:07.080]  of corruption, we have witnesses
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:09.080]  and multiple witnesses who witness some
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:11.080]  of this corruption so
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:13.080]  that's what the film is, this is the first
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:15.080]  series called The Rape of Britain
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:17.080]  and since we released it
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:19.080]  nearly two weeks ago, there's been seven
[1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:21.080]  fire bombings, one of them was my
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:23.080]  vehicle, the gang
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:25.080]  started targeting our victims
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:27.080]  and their families, we've had to relocate
[1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:29.080]  the families, the police
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:31.080]  and there's recordings of all of this
[1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:33.080]  Ok, so let's just slow down because a lot's going on
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:35.080]  and you've got a banned out video channel that I pay attention to
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:37.080]  but I was thinking
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:39.080]  that a part two of The Rape of England
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:41.080]  is coming out soon and then another
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:43.080]  film, you're saying part one is already out
[1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:45.080]  No, part one, that's the promo
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:47.080]  that we're about to watch now, part one
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:49.080]  is an hour long movie
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:51.080]  about a victim, a
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:53.080]  courageous young girl called Nicole
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:55.080]  then we'll have part two, then we'll have
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:25:57.080]  part three, then we'll have part four
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:25:59.080]  and it's all looking at one town
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:01.080]  of Telford and it's examining
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:03.080]  what the police have done
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:05.080]  what they haven't done, who's got dirty
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:07.080]  hands, who the allegations
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:09.080]  are against from the Pakistani Muslim community
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:11.080]  but not just them
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:13.080]  who has dirty hands in the police force
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:15.080]  because there's so many people right now
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:17.080]  sitting in our country who are enjoying their
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:19.080]  pensions, who are sitting there
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:21.080]  with their pensions taking their golden
[1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:23.080]  handshakes after knowing
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:25.080]  that our daughters were being kidnapped
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:27.080]  knowing they were being tortured and actually
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.080]  accommodating and facilitating
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:31.080]  so our film is about
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:33.080]  making sure and what I want
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:35.080]  what I know is when this film goes out
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:37.080]  there's going to be a lot of
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:39.080]  worried Pakistani rapists
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:41.080]  in Telford because they don't know
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:43.080]  who's going to star in number two
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:45.080]  they don't know who's going to star in number three
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:47.080]  and that goes for the police force as well
[1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:49.080]  that's right, let me say this right now
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.080]  I saw you on Steve Bannon as well
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:53.080]  and I'm glad you reached out to us a few weeks ago
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.080]  we should have got you on even earlier but here you are now
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:57.080]  let's put your Band-Aid video channel up
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:26:59.080]  we'll do places you can find, Tommy Robinson's
[1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:01.080]  groundbreaking, incredible courage work
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:03.080]  and if you scroll down you'll see the big Steve Bannon
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:05.080]  interview right there and you'll see part one
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:07.080]  right next to it
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:09.080]  dealing with all the stuff that's going on
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:11.080]  so you want to see all the censored
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:13.080]  blocked information that will literally save lives
[1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:15.080]  you need to go
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:17.080]  to Band.video
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:19.080]  which they've banned Band.video
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:21.080]  on Twitter, Facebook, you name it
[1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:23.080]  so then we had FreeWorldNews.tv is the same link
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:25.080]  to the same site
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:27.080]  they've now banned FreeWorldNews.tv
[1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:29.080]  so the new URL ladies and gentlemen
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:31.080]  is
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:33.080]  a key
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:35.080]  information that I want to direct everybody's attention to
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:37.080]  that we're going to make a graphic for
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:39.080]  because I've been hard
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:41.080]  begging for a week to get this graphic
[1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:43.080]  made and so when we come back
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:45.080]  we're going to show you
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:47.080]  the URL on air to the new
[1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:49.080]  site that isn't blocked by Twitter, that isn't blocked by
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:51.080]  Facebook, that isn't blocked by all these sites
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:53.080]  so you can go to Tommy Robinson's Band.video
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:55.080]  site because you can type that in yourself
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:57.080]  still go there but
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:59.080]  they're banning sharing the links from Band.video
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:01.080]  so you've got to do it
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:03.080]  from this new URL
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:05.080]  that I'm going to build the suspense
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:07.080]  and play for you
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:09.080]  and put a graphic up next segment
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:11.080]  but first
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:13.080]  Tommy, where do people find you other than Band.video
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:15.080]  you're one of the most censored people in the world
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:17.080]  I'm on Ghetto
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:19.080]  and I've started using Ghetto
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:21.080]  really the last four to five weeks
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.080]  and it's exploded on there
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:25.080]  and I'm grateful to have a platform
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:27.080]  where I can use my voice
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:29.080]  I'm on Ghetto as Tommy Robinson one
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:31.080]  on Ghetto Gram as Tommy Robinson news
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  I'm excited about these films
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:37.080]  but the sad situation
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:39.080]  is as a journalist in Britain
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:41.080]  I know these gangs
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:43.080]  are going to target me as they did
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:45.080]  they fired on my car outside the hotel
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:47.080]  that we were staying in
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:49.080]  they have attacked people with baseball bats
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:51.080]  all in the last week
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:53.080]  they've smashed houses up
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:55.080]  Tommy, stay right there
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:57.080]  we'll be right back and we'll give folks the new URL
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.080]  everything we've witnessed
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:01.080]  in the last few decades has only been
[1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:03.080]  the build up
[1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:05.080]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:07.080]  this is their big offensive
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:09.080]  this is their takeover
[1:29:09.080 --> 1:29:11.080]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:13.080]  because now they've revealed themselves
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:15.080]  now they're a world government
[1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:17.080]  their permanent martial law
[1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:19.080]  their medical tyranny is out in the open
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:21.080]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.080]  but they're using their corporate power
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:25.080]  and trillions to go across the planet
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:27.080]  to tell the truth
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:29.080]  so listen Paul Revere's
[1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:31.080]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:33.080]  when you pray for the broadcast
[1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:35.080]  you're the tip of the spear
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:37.080]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com

[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:11.080]  until now and we have reformulated
[1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:13.080]  and not just used the same ingredients
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:15.080]  we've boosted it and made them even stronger

[1:32:59.080 --> 1:33:01.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:03.080]  of the New World Order
[1:33:03.080 --> 1:33:27.080]  It's Alex Jones
[1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:29.080]  Alright folks, I have a ton of breaking news
[1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:31.080]  and incredible information coming out in Congress
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:33.080]  about January 6th being an FBI operation
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:35.080]  Congress releasing documents
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:37.080]  confirming Project Veritas documents
[1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:39.080]  that Fauci created COVID-19
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:41.080]  and released it with Bill Gates
[1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:43.080]  and Peter Dazik on The World
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:45.080]  I mean I should just repeat that for 4 hours here
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:47.080]  but I'm not going to
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:49.080]  this is bigger than us being vindicated
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:51.080]  who cares about that
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:53.080]  this tells us that they really did this
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:55.080]  and
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:57.080]  it's unspeakably evil
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:33:59.080]  going back to the one, the only
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:01.080]  Tommy Robinson
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:03.080]  Tommy Robinson on news, on telegram
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:05.080]  he's got multi-part series
[1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:07.080]  coming out
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:09.080]  The Rape of Britain
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:11.080]  one of the only places to find it is at
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:13.080]  man.video
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:15.080]  people say, well great, how do we share that
[1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:17.080]  well you can't share the URL
[1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:19.080]  man.video
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:21.080]  and then we had other URLs that went back to the same links
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:23.080]  and then they banned those
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:25.080]  the last one went almost a year
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:27.080]  freeworldnews.tv
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:29.080]  it's around 10 months, it's a huge URL
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:31.080]  it's everywhere and it still works typing it in
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:33.080]  and you can share it in some places
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:35.080]  but now on Instagram
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:37.080]  a bunch of other places it's banned
[1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:39.080]  so the new URL is
[1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:41.080]  futurenews.news
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.080]  futurenews.news
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:45.080]  very simple
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:47.080]  futurenews.news
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:49.080]  and we just got a really cool URL
[1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:51.080]  I'm not going to announce yet
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.080]  that everybody's going to love that we'll announce the next few days
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:55.080]  that'll be the new one but for now
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:57.080]  if you want to share his videos
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:34:59.080]  his articles at man.video
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:01.080]  you got to share it with the link from
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:03.080]  futurenews.news
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:05.080]  the same site, same links
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:07.080]  it just gives you another index that gets around the sensors
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:09.080]  and it's very very innovative and thank god we have it
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:11.080]  or we'd be shut down even more
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:13.080]  now I can say, okay I've been sued
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:15.080]  I've been lied about, I've been defaulted
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:17.080]  I've been demonized, I've been physically attacked
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:19.080]  Tommy's been in prison
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:21.080]  literally
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:23.080]  for quote, violating people's privacy
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:25.080]  and covering courts
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:27.080]  where they're giving people very short sentences
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:29.080]  for kidnapping and sex trafficking little girls
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:31.080]  he is the first main man
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:33.080]  going back 13, 14 years ago
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:35.080]  to expose it, so Tommy you never talk about yourself
[1:35:35.080 --> 1:35:37.080]  but you always are on the latest case, the latest thing you're doing
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:39.080]  you're like a bird dog and I love you
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:41.080]  you're just like me
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:43.080]  but spend a little time
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:45.080]  for a few minutes recapping how you woke up
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:47.080]  what you witnessed, what you've gone through
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:49.080]  and the now confirmed industrial level
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:51.080]  with the government
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:53.080]  using Muslims
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.080]  to farm and run kidnapped little girls
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:57.080]  and it's mainly racially motivated
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:35:59.080]  targeted at whites
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:01.080]  and then expanding on that
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:03.080]  how they put you in prison over and over again
[1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:05.080]  and torture you for exposing
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:07.080]  and now just fire bombed your car
[1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:09.080]  and it threatened to acid attack your family
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:11.080]  and they come to your door
[1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:13.080]  and threaten you on the video camera and nothing's done
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:15.080]  recap
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:17.080]  because what you've done is so incredible
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:19.080]  you single-handedly with your supporters supporting you
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:21.080]  but you're the tip of the spear
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:23.080]  blue wide open the sex trafficking
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:25.080]  by Muslims that they then scapegoat
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:27.080]  and call by Asians
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:29.080]  when Asians on average have one of the lowest crime rates out there
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:31.080]  it's not the Sikhs
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:33.080]  that are kidnapping and raping children
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:35.080]  it's not
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:37.080]  people from Japan that live in the UK
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:39.080]  that are doing it, is it? No, it's Muslims
[1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:41.080]  hiding behind a racial title
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:43.080]  of Asians, correct?
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:45.080]  Correct, but for me
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:47.080]  growing up in Luton I witnessed it
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:49.080]  so I saw firsthand
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:51.080]  it happened to a relative of mine
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:53.080]  she was groomed, she was hooked on heroin
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:55.080]  police did nothing
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:36:57.080]  she was 14 years old climbing out the window
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:36:59.080]  go back and get her drugs
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:01.080]  she was being raped, abused once
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:03.080]  found naked running through the town centre
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:05.080]  but taken in
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:07.080]  by the prostitutes on the streets
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:09.080]  but she was a victim of it
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:11.080]  and the police did nothing
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.080]  when I started my movement at the English Defence League
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:15.080]  I started talking about these issues
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:17.080]  and then I spread across the country
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:19.080]  and I travelled the UK
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.080]  and I met families, daughters
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:23.080]  brothers, mothers
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.080]  all these people affected by it
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:27.080]  so I have seen firsthand
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  the pain and the suffering
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:31.080]  and what I want people to know
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:33.080]  or I want the public to know
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:35.080]  for too long everyone's read about Rotherham
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:37.080]  Rotherham is a town in the north of England
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:39.080]  where 1,400 children were raped
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:41.080]  by these gangs
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:43.080]  the difference between reading it
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:45.080]  and then seeing the heartbreak
[1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:47.080]  and the pain in them
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:49.080]  or meeting a victim
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:51.080]  who's a victim from 15 years ago
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:53.080]  who is still suffering with mental health issues
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:55.080]  drug addiction and suicidal problems
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.080]  from the abuse she faced
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:59.080]  so when you meet them
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:01.080]  you feel something that you don't get
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:03.080]  by reading it
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:05.080]  I want to bring that feeling to you
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:07.080]  I want everyone to not read
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:09.080]  and I said it when I first went on Jeremy Paxman
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:11.080]  which was the biggest political debate show
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:13.080]  in the UK
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:15.080]  and they're talking about it
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:17.080]  and they're talking about these girls
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:19.080]  like their statistics
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:21.080]  but they're not statistics
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:23.080]  they're not numbers
[1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:25.080]  there are daughters
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:27.080]  there are sisters
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  whose daughters do you think they are
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:31.080]  do you think they're just picked up and taken
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:33.080]  they're relatives
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:35.080]  they're people's relatives
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:37.080]  people love those children
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:39.080]  and they feel it
[1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:41.080]  I was laughed at first
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:43.080]  I was sat on TV shows trying to talk about it
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:45.080]  I was belittled
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:47.080]  I was called a scaremonger
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:49.080]  talking about conspiracy theories
[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:51.080]  talking about all of this
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:53.080]  and years on as we've gone forward
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:55.080]  people can see we were telling the truth
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:57.080]  that each time we went onto the street
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:38:59.080]  we were screaming and screaming for help
[1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:01.080]  screaming for someone to listen
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:03.080]  and protect our kids
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:05.080]  and now all those years on
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:07.080]  I want to now make the public aware
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:09.080]  that they're not dealing with it
[1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:11.080]  the men that raped our children are still walking the streets
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:13.080]  they're still in our country
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:15.080]  they have done a token gesture
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:17.080]  by arresting a handful or a couple of handfuls
[1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:19.080]  probably in an agreement with the local imams
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:21.080]  and the local Muslim community
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:23.080]  that some people are going to have to take the flag
[1:39:23.080 --> 1:39:25.080]  and the only reason why they have to take the flag
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:27.080]  is because we screamed and we shouted
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:29.080]  and every single one of my supporters that follow me on the street
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:31.080]  to do that
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:33.080]  many of them losing their jobs
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:35.080]  many of them being imprisoned
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:37.080]  they played their part
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:39.080]  in raising awareness of this issue
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:41.080]  this is the most important issue
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:43.080]  that has faced our country
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:45.080]  in decades
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:47.080]  and Tommy, it's not just happening in the UK
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:49.080]  it's happening in Ireland, it's happening all over Europe
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:51.080]  and here in the US similar things are now happening
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:53.080]  and we also have the left in big tech promoting drag queen
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:55.080]  story time
[1:39:55.080 --> 1:39:57.080]  half the time literally they're convicted pedophiles
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:39:59.080]  being given access sometimes without parental consent
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:01.080]  in schools
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:03.080]  so this is a high tech leftist run thing
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:05.080]  why is the left supporting
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:07.080]  the sexualization and rape of children
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:09.080]  why do they love it so much
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:11.080]  this is a system run by folks like Jeffrey Epstein
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:13.080]  and Steve Jobs wife
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:17.080]  we've seen the sexualization of our children
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.080]  pushed through the education system now as well
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:21.080]  we've seen it at a massive level
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:23.080]  and I don't think many in the British public
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.080]  are aware of
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:27.080]  they want to take away your rights even now
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:29.080]  as parents in the schools
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:31.080]  we actually saw
[1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:33.080]  this situation because it was the Muslim community
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:35.080]  who come out in a city called Birmingham
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:37.080]  to protest outside the schools
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:39.080]  about the sexualization of their children
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:41.080]  about their daughter come home
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:43.080]  and said I could be a boy
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:45.080]  this is the new education system
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:47.080]  so they're not just raping you
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:49.080]  they're robbing you of your real sexual identity
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:51.080]  so they form a relationship with you
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:53.080]  because they got the kid to say it
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:55.080]  the state now says that the schools
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:57.080]  down to elementary students in fifth grade
[1:40:57.080 --> 1:40:59.080]  now can form this weird sexual relationship
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:01.080]  with your child about their identity
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:03.080]  how sick and freakish is that
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:05.080]  if your wife or husband tried to tell on your
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:07.080]  five-year-old son or daughter they were another sex
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:09.080]  you'd probably divorce them but it's the school
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:11.080]  doing it it's sick
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:13.080]  I actually went up to
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:15.080]  there was a Muslim man that was leading this
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:17.080]  I went and knocked on his front door
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:19.080]  because I listened to everything he was saying
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:21.080]  and they was being branded as a radical extremist Muslim
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:23.080]  but he wasn't he was concerned father
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:25.080]  a concerned father
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:27.080]  the Muslims that are against the pedophile
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:29.080]  we support them
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:31.080]  that's what I said to him I said
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:33.080]  I offer my hand in friendship to tackle this issue
[1:41:33.080 --> 1:41:35.080]  this is a massive issue
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.080]  the sexualization of our children
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:39.080]  taking away parental rights
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:41.080]  the brainwashing the confusion at a young
[1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:43.080]  they're talking about six years old they're teaching it
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:45.080]  we've been battling that
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:47.080]  and battling the grooming gangs
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:49.080]  but the sad thing is as a British journalist
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:51.080]  I know these gangs are going to want to kill me
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:53.080]  they're blowing up my car I know they want to target me
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:55.080]  my biggest fear is not from them
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:57.080]  it's from the British state
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.080]  it's what the British state and what the police
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:01.080]  and what the authorities are going to do now
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:03.080]  to try and stop what we're about to do
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:05.080]  there's nothing they can actually do Alex
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:07.080]  on the 29th the film will go live on band video
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:09.080]  but I very much doubt
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:11.080]  that I will be sitting here
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:13.080]  or sitting free
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:15.080]  to do series 2, 3, 4 and 5
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.080]  because when they see series 1
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:19.080]  and they're aware of what we have
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.080]  for series 2 we have historic recordings
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:23.080]  we have some we have allegations
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:25.080]  we have lots of information
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:27.080]  to give to the public
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:29.080]  to let them make their mind up to understand
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:31.080]  why these prosecutions weren't bought
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:33.080]  and this has gone on in every town and city
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:35.080]  I picked help and I did
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:37.080]  Stay there we're coming right back to you
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:39.080]  you're not just saying this you've been put in prison
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:41.080]  what three times for exposing child kidnapping rings
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:43.080]  we'll be right back with Tommy Robinson a true hero
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:45.080]  you want to see the real deal folks
[1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:47.080]  this is it he's been in street battles

[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:51.080]  by himself and knocking 5
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:53.080]  6 down while they're attacking
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:43:22.080]  Badass

[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:10.080]  it's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:12.080]  with all the gaslighting
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:14.080]  moralization and absurdity
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:16.080]  it's like we're living in a twilight zone man
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:18.080]  alright Eric's in New Hampshire Eric

[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:34.080]  support the InfoWars

[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:38.080]  thanks for rolling go ahead
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:40.080]  hey Alex it's great to be on with you it's an honor
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:42.080]  honor to talk to you
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:44.080]  awesome so first thing I wanted to do
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.080]  was say I love the products
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:48.080]  Alpha Power even at 29
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:50.080]  that's number one
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:52.080]  well it definitely works it's not a joke
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:54.080]  absolutely
[1:44:57.080 --> 1:45:00.080]  the purpose of fear is to call us into action
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:02.080]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:04.080]  half the population has lined up
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:06.080]  for an untested, deadly
[1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:08.080]  and debilitating experimental injection
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:10.080]  because they were told to be afraid
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:12.080]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:14.080]  the perpetrators of all this
[1:45:14.080 --> 1:45:16.080]  have clearly stated their goal
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:18.080]  having 80% of the population
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:20.080]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:22.080]  hive mind in less than nine years
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:24.080]  for those of us who have awoken
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:26.080]  from the spell we know this is all
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:28.080]  really happening and it's unbelievably
[1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:30.080]  unsettling to see but there is only
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:32.080]  two things to do
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:34.080]  we continue sounding the alarm because
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:36.080]  it's a numbers game if enough people
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:38.080]  awaken from the cold spell then we win
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:40.080]  but even when we win and we
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:42.080]  eventually will the days of convenience
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:44.080]  are soon coming to an end
[1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:46.080]  so we must prepare
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:48.080]  get up to a years worth of storable foods
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:50.080]  water filtration
[1:45:50.080 --> 1:45:52.080]  survival gear, seeds
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:54.080]  shortwave radios and life saving knowledge
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:56.080]  at infoorstore.com
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:45:58.080]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:00.080]  for almost 28 years
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:02.080]  against the globalist
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:04.080]  I wanted to stop their agenda
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:06.080]  I wanted to wake up the world
[1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:08.080]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:10.080]  before they went operational
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:12.080]  but we failed, yes a lot of people are awake
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:14.080]  yes we're not getting caught flat footed
[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:16.080]  but they are going ahead
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:18.080]  with their full operational
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:20.080]  deindustrialization great reset
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:22.080]  and that's why it's more important than ever
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:24.080]  than all viewers and all listeners
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:26.080]  tell everybody they know about the show
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:28.080]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:30.080]  so we've got an information warfare
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:32.080]  of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:34.080]  and we've also got to get personally prepared
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:36.080]  and one of the number one things to do is
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:38.080]  high quality storable food, we've got the best food
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:40.080]  ready to ship at very affordable prices
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:42.080]  at infoorstore.com
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:44.080]  so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:48.080]  right now, lock your orders in
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:50.080]  before food prices go up
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:52.080]  and before there are long lines and waits
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:54.080]  because believe me, serious times are coming
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:47:14.080]  get ready at infoorstore.com
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:16.080]  Coming up 15 minutes to the next hour
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:18.080]  after Tommy leaves us
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:20.080]  we're going to be talking about some of the new news breaking
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:22.080]  Pfizer booster shot listed
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:24.080]  as cause of death in 26 year olds autopsy
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:26.080]  death certificate after
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:28.080]  work mandated
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:30.080]  jab
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:32.080]  so that is coming up
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:34.080]  next hour and so much more
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:36.080]  what an insane time to be alive
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:38.080]  going back to the one the only
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:40.080]  Tommy Robinson car headlined
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:42.080]  blown up outside
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:44.080]  Telfer hotel in petrol
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:46.080]  bomb attack, you see those all over Europe
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:48.080]  when they say
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:50.080]  Germans burn 500 cars
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:52.080]  or
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:54.080]  Swiss burn
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:56.080]  or Parisians in Paris
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:47:58.080]  burn hundreds of cars
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:00.080]  no, it's the Islamic invaders
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:02.080]  I can't go to their country and have them
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:04.080]  let me live there in peace
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  but oh, now I was reading the number one name
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:08.080]  in Europe now is Mohammed
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:10.080]  so here we are
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:12.080]  let's just be honest about it
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:14.080]  Tommy Robinson, the filmmaker
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:16.080]  the journalist, you were saying
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:18.080]  that you believe when the first part of your
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:20.080]  film, we're going to play the trailer in a moment
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:22.080]  comes out here in just a few weeks
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:24.080]  that they're going to throw you back in prison
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.080]  why is that?
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:28.080]  because they want me to show the public
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:30.080]  their incompetence
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:32.080]  their corruption
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:34.080]  and their total
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:36.080]  failure
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:38.080]  and all of the people have got away
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:40.080]  so they're arresting
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:42.080]  some of the rapists but it's not just the rapists here
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:44.080]  there are people in councils
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:46.080]  and police forces who let them
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:48.080]  do it, who knew they were doing it
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:50.080]  we have evidence they knew they were doing it
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  so
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:54.080]  they need to be brought to justice too
[1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:56.080]  they certainly need to look the British
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:58.080]  public in their face
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:00.080]  and explain themselves
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:02.080]  which is what my last
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:04.080]  so I worked this documentary where I sat down
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:06.080]  with all the victims and some of the stories
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:08.080]  and some of the footage we've got is heartbreak
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:10.080]  and then I had to release
[1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:12.080]  series one before I'd done the rest
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:14.080]  because I now have that the final part
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:16.080]  is to go and find the men
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:18.080]  and we've had surveillance teams out there
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:20.080]  we've located, I've got their addresses, I know where they all live
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:22.080]  we've got their cars, we've been watching them
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:24.080]  we've had cameras on them, we've been surveillance
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:26.080]  and in the last
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:28.080]  two weeks with all these fire bombings
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:30.080]  all these attacks since the
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:32.080]  the promotion's gone out
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:34.080]  the police arrested our surveillance team
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:36.080]  they seized their computer, their car
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:38.080]  their phones and they've arrested them
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:40.080]  for harassment
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:42.080]  they're alleged harassment
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:44.080]  and adult male, Pakistani male
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:46.080]  who we have 100%
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:48.080]  DNA evidence impregnated
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:50.080]  a 13 year old English child
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:52.080]  and did not face prosecution
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:54.080]  he was arrested but he did not get prosecuted
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:56.080]  all in our film
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:58.080]  he raped her, she went to the police
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:00.080]  no further action
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:02.080]  they are saying, the police are saying
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:04.080]  that an adult male of Pakistani heritage
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:06.080]  who's a Muslim can rape
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:08.080]  a 13 year old English girl and not be prosecuted
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:10.080]  now we look at him in the story
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:12.080]  we speak to the victim in the story
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:14.080]  we need the police's response
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.080]  in the story
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:18.080]  because they have to answer some questions
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:20.080]  and that's what the film is about
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:22.080]  why is the left and the police
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:24.080]  all over the world under left's control
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:26.080]  protecting the rape and abuse of children
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:28.080]  I mean we know it's the left's religion
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:30.080]  but wow, they're really going for broke here
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:32.080]  the reason being
[1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:34.080]  that's been given across the UK
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.080]  not in one city, not in two cities
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:38.080]  but by government ministers
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:40.080]  prime ministers even
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:42.080]  is that it was political correctness
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:44.080]  it was through fear
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:46.080]  and fear as I've said it many times
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:48.080]  fear is paralysing
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:50.080]  and fear paralysed every single one of our political leaders
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:52.080]  and our police leaders
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:54.080]  into allowing a rape of a generation of young girls
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:56.080]  fear done then
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:58.080]  the fear of being branded as a racist
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:00.080]  the fear of stoking community
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:02.080]  tensions
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:04.080]  we'll let the English girls get raped
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:06.080]  because if we start arresting the Pakistani
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:08.080]  they might see rights
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:10.080]  well Tommy, that's why whenever there's a racial attack
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:12.080]  on white people
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:14.080]  by a person that's not white
[1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:16.080]  the media literally covers it up
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:18.080]  and again, if white people attack other people
[1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:20.080]  that's wrong, I expose it, I care about everybody
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:22.080]  but the left protecting it
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:24.080]  look at Waukesha
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:26.080]  where he runs over and kills 6 people
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:28.080]  almost kills 40 something
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:30.080]  they're all white and then the media says
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:32.080]  an SUV attack people
[1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:34.080]  it's the same thing in Europe
[1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:36.080]  but in a truck it was a crazy Muslim
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:38.080]  screaming Allah Akbar
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:40.080]  the media
[1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:42.080]  use every incident
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:44.080]  to push a narrative
[1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:46.080]  what is the narrative they push every time?
[1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:48.080]  it's a globalist narrative
[1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:50.080]  now the reality of open border policies
[1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:52.080]  is the things I'm talking about
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:54.080]  the stories I present
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:56.080]  the films I will make
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:51:58.080]  that's the reality of open border policy
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:00.080]  what they don't want to tell you
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:02.080]  is this is heading to America
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:04.080]  these are the policies of open border
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:06.080]  with the Afghan and Pakistan
[1:52:06.080 --> 1:52:08.080]  and all these other countries
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:10.080]  and Muslim immigration coming into your country
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:12.080]  it's a very different ball
[1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:14.080]  to have in Mexican immigration
[1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:16.080]  it's a whole new ball game
[1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:18.080]  you have very small numbers of Islamic immigration
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:20.080]  very very small and they're educated
[1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:22.080]  because of your immigration system
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:24.080]  because of how it's been
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:26.080]  now with Biden's new policies
[1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:28.080]  you're about to see half a Kashmir turning up
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:30.080]  which is what we've had in the UK
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:32.080]  now what that brings
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:34.080]  is hatred to women
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:36.080]  homosexuals intolerance
[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:38.080]  you will see the same mindset
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:40.080]  the difference with me and most people in the UK
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:42.080]  is I want to examine
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:44.080]  why 90% of the
[1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:46.080]  convictions in the UK
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:48.080]  for this group gang rate
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:50.080]  are Pakistani Muslims
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:52.080]  90% are from the Muslim community
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:54.080]  the Muslim community only make up 4% of the UK
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:56.080]  and 2% of them are women
[1:52:56.080 --> 1:52:58.080]  so 90%
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:00.080]  we have to ask the question why
[1:53:00.080 --> 1:53:02.080]  and when you try to explore the reason why
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:04.080]  when you hold up the Quran
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:06.080]  when you look at the teachings
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.080]  when you look at Mohammed and you start examining
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:10.080]  what his view was
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:12.080]  not just on women but on non-Muslim women
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:14.080]  on taking sexual slaves
[1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:16.080]  all of these things which totally justify
[1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:18.080]  the actions of these men
[1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:20.080]  we're not allowed to ask those questions
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:22.080]  you're simply not allowed to
[1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:24.080]  one man since Winston Churchill
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:26.080]  tried to talk about this issue in our British Parliament
[1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:28.080]  and that is Lord Pearson
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:30.080]  and when he does
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:32.080]  he literally gets laughed at
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:34.080]  they laugh and boo
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:36.080]  all of them
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:38.080]  all of those politicians do not care
[1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:40.080]  they don't care
[1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:42.080]  Tommy I think it's worse than that
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:44.080]  we know pedophilia isn't just going on in the Pakistani Muslims
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:46.080]  it goes all the way up to the House of Windsor
[1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:48.080]  that is just riddled with Jimmy Savelle
[1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:50.080]  the pedophilia including the murder of children
[1:53:50.080 --> 1:53:52.080]  I agree
[1:53:52.080 --> 1:53:54.080]  I agree Alex and one of the parts of our series
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:56.080]  for this documentary
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:53:58.080]  is not the Muslim community
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:00.080]  we want to look in Telford
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:02.080]  and in the council
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:04.080]  and the hierarchies of the council
[1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:06.080]  and their links to pedophilia
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:08.080]  and how many of them are involved
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:10.080]  absolutely did you see USA Today
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:12.080]  say that pedophilia is not a bad thing
[1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:14.080]  I saw it
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:16.080]  but this is where we're headed
[1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:18.080]  it's a sexuality
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:20.080]  that's where we're headed and to say that to people
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:22.080]  if you'd have spoke about transgender
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:24.080]  like 20 years ago
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:26.080]  and you had said what would be being pushed now
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:28.080]  people would not believe it
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:30.080]  the next level of their movement
[1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:32.080]  is to bring in the sexuality
[1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:34.080]  of being a pedophile but not acting on it
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:36.080]  that's what's coming
[1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:38.080]  the total sexualization
[1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:40.080]  of our children
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:42.080]  and people need to wake up and do Sankaban Alex
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:44.080]  know how happy I am every time I still see
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:46.080]  that you're still here because I know what they've done
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:48.080]  to you I know that they've done to me
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:50.080]  I know that you were the biggest target
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:52.080]  I know the censorship of you
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:54.080]  the fact that if your show falls
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:54:56.080]  that is the knock on effect for the rest of the free world
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:58.080]  because if you fall everyone falls
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:00.080]  because in the United States
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:02.080]  I've watched for years, I've watched the court cases recently
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:04.080]  I've seen everything that's gone on
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:06.080]  I know what I've gone through
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:08.080]  so I know what you've gone through
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:10.080]  but I know how important it is
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:12.080]  so people watching now just listen to one of your adverts
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:14.080]  there where someone wants to have a go at you
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:16.080]  people watching it need to understand that
[1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:18.080]  it is needed
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:20.080]  more than ever and every single person watching it
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:22.080]  needs to support it, share it
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:24.080]  do everything you can
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:26.080]  I don't explain the listeners enough
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:28.080]  that it costs us millions a quarter
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:30.080]  because we do have like now 10 million views a day
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:32.080]  at Bandai Video, we're paying for the bandwidth
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:34.080]  and we're not even having sponsors on there
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:36.080]  so it's people buying products that are literally paying
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:38.080]  so all these other films, all these other things
[1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:40.080]  that aren't allowed anywhere, get out
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:42.080]  and then I don't ever really brag about it
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:44.080]  because the enemy already knows I don't want to
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:46.080]  have him get even, I'm more angry
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:48.080]  at the time, some huge video that goes viral
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:50.080]  despite censorship and reaches 30, 40 million people
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:52.080]  gets its start at Bandai Video
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:54.080]  there's so many examples of this
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:56.080]  every day and so yes, that's why
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:55:58.080]  listeners need to support infowarstore.com
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:00.080]  because if they don't
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:02.080]  we're going to be shut down and they are
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:04.080]  moving against us so quickly but Tommy
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:06.080]  talk about your, and we'll go to break
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:08.080]  play the trailer, come back and talk more about
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:10.080]  not just the Muslim angle coming after the children
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:12.080]  but the leftist angle and why they're supporting
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.080]  the Muslims doing it, you have been in jail
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:16.080]  you've been in solitary confinement many times
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:18.080]  they've tried to kill you, they've tried to
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:20.080]  torture you, they've tried to fire bomb your house
[1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:22.080]  they've fire bombed your car, what is it in you
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:24.080]  just put me at one minute, that makes
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:26.080]  you just never back down
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:28.080]  what is it that makes you different than 99%
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:30.080]  of people?
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.080]  I'd love to say it's because I'm English mate
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:34.080]  it's because I'm English
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:36.080]  I'm an Englishman, no
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:38.080]  do you know what it is for me, I've sat down
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:40.080]  with these victims, so I sat down
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:42.080]  you're going to see the courage of this young girl
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:44.080]  and I've gone through
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:46.080]  nothing that they've gone through, not one of them
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:48.080]  and this girl's coming back
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:50.080]  fighting and she's telling her story
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:52.080]  and so I know
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:54.080]  and it's not just sometimes I would have felt like
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:56.080]  I want to step back or I want to sit back
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  but I'm in a position where
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:00.080]  I am in a position where I can give a platform
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:02.080]  to people, I can raise more
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:04.080]  awareness of these issues, so
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:06.080]  I'd be a coward not to
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:08.080]  so I'd be a coward not to, so I just
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:10.080]  and I'm stubborn as well
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.080]  and I know that I'm right
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:14.080]  so I always say, I bad times
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:16.080]  when even my
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  partner's family have said
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:20.080]  come on, just stop
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  but I said am I wrong?
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:24.080]  I asked everyone am I wrong, no
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:26.080]  so if I'm wrong why should I stop
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:28.080]  because of the threats, because of the intimidation
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:30.080]  because of the imprisonment, so I had
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:32.080]  to get myself ready for this film
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:34.080]  because I believe I know what's coming
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:36.080]  I had to get mentally strong, physically strong
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:38.080]  because I was worried about what I'm about to do
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:40.080]  because what we are about to do
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:42.080]  you're taking one for humanity, hour number three
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  with Tommy Robinson straight ahead, stay with us folks
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:58:10.080]  this is important
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:16.080]  so listen Paul Revere's
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:18.080]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:20.080]  when you pray for the broadcast
[1:58:20.080 --> 1:58:22.080]  you're the tip of the spear
[1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:24.080]  and when you buy products at infoarstore.com
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:26.080]  you keep us on air, plus we've got great

[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:36.080]  that are so good for your body

[1:58:44.080 --> 1:59:13.080]  is if you don't take action
[1:59:15.080 --> 1:59:17.080]  and despite the fact that the product is going to sell out
[1:59:17.080 --> 1:59:18.080]  the next week or so
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:20.080]  we're going to keep it on sale
[1:59:20.080 --> 1:59:22.080]  at 50% off
[1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:24.080]  for another seven days
[1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:26.080]  so again, I am cutting this announcement
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:29.080]  on the afternoon of January 6, 2022
[1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:31.080]  we're going to run this for a week
[1:59:31.080 --> 1:59:34.080]  and then we are going to be selling out of this product
[1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:36.080]  hopefully more comes in in the next month or so
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:37.080]  because it's the best seller
[1:59:37.080 --> 1:59:39.080]  and it's something everybody needs for their immune system
[1:59:39.080 --> 1:59:40.080]  and their body

[1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:44.080]  and support the InfoWare
[1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:47.080]  360 win at infowarstore.com
[1:59:50.080 --> 1:59:53.080]  If you are receiving this transmission
[1:59:53.080 --> 1:59:55.080]  you are the resistance
[1:59:55.080 --> 2:00:02.080]  All right Tommy Robinson leaves us in 15 minutes
[2:00:02.080 --> 2:00:05.080]  he's got to come back sooner
[2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:07.080]  I know he's been under cover the last year
[2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:09.080]  working on this multi-part film
[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:11.080]  so that no matter what happens to him
[2:00:11.080 --> 2:00:12.080]  they put him back in prison
[2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:14.080]  all the other parts get released
[2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:16.080]  when he's telling you it's very clear
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:18.080]  without man.video it might not be able to get out
[2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:20.080]  but we are going to do a video
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:22.080]  and we're going to be doing a video
[2:00:22.080 --> 2:00:24.080]  and we're going to be doing a video
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  that might not be able to get out
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.080]  but we are going to try to stay on there
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:28.080]  as long as possible as well
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:30.080]  what Tommy said, well I teared him out earlier
[2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:32.080]  not of fear, not of cowardice
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:34.080]  but of just energy that he's right
[2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:36.080]  if they take down InfoWars
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:37.080]  they have had a huge victory
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:38.080]  and that's why they are fighting so hard to do it
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:39.080]  but they take Tommy down
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:40.080]  they've had a huge victory
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:42.080]  so Tommy, this is a shorter segment
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:43.080]  we'll play the trailer next segment
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:45.080]  I'm behind here, I need to get to it
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:48.080]  but other points you'd like to add
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:51.080]  to the millions of people that are tuned in right now
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:55.080]  other points, mate, while we're on Covid
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:00:56.080]  you know the vaccine
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:59.080]  I think the mandate is simply about getting rid of
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:00.080]  all the three thinkers
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:02.080]  all the three thinkers will be gone
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:03.080]  they'll be erased from the military
[2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:04.080]  erased from the bank
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:06.080]  erased from all the major corporations
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:08.080]  and then they'll have every employee
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:10.080]  as a stormtrooper that they want
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:11.080]  so watch all this
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:13.080]  I think this is even about the vaccine
[2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:14.080]  they're literally going to
[2:01:14.080 --> 2:01:15.080]  you've got till this date
[2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:16.080]  and you're going to lose your job
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:17.080]  whether it be in the NHS
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:18.080]  whether it be in the American government
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  whether it be in the military
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:21.080]  if they manage that
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:23.080]  all the three thinkers are gone
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:24.080]  all the people
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:25.080]  and the rest
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:26.080]  there's less of the people
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:27.080]  who listen to them
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:28.080]  who abide by them
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:30.080]  who believe they're there
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:31.080]  for their best interests
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  whilst we're on the Covid issue
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:34.080]  that's why I'm watching what's going on
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:36.080]  that's what I believe they're doing
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:37.080]  it's just getting rid of the three things
[2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:38.080]  Tommy, I totally agree
[2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:39.080]  at the main level
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:42.080]  it's about subservience and domination
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:44.080]  and when the vaccine is poisonous
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:46.080]  that scares the smart people away
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:47.080]  to make sure they've got a group of people
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:48.080]  that are so dumb
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:50.080]  they'll follow orders to take something
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:52.080]  that's poisonous to themselves and others
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:54.080]  and not just follow the orders to take it
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:55.080]  but there'll be all the people
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:56.080]  who are being controlled
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:01:58.080]  all the three thinkers
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:01:59.080]  whether they be doctors
[2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:00.080]  whether they be military
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:01.080]  they'll be gone
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:03.080]  they won't be working within those fields
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:04.080]  so all of the controlled fields
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:06.080]  that come under the American government
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:08.080]  will be everyone who's employed
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:09.080]  if they get rid of all the people
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:10.080]  who won't get vaccinated
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:12.080]  they will have got rid of
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:13.080]  all of the three thinkers
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:14.080]  within those fields
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:15.080]  I totally agree
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:16.080]  and then what's the next move
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:18.080]  release a more deadly virus
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:19.080]  or why are they doing a purge
[2:02:19.080 --> 2:02:21.080]  the military, police, the medical field
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:24.080]  well there is one other thing
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:26.080]  that's benefit, not benefit
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:29.080]  but I think we were like the test cases
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:31.080]  because we were talking about Islam
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:32.080]  and they were coming down on us
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:34.080]  and the level of censorship
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:35.080]  and the propaganda
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:36.080]  and the media
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:37.080]  and all of that
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:40.080]  but now there's so many people now
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:42.080]  who are being awoken
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:44.080]  who see the same
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:46.080]  with how they're being labelled
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:47.080]  as conspiracy theorists
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:49.080]  or they're being attacked by the media
[2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:50.080]  they see the lies
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  whereas so what this has done
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:54.080]  is it hopefully has brought
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:56.080]  so many more people to question
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:57.080]  what is going on
[2:02:57.080 --> 2:02:58.080]  and when you start questioning
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:02:59.080]  what is going on
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:00.080]  your eyes open
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:02.080]  and from my experience
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:03.080]  once they're open
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:04.080]  you can't close them
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:05.080]  once they're open
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:06.080]  and once you realise the danger
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:07.080]  that we're in
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  the danger you're in
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:09.080]  if you have children
[2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:10.080]  I look at my three children
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:12.080]  I want to hand them down
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  a safe and prosperous future
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:15.080]  and I'll do everything
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:16.080]  within my breathing body
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:18.080]  to make sure they have that
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:21.080]  and when you realise now
[2:03:21.080 --> 2:03:22.080]  the danger
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:24.080]  so with us talking about Islam
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:25.080]  that might come in 5 years
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:26.080]  10 years 20 years
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:27.080]  the problem like
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:29.080]  but the immediate danger
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:30.080]  is the taking away
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:31.080]  of our rights
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:32.080]  and our freedoms
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:33.080]  right now
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:34.080]  by the British government
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:35.080]  by the American government
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  with the forced vaccines
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:37.080]  with the mandates
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:38.080]  with the lockdowns
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:39.080]  with all of this
[2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:40.080]  and do you know the mad thing is
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:41.080]  I'm looking in the UK
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:42.080]  and looking at who would be
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:43.080]  the best allies
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:45.080]  in fighting and battling this
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:46.080]  and they're probably
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:47.080]  from the migrant background
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:49.080]  especially from the Islamic background
[2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:50.080]  because we need to look
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:51.080]  at our immediate risk here
[2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:52.080]  and our immediate problem
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.080]  and more so to understand
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:03:57.080]  the way we have been played as well
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:03:58.080]  so we're here battling
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  whether it be white, black, BLM
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:02.080]  it's this, it's gay, it's straight
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:04.080]  it's us battling against
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:05.080]  the Islamic community
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:06.080]  and the whole time
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:07.080]  we've been played
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:09.080]  through the immigration system
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:10.080]  to bring it all in
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:11.080]  to cause us chaos
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:12.080]  to cause us divide
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:13.080]  and whilst they do that
[2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:14.080]  and we're all screaming
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:15.080]  and shouting at each other
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:16.080]  they are literally taking away
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:18.080]  every single freedom
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:20.080]  every single one of our forefathers
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:22.080]  bought and died to give us
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:23.080]  it's not free
[2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:24.080]  when we talk about freedom
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:25.080]  it wasn't free
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:26.080]  a generation of men
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:27.080]  left their children behind
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.080]  and died on beaches for that freedom
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:31.080]  that's what we've got it
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.080]  and right now we're all sitting
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:33.080]  just giving it away
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:34.080]  you'd see people
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:35.080]  queuing up and queuing up
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  and walking around
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:37.080]  with their masks on
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:38.080]  and I just think
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:40.080]  we are handing away
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:41.080]  everything
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:42.080]  like that
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:43.080]  we're handing away
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  things that our forebears
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:45.080]  fought back
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:46.080]  as you said, Englishmen
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:48.080]  900 years of the Magna Carta
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:50.080]  900 years of people
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:51.080]  just getting inch by inch
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:53.080]  millimetre by millimetre
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:54.080]  freedoms
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:55.080]  that are now being flushed down
[2:04:55.080 --> 2:04:57.080]  the toilet in a flash of a
[2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:01.080]  Christmas 2021 is over
[2:05:01.080 --> 2:05:02.080]  but you've still got

[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:14.080]  he's alex jones
[2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:17.080]  broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas
[2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:24.080]  worldwide
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:27.080]  well, our guest
[2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:28.080]  Tommy Robinson never gives up
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:31.080]  and he's got a big film coming out
[2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:33.080]  just a few weeks at man.video
[2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:34.080]  the rape of england
[2:06:34.080 --> 2:06:35.080]  but he was saying hey
[2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:37.080]  the muslim rape gangs
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:38.080]  the government covering it up
[2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:40.080]  that's all part of the divide and conquer
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:42.080]  he was saying the number one thing
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:44.080]  is all over the world
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:47.080]  the erasure of parental rights
[2:06:47.080 --> 2:06:48.080]  whether you're in the UK
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:50.080]  or blue cities in the US
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:52.080]  or Canada or Australia
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:53.080]  or Germany
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:55.080]  or giving small children shots at school
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:56.080]  without parental consent
[2:06:56.080 --> 2:06:58.080]  and outside of law
[2:06:58.080 --> 2:07:01.080]  and they're also teaching sexualization of children
[2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:03.080]  and telling them about their identity
[2:07:03.080 --> 2:07:05.080]  to confuse them
[2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:07.080]  and then because the child
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:08.080]  will make believe in role play
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:09.080]  and say okay, I'm a boy
[2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:10.080]  but I'm a girl now
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:11.080]  or vice versa
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:13.080]  then the school marks your child
[2:07:13.080 --> 2:07:16.080]  and begins a sick psychological relationship with them
[2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:18.080]  telling them they're in other sex
[2:07:18.080 --> 2:07:20.080]  I have a lot of family
[2:07:20.080 --> 2:07:21.080]  a lot of cousins
[2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:23.080]  they're in conservative Christian areas
[2:07:23.080 --> 2:07:25.080]  of east Texas and north Texas
[2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:27.080]  suburbs of Dallas
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.080]  and areas
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:32.080]  let's just say a couple hours north of Houston
[2:07:32.080 --> 2:07:34.080]  I have multiple cousins
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:35.080]  without me even asking
[2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:37.080]  when I see them in a family event
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:39.080]  they're like hey did you know
[2:07:39.080 --> 2:07:41.080]  that by the way some of these people are liberals
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:42.080]  and they're against it
[2:07:42.080 --> 2:07:44.080]  they're like
[2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:45.080]  you know my 12 year old daughter
[2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:46.080]  the daughter's right there
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:47.080]  they're like yeah
[2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:48.080]  they called her in last week
[2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:50.080]  and said you're really a boy
[2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:51.080]  she's not even in trouble
[2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:52.080]  she's a straight A student
[2:07:52.080 --> 2:07:53.080]  they go you're really a boy
[2:07:53.080 --> 2:07:55.080]  and she goes no I'm a girl
[2:07:55.080 --> 2:07:56.080]  and then they start telling her
[2:07:56.080 --> 2:07:57.080]  no you're a boy
[2:07:57.080 --> 2:07:58.080]  you know you're mentally ill
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:07:59.080]  if you don't
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:00.080]  and then I talk to other family
[2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:01.080]  they're doing it
[2:08:01.080 --> 2:08:02.080]  they're a 7 year old boy
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:05.080]  saying you could be a girl
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:07.080]  what is a school counselor
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:09.080]  calling a 7 year old in
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:10.080]  it's like in the nurses office
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:12.080]  for a quote well check
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:13.080]  and they just do
[2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:15.080]  and then say oh you like makeup
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:16.080]  you like dresses
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:18.080]  and then they say well sure
[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:20.080]  they put it in a book
[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:22.080]  and now start a sick relationship
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:23.080]  with your child
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:24.080]  if somebody did that
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:25.080]  to you in a park
[2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:26.080]  if you're in a park
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:27.080]  cooking hamburgers
[2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:29.080]  and some dude walks over to your 8 year old daughter
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:32.080]  and says I want to talk about your sexuality
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  you're going to break that guy's neck
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:36.080]  now it's done by the school
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:37.080]  and nothing's done
[2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:38.080]  so yes this is the takeover
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:40.080]  by the state day one
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:42.080]  and Tommy Robinson's dead right
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:43.080]  this is the big issue
[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:44.080]  tell us what's happening in the UK
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:47.080]  because you guys are under the worst attack
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:51.080]  in the city of Birmingham
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:54.080]  and they do it all in the name of Tolerance
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:57.080]  so they're teaching our children these things
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:01.080]  about whether it be about LGBTQ plus whatever it is
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:02.080]  it's all about Tolerance
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:03.080]  and I looked at the name
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:04.080]  there was certain books
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  and there was a person in control
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:09.080]  of the education for the Birmingham area
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:10.080]  and I looked them up
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:11.080]  and I went back through
[2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:13.080]  what they've been saying over the years
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:15.080]  and one of their words
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:17.080]  and I'll quote them
[2:09:17.080 --> 2:09:21.080]  they want to smash heteronormativity
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:23.080]  they want to smash heteronormativity
[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:25.080]  so this isn't about Tolerance
[2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:27.080]  this is about intolerance
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:28.080]  this is about you
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:32.080]  it's about smashing male and female whales
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:33.080]  male and female birds
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:35.080]  male and female humans
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:36.080]  like aliens show up
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:38.080]  and they smash your reproduction
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:39.080]  that's how they kill you
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.080]  and they tell you
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:42.080]  we're eugenicists, we're transhumanists
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:43.080]  we want to depopulate
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:46.080]  we're going to smash your heterosexual communities
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:47.080]  well we're designed for that
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:48.080]  it's what we are
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:49.080]  it's an attack on the species
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:51.080]  it's so damn alien
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:54.080]  and they use our own hospitality
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:55.080]  against us
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:09:57.080]  we're okay, smash my heterosexuality
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:09:58.080]  I'll show you
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:09:59.080]  I'm open to you
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:02.080]  sexualizing my children you criminals
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:05.080]  no, you're pedophile sick freaks
[2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:07.080]  this is actually what the Muslims
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:09.080]  were protesting about in Birmingham
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:11.080]  and they were labelled extremists
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:13.080]  by the media and they were shut down
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:15.080]  but what they were arguing against
[2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:16.080]  was totally just
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:18.080]  they were arguing against the sexualization
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:19.080]  of their kids
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:20.080]  now we see this
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:21.080]  we saw as well
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:23.080]  that they were teaching about self masturbation
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:25.080]  they were teaching children
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:28.080]  age six about how to love themselves
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:29.080]  self masturbation
[2:10:29.080 --> 2:10:31.080]  now I would speak to my six year old
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:32.080]  about masturbation
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:35.080]  so how is a school teacher
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:36.080]  in a position to be sitting
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:37.080]  talking to our children
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:39.080]  and all of these things
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:42.080]  that anyone listening may sound insane
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:43.080]  okay, it's got a lot of this
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:44.080]  I had to check it
[2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:46.080]  I had to sit and research it myself
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:48.080]  see, wow, they are doing this
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:50.080]  and your ability to take your child out
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:51.080]  of sex education
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:53.080]  to take your child out of religious education
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  it's going
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:56.080]  in Wales it's already gone up in Wales
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:58.080]  so again, you're running a business
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:10:59.080]  in your small town
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:01.080]  see the child kidnapping rings
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  you're raising children
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:03.080]  they're trying to brainwash them
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:05.080]  they keep messing with you
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  you're not out there starting the fight
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:09.080]  they're out there coming after your children
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:10.080]  they are
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:14.080]  and for anyone in Britain watching this
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:17.080]  we've drew the line in the sand is Telford
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:19.080]  we are going to hit Telford
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:22.080]  in some way on the 29th of January
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:24.080]  in a way that's going to have the authorities
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:26.080]  the establishment sitting there thinking
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:28.080]  I thought we deleted this guy
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:30.080]  I thought we erased him
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:31.080]  I thought he was gone
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:32.080]  no, we're not gone
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:33.080]  we're not gone
[2:11:33.080 --> 2:11:35.080]  and we're going to keep him in that city
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:36.080]  we're going to keep raising awareness
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:38.080]  until something's done
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:39.080]  until something's done
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:41.080]  we will be that little thorn in your side
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:42.080]  that keeps hitting you back
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:43.080]  that's right because if you can stop
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:45.080]  the state run pedophile rings in one town
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:47.080]  you can stop them all
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:48.080]  if we can highlight enough
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:49.080]  and bring to justice enough
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:51.080]  I said we can go from one to the other
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:52.080]  we're just going to keep with Telford
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:54.080]  and I guarantee you
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:55.080]  we will sit on this show
[2:11:55.080 --> 2:11:58.080]  and I will be placed with some sort of injunction
[2:11:58.080 --> 2:12:00.080]  or some sort of legal route
[2:12:00.080 --> 2:12:02.080]  in order to try and prevent me going into that town
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:04.080]  and then when you still defend the children
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.080]  they'll throw you in solitary confinement
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:07.080]  or explain they let the Muslims
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:09.080]  literally piss on you
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:12.080]  it is but that's when they're in catch 22
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:13.080]  if they do that
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:15.080]  they raise more awareness to our film
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:17.080]  which will awaken more people
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  my job and my role is to awaken people
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:20.080]  if they imprison me
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:22.080]  they awaken people
[2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:24.080]  many people would have been turned
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:25.080]  when they looked me up last time
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:27.080]  I remember saying to them
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:28.080]  as I was getting arrested
[2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:29.080]  more people are going to watch this video
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:31.080]  than you can ever dream of
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:33.080]  5 million people watch our video that weekend
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:35.080]  that's 5 million people questioning the media
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:37.080]  5 million people talking about the rape gangs
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:39.080]  if that saved one girl
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:40.080]  it's worth it
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:41.080]  if it saves one girl
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:42.080]  but the reality is
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:45.080]  hopefully we woke up hundreds and hundreds of parents
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:47.080]  so we aren't going to stop
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:48.080]  we're going to continue
[2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:50.080]  and we rely on every single person
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:51.080]  to share the information
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:52.080]  give us a follow if you're watching this
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:54.080]  and you haven't signed up to get up
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:55.080]  sign up to get up
[2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:56.080]  give me a follow on there
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:12:57.080]  oh yeah tell folks
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:12:59.080]  how do people find Tommy Robinson at Gitter
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:02.080]  get out putting Tommy Robinson 1
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:04.080]  Alex I'd love to get on here more
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:05.080]  so we can talk afterwards
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:07.080]  I want to
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:08.080]  yeah
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:09.080]  let's do this
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:11.080]  I'm going to play the trailer right now as we go out
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:13.080]  but I want to get you on Harrison Smith's show
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:15.080]  I want to get you on the warm with Owen
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:17.080]  because you know I know you've been in the field
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:18.080]  you know undercover
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:19.080]  the last year
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:21.080]  alright Owen as well
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:22.080]  and I just want
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:24.080]  I've had my time
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:25.080]  I've had my rest
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:26.080]  so we're back
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:27.080]  let's go
[2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:28.080]  you're ready to go
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:29.080]  well I tell you
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:31.080]  you know you're what I aspire to be like
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:33.080]  because you know we've been attacked a lot
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:34.080]  but you have been put in jail
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:35.080]  you've been tortured
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:36.080]  I mean I saw you come out
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:37.080]  like a concentration camp victim
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:39.080]  lost like you know 40-50 pounds
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:41.080]  and you've just been through hell
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  the Antifa
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:43.080]  he walks out of a McDonald's
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.080]  and like 15 Antifa
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:46.080]  trying to beat him up
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:47.080]  and like knocking him down
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:48.080]  I mean it's just amazing
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:50.080]  and then he gets in trouble
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:51.080]  it's just crazy
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:52.080]  here's part of the trailer
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:54.080]  for what's coming out in a few weeks
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:55.080]  on the 29th
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:56.080]  The Rape of England
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:57.080]  and we'll be back with a bunch of breaking news
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:13:59.080]  Tommy Robinson has been our guest
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:00.080]  and we salute him
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:01.080]  stay with us
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:31.080]  there has been going on
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:32.080]  for well over two years
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:33.080]  the police
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:34.080]  social services
[2:14:34.080 --> 2:14:35.080]  and councillors
[2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:37.080]  are refusing to help the enquiry at all
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:38.080]  with us the crime then
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:40.080]  was 40 years worth of information
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:41.080]  40 years?
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:42.080]  40 years worth of information
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:44.080]  for 40 years children have been real
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:47.080]  so 40 years children have been failed
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:48.080]  for understanding
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:49.080]  a deliberate attempt
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:51.080]  to cover up these crimes
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:52.080]  against little girls
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:54.080]  for fear of being called racist
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:56.080]  they've known what has been going on in that town
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:58.080]  for 40 years
[2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:01.080]  they would talk to me about going to meet certain people
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:02.080]  not to tell my dad
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:04.080]  if he's told me to go to that person
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:06.080]  who was the kingpin?
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:08.080]  who was the main organiser?
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:10.080]  I don't want to be living this
[2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:11.080]  for the rest of my life
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:13.080]  he was that hurt by it
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:15.080]  he'd guide the car then
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:17.080]  he couldn't wait for the police to come
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:18.080]  he needed to
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:19.080]  to go
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:20.080]  family trees, networks
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:21.080]  how they operate
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:22.080]  who operates with who
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:23.080]  just so you understand
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:24.080]  as we go along here
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:25.080]  we have
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:26.080]  CPS listeners
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:28.080]  police officers
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:29.080]  politicians
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  that's the level of connections
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:31.080]  who are involved
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:32.080]  in the twine
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:33.080]  within these gangs
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:35.080]  there are five dead females
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:36.080]  at the hands of these gangs
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:37.080]  in Telford alone
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:39.080]  I'm sorry for doing this
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:41.080]  I mean I have to be 100%
[2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:43.080]  for what I'm making of this
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:44.080]  the hunters
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:45.080]  are about to become the hunt
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.080]  this is a keyhole
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:47.080]  it's come out of this house
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:48.080]  this is the vehicle
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:49.080]  of one of our surveillance teams
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  the reason why this is so important
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:51.080]  is they can get up close
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:52.080]  they have zooming cameras
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:53.080]  I'll see the full trailer
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:54.080]  and end up in the rape of bread
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:55.080]  and stay with us
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:15:57.080]  over 200 men's names
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:00.080]  I am recording this announcement
[2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:03.080]  on the afternoon of January 6, 2022
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:04.080]  and that means there are only
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:06.080]  seven days left
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:07.080]  of us being able to offer
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:08.080]  our best selling product
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:10.080]  vitamin mineral fusion
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:13.080]  at 50% off
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:14.080]  it has all the vitamins
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:15.080]  all the minerals
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:16.080]  incredible amino acids
[2:16:16.080 --> 2:16:18.080]  it is a game changer
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:19.080]  for your immune system
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:20.080]  and every other function
[2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:21.080]  in your body
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:22.080]  and it's a must have
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:24.080]  that's why despite the fact
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:25.080]  that it's selling out
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:26.080]  at current sales rates
[2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:29.080]  we're going to keep it on sale
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:31.080]  for another seven days
[2:16:31.080 --> 2:16:32.080]  so we're running this
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:34.080]  until next Thursday
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:35.080]  and your purchase
[2:16:35.080 --> 2:16:36.080]  supports the broadcast
[2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:37.080]  I want to thank you all
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:39.080]  for shopping with Info Wars
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:40.080]  without you
[2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:41.080]  it would not have been on air
[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  and the world would be
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:43.080]  a much worse position
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:44.080]  right now that it's in
[2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:46.080]  thanks to you supporting Info Wars
[2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:48.080]  we have now become
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:49.080]  the number one beacon of truth
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:51.080]  exposing the great reset
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:52.080]  and the new world order
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:53.080]  so support your immune system
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:54.080]  and support free speech
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:55.080]  in the fight for liberty
[2:16:55.080 --> 2:16:56.080]  at the same time
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:57.080]  at infowarstore.com
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:16:58.080]  the average person
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:00.080]  on the face of this incredible planet
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:01.080]  is still unaware
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:02.080]  that there's a war
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:03.080]  between three individuals
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:06.080]  and nation states on one side
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:07.080]  and the globalist on the other
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:09.080]  who are literally trying to create
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:11.080]  a post-human world
[2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:12.080]  from the United States to Brazil
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:13.080]  and of course triggered
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:15.080]  by the Brexit in the UK
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:16.080]  nations were pulling out
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:17.080]  of the private corporate
[2:17:17.080 --> 2:17:19.080]  fascist world government
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:20.080]  that's why they launched
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:21.080]  their great reset
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:22.080]  and their program after collapse
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:24.080]  and their program after collapsing us
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:26.080]  of build back better
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:28.080]  this is nothing more
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:29.080]  than a top down
[2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:31.080]  vertical consolidation
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:32.080]  of the world economy
[2:17:32.080 --> 2:17:34.080]  because they couldn't take our guns
[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:35.080]  and because we wouldn't bow
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:36.080]  because the left
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:38.080]  which is the ideology
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:39.080]  of this world government system
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:40.080]  couldn't win
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:43.080]  they released a biological weapon on us
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:44.080]  now we know
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:45.080]  two years ago
[2:17:45.080 --> 2:17:46.080]  we learned about it
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:47.080]  about 20 months ago
[2:17:47.080 --> 2:17:48.080]  it's that simple
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:49.080]  they can't meet us
[2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:50.080]  because of our free speech
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:51.080]  and our guns
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:52.080]  so the global corporate
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:54.080]  combined released COVID-19
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:55.080]  and you know the rest is history
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:56.080]  expose this paradigm
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:17:58.080]  and we win
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:17:59.080]  let's go ahead and take another call
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:01.080]  let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:02.080]  welcome
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:03.080]  hello Alex
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:04.080]  yes Malcolm
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:05.080]  alright I will make this quick
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:06.080]  in real short
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:07.080]  where the other patrons
[2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:08.080]  can get on the line
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:09.080]  Alex I have to promote
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:10.080]  one thing
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:11.080]  from one of your co-host
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:12.080]  Owen Schreuer
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:13.080]  Supermail volatility
[2:18:13.080 --> 2:18:15.080]  and brain force plus
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:16.080]  mix those two together
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:18.080]  you're an unstoppable tank
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:19.080]  Supermail volatility
[2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:20.080]  really really works
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:21.080]  cold pressed herbs
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:23.080]  and natural compounds
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:24.080]  that have never been heated up
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:27.080]  and so it has a dramatic effect
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:29.080]  compared to powdered versions
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:30.080]  that also work quite well
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:31.080]  but just aren't as strong
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:33.080]  this is like a very fine wine
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:34.080]  it's it's it's it's
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:35.080]  in fact each batch is different
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:36.080]  sometimes it's super strong
[2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:37.080]  sometimes it's just okay
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:38.080]  people are like
[2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:39.080]  why are you selling something
[2:18:39.080 --> 2:18:40.080]  and admitting sometimes
[2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:41.080]  the batch isn't strong
[2:18:41.080 --> 2:18:42.080]  that's just how it is
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:43.080]  it's how it works
[2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:45.080]  so it's always good
[2:18:45.080 --> 2:18:46.080]  it's just sometimes
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:47.080]  it's like super strong
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:48.080]  but yeah
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:49.080]  if you want the Rolls Royce
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:50.080]  at a decent price
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:51.080]  then this is it
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:02.080]  get our great bag of it here
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:03.080]  I mean this is from
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:04.080]  people say
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:05.080]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:06.080]  the communists
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:07.080]  well that's where
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:09.080]  some of the best coffee in the world
[2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:10.080]  that's wild harvested
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:11.080]  above organic
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:12.080]  in the volcanic soil
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:14.080]  better than Guatemalan coffee
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:15.080]  and yeah
[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:16.080]  we buy it from the little farmers
[2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:17.080]  that you know the media calls
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:18.080]  communists
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:19.080]  they're just a commune
[2:19:19.080 --> 2:19:20.080]  and whatever the point is
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:21.080]  is that it's good coffee
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:22.080]  and we've got it
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:23.080]  and the farmers
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:24.080]  don't let the Mexican government
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:25.080]  take over
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:26.080]  so I actually buy this
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:27.080]  from the Mexican rebels
[2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:28.080]  and I've been buying it
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:29.080]  for what 14 years
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:30.080]  and the price has never gone up
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:31.080]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods
[2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:32.080]  under another name
[2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:33.080]  for about 50% more
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:34.080]  for pound
[2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:35.080]  and I just think it's
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:36.080]  some of the best coffee
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:37.080]  you're gonna find anywhere
[2:19:37.080 --> 2:19:38.080]  it's Wake Up America
[2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:39.080]  Patriot Blend
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:40.080]  from the Chiapas Rebels
[2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:41.080]  literally
[2:19:41.080 --> 2:19:42.080]  in fact
[2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:43.080]  I'm not gonna tell you a little story
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:44.080]  um
[2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:45.080]  we had one
[2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:46.080]  okay
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:47.080]  you won't believe it
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:48.080]  anyway so
[2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:49.080]  it's infowarstore.com
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:50.080]  and that's how
[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.080]  we fund this operation
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:52.080]  and if you don't find us
[2:19:52.080 --> 2:19:53.080]  and don't want to share
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:54.080]  that's fine
[2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:01.080]  Leading a frontal assault
[2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:02.080]  on the lies
[2:20:02.080 --> 2:20:04.080]  of the New World Order
[2:20:04.080 --> 2:20:06.080]  it's Alex Jones
[2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:12.080]  I remember when
[2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:13.080]  I remember I remember
[2:20:13.080 --> 2:20:15.080]  when I lost my mind
[2:20:15.080 --> 2:20:17.080]  there was something so pleasant
[2:20:17.080 --> 2:20:19.080]  about that place
[2:20:19.080 --> 2:20:21.080]  even your emotions
[2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:22.080]  haven't let go
[2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:24.080]  in so much space
[2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:31.080]  you know when you're interviewing
[2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:33.080]  somebody like Tommy Robinson
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:35.080]  a real hero
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:36.080]  and you look at how much
[2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:37.080]  he's demonized
[2:20:37.080 --> 2:20:39.080]  and how much he's not appreciated
[2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:41.080]  it just makes you marble
[2:20:41.080 --> 2:20:42.080]  cause you see a firefighter
[2:20:42.080 --> 2:20:43.080]  that goes into burning house
[2:20:43.080 --> 2:20:44.080]  and saves a child
[2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:45.080]  you go well that's a hero
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:46.080]  but they signed up for it
[2:20:46.080 --> 2:20:47.080]  but we really want to be
[2:20:47.080 --> 2:20:48.080]  a man like that
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:49.080]  or a woman who's going
[2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:50.080]  in the burning building
[2:20:50.080 --> 2:20:51.080]  women do heroic things as well
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:52.080]  but we're not supposed to
[2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:53.080]  ever recognize that
[2:20:53.080 --> 2:20:54.080]  that's really been men's
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:55.080]  traditional mode
[2:20:55.080 --> 2:20:56.080]  and what we're designed to do
[2:20:56.080 --> 2:20:57.080]  is expend ourselves
[2:20:57.080 --> 2:20:58.080]  we're expendable
[2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:00.080]  and by making it
[2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:02.080]  oh no no that's women's jobs too
[2:21:02.080 --> 2:21:03.080]  well then that makes
[2:21:03.080 --> 2:21:04.080]  or men don't have to
[2:21:04.080 --> 2:21:05.080]  act like men anymore you see
[2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:06.080]  we just turn women
[2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:08.080]  into the expendable
[2:21:09.080 --> 2:21:11.080]  and by extension our children
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:13.080]  so
[2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:16.080]  I think about all he's been through
[2:21:17.080 --> 2:21:18.080]  and I think about the
[2:21:18.080 --> 2:21:19.080]  over all the years
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:20.080]  he's been tortured in jail
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:22.080]  for exposing pedophile groups
[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:24.080]  that were confirmed and convicted
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:26.080]  and how the police
[2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:28.080]  sycophantically worship
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:29.080]  the pedophiles in the UK
[2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:31.080]  and attack him
[2:21:31.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  but it's the same thing
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:33.080]  we see here now
[2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:35.080]  this is the service of evil
[2:21:35.080 --> 2:21:36.080]  going on
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:38.080]  and it's that
[2:21:39.080 --> 2:21:40.080]  me and my show this morning
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:41.080]  thinking about Tommy Robinson
[2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:42.080]  coming on the show
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:46.080]  first we overlook evil
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:48.080]  then we permit evil
[2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:50.080]  then we legalize evil
[2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:51.080]  then we promote evil
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:53.080]  then we celebrate evil
[2:21:53.080 --> 2:21:55.080]  then we persecute those
[2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:57.080]  who still call it evil
[2:21:58.080 --> 2:22:00.080]  Isaiah 5 20
[2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:02.080]  woe unto them
[2:22:03.080 --> 2:22:04.080]  who call evil good
[2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:05.080]  and good evil
[2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:06.080]  and good evil
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:11.080]  and so I'm sitting here
[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:13.080]  while Tommy's talking the last hour
[2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:15.080]  when you're in breaks
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:16.080]  I'm on infowars.com
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:17.080]  and I'm reading articles
[2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:18.080]  and I'm watching videos
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:19.080]  and I'm just like
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:21.080]  man this is moving too fast
[2:22:21.080 --> 2:22:23.080]  and that's what evil's doing
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:27.080]  is just trying to totally
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:30.080]  and completely overwhelm us
[2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:32.080]  to where we just give up
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:33.080]  and go into a catatonic
[2:22:33.080 --> 2:22:34.080]  or fetal position
[2:22:34.080 --> 2:22:37.080]  we cannot let them break our will
[2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:38.080]  we have to just trust in God
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:39.080]  and do the right thing
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:41.080]  and know that it's not our job to stop it all
[2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:43.080]  it's just our job to say no
[2:22:43.080 --> 2:22:44.080]  and to resist it
[2:22:45.080 --> 2:22:46.080]  and when I say that
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:47.080]  I know how you are
[2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:48.080]  because you're like me
[2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:50.080]  you feel guilty
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:51.080]  I know I do
[2:22:51.080 --> 2:22:52.080]  you feel frustrated
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:53.080]  you feel angry
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:54.080]  that you can't stop them
[2:22:54.080 --> 2:22:56.080]  and it's ridiculous
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:58.080]  why are people going along with this
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:22:59.080]  why is this so out of control
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:00.080]  and you want to just say
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:03.080]  screw it then
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:05.080]  but you can't just run hide in the woods
[2:23:06.080 --> 2:23:07.080]  and certainly
[2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:08.080]  you can't go commit suicide
[2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:09.080]  I've never thought of that
[2:23:09.080 --> 2:23:10.080]  but people do
[2:23:10.080 --> 2:23:11.080]  they just get pissed and check out
[2:23:11.080 --> 2:23:14.080]  why not commit your life to fighting evil
[2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:15.080]  and not caring
[2:23:16.080 --> 2:23:18.080]  and being desperate for the children
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:19.080]  instead of just blowing your head off
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:20.080]  in your pickup truck
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:22.080]  how about you go
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:24.080]  politically take over the church meeting peacefully
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:25.080]  and speak out against the new ruler
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:26.080]  how about you go to the city council
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:27.080]  how about you go to congress
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:30.080]  how about you do that
[2:23:31.080 --> 2:23:32.080]  yeah the easy road out
[2:23:32.080 --> 2:23:33.080]  shoving the barrel in your mouth
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:34.080]  and blowing the back of your head off
[2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:35.080]  to get out of this evil
[2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:36.080]  what about the children
[2:23:36.080 --> 2:23:38.080]  they don't even know how to do that
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:40.080]  you can't do that
[2:23:40.080 --> 2:23:41.080]  they need you
[2:23:41.080 --> 2:23:43.080]  God wants you to be a man
[2:23:43.080 --> 2:23:45.080]  and I'm not preaching to people
[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:47.080]  I know how painful this is
[2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:50.080]  and I know the proclivity of people
[2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:52.080]  who are good and hard working
[2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:53.080]  and strong
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:55.080]  who don't want to grandstand
[2:23:55.080 --> 2:23:58.080]  but we're way past that point here
[2:23:58.080 --> 2:23:59.080]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:01.080]  we need to be grandstanding
[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:03.080]  to get out in front of the evil
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:04.080]  that's taken over
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:05.080]  and say whoa
[2:24:05.080 --> 2:24:06.080]  hey everybody
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:07.080]  these people are bad
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:09.080]  you can't trust a damn thing they say
[2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:11.080]  and I'm not shutting up
[2:24:11.080 --> 2:24:12.080]  and I'm telling you
[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:14.080]  I know there are people watching
[2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:15.080]  of every race, color and creed
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:16.080]  who are the one race
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:17.080]  made by God
[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:19.080]  the human race with the red blood
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:22.080]  and when you finally
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:24.080]  go speak at the city council
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:26.080]  when you finally go speak at the school board
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:28.080]  when you finally speak at the state house
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:29.080]  when you finally pick it
[2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:30.080]  by yourself it doesn't matter
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:32.080]  when you finally say no to evil
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:33.080]  when you finally reach out
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:36.080]  and people try to make you submit
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:38.080]  and when they try to silence you
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:39.080]  and intimidate you
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:41.080]  that's when you step into a wider world
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:44.080]  and once you finally get out of your comfort zone
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:47.080]  and stand up to these people
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:48.080]  the whole world's going to change
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:49.080]  just like that
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:51.080]  but you've got to take that first step into the future
[2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:53.080]  you've got to take that first step of destiny
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  that's what I'm telling you
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:55.080]  you've got to do it now
[2:24:55.080 --> 2:24:57.080]  because the children are begging for your help
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:24:59.080]  go back to Tommy Robinson
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:01.080]  they were running thousands of kidnapped kids
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:02.080]  in the town he was in
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:03.080]  he couldn't believe it
[2:25:03.080 --> 2:25:04.080]  the little kids would disappear
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:05.080]  and the Muslims were bragging
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:06.080]  they were cutting them up
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:07.080]  and butchering them
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:09.080]  and selling them in the kebab machines
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:10.080]  that's like they have hamburgers over there
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:11.080]  but it's like
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:13.080]  the Muslims have kebab machines
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:14.080]  and it was the dead kids
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:15.080]  that was later confirmed
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:16.080]  and he's like
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:17.080]  freaking out
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:18.080]  like what's going on
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:19.080]  what's happening
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:20.080]  and then they physically attacked him
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:21.080]  so he beat their ass
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  and fought back
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:23.080]  and then that was it
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:24.080]  it was off the races
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:26.080]  he just saw evil
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:27.080]  he decided not to ignore it
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:29.080]  like the other businesses were doing
[2:25:29.080 --> 2:25:30.080]  because imagine the police
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:31.080]  and the businesses
[2:25:33.080 --> 2:25:34.080]  they just start putting up with it
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:36.080]  and then now they put up with more
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:38.080]  and now they put up with this and that
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:39.080]  and now
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:40.080]  oh the police are involved
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:42.080]  having sex with the children
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:43.080]  let's come out across England
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:44.080]  and they're like
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:46.080]  they're having sex with the children
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:48.080]  let's come out across England
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:50.080]  imagine being that committed to evil
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:52.080]  imagine being part of something like that
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  imagine the arrogant look
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:55.080]  in those pedophiles' eyes
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:57.080]  how they're so satisfied
[2:25:57.080 --> 2:25:58.080]  and so confirmed
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:00.080]  that they've got a government backing them
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:02.080]  and they can get away with whatever they want
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:04.080]  and nothing's going to stop them
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:06.080]  that face
[2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:08.080]  of arrogant, conceited evil
[2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:10.080]  is the face of the devil
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:12.080]  and we can and we must
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:14.080]  and we will defeat it
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:17.080]  even mainline news
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:18.080]  says grooming epidemic
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:20.080]  almost 19,000 children
[2:26:20.080 --> 2:26:22.080]  identified as sexual exploitation victims
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:24.080]  in England by the Muslims
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:31.080]  I mean what do you think happened
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:32.080]  a thousand years ago
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:33.080]  or 500 years ago
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:35.080]  when you get pirated
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:36.080]  out in the Atlantic Ocean
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:38.080]  or in the Mediterranean
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:40.080]  or in the Pacific Ocean
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:42.080]  by Muslim slavers
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:43.080]  where do you think you're going
[2:26:43.080 --> 2:26:44.080]  you're going to a slave camp
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:45.080]  and the Muslims
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:47.080]  yeah they had black slaves
[2:26:47.080 --> 2:26:48.080]  but that isn't what they wanted
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:50.080]  they wanted women slaves
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:52.080]  that was their main business
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:54.080]  is female slaves
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:57.080]  let's just admit that's a cultural part of Islam
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:04.080]  and it's got to stop
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:06.080]  and we got to say no to it
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:09.080]  these are predators that are such cowards
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:11.080]  I don't care if they're a white
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:12.080]  blue-haired person
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:13.080]  or a black person
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:14.080]  or whatever they are
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:15.080]  they're going after children
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:17.080]  because they're bullies
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:19.080]  and they want the power
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:20.080]  over a little child
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:21.080]  to steal their innocence
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:22.080]  and we're not going to sit here
[2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:23.080]  and take it anymore
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:25.080]  you leftist pedophiles
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:26.080]  burn in hell and you will
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:27.080]  and you know it
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:29.080]  and you're not going to take us with you
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:30.080]  alright I'm going to come back
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:31.080]  and hit the huge news
[2:27:31.080 --> 2:27:32.080]  it's just so over the top
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:33.080]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  I'm going to just
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:36.080]  it's exhausting
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:37.080]  but I know you want to hear the truth
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:38.080]  you want to know what's coming next
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:40.080]  we're going to hit it separately
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:42.080]  I told you first hour
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:43.080]  and I'm going to tell you again
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:44.080]  we need a war chest
[2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:45.080]  going into this year
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:47.080]  and we're already 300 days out
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:48.080]  from the midterms
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:49.080]  and the stage terror attacks
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.080]  the globalists want to launch
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:51.080]  and everything they're doing
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:53.080]  and Info Wars now has the minds
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:54.080]  it has the ears
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:56.080]  it has people paying attention
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:27:58.080]  at the highest levels
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:00.080]  and so now is our most important work
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:02.080]  of all of my 27, 28 years
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:03.080]  on air
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:05.080]  so I'm asking you now

[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:14.080]  about to end in a couple days
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:15.080]  probably tomorrow
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:16.080]  it's about to sell out
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:17.080]  vitamin mineral fusion

[2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:26.080]  X2 is about to sell out

[2:31:56.080 --> 2:31:58.080]  at InfoWareStore.com
[2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:02.080]  Cobra Commander here
[2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:03.080]  with an important message
[2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:05.080]  to humanity
[2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:06.080]  I have decided
[2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:08.080]  that all of you
[2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:10.080]  will take a special injection
[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:12.080]  so that you will be safe
[2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:14.080]  but the injection
[2:32:14.080 --> 2:32:16.080]  is not ready yet
[2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:17.080]  and so
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:19.080]  I need all of you
[2:32:19.080 --> 2:32:20.080]  to stay indoors
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:22.080]  for the next 15 days
[2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:25.080]  to flatten the can
[2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:27.080]  I also need you to wear masks
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:29.080]  and I also need you to
[2:32:29.080 --> 2:32:30.080]  only shop
[2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:33.080]  at mega corporations
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:35.080]  that way we can consolidate
[2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:36.080]  control
[2:32:36.080 --> 2:32:37.080]  and bankrupt
[2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:39.080]  the world economy
[2:32:39.080 --> 2:32:40.080]  leaving companies
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:42.080]  that only I own
[2:32:42.080 --> 2:32:43.080]  profitable
[2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:46.080]  you will then be my slaves
[2:32:46.080 --> 2:32:47.080]  oh
[2:32:47.080 --> 2:32:48.080]  and then you'll get
[2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:50.080]  that special shot
[2:32:50.080 --> 2:32:51.080]  and get him from Cobra
[2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:53.080]  it will remove your immune system
[2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:55.080]  so you'll be dependent on me
[2:32:55.080 --> 2:32:57.080]  for the rest of your miserable lives
[2:32:59.080 --> 2:33:01.080]  leading a frontal assault
[2:33:01.080 --> 2:33:02.080]  on the lies
[2:33:02.080 --> 2:33:04.080]  of the New World Order
[2:33:04.080 --> 2:33:24.080]  It's Alex Jones
[2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:26.080]  The Alex Jones show
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:34.080]  because there is a war on
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:36.080]  we know that
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:38.080]  the two dose of the vaccine
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:40.080]  offer very limited protection
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:42.080]  the three doses with a booster
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:44.080]  they offer reasonable protection
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:46.080]  against hospitalization
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:48.080]  and deaths
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:50.080]  against deaths I think very good
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:53.080]  and less protection
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:55.080]  against infection
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:56.080]  now
[2:33:56.080 --> 2:33:58.080]  we are working on a
[2:33:58.080 --> 2:34:00.080]  new version of our vaccine
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:02.080]  the 1.1 let me put it that way
[2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:04.080]  that will cover Omicron as well
[2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:07.080]  and of course
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:09.080]  we are waiting to
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:11.080]  have the final results
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:13.080]  the vaccine will be ready in March
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:15.080]  and the vaccine will be able
[2:34:15.080 --> 2:34:17.080]  to produce it massively
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:18.080]  we need to see
[2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:20.080]  if we will need it
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:21.080]  and we need to see
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.080]  if and what place
[2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:25.080]  can take
[2:34:25.080 --> 2:34:27.080]  in the overall fight against
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:28.080]  the virus
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:30.080]  particularly now that we know
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:31.080]  that mutations are coming faster
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:33.080]  but we have a treatment
[2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:35.080]  so all of that needs to be taken
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:36.080]  seriously in this direction
[2:34:36.080 --> 2:34:38.080]  but we've never had more
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:40.080]  okay so that's enough of that
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:42.080]  anybody that understands
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:44.080]  basic virology knows
[2:34:44.080 --> 2:34:46.080]  there's always mutations of viruses
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:48.080]  and now they're just introducing everybody
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:49.080]  that the common cold is bad
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:50.080]  not just COVID-19
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:51.080]  they're setting the PCR test
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:53.080]  to say the common cold is bad
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:55.080]  and saying oh it's a battle for the virus
[2:34:55.080 --> 2:34:57.080]  oh the old shots don't work
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:34:59.080]  the new one helps you
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:00.080]  and then meanwhile
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:02.080]  EU warns repeat boosters
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:03.080]  could weaken immune system
[2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:05.080]  that's the plan is
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:08.080]  erase your immune system
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:10.080]  so incredibly diabolical
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:12.080]  in fact let's play a clip from that
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:14.080]  European Medicines Agency
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:16.080]  that's their FDA
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:18.080]  which again voted last year
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:20.080]  to not inject people
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:22.080]  below the age of 12
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:23.080]  European Medicines Agency
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:25.080]  warns endless booster shots
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:27.080]  could cause immune response problems
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:29.080]  not just erase your immunity
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:31.080]  not just lower your immunity
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:33.080]  but cause ADE
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:35.080]  oh
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:37.080]  the European Equivalent of the FDA
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:38.080]  is warning that relying on
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:40.080]  endless rounds of booster shots
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:42.080]  to fight COVID-19
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:44.080]  could end up causing immune
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:45.080]  response problems
[2:35:45.080 --> 2:35:46.080]  the comments were made by
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:49.080]  Marco Caballeri
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:51.080]  of the European Medicines Agency
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:53.080]  there's an emergency discussion
[2:35:53.080 --> 2:35:55.080]  around the probability of giving
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:57.080]  a second booster dose
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:58.080]  a second booster
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:00.080]  that's the fourth shot
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:02.080]  with the same vaccines currently in use
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:04.080]  data has not yet been generated
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:05.080]  support this approach
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:06.080]  he went on to say
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:07.080]  it could cause autoimmune
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:10.080]  problems and erase your immunity
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:12.080]  and the FDA scientist
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:14.080]  and CDC scientist said that
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:16.080]  six, seven months ago in the US
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:19.080]  and they were told resign
[2:36:19.080 --> 2:36:21.080]  and the newborn members got up and said
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:24.080]  we don't know it'll hurt the kids till we try it
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:26.080]  I mean we gotta test it on them
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:28.080]  we can't do it on animals
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:30.080]  we pass laws, we can't do it to rats
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:32.080]  so we do it to your children now
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:34.080]  and that's just the cover story
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:36.080]  they know it's designed to sterilize
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:38.080]  they know it's designed to attack the immune system
[2:36:38.080 --> 2:36:41.080]  they know what the plan is
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:44.080]  and they're carrying it out
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:46.080]  you know we told you this was coming
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  because it's a UN World Program
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:50.080]  and I went and read what John Hopkins
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:52.080]  and the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundation
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:55.080]  what the CIA said a year and a half ago
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:57.080]  they said this is never going to end
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:36:58.080]  we're going to piggyback on it
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:00.080]  carbon lockdowns
[2:37:00.080 --> 2:37:01.080]  greenhouse gas lockdowns
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:02.080]  which they've now announced in India
[2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:04.080]  just did one last month
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:06.080]  in December
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:08.080]  and they said so
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:12.080]  you're not going to be able to leave your house
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:14.080]  unless you have this vaccine passport
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:16.080]  which is really the social credit score
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:18.080]  passport which has been announced by the Davos Group
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:20.080]  and so Kelly McBreen has written
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:22.080]  a powerful article
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:24.080]  on infowars.com
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:26.080]  that really needs to be seen
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:28.080]  and it's a big deal that they said
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:30.080]  they're going to start putting the unvaccinated FEMA camps
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:32.080]  that was announced
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:34.080]  that they're doing all this but this is a big deal
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:36.080]  Washington DC
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:38.080]  Vax passport
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:40.080]  mask and photo ID to leave home
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:42.080]  but no ID
[2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:44.080]  to vote
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:46.080]  I'm going to say that again
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:48.080]  in a Vax passport to leave your home
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:52.080]  you need a mask
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.080]  and a photo ID so you took all the shots
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:56.080]  but it didn't work, sorry
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:58.080]  you need a mask and a photo ID that you're up to date
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:00.080]  on the new injections they want to put in your body
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:02.080]  to leave home
[2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:04.080]  but no ID to vote
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:06.080]  yes, the murder of
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:08.080]  logic, read the full article
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:10.080]  the local announcements and everything
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:12.080]  but they show a feminist image
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:14.080]  of a woman
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:16.080]  showing how she's tough
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:18.080]  oh, women show them you're tough
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:20.080]  let Pfizer
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:22.080]  erase your ovaries
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:24.080]  and now
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:26.080]  it's all
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:28.080]  confirmed as the takeover
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:30.080]  ladies and gentlemen but here's the European
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:32.080]  Medical Agency warns
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:34.080]  endless butcher shots could cause
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  immune system response
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:38.080]  so they're covering their asses
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:40.080]  they know all this but now they're like
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:42.080]  hey, Mike, you're a little
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:44.080]  sick from this, here it is
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:46.080]  two concerns here is that
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:48.080]  if we have a strategy
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:50.080]  in which we give boosters
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:52.080]  let's say every four months
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:54.080]  approximately
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  we will end up potentially
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:58.080]  having problems with the immune response
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:00.080]  and the immune response may end up
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:02.080]  not being as good as we would like
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:04.080]  it to be so we should
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:06.080]  be careful in not
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:08.080]  overloading
[2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:10.080]  the immune system with repeated
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:12.080]  immunization and secondly
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:14.080]  of course there is
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:16.080]  the risk of fatiguing the population
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:18.080]  with the continuous
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:20.080]  administration of boosters
[2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:22.080]  but that's the plan
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:24.080]  is to collapse the civilization
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:26.080]  so imagine
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:28.080]  Ronald McDonald's house
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:30.080]  you know, I know McDonald's is part of
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:32.080]  my Monsanto and Bill Gates
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:34.080]  I used to eat at McDonald's
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:36.080]  if you put a gun to my head
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:38.080]  but people eat there
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:40.080]  last time I ate there was about 10 years ago
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:42.080]  and the hamburgers, there was a kid
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:44.080]  we're dripping with juice and we're real beef
[2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:46.080]  the stuff you eat now is basically Bill Gates
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:48.080]  and the Claw Schwab want you to eat bugs
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:50.080]  I don't know if it's made out of bugs
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:52.080]  but I'd imagine that's what it tastes like
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:54.080]  last time I was on the road starving
[2:39:54.080 --> 2:39:56.080]  ate a hamburger, started vomiting it up
[2:39:56.080 --> 2:39:58.080]  an hour later
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:00.080]  and I can eat anything
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:02.080]  I can't
[2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:04.080]  but regardless
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:06.080]  remember all these companies
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:08.080]  that said we're not going to let out a vaccinated in
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:10.080]  and all these companies saying
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:12.080]  oh, if you're not double-vaxxed or whatever
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:14.080]  you're triple-vaxxed, you can't have
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:16.080]  the liver transplant or whatever you paid for
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:18.080]  well, you'd want to talk about a sickening video
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:20.080]  here it is
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:22.080]  Ronald McDonald's house to evict unvaccinated cancer
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:24.080]  stricken child
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:26.080]  because they won't take the shot
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:28.080]  which is linked to accelerating cancers
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:30.080]  in major German studies including
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:32.080]  the type of cancer this child has
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:34.080]  here it is
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:38.080]  this is a piece of paper
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:40.080]  this is an eviction notice
[2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:42.080]  I believe
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:44.080]  to
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:46.080]  anybody older than 5 who's not vaccinated
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:48.080]  is getting evicted from Ronald McDonald's
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:50.080]  so I'm going to go talk to people at the counter
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:41:00.080]  and see if it's legit
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:02.080]  do you have like a manager here
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:04.080]  or somebody across the room?
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:06.080]  oh yeah
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  it's about
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:10.080]  the vaccine
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:12.080]  it's about this letter we got
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:14.080]  saying everybody here has to be vaccinated
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:20.080]  I'm just asking
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:22.080]  we got this last night
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:24.080]  yes
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:26.080]  it's just pretty disturbing
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:28.080]  I'm just wondering if it's legit
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:30.080]  is this saying that everybody
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:32.080]  who's not vaccinated is getting evicted?
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:34.080]  we have a grace period too
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:36.080]  which you can
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:44.080]  get your first dose
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:46.080]  but essentially as of January 17
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:48.080]  it's a poor mandate
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:50.080]  from Ronald McDonald's
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:52.080]  I just want to get this straight
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:54.080]  so by the end of the month
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:56.080]  my four-year-old boy is getting
[2:41:56.080 --> 2:41:58.080]  evicted
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:00.080]  because we don't have a vaccine
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:02.080]  parents
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:04.080]  this is
[2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:06.080]  six months old
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:08.080]  but yeah
[2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:10.080]  because we don't have the vaccine
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:12.080]  you're going to throw us on the snow
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:14.080]  in a few weeks
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:16.080]  this is
[2:42:16.080 --> 2:42:18.080]  some kind of crazy evil
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:20.080]  like I have never seen in my life
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:24.080]  the whole video is on infowars.com
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:26.080]  but his little boy
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:28.080]  has leukemia
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:30.080]  there are studies in Germany you name it
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:32.080]  that if you take a Pfizer or Moderna shot
[2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:34.080]  he just eats everything
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:36.080]  you're dead in months
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:38.080]  easily
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:40.080]  some people in weeks
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:42.080]  and it's like oh we're just following the mandate
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:44.080]  we're the liberal, we're following orders
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:46.080]  like the Nazis in Hamburg
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  and they wear the little mask forever
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:50.080]  oh I thought that made it safe
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:52.080]  but the women particularly love it
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:54.080]  they love the shroud of death they wear
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:56.080]  they love submitting to Pfizer
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:58.080]  their pimp daddy
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:00.080]  Christmas 2021

[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:32.080]  they even admit it now they're saying it's going to be a
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:34.080]  carbon tax attached to it
[2:44:34.080 --> 2:44:36.080]  they're going to track where you go and what you do
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:38.080]  and decide where you can go and what you can do
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:40.080]  that's what the lockdowns are about

[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:50.080]  but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:52.080]  we need to get back to basic human rights
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:54.080]  and promote them
[2:44:54.080 --> 2:44:56.080]  to be enslaved by this horrible technocracy
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:44:58.080]  run by the globalist
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:45:00.080]  in late August

[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:10.080]  some are born to the endless night
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:12.080]  alright listen I've already told you this
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:14.080]  you already know this
[2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:16.080]  you know I don't make this stuff up
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:18.080]  you know I just straight shoot you
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:20.080]  and God gave me the gift of really knowing how to figure stuff out
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:22.080]  and
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:24.080]  you'd have to be a moron
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:26.080]  not to see what's going down now
[2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:28.080]  and I know you guys know what's going on
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:30.080]  but this is serious, serious business
[2:48:30.080 --> 2:48:32.080]  and the republicans
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:34.080]  finally have gotten religion
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:36.080]  you know what
[2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:38.080]  this is so big
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:40.080]  I'm just going to cover it next hour
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:42.080]  because here's what happened
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:44.080]  I had Norm Pattis
[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:46.080]  who's a famous criminal and First Amendment lawyer
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:48.080]  one of the top guys in the country
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:50.080]  and he was already going to be in studio
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:52.080]  about the push for martial law
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:54.080]  and the push claiming we're already in a civil war
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:48:56.080]  and the social engineers and the big banks
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:58.080]  corporations trying to create a climate of civil war
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:00.080]  ahead of all of this
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:02.080]  to smoke screen their big great reset
[2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:04.080]  organized financial collapse
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:06.080]  and I know you all know that
[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:10.080]  and I was planning
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:12.080]  to come into the next hour
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:14.080]  with a John Bound report
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:16.080]  that is so important
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:18.080]  Biden regime prepares
[2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:20.080]  for war against Americans
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:22.080]  and I had a whole stack already today
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:24.080]  on huge developments
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:26.080]  where the justice department says
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:28.080]  yes, anyone that protest is a terrorist
[2:49:28.080 --> 2:49:30.080]  and yes, we're looking
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:32.080]  at arresting anybody that protest us
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:34.080]  so we're talking criminal
[2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:36.080]  North Korean declaration of war
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:38.080]  the documents are public
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:40.080]  I had this this morning
[2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:42.080]  and Norm Pattis was down here
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:44.080]  covering all these establishment legal cases against us
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:46.080]  and I said you got to come on about this
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:48.080]  because you're always bringing up how they're trying to start a civil war
[2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:50.080]  look at how the Department of Justice
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:52.080]  admits that yeah
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:54.080]  anybody that protests the drag queen
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:56.080]  story time is a terrorist
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:58.080]  who doesn't like forced inoculation
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:00.080]  anybody that doesn't like critical race theory
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:02.080]  so he was already coming on
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:04.080]  with this whole stack of news right here
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:06.080]  when this broke
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:14.080]  and when you know this
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:16.080]  it ties everything together
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:18.080]  that's why in June of last year
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:20.080]  they said anybody protesting lockdowns
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:22.080]  or forced inoculation is a terrorist
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:24.080]  and the CIA is going to shut off your bank accounts
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:26.080]  and come arrest you
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:28.080]  I mean that alone announcing
[2:50:28.080 --> 2:50:30.080]  in socky press conferences
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:32.080]  that the CIA is going to get us
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:34.080]  I mean the whole government should have resigned right then
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:36.080]  I mean
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:38.080]  you're talking North Korea level stuff
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:40.080]  that's what I'm telling you folks
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:42.080]  we're in it now but we're so used to life
[2:50:42.080 --> 2:50:44.080]  and Netflix is on and Yellowstone is on
[2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:48.080]  I know the people in Yellowstone
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:50.080]  I know the people
[2:50:50.080 --> 2:50:52.080]  I don't even watch it
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:54.080]  it's like my parents are like did you see Yellowstone
[2:50:54.080 --> 2:50:56.080]  I'm like did you see
[2:50:56.080 --> 2:50:58.080]  they're building FEMA camps
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:04.080]  and so
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:06.080]  that's where we are ladies and gentlemen
[2:51:06.080 --> 2:51:08.080]  is in the real world
[2:51:08.080 --> 2:51:10.080]  here
[2:51:10.080 --> 2:51:12.080]  and when Mitch McConnell
[2:51:12.080 --> 2:51:14.080]  which just happened this clip is coming up next hour
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:16.080]  just broke on inforwars.com
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:18.080]  when Mitch McConnell comes out and says
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:20.080]  we have a national crisis
[2:51:20.080 --> 2:51:22.080]  we have
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:24.080]  the federal government saying
[2:51:24.080 --> 2:51:26.080]  anybody that disagrees
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:28.080]  with big government as a terrorist
[2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:30.080]  this is dangerous
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:32.080]  people finally get it
[2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:34.080]  they're planning terror attacks imminently
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:36.080]  at any time
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:38.080]  could be this afternoon, could be a month from now
[2:51:38.080 --> 2:51:40.080]  could be 300 days from now
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:42.080]  but they're planning
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:44.080]  massive terror attacks
[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:46.080]  to blame on us very soon
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:48.080]  now you have to again
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:50.080]  be hiding under a rock to not see all the
[2:51:50.080 --> 2:51:52.080]  pre-programming and the brainwashing and all this
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:54.080]  that's not going on for no reason
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:56.080]  this is imminent
[2:51:56.080 --> 2:51:58.080]  their whole game plan
[2:51:58.080 --> 2:52:00.080]  they know they're about to lose the house and the senate
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:02.080]  they're about to lose the governorships
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:04.080]  there is a total political landslide
[2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:06.080]  of landslides
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:08.080]  political realignment of a
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:10.080]  massive level
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:12.080]  the US has not had a political realignment
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:14.080]  this big since its
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:16.080]  founding
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:18.080]  246 years ago
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:20.080]  I mean
[2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:22.080]  this is the big enchilada
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:24.080]  this is the UN
[2:52:24.080 --> 2:52:26.080]  global government
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:28.080]  cloud swab corporate takeover of America
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:30.080]  happening in the world right now
[2:52:32.080 --> 2:52:34.080]  and the branding of people that don't like it
[2:52:34.080 --> 2:52:36.080]  who just think the country auto exists
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:38.080]  or just think we shouldn't devalue the dollar
[2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:40.080]  or think we shouldn't dissolve the borders
[2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:42.080]  as terrorists
[2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:44.080]  or think that inflation is not a good idea
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:48.080]  I was reading the transcript as we came out of break
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:50.080]  and my heart started
[2:52:50.080 --> 2:52:52.080]  happily
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:54.080]  because
[2:52:54.080 --> 2:52:56.080]  I told you
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:52:58.080]  that if we can get senators
[2:52:58.080 --> 2:53:00.080]  I told you a hundred times the last six months
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:02.080]  if we can get the senators to realize
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:04.080]  the globalists are planning this coup
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:06.080]  and it isn't business as usual to keep the republican
[2:53:06.080 --> 2:53:08.080]  establishment, democrat establishment
[2:53:08.080 --> 2:53:10.080]  sharing power if they realize this is a globalist takeover
[2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:12.080]  and that they're about to have their normal
[2:53:12.080 --> 2:53:14.080]  standard thing taken over
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:16.080]  a bunch of powerful billionaires and people
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:18.080]  that aren't part of the inside clique
[2:53:18.080 --> 2:53:20.080]  but have as much power as a globalist or more
[2:53:20.080 --> 2:53:22.080]  will get off their asses and come in
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:24.080]  and will save the damn country
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:26.080]  I'm sorry
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:28.080]  I had a little bit of fun and it doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet
[2:53:28.080 --> 2:53:30.080]  but I'm having a little bit of a happy chuckle
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:32.080]  sorry
[2:53:32.080 --> 2:53:34.080]  got a little bit of supervillain in me
[2:53:34.080 --> 2:53:36.080]  profoundly profound
[2:53:36.080 --> 2:53:38.080]  profoundly profoundly
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:40.080]  unpresidential
[2:53:40.080 --> 2:53:42.080]  senator mcconnell
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:44.080]  slams biden for calling
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:46.080]  GOP domestic enemies
[2:53:46.080 --> 2:53:48.080]  he gets you're being
[2:53:48.080 --> 2:53:50.080]  branded as a party period
[2:53:50.080 --> 2:53:52.080]  the former deputy FBI director says
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:54.080]  all republicans are terrorists
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:53:56.080]  yesterday
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:53:58.080]  on television
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:00.080]  I mean when the enemy
[2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:02.080]  that's unpopular losing power
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:04.080]  that literally is run by pedophiles
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:06.080]  all over the country
[2:54:06.080 --> 2:54:08.080]  you got a bunch of blue blood republicans that are just rich guys
[2:54:08.080 --> 2:54:10.080]  and they're like sitting there going hey
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:12.080]  we work with you stop it
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:14.080]  they're like you're a terrorist we're going to arrest you
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  you're going to blow stuff up
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:18.080]  the republicans better go oh wait a minute
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:20.080]  you're planning to do that and blame us aren't you
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:22.080]  I mean a moron could figure this out
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:24.080]  so all it took
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:26.080]  was one person with courage
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:28.080]  Tucker Carlson taking
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:30.080]  Ted Cruz to the woodshed
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:32.080]  Ted Cruz coming out and exposing the FBI plot
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:34.080]  that ran
[2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:36.080]  January 6th
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:38.080]  and then the next day the domino falls
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:40.080]  and the leader of the senate the republican leader
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:42.080]  comes out and says the same thing
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:44.080]  that's leadership folks
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:46.080]  is us leading and forcing them
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:48.080]  and just flame throwing them with truth
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:50.080]  and just constant attacks
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:52.080]  forget democrats they're all bought and paid for
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:54.080]  pedophile scum
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:56.080]  but the republican blue bloods most of them aren't pedophiles
[2:54:56.080 --> 2:54:58.080]  they're just rich old guys
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:00.080]  I'm a lawyer
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:02.080]  and we're not going to sit there while you're asleep
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:04.080]  at the switch and you let these people burn the country down
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:06.080]  because you are going to be held accountable
[2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:08.080]  plus you dumbasses
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:10.080]  you old republicans don't you get
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:12.080]  the new world order is going to strain your ass up
[2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:14.080]  you just think they're going to let you
[2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:16.080]  crawl around up there like some old spider
[2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:18.080]  once they've taken over they're going to flush
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:20.080]  you down the toilet
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:22.080]  and so that's why there's a separation of powers
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:24.080]  is because the globalists
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:26.080]  just can't take over the whole bureaucracy overnight
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:28.080]  and now as the rest of bureaucracy figures out
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:30.080]  they're about to be unseated
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:32.080]  they're going to dig their little heels in
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:34.080]  and then the new world order isn't going to be able to take over
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:36.080]  thank you founding fathers again
[2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:38.080]  for the division of powers
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:55:40.080]  but let me tell you
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:42.080]  it is going down
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:44.080]  and so we're having victory with
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:46.080]  when I said the start of the show I said
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:48.080]  I'd look for some big moves in the house and senate
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:50.080]  when you have the house oversight committee
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:52.080]  release documents that
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:54.080]  a criminal group run by Fauci
[2:55:54.080 --> 2:55:56.080]  and Bill Gates created the bio weapon
[2:55:56.080 --> 2:55:58.080]  and released it
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:00.080]  I mean when I saw that today
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:02.080]  man I was like are you kidding me
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:04.080]  and I went and pulled it up and it was the same documents we had
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:08.080]  so here's the news you know
[2:56:08.080 --> 2:56:10.080]  the fight is on
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:12.080]  the war is on
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:14.080]  it's going down
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:16.080]  and everybody
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:18.080]  better be thinking about what are you going to do
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:20.080]  in the next 24 hours to first pray to God
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:22.080]  and get your soul straight
[2:56:22.080 --> 2:56:24.080]  and then to reach out and call talk radio
[2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:26.080]  call c-span
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:28.080]  call your preacher, go to your church, make this a big deal
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:30.080]  point out the revolution against the globalist revolution
[2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  is here
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:34.080]  this is our counter revolution against this horrible
[2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:36.080]  evil new world order
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:38.080]  clousswab corporate tyranny
[2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:40.080]  of inflation and collapsing borders
[2:56:40.080 --> 2:56:42.080]  and race war and pedophilia
[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:44.080]  and sexualization of children
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:46.080]  and all the mental illness of the behavioral psychologist
[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:48.080]  playing god
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:50.080]  playing army playing video games
[2:56:50.080 --> 2:56:52.080]  in the real world messing with us
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:54.080]  with the corporate media that's already destroyed itself
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:56:56.080]  by signing on to this
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:00.080]  yeah we're winning right now
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:02.080]  but barely and they're going to strike back
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:04.080]  so we should be asking how are they going to do that
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:06.080]  now greg rees has done one of those important reports
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:08.080]  ever on
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:10.080]  what mass psychosis really is
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:12.080]  defined we're going to air that next segment
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:14.080]  then we're going to come out of the break
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:16.080]  we're going to come out of the break with john bounds
[2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:18.080]  report by regime
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:20.080]  prepares for war against americans
[2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:22.080]  and then we're going to play the mitch mcconnell comments
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:24.080]  talk about this a couple segments
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:26.080]  and then we've got to cut some time out
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:28.080]  to talk about
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:30.080]  how we're under attack at info wars
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:32.080]  not for info wars we're important
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:34.080]  we need to stay on air but it's that secondary
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:36.080]  it's a war game on how they're coming
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:38.080]  after everybody else because we're the front probe
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:40.080]  we're the first probe over enemy territory
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:42.080]  we're going to tell you what weapons they've got
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:44.080]  and how to counter them straight ahead
[2:57:44.080 --> 2:57:46.080]  Christmas 2021
[2:57:46.080 --> 2:57:48.080]  is gone
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:50.080]  it's in the rearview mirror

[2:59:52.080 --> 2:59:54.080]  of the new world order
[2:59:54.080 --> 2:59:56.080]  it's alex jones
[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:06.080]  when you have a society
[3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:08.080]  that has become decoupled from each other
[3:00:08.080 --> 3:00:10.080]  and has free floating anxiety
[3:00:10.080 --> 3:00:12.080]  in a sense that things don't make sense
[3:00:12.080 --> 3:00:14.080]  we can't understand it
[3:00:14.080 --> 3:00:16.080]  and then their attention gets
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:18.080]  focused by a leader or series of events
[3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:20.080]  on one small point
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:22.080]  just like hypnosis
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:24.080]  they literally become hypnotized
[3:00:24.080 --> 3:00:26.080]  and can be led anywhere
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:28.080]  mass psychosis
[3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:30.080]  also known as group mind
[3:00:30.080 --> 3:00:32.080]  mortality
[3:00:32.080 --> 3:00:34.080]  or herd mentality
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:36.080]  before modern civilization
[3:00:36.080 --> 3:00:38.080]  we lived in herds
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:40.080]  and in order to survive in the herd
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:42.080]  we conformed to the herd
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:44.080]  this is where mass psychosis all
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:46.080]  stems from
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:48.080]  the most popular examples of explaining
[3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:50.080]  mass psychosis are typically
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:52.080]  angry mobs and violent riots
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:54.080]  but these are merely the end results
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:56.080]  mass psychosis begins
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:00:58.080]  when the individual mind
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:00.080]  starts to identify
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:02.080]  as a member of a group based on any
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:04.080]  unifying factor
[3:01:04.080 --> 3:01:06.080]  the unifying factor doesn't even need
[3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:08.080]  to make sense for many people
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:10.080]  the feeling of unity is enough
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:12.080]  our ego mind
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:14.080]  innately craves acceptance
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:16.080]  and by default will instinctively
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:18.080]  conform to whatever group it
[3:01:18.080 --> 3:01:20.080]  perceives to be the majority
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:22.080]  in order to success conform to the group
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:24.080]  the individual must
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:26.080]  put aside personal intuition
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:28.080]  and follow the guidance of the group
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:30.080]  this makes a person
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:32.080]  highly controllable
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:34.080]  and spiritually stifles the individual
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:36.080]  which causes them to crave group acceptance
[3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:38.080]  even more
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:40.080]  man's disposition for mass psychosis
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:42.080]  has been written about for millennia
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:44.080]  most notably in ancient
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:46.080]  scripture and philosophy
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:48.080]  and we all experience this
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:50.080]  as human beings whether we reflect
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:52.080]  upon it or not
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:54.080]  Plato argued that due to the nature of group
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:56.080]  mind democracy always leads
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:01:58.080]  to tyranny and subjugation
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:00.080]  his concern was the lack of good
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:02.080]  leadership and philosophized
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:04.080]  on ways of solving this
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:06.080]  in 1895
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:08.080]  Gustav Le Bon published The Crowd
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:10.080]  wherein he explains the key
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:12.080]  processes for cultivating mass psychosis
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:14.080]  anonymity
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:16.080]  contagion and suggestibility
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:18.080]  this work is known to have
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:20.080]  influenced world leaders
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:22.080]  businesses and tyrants
[3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:24.080]  of which the ethics has been
[3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:26.080]  written about for decades
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:28.080]  and yet ap and Reuters
[3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:30.080]  outrageously claim
[3:02:30.080 --> 3:02:32.080]  that mass psychosis does not exist
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:34.080]  when it is in fact
[3:02:34.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  the corporate media apparatus
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.080]  to which they belong
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:40.080]  that makes this all possible
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:42.080]  waging psychological warfare
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:44.080]  against a group of the population
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:46.080]  who believes the media would never lie to them
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:48.080]  this is why the term
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:50.080]  mass psychosis is
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:52.080]  arguably a better term than group mind
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:54.080]  or mob mentality
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:56.080]  a change in the
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:02:58.080]  field of consciousness occurs
[3:02:58.080 --> 3:03:00.080]  a devolution from divine
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:02.080]  inspiration into primitive hierarchy
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:04.080]  which has no place
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:06.080]  in a civilized society
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:08.080]  and yet here we are
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:10.080]  without mass psychosis
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  today's leaders would have
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:14.080]  no power
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:16.080]  just like advertising
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:18.080]  everything about politics
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:20.080]  is about cultivating mass psychosis
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  whereas the individual
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:24.080]  pursuit of happiness
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:26.080]  has inevitably led to beauty
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:28.080]  and innovation
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:30.080]  creating and controlling groups of people
[3:03:30.080 --> 3:03:32.080]  which has been the biggest power play on earth
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:34.080]  for all of recorded history
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:36.080]  almost always leads
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:38.080]  to death and destruction
[3:03:38.080 --> 3:03:40.080]  the science and study of mass psychosis
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:42.080]  could be used to enlighten humanity
[3:03:42.080 --> 3:03:44.080]  by educating the individual
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:46.080]  about the power and potential
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:48.080]  of the human mind
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:50.080]  but today the very same corrupt media
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:52.080]  being used by wealthy elites
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:54.080]  to divide and enslave us
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:56.080]  says there is no such thing
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:58.080]  as mass psychosis
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:04:00.080]  mass psychosis is
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:02.080]  humanity's burden to outgrow
[3:04:02.080 --> 3:04:04.080]  it is why we accept the lesser
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:06.080]  of two evils many of us
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:08.080]  are well aware of the frailty of man
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:10.080]  and the civilized world
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:12.080]  the great psychologist Carl Jung's
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:14.080]  warning to the world
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:16.080]  was that the individual must come face to face
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:18.080]  with their own shadow
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:20.080]  in order to accomplish this
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:22.080]  one must liberate themselves
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:24.080]  from the collective
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:26.080]  and until enough of us do
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:28.080]  society will continue to be led
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:30.080]  by tyrants and ignorant mobs
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:32.080]  reporting for info wars
[3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:34.080]  this is greg reese
[3:04:38.080 --> 3:04:40.080]  ladies and gentlemen
[3:04:40.080 --> 3:04:42.080]  the republican party is waking up
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:44.080]  the factor being set up for stage terror
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:46.080]  attacks and martial law
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  coming up we have a special report
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:50.080]  and then we have the republican leader
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:52.080]  waking up to this
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:05:20.080]  big victory stay with us
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:24.080]  energy berry
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:26.080]  alfalfa herb powder
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:28.080]  then it has added magnesium and potassium
[3:05:28.080 --> 3:05:30.080]  and electrolytes
[3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:32.080]  and organic cocoa bean powder
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:34.080]  with natural chocolate flavor

[3:05:48.080 --> 3:05:50.080]  what it does for your body
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:52.880]  is simply amazing, and it helps find the info war.
[3:05:52.880 --> 3:05:55.040]  This is really the best bone broth out there,

[3:05:58.560 --> 3:06:01.160]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:06:01.160 --> 3:06:04.080]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live
[3:06:04.080 --> 3:06:06.720]  from the front lines of the info war.
[3:06:12.200 --> 3:06:15.160]  It has been known since the dawn of civilization
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:19.000]  that a tyrant will always find a pretext for their tyranny.
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:20.960]  January 6th insurrection.
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:22.400]  I know right, Stan.
[3:06:22.400 --> 3:06:23.600]  I will not yield.
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:24.600]  I will not fledge.
[3:06:24.600 --> 3:06:26.480]  I will defend the right to vote.
[3:06:26.480 --> 3:06:28.480]  Our democracy against all enemies,
[3:06:28.480 --> 3:06:31.640]  foreign and yes, domestic.
[3:06:31.640 --> 3:06:35.760]  And so it goes in 2022 as an unyielding portion
[3:06:35.760 --> 3:06:38.200]  of the bureaucracy of the federal government
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:41.040]  of the United States, poisoned by visions
[3:06:41.040 --> 3:06:43.640]  of globalist totalitarian grandeur,
[3:06:43.640 --> 3:06:46.520]  fueled by the 109 year inhabitants
[3:06:46.520 --> 3:06:49.200]  of a foreign central banking cartel
[3:06:49.200 --> 3:06:52.360]  will utilize their one sided characterization
[3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:55.040]  of the staged events of January 6th
[3:06:55.040 --> 3:06:58.320]  to propel their quest for unlimited power.
[3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:00.360]  During 2020, Black Lives Matter
[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:03.080]  and Antifa riots all across the country.
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:06.160]  There were over 700 police officers injured
[3:07:06.160 --> 3:07:08.840]  by Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots.
[3:07:08.840 --> 3:07:11.160]  How many people have been charged with crimes of violence
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:13.320]  concerning those riots all across the country?
[3:07:13.320 --> 3:07:15.280]  I don't have information on how many.
[3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:17.200]  I would say, you know, hundreds of people
[3:07:17.200 --> 3:07:18.800]  have been charged as Ms. Handler.
[3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:20.800]  You would say, but you don't know.
[3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:23.960]  You know, when we asked you why the Biden Department
[3:07:23.960 --> 3:07:27.440]  of Justice has such wildly disparate standards,
[3:07:27.440 --> 3:07:30.920]  we asked you, why is it that you won't target
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:33.960]  the rioters and terrorists who fire bomb cities
[3:07:33.960 --> 3:07:35.320]  across this country?
[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:37.920]  The answer we got from the Department of Justice
[3:07:37.920 --> 3:07:39.000]  was shameful.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:42.440]  On October 22nd, you came back and said, quote,
[3:07:42.440 --> 3:07:45.680]  the department has dedicated investigative and prosecutorial
[3:07:45.680 --> 3:07:50.000]  resources, commensurate with the significance of these events.
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:52.920]  By significance, I guess it means the political benefit
[3:07:52.920 --> 3:07:54.640]  to the Biden White House.
[3:07:54.640 --> 3:07:57.560]  Whether it's unconstitutional vaccine mandates
[3:07:57.560 --> 3:08:00.960]  and lockdowns resulting from gain of function research
[3:08:00.960 --> 3:08:04.600]  engineered by the seemingly untouchable Nuremberg code
[3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:06.840]  violations of Dr. Fauci.
[3:08:06.840 --> 3:08:09.680]  Dr. Fauci, you previously told this committee under oath
[3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.440]  that NIH and NAID have never funded gain of function
[3:08:13.440 --> 3:08:16.760]  research with the EcoHealth Alliance.
[3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:19.360]  However, a report from the Department of Defense
[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:21.840]  Inspector General released yesterday
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:26.240]  states that EcoHealth Alliance opposed DARPA in 2018
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:29.440]  seeking funding to conduct gain of function research
[3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:31.840]  on bat-borne coronaviruses.
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:37.040]  This proposal named Project DEFUSE was rejected by DARPA
[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:39.520]  because the project didn't address the current research
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:44.480]  as potential to violate the gain of function moratorium.
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:46.840]  Why did you tell the committee that your agency has never
[3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:48.680]  funded gain of function research?
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:51.200]  Why did your agency award this grant,
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:53.160]  despite it being rejected by DARPA,
[3:08:53.160 --> 3:08:56.440]  due to its concerns about violating the moratorium that
[3:08:56.440 --> 3:08:57.120]  was in place?
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:08:59.560]  And finally, will you commit today
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:02.240]  to release all records fully unredacted
[3:09:02.240 --> 3:09:05.320]  by the end of this week so Congress and the American people
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:08.080]  can know the truth about NIH's role
[3:09:08.080 --> 3:09:10.760]  and the origins of COVID-19?
[3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:13.440]  You are totally incorrect.
[3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:15.000]  Well, we look forward to reviewing it.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:18.240]  What a moron.
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:21.600]  Or the current war games being played out in rural North
[3:09:21.600 --> 3:09:25.120]  Carolina, where a realistic guerrilla war will
[3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:28.440]  be fought across two dozen North Carolina counties
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:32.240]  in the coming weeks with young soldiers battling seasoned
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:34.760]  freedom fighters, according to the US Army,
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:39.200]  as the Charlotte Observer reported, known as Robin Sage.
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:42.000]  The exercises serve as a final test
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:45.760]  for special forces qualification course training.
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:48.840]  The setting is characterized by armed conflict,
[3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:51.360]  forcing the students to solve problems
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:52.960]  in a real world setting.
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:56.920]  These military members act as realistic opposing forces
[3:09:56.920 --> 3:10:00.760]  and guerrilla freedom fighters, also known as the Pine Land
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:02.120]  Resistance Movement.
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:06.200]  To add realism to the exercise, civilian volunteers
[3:10:06.200 --> 3:10:09.000]  throughout the state act as role players.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:11.560]  Participation by these volunteers
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:14.480]  is crucial to the success of this training,
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:20.160]  and past trainees attest to the realism they add to the exercise.
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:21.920]  Oh, I was seeing that woman earlier.
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:23.880]  Man, that would beat the hell out of her.
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:25.920]  We now have a federal government
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:30.200]  deeming Americans demanding a redress of their grievances
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:32.120]  as domestic terrorists.
[3:10:32.120 --> 3:10:36.480]  Meanwhile, haphazardly attempting to pose as the saviors
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:39.280]  to protect the American people and its country
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:42.680]  club of career politicians, gaming the system
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:45.400]  from an informed patriotic majority.
[3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:48.120]  When everyone knows deep down in their gut
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:50.880]  that we must inevitably save ourselves
[3:10:50.880 --> 3:10:54.520]  from the unrelenting tyranny of a republic hijacked
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:10:58.000]  by a power craze sociopathic elitist establishment
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:01.200]  drugged by institutionalized Marxism
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:03.880]  and dominated by foreign control.
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:05.240]  John Bowne reporting.
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:11.080]  That's a very important report that just went live
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:12.440]  on infowars.com.
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:14.880]  Only way it's lags and warns the American people
[3:11:14.880 --> 3:11:16.880]  of the world is if you get it and share it.
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:17.920]  It's up to you now.
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:20.880]  Biden regime prepares for war against Americans.
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:22.960]  And that's the exact topic this morning.
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:25.760]  I wanted to get famous criminal and First Amendment lawyer,
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:27.480]  Norm Pattis in studio with us.
[3:11:27.480 --> 3:11:29.480]  And I've got a ton of news on that front.
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:33.720]  The next segment I've got, the Republican leader
[3:11:33.720 --> 3:11:37.400]  of the Senate, profoundly, profoundly
[3:11:37.400 --> 3:11:39.600]  unpresidential Senator McConnell slams
[3:11:39.600 --> 3:11:42.440]  Biden for calling GOP domestic enemies.
[3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:44.520]  The former deputy director came out yesterday
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:47.800]  and said, all Republicans are basically terrorists.
[3:11:47.800 --> 3:11:50.080]  When you've got your government, I know the listeners know this,
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:52.000]  but for the general public that might be tuning in,
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:53.360]  because we live in a free country so long,
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:55.000]  people are kind of like Dodo birds.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  They're not used to a natural predator.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:11:59.480]  When you've got government saying the main enemy
[3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:03.040]  isn't the Chinese or radical Islam or the Russians,
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:05.760]  and that could be abuse too, and take our liberties.
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:08.640]  When the government says the people are our enemy
[3:12:08.640 --> 3:12:10.760]  and white people are bad, I mean,
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:14.400]  you are in a very authoritarian system.
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:16.640]  This has never happened in the US issue before.
[3:12:16.640 --> 3:12:18.400]  Norm Pattis, what do you make of this historic moment?
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:19.360]  It's scary times.
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:21.880]  I mean, I think there's a excellent book everybody should read.
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:22.760]  It's by Stephen Marsh.
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:24.160]  It's called The Next Civil War,
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:25.560]  read it on the trip down here.
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:28.400]  He's talked to generals who are war gaming,
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:30.040]  as you saw in the segment before,
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:31.560]  for potential civil dissolution.
[3:12:31.560 --> 3:12:34.440]  He's talked to political science, economists, sociologists.
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:36.440]  His view is that we've reached a point of no return
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:39.760]  in this country, that there will be either a civil war
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:41.680]  or active secession movements.
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:42.960]  Texas may succeed.
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:45.600]  It would be the 13th largest economy in the world,
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:47.360]  rather, California may succeed.
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:49.480]  The country may break into other regions.
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:52.080]  And when I'm sitting here watching reports,
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:53.680]  and I'm listening to quote unquote,
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:57.000]  my president referred to me as a domestic enemy,
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  or as an extremist.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.320]  Or when I watched the January 6th committee,
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:03.320]  refer to peaceful protests that did,
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:05.200]  in some instances, become violent.
[3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:07.680]  But when I see them referred to that glibly
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:09.120]  as domestic terrorism,
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:10.840]  I don't know where I'm living anymore, Alex.
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:13.600]  And I begin to fear a government that decides-
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:14.840]  And by the way, you're not a right winger.
[3:13:14.840 --> 3:13:16.160]  You're a classical liberal.
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:21.040]  So I'm told, I guess I'm verging to the right
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:22.720]  because I'm being forced out of my party.
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:24.360]  So people have said to me in Connecticut,
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:25.560]  what happened to you?
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:28.000]  You know, you used to represent righteous causes.
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:30.280]  Now you represent people on the wrong side of the aisle.
[3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:31.880]  I tell them, nothing happened to me.
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:32.880]  The country changed.
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:35.040]  There is no bully.
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:38.160]  There is no force as powerful and as frightening
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:39.840]  as a self-righteous bully.
[3:13:39.840 --> 3:13:42.640]  And we're becoming governed by self-righteous bullies
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:44.920]  who decide what they know what's good for us,
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:46.920]  both with respect to what we wear,
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:48.920]  how we interact,
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:50.840]  where our children can be treated for cancer.
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:52.800]  It's all your peace on the kid being evicted
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:54.400]  from the Ronald McDonald House
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:56.680]  on how we respond to systemic racism
[3:13:56.680 --> 3:13:58.680]  and what we owe to people we've never met
[3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:00.400]  on climate change, you name it.
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:02.480]  There appears to be a group of people
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:03.960]  who think they know best.
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:06.480]  You refer to them as globalists trying to seize power
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:08.720]  and cram their vision of the good down their throat.
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:10.680]  Our throat, I say, not so fast.
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:15.240]  So for me, my commitment to ordinary people remains the same.
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:16.600]  It's the enemy who's changed.
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:18.160]  And the enemy has become our government.
[3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:20.680]  The enemy has become the public health state
[3:14:20.680 --> 3:14:22.520]  that's decided that in the name of virtue,
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:23.960]  they will tell me not to live.
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:27.640]  That is not now, nor has it ever been the American way.
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:30.640]  And I shudder to think what will happen if it becomes so.
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:33.280]  Beautifully said and very sadly said, this is true.
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:35.960]  And that's the thing is this is not our government.
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:38.280]  It is criminals that have hijacked it
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:40.280]  who are now waging war against us.
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:42.360]  But you're right, technically it's the government,
[3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:44.680]  but it's criminals in the positions of government
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:46.440]  who want to use the Civil War.
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:47.640]  They're triggering, they now admit
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:49.000]  that's their new plan.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:51.240]  It's been their plan all along
[3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:54.720]  to bypass our peaceful political realignment
[3:14:54.720 --> 3:14:57.160]  and our new populism, the new Americanism.
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:14:59.720]  It's really the old Americanism bringing us back together.
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:02.000]  This is the globalist trying to short-circuit that
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.560]  with a violent revolution and we must stop it.
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:07.760]  Well, I was on the phone just moments before I got on the air
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:10.760]  here with you with the lead counsel for the committee,
[3:15:10.760 --> 3:15:12.240]  the January 6th committee.
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:13.320]  There are more people that.
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:14.480]  Oh, I didn't know that, wow.
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:17.800]  Well, it's unrelated to you, but we'll talk about it later.
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:21.000]  And that committee is missing the point.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:24.560]  This is not about domestic terrorism or extremism.
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:27.080]  This is about frustrated people going to the Capitol
[3:15:27.080 --> 3:15:28.760]  because whether rightly or wrongly,
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:30.760]  they believed the election was stolen.
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:32.000]  Some of them got out of hand
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:33.600]  and some of them did break the law.
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:35.920]  But the overwhelming majority of people
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:39.080]  wanted and craved what the American people always have.
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:41.200]  A sense of personal significance.
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:42.920]  They protested, they gathered.
[3:15:42.920 --> 3:15:46.400]  And now in increasing waves, they're being arrested.
[3:15:46.400 --> 3:15:48.040]  We're held in solitary confinement.
[3:15:48.040 --> 3:15:50.560]  Let's talk about the January 6th committee
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:52.080]  because that ties into all of this.
[3:15:52.080 --> 3:15:54.280]  And Mitch McConnell's statement, stay with us.
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:15:59.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air.
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:02.280]  We'll continue to bring you the band guests.
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:04.840]  We'll continue to bring the information
[3:16:04.840 --> 3:16:06.120]  that no one else will touch.
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:06.960]  Keep us on air.
[3:16:06.960 --> 3:16:08.200]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[3:16:08.200 --> 3:16:09.560]  The new supplements that we have,
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:12.320]  the latest in the Infowars Life Supplement line,
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:14.880]  the vitamin D3 with calcium gummies,
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:17.520]  the vitamin C with zinc and the whole food multivitamins,
[3:16:17.520 --> 3:16:20.760]  or if you buy the Combo Pack with all three
[3:16:20.760 --> 3:16:21.720]  at infowarsstore.com.
[3:16:21.720 --> 3:16:25.240]  And you know, I'm telling you, the vitamin D gummies,
[3:16:25.240 --> 3:16:27.040]  this is a great thing for your kids.
[3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:27.880]  They're gonna love it.
[3:16:27.880 --> 3:16:29.400]  They're gonna love the taste of the gummies.
[3:16:29.400 --> 3:16:30.800]  It's healthy.
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:32.360]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:33.920]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[3:16:33.920 --> 3:16:36.040]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:38.720]  Calcium good for them, the vitamin D.
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:41.760]  So that's at infowarsstore.com.
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:42.920]  And again, it's your support there
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:44.400]  that keeps us on the air.
[3:16:44.400 --> 3:16:47.320]  So the supplements, the shirts, the air filters,
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:49.720]  the water filters, the emergency food supplies,
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:52.640]  the emergency supplies at infowarsstore.com.
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:54.280]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:56.000]  We cannot thank you enough.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:00.080]  Three very important life-saving words,
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:03.920]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids,
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:07.760]  and you find them all in vitamin, mineral, fusion.
[3:17:07.760 --> 3:17:10.080]  All the essential vitamins,
[3:17:10.080 --> 3:17:12.960]  all the essential minerals from really good,
[3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:15.120]  high-quality, absorbable sources,
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:19.200]  and a bunch of key compounds, amino acids,
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:21.760]  known to help get the nutrients
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:23.720]  into your tissues, into your cells.
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:25.200]  And despite the fact that the product
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:27.000]  is gonna sell out the next week or so,
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  we're gonna keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days.
[3:17:32.760 --> 3:17:34.560]  So again, I am cutting this announcement
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:38.160]  on the afternoon of January 6th, 2022.
[3:17:38.160 --> 3:17:39.520]  We're gonna run this for a week,
[3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:42.400]  and then we are going to be selling out of this product,
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:44.800]  hopefully more comes in in the next month or so,
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:45.960]  because it's a best-seller,
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:47.000]  and it's something everybody needs
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:48.800]  for their immune system and their body.

[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:05.320]  After years of being off the shelves,
[3:18:05.320 --> 3:18:07.360]  we're bringing back one of the biggest fan-favorite
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:09.640]  formulas ever, and it's now been reformulated
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:13.440]  as even stronger, its ultimate bone broth plus.
[3:18:13.440 --> 3:18:17.040]  It's got concentrated, high-quality chicken broth protein,
[3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:18.640]  turmeric root that's so amazing,
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:20.400]  chaga mushroom, bee pollen,
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:22.720]  goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:26.120]  then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:29.280]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder
[3:18:29.280 --> 3:18:32.680]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[3:18:32.680 --> 3:18:34.560]  It even tastes better than the last formula,
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:37.320]  and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:41.160]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein,
[3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:44.480]  isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:46.640]  You're gonna love this, and what it does for your joints,
[3:18:46.640 --> 3:18:47.880]  what it does for your body,
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:49.920]  what it does for your bones is simply amazing,
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:51.480]  and it helps find the InfoWare.
[3:18:51.480 --> 3:18:53.640]  This is really the best bone broth out there,
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:55.960]  so get yours at infowarsstore.com today.
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:00.600]  In late August, InfoWare saw an explosion of orders,
[3:19:00.600 --> 3:19:02.800]  because our audience understands
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:05.960]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[3:19:05.960 --> 3:19:08.280]  by design and are attempting to cause
[3:19:08.280 --> 3:19:12.200]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:19:12.200 --> 3:19:13.040]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:19:13.040 --> 3:19:14.760]  storable food has always been something
[3:19:14.760 --> 3:19:15.840]  that's important to have.
[3:19:15.840 --> 3:19:17.800]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have,
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:20.760]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:19:20.760 --> 3:19:23.200]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:24.640]  But now, more than ever,
[3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:26.560]  you need to get your storable food orders in.
[3:19:26.560 --> 3:19:28.360]  Now, we're ready to ship to you
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:29.960]  within 24 hours of your order.
[3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:32.320]  It's high-quality, it's very, very low-cost
[3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:35.440]  at infowarsstore.com, because in the future,
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:37.720]  you're gonna see more food supply shortages,
[3:19:37.720 --> 3:19:39.200]  and you're gonna see food supply
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:41.360]  price increases that are already taking place.
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:44.320]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price,
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:47.560]  and fund the InfoWare at infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:47.560 --> 3:19:49.440]  That's how you fight the great reset,
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:52.320]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:19:52.320 --> 3:19:55.160]  So get prepared now at infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:57.360 --> 3:20:00.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:07.680]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.680 --> 3:20:14.600]  So, we have a multinational corporate consortium
[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:16.680]  that created quadrillions of fake currency,
[3:20:16.680 --> 3:20:19.640]  taking over the world, and they need to distract us
[3:20:19.640 --> 3:20:22.800]  while they do that and inflate our currency
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:25.400]  to impoverish us and control us.
[3:20:25.400 --> 3:20:28.240]  And so, they've been hyping up racial division,
[3:20:28.240 --> 3:20:31.760]  sexual division, regional division to implode the nation.
[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:34.000]  It's the same program they've used all over the world.
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:36.040]  This is modern warfare taking place.
[3:20:36.040 --> 3:20:37.040]  Here's some of the headlines.
[3:20:37.040 --> 3:20:39.240]  Imagine another American Civil War,
[3:20:39.240 --> 3:20:45.520]  but this time, in every state, says NPR.
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:47.760]  Unconventional warfare exercise being staged
[3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:49.360]  by the Army in North Carolina.
[3:20:49.360 --> 3:20:51.200]  Yeah, they always do it, but this time,
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:56.000]  they're fighting the American resistance in the drill.
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:20:59.960]  77% of Americans say our society and culture
[3:20:59.960 --> 3:21:01.080]  is in a state of decay.
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:05.360]  Yeah, I guess 23% are idiots.
[3:21:05.360 --> 3:21:10.520]  We are in a new civil war about what exactly, says Politico.
[3:21:10.520 --> 3:21:13.600]  Is the US really heading for a second civil war, the Guardian?
[3:21:13.600 --> 3:21:15.200]  And then articles from years ago,
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:18.000]  those are new articles this week, a short history of Alex
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:21.560]  Jones claiming the left is about to start another civil war.
[3:21:21.560 --> 3:21:23.440]  Civil war posed by a right-wing radio host
[3:21:23.440 --> 3:21:26.080]  roundly mocked by Twitter, because, see,
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:27.840]  their own leftist ground level stuff
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:31.000]  was all civil war, war, kill the white people, all this crap.
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:32.480]  And I'm like, hey, they're doing this.
[3:21:32.480 --> 3:21:34.400]  I give examples, but they never quote those.
[3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:36.160]  They just say, I made it up.
[3:21:36.160 --> 3:21:38.680]  But now, all those attacks didn't age too well.
[3:21:38.680 --> 3:21:41.000]  Norm Paz, constitutional lawyer, riding a shotgun
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:43.160]  with a season warning of this for years.
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:45.840]  But right now, let's go to Mitch McConnell, the Republican
[3:21:45.840 --> 3:21:50.760]  leader in the Senate, talking about this battle
[3:21:50.760 --> 3:21:53.120]  line that's being drawn.
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:57.040]  Yesterday, that very same man delivered
[3:21:57.040 --> 3:22:02.000]  a deliberately divisive speech that
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:07.400]  was designed to pull our country further apart.
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:09.040]  12 months ago, this president said
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:11.280]  we should see each other not as adversaries,
[3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:13.720]  but as neighbors.
[3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:19.840]  Yesterday, he called millions of Americans
[3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:23.120]  his domestic enemies.
[3:22:23.120 --> 3:22:25.240]  12 months ago, the president called on Americans
[3:22:25.240 --> 3:22:32.360]  to join forces, stop the shouting, lower the temperature.
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:37.240]  But yesterday, he shouted that if you disagree with him,
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:39.400]  you're George Wallace.
[3:22:39.400 --> 3:22:42.440]  George Wallace.
[3:22:42.440 --> 3:22:45.120]  If you don't pass the laws he wants, you're Bull Connor.
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:51.840]  And if you oppose giving Democrats untrammeled one-party
[3:22:51.840 --> 3:22:57.840]  control of the country, well, you're Jefferson Davis.
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:22:59.600]  12 months ago, this president said
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:05.840]  disagreement must not lead to disunion.
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:08.160]  But yesterday, he invoked a bloody disunion
[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:13.800]  of the Civil War, the Civil War, to demonize Americans
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:16.320]  who disagree with him.
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:19.400]  He compared, listen to this, a bipartisan majority
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:23.240]  of senators to literal traitors.
[3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:34.240]  How profoundly, profoundly, unprecedented.
[3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:39.360]  Look, I've known, liked, and personally respected Joe
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:43.000]  Biden for many years.
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:50.920]  I did not recognize the man at the podium yesterday.
[3:23:50.920 --> 3:23:55.000]  And that's because he is in dementia
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:57.240]  and being controlled by a very sick, evil group that
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:23:58.640]  wants the US to go down.
[3:23:58.640 --> 3:24:00.720]  We don't want a Civil War.
[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:02.040]  The Democrats start a war.
[3:24:02.040 --> 3:24:02.720]  They don't win.
[3:24:02.720 --> 3:24:03.720]  Republicans start a war.
[3:24:03.720 --> 3:24:04.760]  They don't win.
[3:24:04.760 --> 3:24:07.160]  Not fighting it is the winning move.
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:08.800]  Remember the movie in 1983?
[3:24:08.800 --> 3:24:11.000]  Great movie, War Games.
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:15.040]  The only winning move is not to play.
[3:24:15.040 --> 3:24:16.680]  A strange game.
[3:24:16.680 --> 3:24:18.840]  The only way to win is not to play.
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:20.520]  This is how they take down the US.
[3:24:20.520 --> 3:24:22.000]  This is their preparation.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:23.600]  George Soros, the globalist.
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:26.440]  And on the ashes of it, they take full control of America.
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:28.720]  And now America is an authoritarian state.
[3:24:28.720 --> 3:24:30.040]  And my god, what a nightmare.
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:33.000]  I mean, we're living in history right now with Joe Biden
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:34.840]  invoking the Civil War and saying,
[3:24:34.840 --> 3:24:36.560]  if you don't promote open borders and forced
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:40.040]  inoculations and $5 trillion spending bills,
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:43.520]  you are the leader of the Confederacy.
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:47.200]  95% of people don't even know who Jefferson Davis is.
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:50.120]  He might as well be talking about Plato or Aristotle
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.640]  or the Easter Bunny.
[3:24:52.640 --> 3:24:54.240]  I mean, this is crazy.
[3:24:54.240 --> 3:24:56.080]  It is terrifying.
[3:24:56.080 --> 3:24:57.080]  It is crazy.
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:24:57.840]  It's beyond that.
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:24:59.240]  It's terrifying.
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:00.840]  There was a point in this country
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:03.320]  where the marketplace of ideas was where we went.
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:05.560]  We discussed our common vision of ourselves.
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:07.000]  And we either came to an agreement
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:09.160]  or we agreed to disagree.
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:11.280]  But agreed to live together.
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:14.000]  The American consensus has broken down.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.240]  I see less than you do in the world, Alex.
[3:25:16.240 --> 3:25:19.160]  I don't have the opportunity to study it as closely as you.
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:21.600]  I see different causes than a global elite.
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:23.920]  Maybe the global elite are taking advantage of this.
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:25.680]  Oh, no, they're manipulating real things.
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:27.800]  There's a cultural rot going on.
[3:25:27.800 --> 3:25:29.800]  I mean, we have spent the moral capital.
[3:25:29.800 --> 3:25:31.680]  It took centuries, if not millennia,
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:33.560]  of intellectual tradition to spend down.
[3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:34.920]  And we've now come at a point where
[3:25:34.920 --> 3:25:37.320]  we can't tell who should use which restroom.
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:39.840]  And we let men pretend to be women and compete in women's
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:42.560]  sports and say that that's what equal protection of the law
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:43.560]  deserves.
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:45.800]  And it is sabotaging us, because we don't have
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:47.760]  a consensus on values anymore.
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:50.080]  I don't know what's, and listen carefully to you say,
[3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:51.880]  the only way to win is not to play.
[3:25:51.880 --> 3:25:55.240]  I suppose, although I'm afraid and I'm concerned.
[3:25:55.240 --> 3:25:58.320]  Well, when I say play, burning down police stations
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:00.360]  is how the left does it.
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:00.760]  No, no.
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:03.000]  We're going to intellectually not support the system
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:06.400]  and say no to it and awaken to the globalist program.
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:07.200]  That's how we win.
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:09.680]  Well, we have to fight if they come for us, which
[3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:11.920]  you're trying to trick law enforcement into,
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:13.160]  then I'll have to defend myself.
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:16.680]  But every person we've got to physically fight is a failure.
[3:26:16.680 --> 3:26:17.480]  I think that's right.
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:21.120]  I also think one way to win this war is with handshakes,
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:22.320]  is the handshake economy.
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:25.360]  Reach across the aisle to the stranger who helped you,
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:26.920]  or who provides a service that you need.
[3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:28.080]  And that's why they promote COVID to metaphysically
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:29.160]  say, don't shake hands.
[3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:30.840]  That's an excellent point, because we're now
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:32.600]  afraid of one another in public places.
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:34.280]  I'm here in Austin visiting.
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:36.080]  I'm walking down the street the other day.
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:37.480]  And people are wearing masks.
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:39.200]  And I'm like, what did I do?
[3:26:39.200 --> 3:26:40.560]  I'm not sneezing at you.
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:41.680]  I'm not breathing.
[3:26:41.680 --> 3:26:42.680]  You are my neighbor.
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:43.800]  You are my fellow country.
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:45.240]  And they supposedly took their shot.
[3:26:45.240 --> 3:26:47.320]  But oh, notice, it didn't work, did it?
[3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:48.200]  Apparently not.
[3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:50.400]  And does this crisis ever end?
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:53.000]  I saw a hopeful headline in the paper this morning
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:54.960]  that European countries are beginning to wonder
[3:26:54.960 --> 3:26:56.880]  whether COVID should be treated like the flu.
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:26:59.280]  In other words, if there is an illness out there,
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:02.800]  can we respond to it by normal means, or do we have to explain?
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:03.800]  Well, Norm, that's it.
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:04.600]  Here's the deal.
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:07.040]  The authoritarians will push this as far as they can.
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:07.880]  They planned it all out.
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:09.440]  It's pre-planned some record.
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:12.680]  But when we reject them and put pressure on Klaus Schwab
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:15.280]  and pressure on Bill Gates, this is going to stop.
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:15.920]  You think so?
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:17.720]  Do you think it's or has it come too far?
[3:27:17.720 --> 3:27:20.200]  I mean, I saw your clip about military men
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:22.440]  that looked like they were standing outside of Info Wars
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:23.200]  ready to break down.
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:25.680]  That was a common location in the United States,
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:28.480]  a building that any of us could enter to go to work at any point.
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:30.360]  Are you telling me my tax dollars are
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:33.360]  being used to train military officers to shoot me down
[3:27:33.360 --> 3:27:36.440]  if I resist when I go into work because I'm not wearing a mask?
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:39.280]  Are you actually telling me that my four-year-old child,
[3:27:39.280 --> 3:27:40.680]  as I saw in the McDonald's video,
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:42.960]  is going to be evicted from cancer treatment
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:45.000]  because they're not vaccinated?
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:46.520]  Who are these people?
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:48.480]  This is not my country.
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:49.120]  This is not.
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:51.240]  And I want to find a way to take it back.
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:54.200]  I think we have to do it one election, one handshake at a time.
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:56.480]  I hope things don't become violent.
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:27:58.000]  But I worry about it, Alex.
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:27:59.520]  I think people are frustrated.
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:02.000]  And when Congress deliberately misreads
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:05.560]  the January 6th event to call it an act of domestic terrorism
[3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:08.480]  and ignores the burning cities of the summer before,
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:11.280]  I feel as though I'm being told, you're not welcome here.
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:12.000]  Go live in the woods.
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:12.480]  No, I agree.
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:14.640]  And I look at all those young men going through special forces
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:16.320]  training.
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:18.280]  If they march them out to confiscate our guns,
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:19.720]  it'll be very sad what happens to them
[3:28:19.720 --> 3:28:22.040]  and another victory for evil, where we kill each other.
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:25.600]  And I just hope and pray there are people inside the military
[3:28:25.600 --> 3:28:27.560]  who haven't been purged, who will understand this,
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:31.480]  because it's not going to be waiting for people in meeting them
[3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:33.920]  inside warehouses to fight the troops.
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:35.880]  People are going to come to their houses,
[3:28:35.880 --> 3:28:37.840]  and they're going to catch them in the grocery stores
[3:28:37.840 --> 3:28:38.800]  and at the banks.
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:39.920]  That's what's going to happen.
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:41.560]  And the military knows they'll be wiped out
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:42.960]  and to fight with the American people.
[3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:43.920]  We don't want to do that.
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:45.400]  The military is not our enemy.
[3:28:45.400 --> 3:28:47.520]  But they need to get their head ready for what's
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:48.480]  about to go down.
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:49.600]  Moron Patis, stay with us.
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:50.600]  We'll come right back.
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:28:59.160]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon
[3:28:59.160 --> 3:29:03.440]  of January 6, 2022, and that means there are only seven days
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:06.720]  left of us being able to offer our best-selling product,
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:11.040]  vitamin mineral fusion, at 50% off.
[3:29:11.040 --> 3:29:13.840]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals, incredible amino
[3:29:13.840 --> 3:29:14.800]  acids.
[3:29:14.800 --> 3:29:17.280]  It is a game changer for your immune system
[3:29:17.280 --> 3:29:20.720]  and every other function in your body, and it's a must-have.
[3:29:20.720 --> 3:29:23.560]  That's why, despite the fact that it's selling out
[3:29:23.560 --> 3:29:25.400]  at current sales rates, we're going
[3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:29.680]  to keep it on sale for another seven days.
[3:29:29.680 --> 3:29:32.880]  So we're running this until next Thursday.
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:35.000]  And your purchase supports the broadcast.
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:37.920]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars.
[3:29:37.920 --> 3:29:39.600]  Without you, we would not have been on air,
[3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:42.440]  and the world would be a much worse position right now
[3:29:42.440 --> 3:29:43.400]  than it's in.
[3:29:43.400 --> 3:29:45.520]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars,
[3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:48.120]  we have now become the number one beacon of truth,
[3:29:48.120 --> 3:29:50.760]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[3:29:50.760 --> 3:29:53.400]  So support your immune system and support free speech
[3:29:53.400 --> 3:29:54.920]  in the fight for liberty at the same time.
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:29:55.880]  At InfoWars.com.
[3:29:58.280 --> 3:30:00.440]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:30:00.440 --> 3:30:02.320]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it
[3:30:02.320 --> 3:30:05.000]  from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:07.280]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[3:30:07.280 --> 3:30:11.000]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:12.320]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:14.360]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:16.200]  that the media calls communists, but really,
[3:30:16.200 --> 3:30:17.080]  they're just a commune.
[3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:19.360]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee,
[3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:20.120]  and we've got it.
[3:30:20.120 --> 3:30:22.320]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:24.120]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[3:30:24.120 --> 3:30:25.720]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[3:30:25.720 --> 3:30:26.840]  and the price has never gone up.
[3:30:26.840 --> 3:30:28.920]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:31.000]  for about 50% more, per pound,
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:32.560]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[3:30:32.560 --> 3:30:33.640]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[3:30:33.640 --> 3:30:35.520]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend,
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:38.040]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:40.240]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[3:30:42.760 --> 3:30:45.160]  Yeah, I'd like to, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[3:30:45.160 --> 3:30:48.040]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com,
[3:30:48.040 --> 3:30:49.720]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:30:49.720 --> 3:30:54.720]  And if you don't find us and don't want to steer, that's fine.
[3:30:55.960 --> 3:30:58.480]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients
[3:30:58.480 --> 3:31:00.160]  we put in infowar's live products,
[3:31:00.160 --> 3:31:01.720]  and that's why for more than two years,
[3:31:01.720 --> 3:31:03.680]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth,
[3:31:03.680 --> 3:31:07.280]  and we could never get the ingredients again until now,
[3:31:07.280 --> 3:31:09.520]  and we have reformulated and not just used
[3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:11.560]  the same ingredients, we've boosted it
[3:31:11.560 --> 3:31:13.360]  and made them even stronger.
[3:31:13.360 --> 3:31:15.200]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:17.200]  I'm telling you, this is next level.
[3:31:17.200 --> 3:31:18.400]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[3:31:18.400 --> 3:31:21.440]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:23.560]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:31:23.560 --> 3:31:25.640]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[3:31:25.640 --> 3:31:28.480]  bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:31.160]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries
[3:31:31.160 --> 3:31:33.040]  that turbo charge your body with antioxidants,
[3:31:33.040 --> 3:31:34.680]  and then it's got a bunch of other incredible things
[3:31:34.680 --> 3:31:37.240]  like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[3:31:37.240 --> 3:31:38.640]  I mean, this sucker has got everything
[3:31:38.640 --> 3:31:39.680]  for your electrolytes.
[3:31:39.680 --> 3:31:42.200]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[3:31:42.200 --> 3:31:45.080]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt,
[3:31:45.080 --> 3:31:46.400]  and it just goes on and on.
[3:31:46.400 --> 3:31:47.600]  It is now back in stock.
[3:31:47.600 --> 3:31:49.680]  Ultimate bone broth plus,
[3:31:49.680 --> 3:31:52.040]  available at 20% off and free shipping
[3:31:52.040 --> 3:31:55.040]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:55.880 --> 3:31:58.680]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[3:31:58.680 --> 3:32:00.760]  has only been the build up
[3:32:00.760 --> 3:32:03.120]  for what the globalists are doing right now.
[3:32:03.120 --> 3:32:06.320]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover,
[3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:08.320]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[3:32:08.320 --> 3:32:10.280]  because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:32:10.280 --> 3:32:11.440]  Now they're a world government,
[3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:12.880]  they're permanent martial law,
[3:32:12.880 --> 3:32:15.280]  their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:17.840]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed,
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:20.480]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions
[3:32:20.480 --> 3:32:21.920]  to go across the planet
[3:32:21.920 --> 3:32:24.080]  and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:25.600]  So listen, Paul Revere's,
[3:32:25.600 --> 3:32:27.120]  when you spread the word about the broadcast,
[3:32:27.120 --> 3:32:29.560]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear,
[3:32:29.560 --> 3:32:32.120]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[3:32:32.120 --> 3:32:33.240]  you keep us on air.
[3:32:33.240 --> 3:32:35.080]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out
[3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:36.880]  for months that are back in stock,
[3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:40.280]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[3:32:40.280 --> 3:32:42.400]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers,
[3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:43.840]  they are so good for your body,
[3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:45.960]  and if there's two things you do for your body,
[3:32:45.960 --> 3:32:47.160]  it's these two products.
[3:32:47.160 --> 3:32:49.640]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com,
[3:32:49.640 --> 3:32:51.680]  50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[3:32:51.680 --> 3:32:54.040]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[3:32:57.520 --> 3:33:00.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:33:00.320 --> 3:33:03.920]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:09.160 --> 3:33:12.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[3:33:12.320 --> 3:33:14.920]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:16.520 --> 3:33:20.040]  I hear people talking bad about the way
[3:33:20.040 --> 3:33:23.160]  we have to live here in this country.
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:25.080]  Harping on the wars we fight.
[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:27.200]  Harping on the wars we fight,
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:31.120]  griping about the way things are being.
[3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:34.680]  Well Norm, I know there's not a lot we're gonna get into
[3:33:34.680 --> 3:33:36.440]  at this point, it just gives the other side to anything,
[3:33:36.440 --> 3:33:41.440]  but you talk about lawfare, you talk about corruption,
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:46.440]  you talk about weaponization of the legal system.
[3:33:47.280 --> 3:33:49.440]  We are right dead smack in the middle of it,
[3:33:49.440 --> 3:33:53.680]  so you're down here working on the Democratic Party
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:55.600]  run lawsuits that they admit are attempts
[3:33:55.600 --> 3:33:57.520]  to shut down operation.
[3:33:57.520 --> 3:33:59.280]  You were just telling me off air,
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:01.040]  that it's unprecedented what you've seen,
[3:34:01.040 --> 3:34:03.000]  and if I get my work done today,
[3:34:04.480 --> 3:34:07.320]  it's bigger than info wars, we're gonna release tomorrow
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:10.640]  some of the behind the scenes stuff that's been going on
[3:34:10.640 --> 3:34:12.800]  with their attempts to take the show off the air,
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:14.640]  because that's the mission.
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:18.840]  But again, I don't take that as oh poor me,
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:21.760]  we're in a war, I expect them to be doing this,
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:24.520]  but what's crazy is they actually say,
[3:34:25.880 --> 3:34:29.120]  we want total unconditional surrender.
[3:34:31.800 --> 3:34:34.840]  And then they know they work for the establishment,
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:36.760]  they know they work for the power structure,
[3:34:36.760 --> 3:34:38.720]  they know they work for the group's taking over,
[3:34:38.720 --> 3:34:41.080]  and they sit there and giggle and laugh and act like
[3:34:41.080 --> 3:34:42.680]  they're fighting the establishment,
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:44.920]  and they're the underdogs, they're the little guys,
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:46.440]  but when you go out and look at the sponsors
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:49.240]  of all the leftist shows, it is the establishment,
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:52.440]  so we're witnessing history here,
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:55.280]  and I can look at the left and their takeover of the world,
[3:34:55.280 --> 3:34:56.960]  there's gonna be a backlash, it's already here,
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:34:58.520]  it's not gonna go well for them,
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:02.400]  clearly there's multinational forces manipulating them
[3:35:02.400 --> 3:35:03.760]  to do their dirty work,
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:06.640]  I don't think the average leftist realizes
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:07.880]  what they've signed onto norms,
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:09.000]  so there's so much to talk about,
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:10.720]  I don't wanna get into specifics here,
[3:35:10.720 --> 3:35:13.400]  but what do you make of the persecution
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:16.120]  in all your years as a lawyer that you've seen of Info Wars,
[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:17.800]  because we're not being victims here,
[3:35:17.800 --> 3:35:21.440]  we want people to know the flavor of what's coming for you,
[3:35:21.440 --> 3:35:23.480]  because what they do to Info Wars,
[3:35:23.480 --> 3:35:25.240]  they do to everybody the next year.
[3:35:25.240 --> 3:35:27.560]  Yeah, Info Wars is an easy target right now,
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:29.640]  there were some comments made many years ago,
[3:35:29.640 --> 3:35:33.920]  a decade or so ago about us shooting in Newtown, Connecticut,
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:36.080]  and these have been held out to the world at large,
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:39.120]  is what this entity, what you, what Info Wars,
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:40.160]  what all the folks here stand for.
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:41.840]  And they've republished it over and over again,
[3:35:41.840 --> 3:35:42.680]  saying we're saying.
[3:35:42.680 --> 3:35:44.920]  It couldn't be further from the truth,
[3:35:44.920 --> 3:35:47.240]  the truth is that you're onto something here,
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:48.560]  and that's why people listen to you,
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:50.920]  there is a legitimacy crisis in the United States,
[3:35:50.920 --> 3:35:52.240]  people are looking for answers,
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:54.320]  you're giving answers, you're naming names,
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:35:57.400]  whether rightly or wrongly, that's your right to do so.
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:36:00.760]  People who oppose what you're saying wanna shut you down,
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:03.160]  and they've seized on litigation as a pretext,
[3:36:03.160 --> 3:36:07.320]  and you cannot get objective actual reporting
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:08.320]  in the press at all.
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:11.400]  There was an amazing story last week that suggested
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:13.600]  that this place is rolling in more money
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:16.120]  than King Croich's had at his most solvent,
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:17.800]  and the story said that somehow,
[3:36:17.800 --> 3:36:20.760]  and it suggested that on dates that you ran
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:23.760]  Sandy Hook stories, you actually profited more.
[3:36:23.760 --> 3:36:25.400]  The truth is the opposite,
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:28.000]  and no one bothered to study the data,
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.280]  they bought the narrative, they went on the attack,
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:31.680]  and they sought to drive a wedge
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:33.240]  between you and your listeners.
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:36.360]  Listen folks, there is a real war going on.
[3:36:36.360 --> 3:36:38.880]  If you read a story last week in the Huffington Post,
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:41.480]  it was reported that on November 18th of a certain year,
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:45.400]  Info Wars actually had sales of $105,000
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:46.840]  in its related products.
[3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:48.600]  They never gave you what the costs were
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:51.720]  to produce those items, what the cost was for the overhead,
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:54.560]  what it cost legal fees to keep this place alive
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:55.880]  in the face of a concerted effort to take them.
[3:36:55.880 --> 3:36:56.960]  More of the Google ads, we're talking about.
[3:36:56.960 --> 3:36:59.480]  And what's more, the average sales for the day
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:02.800]  that they reported those product sales
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:04.400]  were actually less.
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:06.680]  And so Huffington Post is reporting,
[3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:08.280]  oh, look at all the money he made.
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:10.440]  No, he lost money that day.
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:14.480]  What reporter is going to sit down, study the data,
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:17.440]  and ask the hard questions in this case?
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:19.360]  Who is funding the litigation?
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:20.920]  Why are they funding it?
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:22.440]  What is their objective?
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:25.760]  And why is it that the plaintiff seemed hell bent
[3:37:25.760 --> 3:37:28.560]  to avoid having these cases tried on the merits
[3:37:28.560 --> 3:37:31.400]  and have them won instead on the basis of default judgments?
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:32.840]  Well, that's what really wakes people up.
[3:37:32.840 --> 3:37:34.920]  Jones never gave one document.
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:36.440]  I've been deposed over and over again.
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:37.480]  They have all my bank.
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:39.080]  You've never seen this many documents handed over
[3:37:39.080 --> 3:37:40.160]  to cases like this.
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:41.200]  I haven't had many.
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:42.520]  I haven't had a case quite like this,
[3:37:42.520 --> 3:37:44.360]  but I mean, I have personally handed over
[3:37:44.360 --> 3:37:46.080]  tens of thousands of documents.
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:48.240]  And they're like, he gave us nothing but less like,
[3:37:48.240 --> 3:37:49.680]  well, we do believe in juries,
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:51.320]  but he doesn't get a trial
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:52.960]  because he didn't respond to the court.
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:54.320]  Total lie.
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:56.000]  I issued the following challenge
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:57.600]  to the plaintiff suing you.
[3:37:57.600 --> 3:38:00.880]  Let a jury decide all of this case.
[3:38:00.880 --> 3:38:02.760]  Let a jury decide liability.
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:05.680]  Let a jury decide damages if there are any,
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:08.480]  but give Alex Jones a full and fair opportunity.
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:10.440]  Well, imagine the jury.
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:12.560]  Like, hey, you always thought juries decided
[3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:14.520]  whether somebody was guilty and then what they owed.
[3:38:14.520 --> 3:38:16.560]  No, you're told he's guilty,
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:18.520]  not until he's proven innocent.
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:19.960]  He's guilty, period.
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:22.000]  Well, the courts have reached judgments
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:23.920]  and that's why there are appeals.
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:26.000]  And obviously this fight will go on.
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.560]  We feel strongly that your rights were violated.
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:29.400]  But explain what happened.
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:30.400]  They wanted me to give them
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:32.480]  Sandy Hook marketing that doesn't exist.
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:35.080]  Like, I don't sit here and market stories I talk about.
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:37.840]  So because that, because they said, give me this,
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:39.720]  and because it doesn't exist, I can't give it to them.
[3:38:39.720 --> 3:38:41.760]  You're being punished for not being the company
[3:38:41.760 --> 3:38:43.400]  they wish you were.
[3:38:43.400 --> 3:38:46.280]  I've spent months of my life on this campus now
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:48.280]  and understand how it works.
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:49.320]  This is not IBM.
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:51.680]  There's not a controller sitting in the back
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:52.880]  connecting dots and doing this to them.
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:54.360]  There's certainly nobody turning your phone off.
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:56.080]  Was that mine?
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:38:57.560]  I'm nervous so far.
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:38:58.960]  Hi, Mom, I'm busy right now.
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:00.920]  Seriously, please continue.
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:03.880]  Now, you know, you shouldn't be able to attack
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:05.600]  the fantasy that you've created and say,
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:07.800]  look, the fantasy doesn't meet my expectations,
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:09.120]  therefore punish him.
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:12.760]  Let us come into a courtroom and present the evidence.
[3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:14.080]  But you've been here for over three years
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:15.040]  in this looking at everything.
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:17.160]  There's nobody telling me what to say.
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:18.000]  Nobody telling you what to do.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.880]  But they're literally like, we know someone's in control.
[3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:22.960]  Give us who gives you the orders.
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:23.960]  I'm like, it doesn't exist.
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:25.360]  Okay, defaulted.
[3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:27.960]  There is no, you know, what you see folks,
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:30.840]  I am often asked by folks around the country,
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:32.360]  well, you've met Alex Jones.
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:34.360]  Does he believe what he says?
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:35.520]  I believe he does.
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:37.520]  I believe he's one of the few honest men
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:39.160]  in the United States.
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:40.960]  That doesn't mean he's always right,
[3:39:40.960 --> 3:39:42.440]  but I would defend to the death
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:44.080]  his right to give his opinions
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:45.560]  and you should defend to the death
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:46.840]  your right to hear them.
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:49.080]  There are people who don't want you to hear
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:51.880]  what Alex has to say and they hold them out as a monster.
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:53.400]  A conspiracy theorist.
[3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:56.080]  Hey, if you're watching the news in this country,
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:39:57.440]  you're going to the grocery store,
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:39:59.280]  you're paying prices for your mortgage,
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:00.960]  your gas, your home and everything else
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:02.320]  and you're not pissed off,
[3:40:02.320 --> 3:40:03.800]  there's something wrong with you.
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:05.560]  Who is it that doesn't want to be in the question sense?
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:07.400]  Well, I was never really rich as they claim,
[3:40:07.400 --> 3:40:09.360]  but I had more money than I used to.
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:10.920]  I don't even have money for stuff now.
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:11.760]  Yeah.
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:13.520]  I don't even know how people are paying for everything.
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:17.880]  Well, the gap between rich and poor continues to grow.
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:20.040]  An increasingly small number of people
[3:40:20.040 --> 3:40:22.760]  in control the largest amount of our assets.
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:24.720]  I don't know what the numbers are off the top of my head.
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:26.800]  It's an 100 people have like 80% of the world.
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:30.240]  It's an unsustainable spiral that will end in violence.
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:31.240]  Yeah.
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:32.400]  And I don't want to be part of it.
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:33.560]  I want to prevent it.
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:36.200]  And I think the way we prevent it is by talking about it,
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:37.040]  by reasoning together.
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:39.040]  I agree and identifying who's behind it.
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:40.640]  Instead of us killing each other
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:41.680]  with a different skin color,
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:45.520]  we should get together and talk about who's really running this.
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:47.360]  We should and I think that's what you're trying to do
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:49.440]  and that's why it's my pleasure and honor
[3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:51.440]  to be able to represent you in these fights.
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:53.080]  Well, Norm, for those that don't know,
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:54.720]  explain death penalty sanctions
[3:40:54.720 --> 3:40:55.880]  because I go out in the public, they go,
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:58.080]  oh, I'm sorry you were found guilty.
[3:40:58.080 --> 3:40:59.600]  I'm sorry all your money was taken away.
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:02.520]  I don't have that much money, but I wasn't found guilty.
[3:41:02.520 --> 3:41:05.840]  Judges decided to just say I was defaulted
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:06.960]  and I don't get a jury trial.
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:08.560]  So that's really dangerous, folks.
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:09.960]  In Connecticut and Texas,
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:12.440]  you have been subject to punitive sanctions
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:17.000]  and they are referred to in Texas as death penalty sanctions.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  A judge has concluded that you are liable for the allegations
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:25.080]  made against you by the Sandy Hook plaintiffs.
[3:41:25.080 --> 3:41:27.480]  The judge has not determined that you're guilty.
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:29.920]  There's no such thing as guilt in a civil context,
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:32.680]  but you are liable and now a jury on another day
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:36.040]  will have to determine what, and I say this candidly,
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:39.520]  what if anything, you'll have to pay for that liability.
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:44.160]  Among the challenging questions in this case is,
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:46.480]  Mr. Jones, you asserted certain beliefs
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:50.320]  about Sandy Hook at various times on the air.
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:53.920]  And these folks claim they're crushed by your opinions.
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:57.120]  Question for them, what was more disturbing to you?
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:42:00.800]  The gratuitous murder of your child by an unhinged man
[3:42:00.800 --> 3:42:03.080]  or Mr. Jones's opinions about them?
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:07.680]  And candidly, if you found Mr. Jones's opinions so outrageous,
[3:42:07.680 --> 3:42:08.880]  why did you listen?
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:10.000]  Why did you seek it out?
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:10.840]  Why did you decide?
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:12.600]  Well, I do wait six plus years to sue him.
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:15.360]  And this is the other thing we barely ever talked about it.
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:17.080]  People don't know about Adam Lanza.
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:19.720]  Either people say on the street to me in front of my family,
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:21.280]  you killed those kids.
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:22.120]  Well, here's the other.
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:23.800]  Because people think Sandy Hook, I was Jones.
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:24.720]  Well, and here's the other thing.
[3:42:24.720 --> 3:42:28.160]  I mean, the downside of a defamation lawsuit is,
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:30.520]  and I've often said to folks who want to bring them,
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:32.240]  be careful what you wish for.
[3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:35.080]  If you think somebody's opinion of you hurt you before,
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:36.960]  what are you going to do when the trial is televised?
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:37.840]  Hold on, let's talk about that.
[3:42:37.840 --> 3:42:39.960]  But that's why the judges and everybody feel
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.880]  they can't let me have a real trial.
[3:42:41.880 --> 3:42:44.040]  Because they did this, they've got to prove I'm wrong.
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:46.760]  So Jones has to be tied down like a butterfly
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:49.200]  that's about to be anethicized and just, you know,
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:51.480]  he's guilty, prepare it, that's how it is.
[3:42:51.480 --> 3:42:54.240]  Don't let Jones talk about the lies they told him.
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:42:58.080]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:01.320]  has only been the buildup for what the globalists
[3:43:01.320 --> 3:43:02.520]  are doing right now.
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:05.720]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover.
[3:43:05.720 --> 3:43:07.720]  And this is the point that they're very weakest
[3:43:07.720 --> 3:43:09.680]  because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:10.840]  Now they're a world government,
[3:43:10.840 --> 3:43:12.280]  they're permanent martial law,
[3:43:12.280 --> 3:43:14.680]  their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:17.240]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed,
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:19.320]  but they're using their corporate power
[3:43:19.320 --> 3:43:21.320]  and trillions to go across the planet
[3:43:21.320 --> 3:43:23.480]  and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:25.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's,
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:26.520]  when you spread the word about the broadcast,
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:28.960]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere.
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:31.520]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:32.640]  you keep us on air.

[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:46.560]  it's these two products.
[3:43:46.560 --> 3:43:49.040]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com,

[3:43:51.080 --> 3:43:53.480]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.

[3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:56.720]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:45:59.800]  for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:45:59.800 --> 3:46:01.840]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:03.520]  I wanted to wake up the world
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:05.680]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:08.520]  before they went operational, but we failed.
[3:46:08.520 --> 3:46:10.160]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:46:10.160 --> 3:46:12.040]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:14.120]  but they are going ahead
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:17.080]  with their full operational deindustrialization,
[3:46:17.080 --> 3:46:18.040]  great reset.
[3:46:18.040 --> 3:46:19.960]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:21.960]  that all viewers and all listeners
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:24.040]  tell everybody they know about the show
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:25.520]  because people are ready to wake up
[3:46:25.520 --> 3:46:26.960]  and ready to hear the truth.
[3:46:26.960 --> 3:46:28.880]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[3:46:28.880 --> 3:46:30.240]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:46:30.240 --> 3:46:32.480]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:33.640]  And one of the number one things to do
[3:46:33.640 --> 3:46:35.120]  is high quality, storeable food.
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:36.040]  We've got the best food,
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:38.320]  ready to ship at very affordable prices
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:39.800]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:39.800 --> 3:46:41.560]  So whether it's a month or a six month
[3:46:41.560 --> 3:46:43.680]  or a year supply or specialty diets,
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:45.400]  it's ready to ship right now.
[3:46:45.400 --> 3:46:48.240]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[3:46:48.240 --> 3:46:50.360]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:46:50.360 --> 3:46:52.680]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:46:52.680 --> 3:46:54.840]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:57.640 --> 3:47:00.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:04.040]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:07.040]  All right, it's the final segment of the Alex Jones show,
[3:47:07.040 --> 3:47:12.040]  January 12th, 2022, and man has incredible stuff broken.
[3:47:12.040 --> 3:47:15.440]  The EU government, their FDA says the vaccine
[3:47:15.440 --> 3:47:18.760]  erases your immune system, and it's extremely dangerous,
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:21.960]  but then it's just minor footnote as they cover their ass.
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:24.320]  The Congress releases thousands of pages of documents
[3:47:24.320 --> 3:47:26.840]  that are the same documents as Project Veritas had,
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:28.840]  confirming that they're going to be able to get
[3:47:28.840 --> 3:47:31.640]  to the United States, and they're going to be able to get
[3:47:31.640 --> 3:47:33.640]  to the United States, and they're going to be able
[3:47:33.640 --> 3:47:38.240]  to confirm and gain a function, and Fauci producing
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:39.760]  the virus, all the rest of it.
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:41.720]  What an incredible time to be alive,
[3:47:41.720 --> 3:47:43.200]  but those aren't the bad guys.
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:46.040]  You know it's Alex Jones that's questioned mass shootings,
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:48.560]  but I want to be clear about this.
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:50.880]  I'm not worried about me and all of this.
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:53.440]  Info Wars has been validated, we've been vindicated.
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:55.040]  It's so many levels, we're the best audience
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:47:56.280]  of activists ever.
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:47:59.720]  I'm worried about society and civilization itself.
[3:47:59.720 --> 3:48:02.400]  So Norm Pattis just in the big picture here
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:05.520]  about where America is, what the establishment's doing,
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:07.560]  what the social engineers have done.
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:09.200]  I think if the public becomes aware
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:12.360]  of the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists,
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:13.800]  then their power is over.
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:15.560]  But as long as we're not aware of it,
[3:48:15.560 --> 3:48:18.360]  it's like we're in the matrix and they're not.
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:19.360]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:21.680]  I think you mentioned the business about the vaccines
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:24.920]  and messenger RNA and so forth, and transhumanism.
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:26.840]  You didn't use those words, but I've recently become
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:28.600]  more aware of that discussion.
[3:48:28.600 --> 3:48:30.880]  And I did it in an untraditional way.
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:33.080]  I'm very preoccupied with artificial intelligence.
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:34.760]  We have machine learning and algorithms
[3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:37.120]  making decisions about what we can and cannot
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:38.360]  and shouldn't should not do.
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:40.600]  We don't understand how they're making those decisions.
[3:48:40.600 --> 3:48:43.040]  And now we're going to somehow monkey
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:48.040]  with the very stuff of which we're made, our RNA or DNA,
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:50.160]  and we're going to have augmented humans.
[3:48:50.160 --> 3:48:51.560]  In other words, you're not good enough
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:48:53.160]  as you come out of the womb.
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:54.560]  You need to be supplemented somehow
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:48:56.320]  to enhance your right to survive.
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:48:57.680]  At what point will that become,
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:00.320]  you need to be supplemented more to become more excellent?
[3:49:00.320 --> 3:49:02.560]  And in whose view will you become more excellent?
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:04.040]  And so here's my fear.
[3:49:04.040 --> 3:49:06.880]  You look at the advances in nanotechnology,
[3:49:06.880 --> 3:49:09.200]  you look at what's going on with artificial intelligence,
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:11.280]  and you look at what's going on with concentration
[3:49:11.280 --> 3:49:14.120]  and control of power in major corporations and government.
[3:49:14.120 --> 3:49:16.880]  And are we going to come to a point in this country
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:19.120]  where we have what they have in China?
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:20.760]  Social utility scores.
[3:49:20.760 --> 3:49:23.920]  An algorithm somewhere says, oh, here's Alex Jones.
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:25.640]  He gets a 66 score.
[3:49:25.640 --> 3:49:27.960]  Here's Norm Patis, he gets a 54.
[3:49:27.960 --> 3:49:30.720]  Well, those scores translate into different prices
[3:49:30.720 --> 3:49:32.680]  for the goods and services we pay for in the school.
[3:49:32.680 --> 3:49:34.400]  And by the way, Big Tech admits that's the plan.
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:35.240]  They're already basically bringing this.
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:36.880]  Well, and look how it can play out
[3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:38.760]  with respect to systemic racism.
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:41.600]  The government may not actually enforce
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:44.680]  overt reparations, race-based transfer payments.
[3:49:44.680 --> 3:49:46.640]  It may give us a social utility score.
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:47.920]  So if you are-
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:50.240]  Well, they're already denying white people
[3:49:50.240 --> 3:49:51.520]  monoclonal antibodies.
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:52.360]  On the basis of the race.
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:53.880]  Which that's not black folks that are doing that.
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:55.360]  It's meant to create racial division.
[3:49:55.360 --> 3:49:57.880]  But if you want to create social justice
[3:49:57.880 --> 3:49:59.560]  where everybody's the same and you conclude
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:02.080]  that somebody's from an historically disadvantaged group,
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:04.360]  why not give them a 10% discount
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:05.840]  on the price of goods and services?
[3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:08.400]  So your score for a gallon of milk will be 90.
[3:50:08.400 --> 3:50:11.080]  A person who comes from the right group will pay 90 units.
[3:50:11.080 --> 3:50:11.920]  How will that happen?
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:14.520]  When they eliminate cash and everything becomes digital
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:16.560]  and you present your credit card at the store,
[3:50:16.560 --> 3:50:21.080]  it'll say, Alex Jones, a factor of 0.90.
[3:50:21.080 --> 3:50:21.920]  So you'll pay more.
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:22.760]  And again, they're doing that
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:24.320]  to give themselves total control.
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:25.920]  Well, it's not a people's revolution.
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:29.240]  Total control in the name of their vision of the good.
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:32.400]  And the genius of American politics has always been
[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:34.840]  that the federal government does not have the right
[3:50:34.840 --> 3:50:36.960]  to impose its vision of the good on us.
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:39.960]  That local control mattered and that federalism,
[3:50:39.960 --> 3:50:41.520]  the division of power between state
[3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:43.680]  and federal governments was to have the police power.
[3:50:43.680 --> 3:50:46.240]  That is the vision to determine what a good life is.
[3:50:46.240 --> 3:50:47.080]  Belong to the people.
[3:50:47.080 --> 3:50:47.920]  And I was about to say though,
[3:50:47.920 --> 3:50:50.040]  I mean, this power graph, this big tech move,
[3:50:50.040 --> 3:50:53.920]  this biomedical state is just outrageously authoritarian.
[3:50:53.920 --> 3:50:56.120]  It's spritin' up and it does so in the name of science.
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:50:58.000]  Every time I see one of those signs on a lawn
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:50:59.720]  that says, I believe in science,
[3:50:59.720 --> 3:51:01.440]  I wanna stop and tear it down.
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:02.840]  I believe in science too.
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:04.880]  I don't seek to jump up and go to the moon.
[3:51:04.880 --> 3:51:06.200]  Gravity holds me to the earth.
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:07.800]  No, no, no, they use that as a trump card like.
[3:51:07.800 --> 3:51:09.560]  I'm taking your right, science.
[3:51:09.560 --> 3:51:10.400]  I hear you.
[3:51:10.400 --> 3:51:11.920]  I'm gonna force me to inject you, science.
[3:51:11.920 --> 3:51:14.280]  But science is only about how to do things,
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:15.400]  not about what to do.
[3:51:15.400 --> 3:51:16.400]  What to do is a question of values.
[3:51:16.400 --> 3:51:17.840]  But they don't even represent science.
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:19.440]  The science is all against them.
[3:51:19.440 --> 3:51:21.640]  They just use it like saying the word science
[3:51:21.640 --> 3:51:23.640]  means they're, you know, God.
[3:51:23.640 --> 3:51:26.440]  We, the people, are sovereign and should remain so.
[3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:29.240]  And it's going to take fundamental and individual
[3:51:29.240 --> 3:51:31.400]  and discreet and small acts of resistance
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:32.800]  that you can every step of the way.
[3:51:32.800 --> 3:51:35.720]  Say hello to somebody, smile, shake a hand,
[3:51:35.720 --> 3:51:37.520]  ask how you can help your neighbor.
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:39.040]  They can't defeat goodwill.
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:40.400]  They can't defeat love.
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:42.840]  I agree.
[3:51:42.840 --> 3:51:44.280]  And the social engineers are beta testing
[3:51:44.280 --> 3:51:45.640]  their big move right now.
[3:51:45.640 --> 3:51:48.120]  As bad as all this is, Moram, this is a test.
[3:51:48.120 --> 3:51:50.760]  I hope you're wrong, but you haven't been wrong yet.
[3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:53.560]  And I think, you know, people who've been your critics
[3:51:53.560 --> 3:51:56.000]  over the years, oh, Alex this, Alex that,
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:51:57.760]  they're coming back to you now and they're saying,
[3:51:57.760 --> 3:51:59.600]  wait a minute, what's he been talking about?
[3:51:59.600 --> 3:52:02.720]  Big globalists, it's easy to make fun of that word.
[3:52:02.720 --> 3:52:05.320]  It's hard to deny the fact that there is a movement
[3:52:05.320 --> 3:52:09.240]  of foot in the world to make sure that everybody conforms
[3:52:09.240 --> 3:52:11.280]  to standards determined by others.
[3:52:11.280 --> 3:52:12.960]  Whether those standards be for good or ill.
[3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:14.360]  That's what globalism is.
[3:52:14.360 --> 3:52:17.240]  Who controls what we get controls the world.
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:19.200]  And there is a power grab going on.
[3:52:19.200 --> 3:52:20.040]  Well, that's right.
[3:52:20.040 --> 3:52:22.480]  I remember Fauci saying, I am science.
[3:52:22.480 --> 3:52:24.360]  Well, good for him.
[3:52:24.360 --> 3:52:25.520]  I have a shitting.
[3:52:25.520 --> 3:52:27.720]  Yeah, well, you know, I don't have opinions
[3:52:27.720 --> 3:52:29.280]  about Fauci one way or the other.
[3:52:29.280 --> 3:52:30.800]  I guess I haven't studied it enough.
[3:52:30.800 --> 3:52:33.000]  And I should confess to your listeners and to you,
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:34.200]  you know, I've got the vaccine.
[3:52:34.200 --> 3:52:36.720]  I played the odds that I'll be okay.
[3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:39.000]  If I'm not going to be, well, that's fine.
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.200]  You know, I accepted that risk,
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:43.200]  but it was my risk to accept.
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:46.400]  Well, we now know most people are being given a saline,
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:47.920]  but it's some kind of weird test
[3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:49.800]  that only certain numbers get to,
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:51.880]  you get the real thing.
[3:52:51.880 --> 3:52:53.240]  You're not excited to be too good.
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:55.160]  Well, I don't know what I got, but then again,
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:52:57.360]  I noticed I started growing a third year back here.
[3:52:57.360 --> 3:52:58.800]  And so that may be me.
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:01.520]  No, but seriously, Norm, like all these documents,
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:05.200]  I mean, this is a major Canadian group
[3:53:05.200 --> 3:53:07.040]  at the British Medical Journal here.
[3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:08.360]  I have all these government reports
[3:53:08.360 --> 3:53:11.440]  where 40% uptick in deaths now
[3:53:11.440 --> 3:53:13.120]  and across the world where the shots are happening,
[3:53:13.120 --> 3:53:14.600]  40% increase in deaths.
[3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:16.240]  It's a result of what?
[3:53:16.240 --> 3:53:18.200]  They don't know, but it's in the vaccinated.
[3:53:18.200 --> 3:53:19.040]  Wow.
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:23.400]  All these other big studies, I can show you
[3:53:23.400 --> 3:53:26.160]  John Hopkins graph from numbers around the world.
[3:53:26.160 --> 3:53:27.000]  I'd like to see that.
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  Can I take this one with me?
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:30.120]  I'm obviously not paying attention.
[3:53:30.120 --> 3:53:30.960]  I'd like to read this.
[3:53:30.960 --> 3:53:31.800]  No, you're welcome to read that,
[3:53:31.800 --> 3:53:32.640]  but I've got a bunch more here.
[3:53:32.640 --> 3:53:34.720]  I mean, look, here's the DARPA document.
[3:53:36.040 --> 3:53:40.800]  This is what Project Veritas released yesterday.
[3:53:40.800 --> 3:53:42.320]  And now Congress released the same thing
[3:53:42.320 --> 3:53:43.520]  in front of us all real.
[3:53:45.720 --> 3:53:48.320]  That's a Fauci creating the virus.
[3:53:48.320 --> 3:53:49.520]  Fauci releasing it.
[3:53:49.520 --> 3:53:52.240]  You know, I don't want to be a statistic
[3:53:52.240 --> 3:53:53.600]  in somebody's social science
[3:53:53.600 --> 3:53:55.400]  or medical science experiment.
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:53:56.920]  So like right there's the proof
[3:53:56.920 --> 3:53:58.360]  that they made it and did it all.
[3:53:58.360 --> 3:53:59.280]  It's out now.
[3:53:59.280 --> 3:54:00.480]  Well, I'm going to read it,
[3:54:00.480 --> 3:54:01.640]  have me back when I've read it.
[3:54:01.640 --> 3:54:03.480]  I'll tell you what I think, yeah?
[3:54:03.480 --> 3:54:04.320]  Absolutely.
[3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:07.760]  Norm, we're still on there.
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:09.480]  Well, I guess that means,
[3:54:09.480 --> 3:54:11.080]  you know, I gotta keep talking.
[3:54:11.080 --> 3:54:11.920]  You know.
[3:54:11.920 --> 3:54:13.600]  Well, I have no problem keeping talking.
[3:54:13.600 --> 3:54:14.560]  You're always talking.
[3:54:14.560 --> 3:54:17.000]  I don't, you know, I guess,
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:17.960]  here's a challenge to you.
[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:19.840]  I mean, science is not our enemy.
[3:54:19.840 --> 3:54:20.920]  Science is our friend.
[3:54:20.920 --> 3:54:22.720]  And we're here in synthetic fibers.
[3:54:22.720 --> 3:54:24.720]  We're in a studio that is made possible
[3:54:24.720 --> 3:54:25.560]  by electronic waves.
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:26.400]  No, I agree.
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:27.520]  But people claiming they represent science
[3:54:27.520 --> 3:54:29.880]  is a priest class saying we must submit to them.
[3:54:29.880 --> 3:54:30.720]  That's not a good deal.
[3:54:30.720 --> 3:54:31.640]  No, and that's wrong.
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:33.680]  And that's why my law firm is very proud
[3:54:33.680 --> 3:54:35.760]  to represent folks who oppose vaccination
[3:54:35.760 --> 3:54:36.600]  on religious grounds.
[3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:38.080]  Government was meant to serve people,
[3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:39.200]  not people to government.
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:40.800]  And if I choose to bear the risk
[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:43.320]  of not being vaccinated, that choice is on me.
[3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:45.240]  I don't think elites should be able to say,
[3:54:45.240 --> 3:54:48.120]  if you make that choice, you're declined goods and services.
[3:54:48.120 --> 3:54:49.440]  Well, think about that power.
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:52.320]  Just the power to surveil who has the shot or not
[3:54:52.320 --> 3:54:54.360]  is a total tyranny and violates the Fourth Amendment
[3:54:54.360 --> 3:54:56.240]  and so much more in just common sense.
[3:54:56.240 --> 3:54:58.120]  But then the fact that it doesn't work
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:00.200]  and is a fraud makes it even worse.
[3:55:00.200 --> 3:55:02.040]  It's just insane.
[3:55:02.040 --> 3:55:03.920]  You know, mass surveillance is a big problem.
[3:55:03.920 --> 3:55:05.760]  We've talked about that the first time I was on your show
[3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:09.640]  about three years ago with Shoshana Zuboff's book
[3:55:09.640 --> 3:55:11.520]  on the age of mass surveillance.
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:14.760]  And we all carry mass surveillance devices
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:15.600]  in our pocket.
[3:55:15.600 --> 3:55:16.880]  I went to breakfast with you not long ago,
[3:55:16.880 --> 3:55:17.920]  I think a few months ago,
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:21.600]  and you wouldn't use the app that permitted us
[3:55:21.600 --> 3:55:22.760]  to read the menu.
[3:55:22.760 --> 3:55:24.400]  And you said, you know, I don't really want to be part
[3:55:24.400 --> 3:55:25.400]  of their data set.
[3:55:25.400 --> 3:55:27.800]  And I looked at you and I thought, you know, he's right.
[3:55:27.800 --> 3:55:30.480]  And as a result of that, I took my digital watch off
[3:55:30.480 --> 3:55:32.280]  and I'm not wearing a digital watch.
[3:55:32.280 --> 3:55:33.120]  I want to be free to be me.
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:34.360]  Sure, it's not that these things are bad,
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:35.840]  but they have Trojan horses on them.
[3:55:35.840 --> 3:55:36.680]  Well, nothing.
[3:55:36.680 --> 3:55:38.040]  And I was just telling them, give me a paper menu.
[3:55:38.040 --> 3:55:39.760]  I'm not gonna play this neurotic game
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:40.640]  that I've gotta be digital.
[3:55:40.640 --> 3:55:42.200]  Because Klaus Schwab wrote about,
[3:55:42.200 --> 3:55:45.080]  we will make them, you have to get the menus to train them.
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:47.120]  And then we will make them have a digital passport.
[3:55:47.120 --> 3:55:48.160]  And then we make them take a shot.
[3:55:48.160 --> 3:55:51.040]  But that your refusal to do the digital menu
[3:55:51.040 --> 3:55:52.480]  is exactly what I'm talking about,
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:54.720]  about the small acts of resistance that are necessary.
[3:55:54.720 --> 3:55:55.560]  No, I totally agree.
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:55:56.720]  You know, I mean, and there's some,
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:55:58.800]  and that's something you can do today.
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:00.240]  You can go into a restaurant that says,
[3:56:00.240 --> 3:56:02.920]  download our app and say, why should I give you my data
[3:56:02.920 --> 3:56:03.960]  or access to my data?
[3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:05.320]  I want to eat your food.
[3:56:05.320 --> 3:56:07.320]  What's more, I want to pay you to eat your food.
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:08.360]  You want my data?
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:09.720]  How much are you gonna pay me?
[3:56:09.720 --> 3:56:13.160]  I don't want your digital pee-pee stuck in me.
[3:56:13.160 --> 3:56:15.800]  I don't want to be digitally penetrated by you, dear,
[3:56:15.800 --> 3:56:16.640]  regardless of what you do.
[3:56:16.640 --> 3:56:19.000]  But I mean, the point is, it's not even that that place,
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:20.160]  I don't want to have, it's that,
[3:56:20.160 --> 3:56:22.920]  it's all this big, big tech rape.
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:23.760]  Well, and we don't-
[3:56:23.760 --> 3:56:25.640]  Think how much big tech has already got to take assistance
[3:56:25.640 --> 3:56:27.760]  in our houses that all watch and listen to us
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:29.320]  that are now using trials everywhere?
[3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:31.080]  We don't know where it ends.
[3:56:31.080 --> 3:56:33.920]  You know, I did a murder trial just in December
[3:56:33.920 --> 3:56:35.280]  in New Haven, Connecticut.
[3:56:35.280 --> 3:56:39.040]  And they had an FBI agent who digitally traced
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:40.280]  a person's telephone.
[3:56:40.280 --> 3:56:43.000]  And when asked whether that phone was actually
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:44.560]  at the location of the crime,
[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:47.000]  well, no, it was within a couple miles of it.
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:50.160]  Well, so were about 10 or 20,000 other people.
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:53.480]  So the challenge to the FBI is to refine this technology
[3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:56.200]  so that it can pinpoint your exact location.
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:56:58.160]  And if it can pinpoint your exact location,
[3:56:58.160 --> 3:56:59.880]  it can record what you're saying.
[3:56:59.880 --> 3:57:01.240]  And if you get enough data,
[3:57:01.240 --> 3:57:04.160]  they can predict what you're likely to do next
[3:57:04.160 --> 3:57:06.440]  so that they're waiting for you around the next corner.
[3:57:06.440 --> 3:57:08.320]  Now, folks are gonna say, they, they, they,
[3:57:08.320 --> 3:57:11.760]  it's already happening with that power we give the system
[3:57:11.760 --> 3:57:14.080]  always leads to very destructive things.
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:16.000]  Norm Patis, what's your website?
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:19.400]  normpatis.com and I hope you'll visit.
[3:57:19.400 --> 3:57:21.880]  I also do a podcast called Law and Legitimacy.
[3:57:21.880 --> 3:57:24.360]  Alex has even posted one or one or two from time to time.
[3:57:24.360 --> 3:57:25.200]  That's right.
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:26.800]  All right, folks, the War Room with Owen Schroyer
[3:57:26.800 --> 3:57:27.720]  is coming up.
[3:57:27.720 --> 3:57:29.440]  Major news tomorrow on the show.
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:30.680]  So much breaking.
[3:57:30.680 --> 3:57:32.000]  You want to tune into the War Room right now
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:35.040]  on infowars.com, forward slash show, band dot video
[3:57:35.040 --> 3:57:38.920]  and futurenews.news is the new URL
[3:57:38.920 --> 3:57:40.160]  to get around the sensors.
[3:57:40.160 --> 3:57:42.000]  Futurenews.news.
[3:57:45.560 --> 3:57:49.640]  Three very important lifesaving words.
[3:57:49.640 --> 3:57:53.480]  Vitamins, minerals, amino acids,
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:57.320]  and you find them all in vitamin, mineral, fusion.
[3:57:57.320 --> 3:57:59.640]  All the essential vitamins,
[3:57:59.640 --> 3:58:02.560]  all the essential minerals from really good,
[3:58:02.560 --> 3:58:04.720]  high quality, absorbable sources
[3:58:04.720 --> 3:58:07.920]  and a bunch of key compounds,
[3:58:07.920 --> 3:58:11.360]  amino acids known to help get the nutrients
[3:58:11.360 --> 3:58:13.320]  into your tissues, into your cells.
[3:58:13.320 --> 3:58:14.800]  And despite the fact that the product
[3:58:14.800 --> 3:58:16.600]  is going to sell out the next week or so,
[3:58:16.600 --> 3:58:20.120]  we're going to keep it on sale at 50% off
[3:58:20.120 --> 3:58:22.360]  for another seven days.
[3:58:22.360 --> 3:58:24.160]  So again, I am cutting this announcement
[3:58:24.160 --> 3:58:27.720]  on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[3:58:27.720 --> 3:58:29.120]  We're going to run this for a week
[3:58:29.120 --> 3:58:32.000]  and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[3:58:32.000 --> 3:58:34.400]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so
[3:58:34.400 --> 3:58:35.560]  because it's a best seller.
[3:58:35.560 --> 3:58:36.600]  And it's something everybody needs
[3:58:36.600 --> 3:58:38.400]  for their immune system and their body.
[3:58:38.400 --> 3:58:40.400]  Get your vitamin, mineral, fusion now
[3:58:40.400 --> 3:58:45.160]  and support the InfoWare, a 360 win at infowarstore.com.
[3:58:47.240 --> 3:58:48.800]  I want to explain something
[3:58:48.800 --> 3:58:51.240]  that is absolutely feed understanding our world.
[3:58:51.240 --> 3:58:54.240]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[3:58:54.240 --> 3:58:56.960]  The privately owned central banks of the world
[3:58:57.840 --> 3:59:01.040]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[3:59:01.040 --> 3:59:03.560]  of dollars and other major currencies.
[3:59:03.560 --> 3:59:07.160]  And using them to buy up infrastructure,
[3:59:07.160 --> 3:59:10.400]  intellectual property, energy.
[3:59:10.400 --> 3:59:13.360]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence.
[3:59:13.360 --> 3:59:16.080]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions
[3:59:16.080 --> 3:59:18.880]  so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets,
[3:59:18.880 --> 3:59:20.760]  but they never allowed that money
[3:59:20.760 --> 3:59:22.480]  to get into the general circulation
[3:59:22.480 --> 3:59:24.520]  or it would cause massive inflation.
[3:59:24.520 --> 3:59:26.160]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it
[3:59:26.160 --> 3:59:29.120]  and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[3:59:29.120 --> 3:59:32.960]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate,
[3:59:32.960 --> 3:59:35.000]  but to actually shut them down
[3:59:35.000 --> 3:59:37.200]  and force to collapse the civilization,
[3:59:37.200 --> 3:59:39.080]  making the companies they do find
[3:59:39.080 --> 3:59:40.760]  to be the only things left standing.
[3:59:40.760 --> 3:59:43.080]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now,
[3:59:43.080 --> 3:59:45.280]  war on everyone is the only way to stop it.
[3:59:48.840 --> 3:59:51.320]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:59:51.320 --> 4:00:03.480]  you are the resistance.
