[00:00.000 --> 00:16.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.760 --> 00:37.000]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.960]  gentlemen we're live we are broadcasting worldwide we're going to have the
[00:41.960 --> 00:47.360]  aftermath of what's unfolded there in the swamp battle the swamp has struck back
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.560]  big time in Alabama massive evidence of election fraud judges ruling they could
[00:53.560 --> 00:59.400]  erase the digital records the next day so there couldn't be a proper recount the
[00:59.400 --> 01:03.480]  military ballots almost none of them counted it just goes on but plus you
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.760]  notice that he lost by half a point well ladies and gentlemen they said he was
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.220]  gonna lose by 10 to 15 to create the bandwagon effect but the big story is the
[01:14.220 --> 01:20.220]  grilling of the swamp creature Rosenstein right now in Congress here's
[01:20.220 --> 01:24.280]  from earlier when the chairman of the committee Bob Goodlot laid out some of
[01:24.280 --> 01:29.580]  the breaking news from documents they just got last night thank you deputy
[01:29.580 --> 01:33.120]  general Rosen attorney general Rosenstein for appearing for the first
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.040]  time in front of this committee there's much to discuss today we look forward to
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.920]  your testimony and answers to your questions as chairman of the committee
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.160]  with primary oversight of the Department of Justice and the FBI I have always
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.440]  supported the department and the FBI in performing their valuable missions to
[01:50.440 --> 01:54.200]  keep our nation safe and to hold individuals accountable for criminal
[01:54.200 --> 01:59.960]  conduct yet I and many on this committee now find ourselves in the very
[01:59.960 --> 02:03.880]  difficult position of questioning the actions of both prior and current
[02:03.880 --> 02:08.080]  department and FBI leadership you have a unique role at the Department of
[02:08.080 --> 02:12.400]  Justice in that you appointed special counsel Muller and have a supervisory
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.680]  role over his investigation it is therefore very appropriate for you to
[02:16.680 --> 02:20.600]  appear before this committee to answer questions related to the scope of the
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.320]  special counsel's investigation as well as its current efficacy in light of
[02:25.320 --> 02:30.320]  various events calling into question its impartiality reports on the political
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.840]  predisposition and potential bias of certain career agents and department
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.920]  lawyers on special counsel Muller's team are deeply deeply troubling to all
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.720]  citizens who expect a system of blind and equal justice the Department of
[02:45.720 --> 02:50.360]  Justice investigations must not be tainted by individuals imposing their
[02:50.360 --> 02:55.000]  own political prejudices we are now beginning to better understand the
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.360]  magnitude of this insider bias on Mr. Muller's team first we have FBI agent
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.480]  Peter Struck and FBI lawyer Lisa Page exchanging communications showing
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.080]  extreme bias against President Trump a fact that would be bad enough if it
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.920]  weren't for the fact that these two individuals were employed as part of the
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.760]  Muller dream team investigating the very person for whom they were showing
[03:20.760 --> 03:27.000]  disdain and calling it mere disdain is generous according to the documents
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.400]  produced last night to this committee Mr. Struck and Ms. Page refer to the
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.440]  president as an utter idiot a loathsome human and awful while continually
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.760]  praising Hillary Clinton and the Obamas these text messages prove what we all
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.560]  suspected high-ranking FBI officials involved in the Clinton investigation
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.320]  were personally invested in the outcome of the election and clearly let their
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.400]  strong political opinions cloud their professional judgment and this was only
[03:57.400 --> 04:04.600]  an initial disclosure containing heavy redactions second former FB embattled FBI
[04:04.600 --> 04:09.520]  general counsel and current Muller prosecutor Andrew Weissman expressed his
[04:09.520 --> 04:14.840]  awe of a former DOJ official for shunning the president and failing to
[04:14.840 --> 04:21.080]  faithfully execute the law however we are the ones now in awe that someone like
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.660]  mr. Weissman remains on an investigative team that looks more and more
[04:25.660 --> 04:33.160]  partisan third we have learned that a top Muller prosecutor Jeannie re in addition
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.320]  to the other actions that would normally justify recusal served as an attorney
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.920]  for the Clinton Foundation aren't Department of Justice attorneys advised
[04:42.920 --> 04:48.560]  to avoid even the appearance of impropriety a former Clinton employee is
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.480]  now investigating president Trump this seems to be the very definition of
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.800]  appearance of impropriety fourth we have just recently learned that another top

[06:26.080 --> 06:42.640]  and we're broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday post election coverage the
[06:42.640 --> 06:50.880]  swamp has definitely struck back in a big big way they buried Roy Moore under
[06:50.880 --> 06:57.120]  record amounts of vicious campaign ads total demonization false reports the
[06:57.120 --> 07:03.800]  entire swamp Republican and Democratic parties ganged up on more that was the
[07:03.800 --> 07:08.880]  program that was the operation and so they're heralding this is a great sign
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.080]  that they're gonna retake things in 2018 that is not with the demographics the
[07:13.080 --> 07:17.600]  numbers the facts show the Republican Party has raised more money in the last
[07:17.600 --> 07:23.160]  year since the president was elected than it ever has by a massive factor of
[07:23.160 --> 07:28.960]  almost two to one all over the country most local elections are being won by
[07:28.960 --> 07:33.200]  Republicans and even traditionally Democratic held areas yes one of the
[07:33.200 --> 07:38.600]  redest states in the country is Alabama but you had a perfect storm come in here
[07:38.600 --> 07:44.520]  and you also had ads running millions of dollars of them saying if you vote for
[07:44.520 --> 07:50.320]  Roy Moore we're gonna publish your name in the newspaper talk about a total
[07:50.320 --> 07:59.400]  civil rights violation but it's again all about your daughter being mad at you
[07:59.400 --> 08:06.040]  your wife being mad at you that you have enabled a pedophile who's not a
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.760]  pedophile is not been convicted of being a pedophile not been charged being a
[08:08.760 --> 08:14.680]  pedophile if you vote for judge Roy Moore this is a great example a great
[08:14.680 --> 08:19.320]  exercise in the art of dirty politics and they're just getting more and more
[08:19.320 --> 08:23.200]  desperate again they want to build this image that the Democrats have cleaned
[08:23.200 --> 08:26.440]  house now Trump's gotta go they want congressional hearings because the
[08:26.440 --> 08:32.000]  Russia situation has imploded now I'm gonna get back to more on Roy Moore in
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.600]  Alabama and what really happened there coming up in the next segment and I'm
[08:38.600 --> 08:42.720]  also going to later get into some more of the hearing that's still going on with
[08:42.720 --> 08:47.880]  the deputy AG Rosenstein who really is the attorney general at this point a
[08:47.880 --> 08:53.240]  part of a swamp coup of that agency and we have him appointing individuals like
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.280]  Mueller who brought in nothing but Democrats 97% of those in this giant
[08:58.280 --> 09:04.760]  organization that spent almost $8 million now in the last year are part of
[09:04.760 --> 09:10.440]  stay-behind networks that Hillary put in charge and new documents were given to
[09:10.440 --> 09:17.080]  the committee just last night under threat of contempt of Congress by
[09:17.080 --> 09:20.880]  Rosenstein and the Department of Justice and it just gets worse by the
[09:20.880 --> 09:27.160]  minute it is unbelievable fusion GPS admits DOJ officials wife Nellie or
[09:27.160 --> 09:34.240]  hired to probe Trump so she was brought in specifically from Fusion GPS the group
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.800]  that put out the fake dossier by the FBI to put millions more into trying to
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.960]  doll it all up and make it look real and then or was there to make sure that it
[09:43.960 --> 09:50.520]  went to the FISA court and they even had the FBI agents there that have turned
[09:50.520 --> 09:53.600]  out to be Clinton operatives as well that then reportedly other words can
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.440]  assume me breaking testified secretly to the FISA court that's why you have the
[09:57.440 --> 10:03.520]  FISA judge that was also the judge over Flynn recusing himself it's why you've
[10:03.520 --> 10:08.160]  got all these other FBI agents having to step down just department people because
[10:08.160 --> 10:16.880]  this was a completely fraudulent endeavor what they did is what the NSA has
[10:16.880 --> 10:20.960]  been caught doing in the last five years that's been going on for decades
[10:20.960 --> 10:26.960]  working with the drug enforcement agency and that program that the drug
[10:26.960 --> 10:33.480]  enforcement agency is to use illegal wiretaps to then gather data on how to
[10:33.480 --> 10:38.200]  frame somebody usually they're innocent and then they have false witnesses and
[10:38.200 --> 10:44.200]  others false informants false witnesses liars criminally go in and then
[10:44.200 --> 10:48.760]  testify to things that didn't happen to then get the fake warrants to then
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.960]  reconstruct what the illegal investigation did it's called parallel
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.640]  construction and so you have parallel construction illegal spying then they go
[10:59.640 --> 11:05.080]  get the warrants based on lies and fraud and the judge and the FBI agents and the
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.760]  just department official and then his wife it's all fusion GPS you go do it in a
[11:10.760 --> 11:13.960]  foreign country so there's plausible liability so the courts can't reach over
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.360]  there as well the fraud is inculcated it is then criminally brought back over
[11:18.360 --> 11:27.360]  here using taxpayer money it is further embellished and then it is deployed into
[11:27.360 --> 11:33.360]  the media through Buzzfeed during the election to destroy the president when
[11:33.360 --> 11:40.040]  that doesn't work it's still the entire modus operandi and the entire Bible the
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.360]  entire canon the entire operating manual the entire universe of the in false
[11:45.360 --> 11:53.880]  Russia storyline and that's what they hang their entire hat on so the wheels
[11:53.880 --> 11:59.120]  are falling off the engine is on fire and they are now
[11:59.120 --> 12:07.200]  segwaying into hashtag me too that was meant to be launched during ongoing
[12:07.200 --> 12:11.240]  impeachment hearings next year the word is they were gonna launch this and the
[12:11.240 --> 12:16.880]  Alzheimer's and all the rest of it next year for the final blows to make it just
[12:16.880 --> 12:20.040]  look like to America there's so much scandal this guy's evil all these women
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.880]  coming out you know all this stuff about Alzheimer's all these other things and
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.200]  now the Russia stuff it was all meant to come together in February of next year
[12:28.200 --> 12:31.920]  but they're desperate so they're now firing their reinforcement it's kind of
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.440]  like a battle of Waterloo and you've got Napoleon up against Lord Wellington and
[12:37.440 --> 12:44.040]  he's getting crushed by the Prussians and so Napoleon commits all of his forces
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.000]  and then in swings the British to close the door in a pincere attack and crush
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.160]  them they they had that planned they thought that they would but now they've
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.000]  already had to do what Napoleon did they've deployed everything they launch
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.240]  all reserves attacks everything fire fire fire fire fire but they're not
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.120]  raising money they spent the little they've got on this more thing betting
[13:07.120 --> 13:13.280]  everything on it and notice the Democrat judge said oh we're gonna erase all the
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.760]  computer files after tonight on Wednesday morning so there's gonna be no
[13:17.760 --> 13:24.560]  recount try that more oh and the polls said he was gonna lose by 10 to 15
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.760]  points Fox News CNN same garbage to create a bandwagon effect with some to
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.800]  go I better boat with a winner he's gonna lose so he lost some there and then
[13:33.800 --> 13:37.320]  they just came in baby and they as they do all over the country had the dead
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.480]  people vote and had the folks busted in in those Democrat areas and they stole
[13:42.480 --> 13:51.000]  the election when my research shows Roy Moore probably would have won by six
[13:51.000 --> 14:00.280]  seven points so it really is biblical what we're witnessing and the dirty
[14:00.280 --> 14:03.640]  tricks of the Clintons and the dirty tricks of their systems in this country
[14:03.640 --> 14:08.640]  reaching down through into daily life I mean they come after you when you fight
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.740]  them they they run intelligence operations they destroy families they
[14:13.740 --> 14:19.200]  pay people off they threaten weak-minded people into into you're going
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.520]  along with them but their reign of intimidation and their reign of just the
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.400]  dirtiest pool ever played in this country probably in the world is coming
[14:27.400 --> 14:31.480]  to an end it's coming to an end doesn't mean there's some great utopia we're
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.680]  over the hill but Americana people being honorable folks operating off their name
[14:37.680 --> 14:40.800]  and off the fact that folks know where they stand and then and then your
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.320]  words your word and it deals a deal and just getting back to basic free market
[14:44.320 --> 14:49.360]  where companies are too confident in the system for their children to want to
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.480]  shut down free market just because they can get even richer now by destroying
[14:53.480 --> 14:58.560]  the cornucopia by killing the golden goose killing the golden goose is coming
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.360]  to an end and if you try that type of garbage crony capitalist crap people are
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.680]  going to come after you and so I am just so honored to stand here with all of you
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.000]  in this epic fight it's incredibly interesting it's incredibly important
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.920]  it's incredibly amazing and I just want to thank you all for your support and
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.520]  your prayers because without you info wars wouldn't have been able to come
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.200]  through all these storms without you we wouldn't be seeing the major turnaround
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.320]  the economy and the culture and we wouldn't be seeing the enemy throw
[15:28.320 --> 15:36.520]  everything they've got everything they've got humanity trying to bully us
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.480]  back into submission that's only going to cause the next wave of libertarian
[15:40.480 --> 15:44.040]  thinking to be even bigger and I can tell you we're moving in a very good
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.640]  direction we're in a fight we're bloodied but at least we're not on our
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.640]  knees tied up with these people having their way with us culturally

[20:43.880 --> 20:50.720]  you without any doubt the entire house of cards as I said two weeks ago has
[20:50.720 --> 20:56.640]  collapsed on Russia Gate and the crimes committed are unbelievable and the
[20:56.640 --> 21:02.040]  individuals involved are either involved in the fake dossier most of them are
[21:02.040 --> 21:06.640]  involved in that others are involved literally selling out our uranium
[21:06.640 --> 21:10.920]  reserves of you rich in uranium I mean it doesn't get more national security
[21:10.920 --> 21:18.760]  violations it doesn't get more treasonous and just getting fabulously rich off
[21:18.760 --> 21:22.040]  the Russians buying them off which is what foreign governments do if you're
[21:22.040 --> 21:24.560]  wide open to it of course they'll come in and buy off your government to get
[21:24.560 --> 21:28.640]  resources that's what our government does and I think it should stop by the
[21:28.640 --> 21:31.600]  way I think we should have real-day talk with Russia and it should all stop
[21:31.600 --> 21:34.440]  there have been long periods of time before in civilization where people
[21:34.440 --> 21:39.200]  don't do this type of crap because folks would go to war over it we put up with
[21:39.200 --> 21:44.000]  too much of this stuff leave everybody alone man let's go to the stars let's
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.080]  build civilization stop spending all our times robbing from each other so many
[21:49.080 --> 21:53.360]  beta males though in the system want to go out and screw people over because they
[21:53.360 --> 21:57.880]  are dishonorable the problem in the world is wimps I don't mean wimps
[21:57.880 --> 22:02.520]  physically I mean wimps mentally every time I turn around that's the problem is
[22:02.520 --> 22:07.280]  cowardly beta males that think doing evil is powerful and being dishonorable is
[22:07.280 --> 22:15.000]  powerful it is not powerful it is disgusting but the whole things coming
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.520]  down I just point out that we laid all this out weeks ago and I pinned it so
[22:21.520 --> 22:24.960]  people will know that I know what I'm talking about I don't just get up here
[22:24.960 --> 22:29.360]  and say we're kicking there living but behinds and so get on your knees before
[22:29.360 --> 22:36.040]  God we've been praying for this seeking God's face trying to humble ourselves and
[22:36.040 --> 22:43.520]  find that quiet place the most high and it's happening but we're in the middle of
[22:43.520 --> 22:50.680]  a major spiritual war here ladies and gentlemen and so none of us are worthy
[22:50.680 --> 22:55.400]  by the way to even fight on God's side you know evil attacks those of us that
[22:55.400 --> 22:57.800]  have good hearts and makes us think you know well you're not that good of a
[22:57.800 --> 23:02.280]  person you have a conscience you have some problems in your life so you're
[23:02.280 --> 23:05.400]  nobody stand up against evil well I'm not trying to consciously hurt people and
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.120]  I love God that's the difference and I just am so thankful this is all coming
[23:09.120 --> 23:15.720]  out came out days ago that the wife of the number two at fusion GPS was hired
[23:15.720 --> 23:18.760]  by the Justice Department official that resigned last week highest level
[23:18.760 --> 23:22.440]  Justice Department official over Russia investigations this is all the top people
[23:22.440 --> 23:26.960]  who had the other FBI agents over there who were in charge of the Russia
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.720]  investigations period not just this investigation all manufacture this fake
[23:31.720 --> 23:36.800]  garbage and they knew it was fake and the judges had to recuse themselves because
[23:36.800 --> 23:40.360]  that was fake the whole thing's fake and now they've got all these congressmen
[23:40.360 --> 23:47.640]  coming out saying the most incredible things ever look at this this is Jim
[23:47.640 --> 23:51.600]  Jordan house judiciary committee grills deputy attorney general Americans
[23:51.600 --> 23:55.160]  believe that the Comey FBI and the Obama Justice Department worked with one
[23:55.160 --> 24:00.960]  campaign to go after the other campaign that just happened a little while ago and
[24:00.960 --> 24:04.800]  I've got a bunch of other clips that I'm gonna get to when we come back in the
[24:04.800 --> 24:11.720]  next segment I'm gonna go right to it but I just up front want to say that this
[24:11.720 --> 24:15.160]  is not something that's instant gratification everybody just wants a
[24:15.160 --> 24:20.400]  better roses right now we are having if you look at political time spans we're
[24:20.400 --> 24:24.800]  getting instant delivery right now of globalism falling apart a prosperity
[24:24.800 --> 24:30.040]  coming back of tyrants being unmasked of incredible things happening if you
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.880]  want to see incredible victory you're seeing that's why the enemy through
[24:35.880 --> 24:43.280]  everything they could at Roy Moore and manufactured all that garbage and and
[24:43.280 --> 24:47.520]  said he was gonna lose by 10 15 points to create a bandwagon effect and the
[24:47.520 --> 24:51.400]  judge said oh no we're erasing all the digital files I mean how creepy is that
[24:51.400 --> 24:56.920]  to have the big Democrat judge over the state election Commission say we're
[24:56.920 --> 25:02.080]  getting rid of the computer files as soon as the polls close you know like why
[25:02.080 --> 25:06.800]  would you say that just hide it in plain view they've never done that before last
[25:06.800 --> 25:09.960]  night I look that up and they don't do that they keep it for several years it's
[25:09.960 --> 25:16.520]  like why why would you announce that there it is Alabama Supreme Court blocks
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.640]  order to preserve digital voting records digital is not even like paper it's
[25:21.640 --> 25:29.000]  basically free you can save the whole election on a thumb drive no no no imagine
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.360]  you go to the bank you're gonna deposit $10,000 and they say oh by the way we're
[25:33.360 --> 25:35.960]  not gonna let you keep a record you put this in there I can give you a receipt
[25:35.960 --> 25:41.520]  you said well that sounds like your plan to steal my money and the final hour
[25:41.520 --> 25:50.160]  court rules that Alabama can destroy digital voting records after all and the
[25:50.160 --> 25:55.000]  judge said we're getting rid of them the next day or right when the polls close
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.800]  oh that's not suspicious at all alabamans you don't get to vote for who you
[26:00.800 --> 26:04.520]  want you don't get to thumb your nose at the outside powers and the globalist
[26:04.520 --> 26:07.600]  and I don't knock New Yorkers they're great people and folks in California but
[26:07.600 --> 26:13.040]  they're all you know running down the hayseeds and oh you dumb alabamans how
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.240]  you like that now we're gonna destroy the records and we're gonna run ads saying
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.280]  we're publishing your names and having young women say we're gonna say you're a
[26:22.280 --> 26:25.120]  pedophile we're gonna play that ad coming up to that maybe I should play a
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.760]  little bit of that ad right now because that is the nastiness of the nastiness
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.480]  the nastiness of the Democratic pedophile party with all their corruption
[26:35.480 --> 26:43.840]  all their evil and all their admissions to point their finger at you and to say
[26:44.200 --> 26:49.360]  that we're gonna publish just like these to publish until they got sued
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.520]  newspapers would publish the names of concealed carry people in the town great
[26:54.520 --> 26:58.680]  tell who's got a gun where they live like they're bad people oh want to go
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.160]  steal guns you know go to this house during the holiday see if there's a

[27:07.360 --> 27:13.480]  this is the harassment this is the garbage and people are sick of it
[27:13.480 --> 27:18.400]  Alabama voters are upset that the court says we destroyed the voting records
[27:18.400 --> 27:25.440]  more buried under TV ad barrage and a bunch of so-called conservative neo
[27:25.440 --> 27:33.120]  congress bought ads also saying terrible things pro Doug Jones super PAC using
[27:33.120 --> 27:39.120]  voter intimidation tactics ad claims your vote is public record
[27:39.120 --> 27:46.320]  wow let's let's let's play part of that ad going on to break your daughter your
[27:46.320 --> 27:54.160]  sister what if she was 16 years old or 15 or even 14 would you let a 32 year old

[28:01.400 --> 28:09.480]  what Roy Moore did he called it dating we call it unacceptable that's why we
[28:09.480 --> 28:21.440]  can't support Roy Moore and none of that's even been proven it's amazing
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.680]  we're gonna go to break and come back and get to the real victory that they
[28:27.680 --> 28:31.600]  have been caught committing all these crimes in the Russia gate to overthrow

[28:35.960 --> 28:40.200]  from Sanders they just stole the election from more in Alabama's but you

[33:28.880 --> 33:58.160]  I'm Alex Jones your host exposing the globalists of the underbelly of
[33:58.160 --> 34:04.040]  Hollywood the New World Order satanic pedophile worldwide network and the
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.640]  swamp thinks it's had a big victory in Alabama it hasn't I'm gonna break the
[34:08.640 --> 34:14.800]  fraud down the election was clearly stolen by a trifecta of fake polls saying
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.640]  war was 10 to 15 points behind when he lost by half a point that creates a
[34:18.640 --> 34:22.080]  fake bandwagon effect to make people feel like they're gonna be losers if they
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.080]  go for who they really want that probably pulled five points that fraud
[34:26.080 --> 34:29.000]  historically we know that's all that works they admit it it's in the wiki
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.840]  leaks they tried it with Trump people broke through the conditioning and
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.160]  that's why one telling people we're gonna say you're a child molester and
[34:37.160 --> 34:44.440]  publish your name in the newspaper with TV ads if you don't come out and vote
[34:44.440 --> 34:49.920]  for Jones and then of course election fraud having folks vote in the names of
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.400]  dead people we know that's a Democrat specialty they were throwing everything
[34:53.400 --> 34:57.040]  they could into this in Alabama is famous for Democrats cheating in
[34:57.040 --> 35:00.080]  elections so this is all about frustrating the willing American people
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.240]  after they've had eight other special elections federal elections that
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.760]  Democrats lost even though they throw all that money behind it they were
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.840]  desperate for a victory and that's what this was all about desperate for a
[35:16.840 --> 35:22.280]  victory desperate for something and that's what they're trying to do but
[35:22.280 --> 35:25.400]  getting back to the really really big news I want to go to a clip of
[35:25.400 --> 35:29.520]  congressman Jim Jordan Republican Ohio grills just your committee deputy

[36:14.440 --> 36:22.240]  this powerful video from congressman Jim Jordan here it is from Ohio mr. Jordan
[36:22.240 --> 36:26.640]  for five minutes did the FBI pay Christopher Steele and was the dossier
[36:26.640 --> 36:30.760]  the basis for securing warrants at the FISA court to spy on Americans
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.440]  associated with the Trump campaign really when you sum it all up it boils it
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.280]  boils down to those fundamental questions did you pay the guy who wrote it and did
[36:39.280 --> 36:42.640]  you use what he wrote disproven discredited dossier paid for by the
[36:42.640 --> 36:45.960]  Clinton campaign did you use it to go get warrants to spy on Americans that's
[36:45.960 --> 36:50.200]  what it comes down to and you're the guy can answer those questions and I was
[36:50.200 --> 36:53.080]  convinced yesterday I was convinced that the answer those questions was probably
[36:53.080 --> 36:58.520]  yes but today I'm even more convinced the answer is yes based on the text
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.160]  messages we got to read early this morning mr. Rosenstein you know Peter
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.840]  Strock you familiar with that name yes I'm through the name and former deputy
[37:07.840 --> 37:12.760]  head of counterintelligence at the FBI Peter Strock that one I don't know it's
[37:12.760 --> 37:15.920]  precise title but yes he had a significant role in Peter Strock ran the
[37:15.920 --> 37:20.120]  Clinton campaign it was abiding Clinton changed the back it up 15 seconds for
[37:20.120 --> 37:23.240]  me this is so powerful remember this same congressman last week we played the
[37:23.240 --> 37:28.680]  clip four or five times so powerful we never do that he said you know I wonder
[37:28.680 --> 37:34.840]  if mr. Strock's the one that took the fusion GPS dossier to get the get the
[37:34.840 --> 37:38.760]  fake warrant these guys all have security clearances they already know they just
[37:38.760 --> 37:45.200]  can't release it and we knew this a long time ago just from my sources that it
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.120]  was all a Clinton op and that's how they did it and they use the dossier to get
[37:48.120 --> 37:53.240]  the fake warrant for the parallel construction but this is incredible
[37:53.240 --> 37:59.000]  Rosenstein's involved with uranium one he's involved in everything and here he
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.080]  is trying to play dumb when they set up this whole fraudulent criminal
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.280]  conspiracy that's being blown open in front of everyone that's why they're so
[38:08.280 --> 38:12.800]  scared that's why they're so shrill let's go back Peter Strock that one I
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.840]  don't know it's precise title but yes he had a significant role in Peter Strock
[38:16.840 --> 38:19.760]  ran the Clinton campaign interviewed Mills abiding Clinton changed the
[38:19.760 --> 38:23.560]  exoneration letter from gross negligence to extreme Carol is Peter Strock who
[38:23.560 --> 38:26.640]  ran the Russian investigation interviewed Mike Flynn Peter Strock selected
[38:26.640 --> 38:33.680]  by mr. Mueller to be on his team that Peter Strock we learned had all these
[38:33.680 --> 38:37.960]  text messages we got to read some of them the early this morning now as my
[38:37.960 --> 38:41.200]  colleagues to point out some of them are you know they're sure we didn't like
[38:41.200 --> 38:44.880]  Trump he and Miss Page are exchanging text messages back and forth so they
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.120]  don't like the president but that's nothing new everyone on Mueller's team
[38:49.120 --> 38:52.880]  no one on Mueller's team likes Trump we already knew that but I want to focus on
[38:52.880 --> 38:59.800]  one in particular one in particular and this this is a text message from Mr.
[38:59.800 --> 39:04.680]  Strock to Miss Page recalling a conversation and a meeting that took
[39:04.680 --> 39:10.240]  place in Andy Andrew McCabe's office deputy director of the FBI recalling a
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.200]  meeting earlier and mr. Strock says this I want to believe the path you
[39:14.200 --> 39:19.160]  threw out for consideration in Andy's office then there's a break dash it
[39:19.160 --> 39:22.720]  says that there's no way he gets elected no way Trump gets elected he says I
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.600]  want to believe that you said that in the meeting in Andrew McCabe's office I
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.760]  want to believe that but then he goes but I'm afraid we can't take that risk
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.560]  but this goes to intent he says we can't take the risk at you know the people
[39:36.560 --> 39:39.360]  of this great country might elect Donald Trump president we can't take this
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.440]  risk this is Peter Strock head of counterintelligence at the FBI this is
[39:44.440 --> 39:48.240]  Peter Strock who I think had a hand in that dossier that was all dressed up and
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.800]  taken to the FISA court he's saying we can't take the risk we have to do
[39:52.800 --> 39:59.160]  something about it but don't forget the timeline here either mr. Rosenstein
[39:59.160 --> 40:04.160]  Peter Strock January 10th he's the guy who changes the exoneration letter from
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.360]  gross negligence criminal standard to extreme carelessness stop again back it
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.860]  up again 10 seconds you understand they've got the whole chain the
[40:13.860 --> 40:18.400]  president has all the NSA stuff all the spy grids they've been using on him he
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.160]  can now because they're the ones that recorded it and put it in the files they
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.080]  can go pull them up and what did Roger Stone call for two months ago on this
[40:27.080 --> 40:35.200]  show a new special counsel to investigate these guys but I tend to
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.760]  agree that the inspector general's office are the ones finally exposing all
[40:39.760 --> 40:43.200]  this and finally doing a good job that they've got the constitutional duty is
[40:43.200 --> 40:46.840]  some rogue group over here like Mueller or some group that can be gotten to and
[40:46.840 --> 40:51.680]  intimidated let's continue but don't forget the timeline here either mr. Rosenstein
[40:51.680 --> 40:57.120]  Peter Strock January 10th he's the guy who changes the exoneration letter from
[40:57.120 --> 41:02.520]  gross negligence criminal standard to extreme carelessness July 2nd he's the
[41:02.520 --> 41:07.280]  guy who sets in on the Clinton interview July 5th 2016 that's when Comey has the
[41:07.280 --> 41:09.800]  press conference says we're not gonna prosecute Clinton's okay we're not gonna
[41:09.800 --> 41:16.520]  prosecute and then August 2016 we have this text message the same month that
[41:16.520 --> 41:22.400]  the Russian investigation is opened at the FBI August 2016 and my guess is
[41:22.400 --> 41:27.800]  that's the same month that the application was taken to the FISA court to
[41:27.800 --> 41:35.240]  get the warrants to spy on Americans using this dossier that Clinton campaign
[41:35.240 --> 41:42.520]  paid for Democrats paid for fake news all dressed up taken to the court so I
[41:42.520 --> 41:45.440]  got really just a couple basic questions because it seems to me if the
[41:45.440 --> 41:50.480]  answer to any of these of those two questions if the answer is yes if you
[41:50.480 --> 41:54.560]  guys paid Christopher Steele at the same time the Democrats and the Clinton
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.640]  campaign were painting or if you took the dossier dress it all up took it to
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.920]  the FISA court and use that as the basis to get warrants and now we have intent
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.000]  in this in this text message saying that there's another text message my
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.640]  colleague represented earlier where mr. Strock says I can protect our country
[42:13.640 --> 42:18.560]  at many levels says it with all the humility he could muster I can protect
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.160]  our country at many levels this guy thought he was super agent James Bond
[42:22.160 --> 42:26.800]  at the FBI this is obvious all right it costs we're gonna come back with the
[42:26.800 --> 42:32.440]  powerful conclusion here and then the bumbling response of Rosenstein but let
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.720]  me tell you this congressman is unbelievable I've watched Jordan for a
[42:35.720 --> 42:40.120]  while he'd make a great present that guy make a grad that's the presidential
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.360]  material a guy smart on target focus he's he knows how to set these guys up
[42:44.360 --> 42:51.720]  and destroy the enemies of America I love it in Rosenstein all you idiots you
[42:51.720 --> 42:56.560]  want to fight you better believe you got one scum
[42:56.560 --> 43:01.360]  another former Facebook executive has come out against the social media giant
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.200]  former Facebook vice president Chomath Paliha Patia revealed that he feels
[43:05.200 --> 43:08.680]  tremendous guilt over his role in heading a company which is aiding the
[43:08.680 --> 43:12.520]  destruction of society he believes social media networks are employing tools
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.600]  that are destroying society's social fabric pointing to the insatiable need
[43:16.600 --> 43:21.160]  for hearts likes and thumbs up you don't realize it but you are being programmed
[43:21.160 --> 43:25.800]  he also highlighted the way social media is able to manipulate mob mentality by
[43:25.800 --> 43:29.800]  referring to an incident in which seven Indian people were lynched due to a
[43:29.800 --> 43:34.160]  WhatsApp hoax that's what we're dealing with he said imagine taking that to the
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.560]  extreme where bad actors can now manipulate large swaths of people to do
[43:38.560 --> 43:42.880]  anything you want similar to tech giants before him Paliha Patia says his
[43:42.880 --> 43:47.080]  children are not allowed to use Facebook and he recommends the rest of us take a
[43:47.080 --> 43:50.920]  hard break from the app I've just removed all social media apps and games
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.400]  from my phone and surprisingly I've got a lot more free time

[47:23.640 --> 47:32.520]  the second third and fourth hours today we're gonna go right back to the
[47:32.520 --> 47:37.800]  congressman jim jordan just so dramatic you never see the FBI or just
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.640]  department grilled like this because they can set you up they'll put you in
[47:41.640 --> 47:45.040]  prison they'll send the IRS after congress members that to speak out
[47:45.040 --> 47:47.960]  against that's why everybody's so scared of them they turn to the Victorian
[47:47.960 --> 47:52.320]  Guard in this country and it is a shameful collection of horrible
[47:52.320 --> 47:57.280]  criminals at the top I mean just the FBI at the top is is lakosa nostri in
[47:57.280 --> 47:59.880]  America strangely enough though the average FBI
[47:59.880 --> 48:04.680]  tries to save kidnapped kids or it's fighting bank robbie or like mr. goody
[48:04.680 --> 48:09.200]  two shoes the best folks out there I've got this from highest levels FBI highest
[48:09.200 --> 48:14.160]  level CIA highest level folks that you know have been deputy directors in the
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.560]  FBI okay that there's white hats there's black hats and for decades they had some
[48:19.560 --> 48:23.040]  white hats and some black hats at the top they got all black hats at the top
[48:23.040 --> 48:29.840]  now and man they would do anything at Chinese money Russian money EU money
[48:29.840 --> 48:34.200]  corporate I mean the crimes are just they all protect each other and they have
[48:34.200 --> 48:38.360]  these big law firms that sign off on it and stuff it's like Enron had and it's
[48:38.360 --> 48:45.600]  just crazy they make Bernie Madoff look like an angel but now to see congressman
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.200]  coming out a bunch of and say we got you and forcing them to turn over the
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.040]  documents and it's just worse than that they'd even said last week in hearings
[48:54.040 --> 49:00.920]  I mean this was a group of Clinton zealots manufacturing fraud lying about
[49:00.920 --> 49:06.640]  it using illegal wiretaps to get real wiretaps intercepts and then leaking it
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.680]  to the press I mean there's so many crimes here and then lying to Congress
[49:10.680 --> 49:13.920]  Comey and Mueller lied to Congress about the investigation I mean they all need to
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.560]  go to prison if you really want to clean house and end all this there's no
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.040]  bigger fans you see Nadler Matthews well a lot of the FBI is battling the
[49:22.040 --> 49:27.560]  Democrats and you want to get political yeah the FBI that aren't pedophiles so
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.360]  this is a real war in America the FBI is not the enemy the Justice Department
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.600]  signed the enemy these are our institutions but they've been taken
[49:34.600 --> 49:39.040]  over they've been hijacked folks it's that simple I'm gonna try to shut up just
[49:39.040 --> 49:41.320]  let him finish up with this piece of testimony because I want to play the
[49:41.320 --> 49:45.040]  other clip from last week where he said I got a feeling this is the case then
[49:45.040 --> 49:49.760]  this week we have all the documents he's already got them all here let's
[49:49.760 --> 49:54.360]  continue our country at many levels says it with all the humility he could
[49:54.360 --> 49:59.320]  muster I can protect our country at many levels this guy thought he was super
[49:59.320 --> 50:04.880]  agent James Bond at the FBI this is obvious I'm afraid we can't take that
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.120]  risk we can't there's no way we can let the American people make Donald Trump
[50:08.120 --> 50:13.960]  the next president I got to protect our country this is unbelievable and I'm
[50:13.960 --> 50:17.400]  here to tell you Mr. Rosenstein I think the public trust in this whole thing is
[50:17.400 --> 50:23.520]  gone so see me you got two things you can do you're the guy in charge you're
[50:23.520 --> 50:26.400]  the guy to pick Mueller you're the guy who wrote the memo saying why he needed
[50:26.400 --> 50:30.880]  to fire Comey you're the guy in charge you could disband the Mueller special
[50:30.880 --> 50:34.720]  prosecutor and you can do what we've all called for appoint a second special
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.880]  counsel to look into this to look into Peter struck Bruce or everything else
[50:38.880 --> 50:44.240]  we've learned in the last several weeks it pause back it up I just got to tell
[50:44.240 --> 50:50.080]  you where'd you hear about a new special counsel first is right here and we're
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.240]  gonna debate that with Roger Stone I forgot to tell you guys Roger Stone he
[50:55.240 --> 50:58.200]  wants to come on the third hour I forgot to tell you know we got another guest on
[50:58.200 --> 51:02.920]  there so we'll do 30 minutes with one guest and have stone on but I mean why
[51:02.920 --> 51:08.520]  well why not use the inspector general they're the ones that are finally doing
[51:08.520 --> 51:10.760]  something I think that's the proof they're doing what they're supposed to I
[51:10.760 --> 51:14.720]  mean they've uncovered Matt they're caught folks I mean this is unbelievable
[51:14.720 --> 51:17.920]  let's continue you're the guy who wrote the memo saying why he needed to fire
[51:17.920 --> 51:22.720]  Comey you're the guy in charge you can disband the Mueller special prosecutor
[51:22.720 --> 51:26.960]  and you can do what we've all called for appoint a second special counsel to look
[51:26.960 --> 51:30.680]  into this to look into Peter struck Bruce or everything else we've learned in
[51:30.680 --> 51:38.000]  the last several weeks yes congressman and I can assure you that I considered
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.440]  very important to make sure the thorough review is done and our inspector general
[51:42.440 --> 51:45.320]  is doing a thorough review that's how we found those text messages as part of that
[51:45.320 --> 51:48.080]  review let me at you've said you've given that answer like 15 times let me
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.480]  ask you this are you concerned I mean this is what a lot of Americans are
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.520]  believing right now and I certainly do oh hey boss the Comey FBI they wouldn't
[51:56.520 --> 52:01.680]  release all this inspector general stuff till Congress have painted it now the
[52:01.680 --> 52:04.800]  FBI did two weeks ago go ahead and post on their site the beginning of this so
[52:04.800 --> 52:08.320]  I again I'm I don't know is it a inspector general because they look
[52:08.320 --> 52:11.240]  they're starting to do their job or is it the special prosecutor or let's
[52:11.240 --> 52:15.600]  continue and the Obama Justice Department worked with one campaign to go
[52:15.600 --> 52:19.240]  after the other campaign that's what everything points to think about what
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.560]  we've learned in the last several weeks we first learned they paid for the
[52:22.560 --> 52:26.440]  dossier then we learn about Peter struck and last week we learned about Bruce
[52:26.440 --> 52:31.440]  Orr and his wife now I mean this is unbelievable so what's it going to take
[52:31.440 --> 52:36.080]  to get a second special counsel to answer these questions and find out was
[52:36.080 --> 52:40.160]  Peter struck really up to what I think he was I think it's important to
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.440]  understand Congressman we have an inspector general has 500 employees and
[52:44.440 --> 52:48.160]  a hundred million dollar budget and this is what he does he investigates
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.280]  allegations of misconduct involving department employees that review that he
[52:52.280 --> 52:56.320]  is conducting is what turned up those text messages it will also involve
[52:56.320 --> 52:59.840]  interviews of those persons and of other witnesses we're looking forward to his
[52:59.840 --> 53:02.960]  report and we've met with mr. Horowitz and we're anxiously awaiting that
[53:02.960 --> 53:06.720]  report but that doesn't dismiss the fact that the country thinks we need a
[53:06.720 --> 53:09.720]  second special counsel 20 members of this committee the judiciary committee
[53:09.720 --> 53:12.320]  with primary jurisdiction over the Justice Department thinks we need a
[53:12.320 --> 53:15.800]  second special counsel all kinds of senators think we need a special counsel
[53:15.800 --> 53:21.080]  and what fact pattern do you have to have what kind of text message do you
[53:21.080 --> 53:24.120]  have to see before you say it's time for a second special counsel I want to assure
[53:24.120 --> 53:27.920]  you congressman I think the attorney general explained we take very seriously
[53:27.920 --> 53:31.640]  the concerns of 20 members this committee or one member of this committee
[53:31.640 --> 53:35.080]  but we have a responsibility to make an independent determination and we will
[53:35.080 --> 53:38.120]  pause again
[53:41.000 --> 53:47.360]  homing and Mueller into different criminal investigations on servers and
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.640]  we're uranium wine and all this other stuff on the Clintons as FBI directors
[53:51.640 --> 54:02.720]  they did that and then it gets worse because you could have the president fire
[54:02.720 --> 54:06.740]  the FBI director they wanted to but we just leave all this in place and he
[54:06.740 --> 54:11.280]  says oh we're just going to continue on when they're the ones that criminally
[54:11.280 --> 54:14.240]  ended the Hillary investigation because they felt like it's the Justice
[54:14.240 --> 54:17.760]  Department and any legal tarmac meetings but he's acting like when they're in the
[54:17.760 --> 54:21.440]  middle of this giant debacle or they've been caught red-handed that they're just
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.720]  going to go ahead with it all because it just doesn't matter and everybody will
[54:24.720 --> 54:29.840]  forget about it next week go ahead I want to assure you congressman I think the
[54:29.840 --> 54:34.060]  attorney general explained we take very seriously the concerns of 20 members this
[54:34.060 --> 54:37.200]  committee or one member of this committee but we have a responsibility to
[54:37.200 --> 54:43.400]  make an independent determination and we will thank the chair the chair
[54:43.400 --> 54:48.400]  recognizes and again let's read that quote did the FBI pay Christopher Steele
[54:48.400 --> 54:51.800]  and was the dossier the basis for securing warrants for the FISA court
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.640]  spy on Americans associated with the Trump campaign and this is beyond any
[54:56.640 --> 55:06.600]  movie beyond Perry Mason I mean this is just sensational and then when they cut
[55:06.600 --> 55:12.280]  is it still going when they cut to the Democrats they'll just bring up the
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.960]  racism and other Republicans and we need investigations of Trump for hurting
[55:16.960 --> 55:23.520]  women and by the way Trump did a bad job on the response to the hurricanes it
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.360]  has I've never seen them have hearings where they just totally bypass all this
[55:27.360 --> 55:32.040]  and just cover other issues they don't even try to prop up the DOJ or prop up
[55:32.040 --> 55:38.040]  their minion they just engage in this behavior I'll play it coming up in the
[55:38.040 --> 55:44.160]  next little segment congressman Jim Jordan last week but I'm really a fan of
[55:44.160 --> 55:47.920]  that guy tenacious everything's just amazing he's awesome every time I see
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.000]  him over the years just does an amazing job so that I've been a fan but I'm
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.360]  really a really a big fan because we say you're going up against the mafia when
[55:55.360 --> 55:58.520]  you ask questions like that and I do it every day it's just good to see other

[59:55.000 --> 01:00:24.480]  Well Jim Jordan is asking questions that I've seen like people like Congressman
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.600]  Hanson asked back in the 90s the IRS had dotted him and drove him around for six
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:37.280]  months in federal buses till his feet exploded they call it deceling they drive
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.240]  you all day 16 hours to another federal president take you out chain you back up
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.360]  make you crap all over yourself it's one of the worst forms of torture there is
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.040]  like being chained up to a wall that's why I admire people like that because
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.000]  that's what makes the world go around is men that are willing to stand up against
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:07.080]  scum they're good men and they're bad men in this world and I really want to see
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:16.720]  the bad men defeated and I'm sick of them and I'm sick of how their little
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.960]  cowardly chicken neck pieces of filth and I hope God kills them all
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:35.640]  and God will let's go to Congressman Jim Jordan last week predicting everything
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.560]  that's now come true in documents released last night as the Democrats
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.520]  crap all over their treasonous pedophile pants there all kinds of story
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.480]  political fact reported 96% of the top lawyers contributions went to Clinton
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.240]  or Obama but Peters struck the guy who ran the Clinton investigation interviewed
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.200]  Mills Aberdeen interviewed Secretary Clinton changed gross negligence a crime
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.080]  to the term extreme carelessness who ran the Russian investigation who
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.320]  interviewed Mike Flynn gets put on Mueller's team and then he gets kicked
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:12.480]  off for a text message that's anti-trump if he kicked everybody off
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.560]  Mueller's team who is anti-trump I don't think there be anybody left so here
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:22.040]  there's got to be something more here it can't just be some text messages that
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.960]  show a pro-Clinton anti-trump bias there's got to be something more and I'm
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.320]  trying to figure out what it is but my hunch is it has something to do with
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:38.240]  the dossier director did Peter struck help produce and present the
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.520]  application to the FISA court to secure a warrant to spy on Americans
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.600]  associated with the Trump campaign a congressman I'm not prepared to discuss
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.400]  anything about a FISA process in this we're not talking about what happened
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.640]  in the court we're talking about what the FBI took to the court the
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.320]  application did Peter struck was he involved in taking that to the court
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.880]  I'm not going to discuss in this setting anything to do with the FISA court
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.360]  applications well let's let's remember a couple things director and I know you
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.320]  know this we've we've all been made aware of this in the last few weeks let's
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.440]  remember a couple things about the dossier the Democrat National Committee
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:21.080]  in the Clinton campaign which we now know we're one in the same paid the law firm
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:30.160]  who paid Fusion GPS who paid Christopher Steel who then paid Russians to put
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.880]  together a report that we call a dossier full of all kinds of fake news
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.880]  national inquire garbage and it's been reported that this dossier was all
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.600]  dressed up by the FBI taken to the FISA court and presented as a legitimate
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.960]  intelligence document that it became the basis for granting a warrant to spy on
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:58.200]  Americans I'm wondering I'm wondering if that actually took place it sure looks
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.400]  like it did and the easiest way to clear it up is for you guys to tell us what
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.760]  was in that application and who took it there congressman our staffs have been
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.120]  having extensive interaction with both intelligence committees on our
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.160]  interaction with the FISA court and I think that's the appropriate setting for
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  those questions here's what I think director Ray I think Peter struck head
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.960]  of counterintelligence at the FBI Peter struck the guy who ran the Clinton
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:30.880]  investigation did all the interviews Peter struck the guy who was running the
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:37.120]  Russian investigation at the FBI Peter struck Mr. Super Agent at the FBI I
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.800]  think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA court and if
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:47.240]  that happened I mean think if this happened if you had the FBI working with
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:54.080]  a campaign the Democrats campaign take an opposition research dressing it all up
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:00.640]  and turn it into top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:07.080]  toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat sick and
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.720]  stupid so what do we do about it well for starters don't just sit there and

[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.080]  usually cover congressional hearings I like to talk I like to cover a lot of
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.880]  news like take your calls have a lot of guests but I've bumped some guests and
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.520]  move some guests today because the ongoing congressional hearings of the
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:42.600]  Democratic Party operative deputy AG that created the whole avenue for
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.400]  Mueller to set up this fake investigation he has just been grilled by
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.840]  Congressman Jim Jordan he's been grilled and absolutely impeached by the
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:07:02.440]  chairman Bob Goodlite it has just been epic so I'm gonna play a mr. Mr. Gowdy
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:09.160]  trade Gowdy former prosecutor tearing into him but let me just tell you when
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:14.160]  you get government agencies caught politically in text messages and
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.800]  emails saying we can't let Trump be president we got to make something up
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:25.880]  and then they hire people from the GPS group and it's the wife of the head of
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.320]  the Justice Department Russia operation and the judges involved and has to
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:39.320]  accuse themselves I mean this is sin sational so just like Nixon recorded people
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.920]  with the tapes to have dirt on them the tapes got him and it's the same thing
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.960]  here the criminal wiretaps before they didn't get warrants on they lot about
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:56.200]  then getting false info to get the fake wiretaps because then they put up when I
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.880]  say fake wiretaps they would use wiretaps and then say they found things in
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.160]  those that weren't there and then leaked back to the press and then when they get
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.200]  the transcripts it's not even what was said transcripts show Trump getting
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.920]  orders from Putin blah blah blah then the transcripts are when he's president
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.920]  elect need to back off from military strong we'll take out ISIS don't respond
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:24.360]  to our sanctions and Russia's like okay that's what you're supposed to do as a
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.640]  president it's it's like amazing how much they respect it so this whole thing
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.960]  is just unbelievable and then again the wife of the Justice Department head of
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.920]  the Russia operation all Russian investigations run by this one guy or
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:45.840]  his wife's the deputy of Fusion GPS and then millions of dollars in additional
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.800]  what two million is given by the Justice Department from the husband to the
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:57.680]  wife at Fusion GPS and then she admits in the emails that they've now been
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.560]  forced to give them last night that they've been holding back under threat
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.160]  of contempt to Congress and she's in there going yeah we understand I'm meant
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:11.360]  to do this with the money I meant to take Trump out that's in mainstream news
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:19.800]  today I mean just giving money to your wife at some flimsy fake intelligence
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.400]  shop that was 13 million we know of you really think they paid 13 million to say
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.800]  that women here and at it on Trump in a Moscow hotel or St. Petersburg when it
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:36.880]  was that's the payoff to all the people to lie it's the payoff to the FBI agents
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.160]  and the just in fact in fact no one's even seeing this I'm gonna tell you now
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:48.360]  the big smoking gun of all these smoking guns the big one the hundred
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:55.640]  millimeter cannon you know on the big battleship Arizona is that this guy was
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.240]  over the entire Russia investigation and all things Russia at the Justice
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.080]  Department he was at the head of the Russia desk of the Justice Department or
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:09.200]  his wife is already at Fusion GPS already getting Democrat money they get
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.560]  millions and millions more as it's transferred to them and she's paid money
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:26.880]  and bonuses it's now coming out on that so they were paid for the frame up we're
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:33.160]  gonna go to Trey Gowdy right now but again ladies and gentlemen you realize
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:39.400]  that you realize they use the tax payer money for the Justice Department head of
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.240]  the Russia desk to say we need to pay a couple extra million dollars they've
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.600]  only made 11 million that's not enough they need 2 million more for the PP gate
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:55.120]  dossier while his wife is running the piss gate operation you got millions
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:04.160]  going to this guy's wife and company and see why is no one wargaming this no
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.440]  one has said that till I said that and I don't want to be the one that keeps
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:15.160]  figuring the stuff out but do you do you see that let's go to Trey Gowdy
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.440]  there are a lot of issues that I would like to ask you about Mr. Deputy
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.920]  Attorney General we had a terrorist incident in New York this week we have
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.400]  702 reauthorization that is pending in Congress gun violence the opioid
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.160]  epidemic criminal justice reform but when I go home to South Carolina this
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.640]  weekend trust me when I tell you no one is gonna ask me about any of those
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.800]  issues they're gonna ask me what in the hell is going on with the Department of
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.560]  Justice and the FBI the reason we have special counsel this is a very important
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.760]  point there and you know it the reason we have special counsel is because of a
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  conflict of interest the regulation itself specifically makes reference to a
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.680]  conflict of interest and and we don't like conflicts of interest because it
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:08.080]  undercuts people's confidence in both the process and the result so so let's be
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.960]  really clear why we have special counsel there was either a real or
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.880]  perceived conflict of interest that we were fearful would either impact the
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:23.120]  result or people's confidence in the process that's why we have something
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  called special counsel and that's why we have special counsel in this fact
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:33.080]  pattern and then lo and behold those who are supposed to make sure there are no
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.160]  conflicts of interest seem to have a few of their own there's a senior
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:47.080]  prosecutor who said of sequious emails to a fact witness I she can be described
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.200]  as nothing other than a fact witness she's a really important fact witness if
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.080]  you pursue the line of inquiry that my Democrat friends want to pursue
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.720]  they got off of collusion and now they're on obstruction of justice she
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:07.000]  may be the most important fact witness in an obstruction of justice case and the
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.200]  senior prosecutor for this conflict of interest free special counsel sent a
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:17.840]  phoning of sequious email to a fact witness and then we have prosecutors
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.720]  assigned to conduct this investigation who donated almost exclusively to one
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.520]  candidate over another and then we have a prosecutor assigned to this conflict of
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.360]  interest free team that attended what was supposed to be what he'd hoped to be a
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.800]  victory party for secretary Clinton and we have a senior DOJ official mr.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.000]  deputy attorney general with an office that used to be two doors down from
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.600]  yours wife was on the payroll of fusion GPS and then we have a senior agent
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.800]  assigned to investigate secretary Clinton's email help draft the exoneration
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.400]  letter will we change the language from a grossly negligent to extremely careless
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.320]  interviewed secretary Clinton and an interview I've never seen and I doubt you
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.680]  have either in your career as a prosecutor interviewed Michael Flynn was
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.320]  actively involved in the investigation into the trunk campaign before the
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:21.360]  inspector general found his text so this agent in the middle of almost everything
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.960]  related to secretary Clinton and president Trump sent pro-clinic tax
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:33.800]  anti-trump tax to his paramour in response to being told maybe he is
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.960]  where he is to protect the country from that menace Donald Trump he said I can
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:45.000]  protect our country at many levels and then he said Hillary Clinton should win
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  100 million to nothing I think about that mr. deputy attorney general that's a
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.280]  pretty overwhelming victory 100 million to zero and when I read that last night
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:02.000]  what I thought was this conflict of interest free senior agent in the FBI
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.920]  can't think of a single solitary American who would vote for Donald Trump
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:12.040]  that's where this zero comes in not a single solitary American he can imagine
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.600]  would that's right they're saying we're not human we're gonna come back and play
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.120]  the rest of this powerful testimony it just gets more incredible because it's
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.080]  so truthful it's veritas this is the arrogance of the people that have hijacked
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.880]  our country this is the arrogance of these
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.800]  globals that think they're invincible that they'd be in emails and text messages
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.640]  saying all this and most of them are on the Russian payroll or the Chinese
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:42.160]  communist payroll or you know other things even worse and it is just insane how
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.160]  these beta weirdos get into power and always think they're invincible till

[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.880]  Democrats are purging their own perverts to weaponize the me too movement in
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.840]  order to take out their opponents now former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly is
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.040]  predicting a huge onslaught against President Trump in January based around
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.480]  fake accusations of sexual assault O'Reilly says there's an audio tape of
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.760]  an anti-Trump person offering two hundred thousand dollars to a woman to
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.080]  accuse Donald Trump of untoward behavior O'Reilly says Trump knows about the tape
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.880]  and he should be drawing attention to it to highlight how the entire raft of
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.320]  sexual assault allegations against him is an industry that there are false
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.320]  charges and money changing hands O'Reilly says Democrats now feel they
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:39.240]  must go all-in to destroy Trump because he has a good chance of getting
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.480]  reelected it's funny how the mainstream media never got around to
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.320]  addressing the very serious allegations of sexual misconduct against Bill
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.760]  Clinton but with Hillary's chance at becoming the president nothing more than
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.640]  a pipe dream accusations of sexual assault are front-page news
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:20:13.160]  leon macadoo info wars.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:27.040]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones for example
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:56.160]  I will not let you down you will be very very impressed I hope I'm not gonna
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:04.960]  let America or my family or you or the president down president says to me last
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.400]  time I talked to him he said Alex and make it harder and harder for us to talk
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:15.200]  I want you to know this I want you to keep it up I want you to continue what
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.160]  you're doing and you've got my pledge I'm gonna keep it up as strong as I can
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:27.800]  and I'm not gonna let you down you're not letting us down isn't the media you'll
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.320]  probably have a heyday without that's the last time I talked to president but
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:41.400]  he said to me he said keep it up what you're doing and I'm gonna work as hard
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:50.840]  as I can as well you got that commitment and I don't think I'm gonna let you down so
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.640]  that's what's happening right now that's why they hate him they go he's an
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.880]  idiot we could buy him off a more power what why is he like these Americans
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.160]  don't deserve prosperity other countries we're the big global elites let's screw
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:10.960]  everybody he's doing what he says he'll do CNN Fox News MSNBC it's crazy
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:18.680]  I mean Donald Trump wouldn't sell out to the globalists he's not selling out to
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.520]  Russians they want to build a big hotel over there and he'll do it and he's not
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.000]  gonna sell out what he's doing for that they've taken hotels and golf courses and
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.280]  his pageants and his TV shows in this whole campaign probably it's like a
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.200]  billion dollars they say he's probably lost about somebody that absolutely loves
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.120]  money no he doesn't he likes winning against other people that want to shut
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.720]  him down and he sees America like in a mirror as himself as we all should that's
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.320]  what what it is and he's tired of it
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.360]  let's finish up a trade galley ahead of the guest joining us let's let's finish
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.880]  up this powerful testimony of the Congress was giving her it is conflict of
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.760]  interest-free senior agent of the FBI can't think of a single solitary American
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:11.240]  who would vote for Donald Trump that's where this zero comes in not a single
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:16.360]  solitary American he can imagine would vote for Donald Trump this is the
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.600]  conflict of interest-free special agent assigned and then he went on if that
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.320]  weren't enough to belittle Trump supporters by saying he could smell them
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:32.800]  at a Walmart in Virginia this is the person we needed to avoid a conflict of
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.560]  interest and then he said this they fully deserve to go and demonstrate the
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:43.000]  absolute bigoted nonsense of Trump but he wasn't content to just disparage
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.240]  Donald Trump he had to disparage Donald Trump's family this is what he said
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.600]  mr. deputy attorney general he said the douchebags are about to come out he's
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:58.280]  talking about our first lady and children this conflict of interest-free
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:04.920]  special agent of the FBI this is who we were told we needed to have an objective
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:10.480]  impartial fair conflict of interest-free investigation so he's openly pulling for
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.280]  the candidate he had a role in clearing and he's openly investigating a candidate
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.960]  that he has bias against and then if that's not enough he says Trump is an
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.680]  effing idiot what the f just happened to our country this is the same man that
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:32.760]  said he would save our country when they say their country they mean the
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.720]  globalist crime network that's their country America is the enemy they're
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.720]  fighting for over country that's what Obama said in speeches so again they're
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.800]  going to save their country to run our kids run our lives suck off of us that's
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.800]  their country the anti-america and so these are the emails coming out they've
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.800]  been holding back and the text messages doesn't make a presence he came out
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.640]  today and said you know his family his wife his kids they're horrible they to
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.960]  come out call Trump a pig that's coming up the next segment this is their
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.680]  hateful attitude let's continue what happens when people who are supposed to
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.240]  cure the conflict of interest have even greater conflicts of interest than
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.280]  those they replace that that's not a rhetorical question you nor I nor
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:22.680]  anyone else whatever said Peter struck on a jury we wouldn't have him
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:28.840]  objectively dispassionately investigate anything knowing what we know now why
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:33.400]  didn't we know it ahead of time and my last question my final question to you
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.280]  and I appreciate the chairman's patience how would you help me answer that
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.680]  question when I go back to South Carolina this weekend
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:47.880]  congressman first of all with regard to the special counsel mr. truck was
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.480]  already working on the investigation when the special counsel was appointed
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.120]  the appointment that I made was a Robert Muller so what I recommend that you
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.640]  tell your constituents is that Robert Muller and Rod Rosenstein and Chris
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.840]  Ray are accountable sure that no bias is reflected in any of the actions taken
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.680]  by the special counsel or in any matter within the jurisdiction when we have
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:17.920]  evidence of any inappropriate conduct you take action on it money I did here
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.880]  as soon as he learned about this issue he took action and that's what I
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.960]  anticipate that the rest of our prosecutors are new well that's the
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.000]  guy on the Russian payroll Rod Rosenstein let's shut up that Clinton
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.560]  turd that enough from him everything's fine forget the record conflict of
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.560]  interest total fraud fake dossiers the very people with the fake dossiers
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:45.200]  clearing Hillary forget about it everything's fine they're gonna save
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:53.440]  America by shutting us down and they're doing a good job censoring but Donald
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.880]  Trump and others are moving in to stop Google and Facebook and Twitter
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:02.280]  censorship so they're getting a big fat juicy wake-up call by the way I'm
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:09.000]  tired of big corporations taking holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas and
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.680]  turning into their own little corporate name to get away from what the
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.560]  tradition really was that's why I said why not just have Christmas week in the
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:23.160]  week leading up kicking off on the 11th running through for a week until the

[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:47.840]  or so and then I'm gonna get into great detail on a news wars.com article that
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:55.040]  just went live and I was aware of this and then we were researching it but it's
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.120]  all part of Hollywood trying to mainline pedophilia at the UN through
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.680]  Nambla and others and Nickelodeon sexualizing children this is a story
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.280]  by Clifford Cunningham it's on info wars.com as well this needs to go
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.800]  everywhere folks this needs to go top story out there I never beg drudge to
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.920]  link to our articles he just links wherever he wants but I think this is
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:17.040]  newsworthy even if you link to somebody else's about it but I haven't seen this
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.000]  anywhere else but info wars. Pito film takes Hollywood by storm amid wave of
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.960]  sexual assault allegations despite a wave of sexual assault allegations that
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.160]  have rock Hollywood film executives at Sony have decided to show a film
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.920]  depicting a relationship between a teenage boy and adult male a decision
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.880]  slammed by former child actor Corey Felden I mean there you go folks you
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:51.040]  can't make this up and this is the agenda LA blazing not about vagrants as
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.840]  homeless camps explode across the state it's another news war story joining us
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:01.240]  is David Seaman investigative journalist and author and follow him on
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:06.080]  YouTube at David Seaman online and he's here with us because he's one of the
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:10.720]  really balanced reporters out there who isn't just hyping it from from our
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:17.600]  research but actually covering it crypto currencies and look mainstream stuff is
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.960]  is all fiat this is crypto and then has privacy that's the real value and the
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.360]  code how it works I'm not a mathematician like some of these folks but again you
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:29.000]  can follow him on YouTube at David Seaman 160,000 subscribers just on YouTube
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.640]  there the cryptocurrency market is now worth more than JP Morgan CNBC
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:40.040]  Bitcoin market value is now larger than Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan RBC the
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:45.760]  cryptocurrency market could at the day be worth 10 trillion and it goes on a
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:52.280]  Litecoin Ethereum Bitcoin price surge leads alternatives to gain huge amounts
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.800]  of value Litecoin we're gonna get into all these with him because here's the
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.960]  thing if I study something I can kind of figure it out but then if I start
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.720]  wanting to invest in something I get obsessed with it so I don't watch sports
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.640]  why I don't invest because I want to just invest in news and know what's going
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.000]  on there so that's never invested in cryptocurrency even though I believe in
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.600]  the overall system in it because I don't want to give listeners bad advice so
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.520]  then I kind of stay a neophyte but that's why I've experts on like David
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.240]  Seaman so David I've got a lot of questions here if you're the expert
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.840]  you should out of the gates tells us most important it's just that I don't want
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.240]  to tell people get involved in something that's a giant bubble but good Lord
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.720]  Bitcoin is going on six years I had guests on that told people get into it
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.800]  I've had so many people thank me because they've invested a thousand dollars and
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.560]  you know made five billion dollars and I just think good Lord one time you know
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.400]  four years ago what's Max Kaiser was trying to give me a thousand dollars
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.240]  worth at some hotel in London I was too busy to go to my hotel and get my laptop
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.240]  because I just didn't want to get involved I didn't want to mess with it
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.640]  because I just I don't explain it it's like if I don't know something then I
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.440]  don't ever get involved I here's a I'm trying to get involved I want to know
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.480]  because now it's so big that I feel like an idiot does that make sense yeah it
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.920]  makes it makes total sense never turned down free coins from Max Kaiser but
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.480]  nobody wants to jump to a new system nobody wants to learn a new thing it
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.000]  took me a couple of interviews of interviewing different people in Bitcoin
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.120]  to actually come around to the conclusion that this thing is probably
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.560]  sound you know do I read computer code I really don't for the most part but
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:34.200]  thousands of people around the world from totally different backgrounds right
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.520]  big government crazies libertarians anarchists people who support Wiki
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:46.760]  leaks big bankers everybody in between Russians Chinese American people keep in
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  mind Bitcoin is global this phenomenon of people mining for crypto it's happening
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.880]  all over the world and so these thousands of people in different countries
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.680]  with different backgrounds they've all reviewed the computer code it's a hundred
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.920]  percent open source in the case of Bitcoin and like coin and Ethereum these
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.520]  are open source technologies so if you have a disagreement with how something
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.520]  runs just show us the line of code right so it definitely took me a lot of a
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.720]  lot of research to jump into it I didn't want to stake my name something that
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.280]  would go down in flames and for a couple of years the crypto markets really did
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.360]  nothing and a lot of people burnt out financially during that period of time
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:34.280]  crypto did nothing but below the surface a lot was being built and now we're
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:40.400]  starting to see the beginnings of what was built you know so exactly and again
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.120]  I just wanted to really understand before I got into it or promoted it but
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.120]  now what about the concern that it's been leaked out by powerful global groups
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.400]  that know the old currencies are going to die they want to get us on this
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.280]  global digital system that we think is personal and private but really is part
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:59.960]  of a larger global management system that is going to be brought in via booms
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:06.040]  and crashes globally to consolidate control over cryptocurrency sure well
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.840]  we all know that the elites have been trying to collapse the global economy
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.520]  for some time first make us reliant on their fiat currencies the Rothschild
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:20.640]  banks you know dead people's faces on rectangles of paper what most people
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.440]  don't realize in America and in Europe when you go to the mall when you spend
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.440]  some money you're using foreign banker currency right I don't want to get too
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.840]  esoteric here but we're using somebody's we're using their phony digital system
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:39.440]  exactly yeah using a system where they they is in the house of Rothschild and
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.480]  the Rockefellers and Soros and other ruling families have literally trillion
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:50.080]  of these things trillions of these digital tokens called dollars and Bitcoin
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.320]  is a shot across the bow no doubt about it and what I tell people now people
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.200]  have those concerns what if this is some system they're trying to crowd us into
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.160]  it like sheep trying to throw us off the cliff I say if this is a cliff it's a
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.040]  good cliff right if this is the cliff they're trying to cast us off of because
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.200]  it's open source and because anybody can mine for it look at things by by their
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.880]  fruit right that's what the Bible tells us to do look at things by their fruit I
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.320]  get the exact quote but if this thing were created by fruits that's what you
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.040]  said yeah exactly that's the quote if this thing were created by Lucifer
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:30.320]  himself and I have no evidence to suggest it was I think it was just the
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.760]  crypto the cryptography community realized that there's a bigger issue than
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.840]  privacy and that issue is currency and they worked on this problem quietly for
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.280]  years and finally figured out Max Kaiser on here like four or five years ago
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:46.920]  saying this will challenge JP Morgan he goes I tried to use silver to crash him
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.000]  but Bitcoin will do it and it's now worth just Bitcoin 370 plus billion more
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.400]  than JP Morgan yeah yeah no Max Kaiser is one of the most brilliant people on
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.440]  television when it comes to currency stuff the way I like to think of it is
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.800]  if somebody was telling you about Bitcoin years ago they probably know what
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.800]  they were talking about right and you've covered it for years you've made many
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:15.120]  of your viewers unintentionally rich as you pointed out and so as I was saying
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.160]  if Lucifer himself or if some demon race of aliens launched Bitcoin at least
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.600]  it's a better deal than Chase at least it's a better deal than Wells Fargo
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:29.480]  whatever this stuff is eight years in thousands of people way smarter than me
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.400]  to review the software that makes it run it seems to do its job if there's a
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.680]  problem I'll be the first to let me ask you where is it going next I mean it's
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.560]  just undoubtedly is the future where is it going next what do you expect to
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:47.120]  happen Bitcoin is one of those self-enhancing prophecies right the
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.760]  chicken or the egg problem if you have a currency and nobody wants to accept it
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.120]  then it can't grow and if everybody wants to accept something that nobody uses
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:01.120]  then it can't grow but now because of how big the market valuation is you know
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:05.520]  some people say it's stupid some people say it's overvalued but because of that
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.880]  market valuation everybody wants a piece nobody's turning down Bitcoin now
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.680]  right if Max Kaiser were to tell you today hey Alex you still want those
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.880]  bitcoins I offered you years ago you probably say yes
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:25.320]  yeah worth more analysis a week ago yes yeah so I think I think it's a self
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:28.920]  enhancing prophecy and there's no reason to think it can't take out the PayPal's
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.800]  and JP Morgan's of the world over the long term well let's get into this with

[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:20.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show he aligns himself with the truth and
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:33.840]  it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones ladies and
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:39.720]  gentlemen we are back live here broadcasting worldwide I am your host
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:45.200]  Alex Jones and we are joined here by a journalist who's been on before David
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:48.080]  Seaman that's for a lot of big publications is a very very popular
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.160]  YouTube channel and he's somebody that a lot of folks respect as as really trying
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.920]  to steer folks towards the right places to go in Bitcoin you know the radio
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:03.080]  network I'm on GCN has taken a lot of advertising for Bitcoin groups and
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.680]  and other cryptocurrencies and that's fine we really haven't done much of it
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.400]  except for the few groups we know just because again I just have a little
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:17.600]  neurotic about understanding something before I get into it but now clearly the
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.040]  governmental fiat currencies are used to control people what people agree upon
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:25.480]  to use the currency is just the nature of civilization so if it empowers
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:29.880]  individuals as he said eight years into this this is this is looking really
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:37.200]  really good but my problem is then who do I who are the best websites and how
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.280]  about advertising they're not advertising they should I need to find out who the
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.880]  best people are talking to you and other experts Max Kaiser you name it to see
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:49.800]  who I should approach to be sponsors because I want to now start getting into
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.640]  a spectrum of these I think people should again not spend any money that they
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:57.200]  need to eat or live off of I think it should be money that you'd be willing
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.280]  to you know take your wife or girlfriend or husband out to dinner on or you know
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:03.640]  maybe a weekend you know driving down to the coast or something I think this
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.080]  should be discretionary income but I don't feel like I feel like I'm stupid
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:11.920]  I mean I have integrity so I've waited so long but I think now I need to really
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:15.600]  get a crash course and not just kind of sit back and interview people I need to
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.760]  start experiencing myself so I mean obviously you're reporting but where do
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.920]  you go what do you think are some of the best currencies how you store it we
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.080]  hear about people that store it on their own computer that's looks at the
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:29.720]  internet or some of the exchanges people break in and steal it where's that can
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.400]  happen with any wealth you know why have kids they can get hurt or you know why
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.720]  on a car somebody can key it I mean it's a normal thing with assets I'm not
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:40.760]  knocking it but those are some of my questions yeah sure so you bring up a
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:45.600]  great point which is it is still very risky for eight years in this is open-source
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:49.680]  software it's not backed by any government it's not insured by any
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.080]  government at this point so it's do it yourself and it's use at your own risk
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.520]  but as you can see for those of you who are watching on Alex's TV show and
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.680]  YouTube sorry I don't mean to bring up some random currency I'm not even
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.520]  invested in that one but yeah I'm up on coincap.io and as you can see the
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:13.160]  crypto markets are red hot so a good place to just get your feet wet and see
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:18.240]  what are these things value that right now I would be coincap.io or another
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.560]  really popular one would be coinmarketcap.com and so that's where you
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:27.200]  can begin to see which currencies are competing against each other you can
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:30.600]  start to do your homework over there and how many thousands of percentage
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:36.640]  points is Bitcoin up since it first launched I mean I mean Vegas is 60%
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.480]  against you even if you see this as gambling this is paid off in thousands
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.680]  of percentage points yeah so since Bitcoin was launched to the world about
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:51.200]  eight years ago this open-source software it came out January 2009 he
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.960]  released his white paper explaining how it works that white paper is still online
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:00.320]  anybody in the world can read it at bitcoin.org
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:07.120]  that's the original free document it tells you what on earth is this thing
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.560]  and how does it how does it create digital cash and so since that point in
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:17.520]  time Bitcoin is up more than 50,000% yeah that's the white paper right there
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:21.840]  it's up more than 50,000 and again tell folks a little bit about 50,000% tell
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:25.760]  people about the developer the Japanese developer yeah so we don't know much
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.640]  about Satoshi Nakamoto that's the pseudonym of the creator or the team of
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:34.880]  creators who released Bitcoin to the world and then to answer questions from
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.000]  the music. I can never get answers even from people like Kaiser that have met
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.320]  these folks who really did it that's one thing I don't like I'd kind of like to
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.520]  know who really created it. Yeah if that's a sticking point for you there are
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:49.720]  other currencies like Litecoin where they know very well who the creator is
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.600]  and where he's doing media interviews. Why wouldn't somebody want their name to be
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.240]  known maybe in case it went south or in case they got targeted for doing it. Yeah
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:01.440]  I think it's actually a strong feature of Bitcoin that we don't know who the
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.080]  creator is because if some overzealous government agency says oh look you're
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:11.040]  not complying with rule A, B and C we need to indict you and bring you in that
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:15.040]  would obviously crash the currency's value at least in the short term even if
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.520]  they say and that manifesto and others that they're doing this to empower
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:25.080]  the people. Essentially Satoshi made hints on the blockchain he references
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:28.680]  an article about the financial crisis and that was one of the first you know
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:33.120]  things written into the blockchain is a newspaper article about the financial
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.240]  crisis where Americans are getting hosed so there is an ideological element to
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.800]  this I mean we all know what we're doing we're psychologically replacing the
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.840]  dollar with this crazy thing called a Bitcoin and so far so good but again it
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:49.800]  is still very risky technology nobody's underwriting this nobody's
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:54.640]  guaranteeing it it's what really it comes down to I think Alex is whenever
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:53:01.160]  peer-to-peer pops up in any area of life P2P they try to stomp it down as hard
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:04.600]  and as fast. They want middlemen in control this is cutting middlemen out.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:10.440]  Yeah they try to make us never try it again right so the printing press they
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:14.840]  didn't like because you no longer have to go to church and tie 10% of your
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:18.880]  income to have somebody in the church tell you what the Bible says you can
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:23.080]  print up your own Bible you can give them to friends and family members and you
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:27.440]  can start to interpret God's word for yourself back then that was highly
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.480]  disruptive and that's what we're doing in the independent new media is saying
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:32.960]  hey we're having everybody on we're having a bigger discussion people say I
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:37.800]  want my own discussion and that's what's killing that monopoly. Exactly yeah they
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.600]  don't like people going off and doing their own thing and there's nothing
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:44.320]  more peer-to-peer than Bitcoin there are people in their basements mining for
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:49.080]  bitcoins and ethers and like coins right now they can't control that and of
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:53.440]  course tomorrow we could all stop craving Bitcoin and then it could collapse
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:58.400]  but tomorrow we could also crave Bitcoin even more I mean now it's a massive
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:02.160]  network so I was about to say how many cryptocurrencies are there because there's
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.240]  because they're saying I mean it's it's it's it's already what approaching what
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:13.480]  what percentage of global currency. Yeah so as of yesterday or the day before it
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:19.080]  all the crypto in the world had reached more than $500 billion in value so more
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:23.040]  than half a trillion now it's a little bit under a trillion because it's moved
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.840]  back a bit but roughly half a trillion dollars of market value in crypto at
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:33.440]  this point it's incredible. So if I would have invested $10,000 in Bitcoin eight
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:40.400]  years ago what's 50,000 times a thousand. I mean you would have a lot of money
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.400]  today and one of the concerns about Bitcoin is who is Satoshi Nakamoto right
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.400]  what are this man's intentions or this team's intentions because he stopped
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.160]  communicating with the public in 2010 he was responding to people in the Bitcoin
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.600]  forums developers and miners and stuff drops off the face of the earth sometime
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.120]  in 2010 and it's been run by volunteers ever since pretty much by volunteers and
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:10.680]  by companies who work with Bitcoin but this man maybe he still holds some of
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:16.320]  his coins and it makes you wonder if he becomes the next you know super banker
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:21.600]  okay how many coins he has is he a good person or is he a bad person at least
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.200]  again it goes back to that biblical quote he's made a lot of people rich he's
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:31.320]  made Jamie Diamond sweat so judging him by the fruit of his tree he's good one
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:38.040]  night so far you know that's one real nice treat so wow it's amazing well I
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.280]  want to get you back on the broadcast soon my friend any other important
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:46.560]  tidbits we should get into to understand cryptocurrency yeah just a couple of
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.160]  closing things that people always ask where to buy it at least if you're in
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:56.240]  the US one of the best places is Coinbase Coinbase.com let's see if I can
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:59.600]  bring it up there and where do you keep it just on a thumb drive you don't plug
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:05.120]  it into the internet so Coinbase.com they're a good place so you can do
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.760]  something called offline storage or cold wallets do a search for Bitcoin
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:15.960]  cold wallet Bitcoin hard drive and put in the Faraday cage essentially yes
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:20.120]  essentially you can have a laptop that you never connect to the internet you
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:24.120]  use a thumb drive to install your favorite Bitcoin wallet you generate a
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.560]  Bitcoin address or an Ether address if you're using Ethereum you send money to
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:32.280]  that address but you never connect that computer to the internet and therefore
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.280]  you don't have to sweat at night about hackers getting your Bitcoin is from a
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.640]  physics perspective we know it's impossible to hack a computer that never
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.240]  connects to the internet you can disconnect. Hold on stay right there we
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.200]  got to come back in two minutes I want to do five more minutes with you if you

[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:53.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:53.200 --> 02:00:01.280]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:08.600]  watch me watch me I got it by the way just like I first called not braggers
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.480]  letting folks know I figured out their program their blueprint their their
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:16.120]  operations manual I was the first to say hours after last week that a little
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:22.080]  bunch of stuff but I was pointing out that they were running a bunch of scams
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:26.120]  where they would come out and make an announcement and then it wasn't true they
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.960]  would say that Flynn has you know admitted that he during the campaign
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:34.360]  worked with the Russians that Trump ordered him to wasn't true and they put
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:38.760]  the hoax out and they go oh you're suspended for weeks they did that
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:42.760]  desperately to see how it would be accepted it wasn't just to see if it
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:45.840]  would sail and people wouldn't go look up the dates that were already there and
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:49.800]  find out it was he was president-elect totally normal well I saw Anderson
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.240]  Cooper last night called Trump a pathetic loser and all this stuff and then
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:57.760]  when I had a backlash he deleted it saying oh someone hacked me so that's
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:02.440]  how these cowards do it but I have to make a presence key with her filthy
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:05.160]  activity she just does it right out front of God country that's coming up the
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:08.400]  next segment Catherine Austin Fitz joining us Roger Stone with biggest
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.160]  listeners he's the guy that first called for the special counsel investigate
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:16.280]  Mueller and the whole thing and it looks like that's what's gonna happen so I
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:19.760]  just can't believe how dialed in Roger is not to getting orders from somebody
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:25.080]  he develops so many of these strategies that's why I call him dirty and evil
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.680]  because he's not and then he just kind of arrogantly goes with it where I hear
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.680]  about on the villain it's not even true so again joining us is David Seaman
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.320]  again investigative journalist and researcher a popular YouTube channel
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:42.120]  130 something thousand subscribers at David Seaman online I've got about three
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.480]  minutes to break thanks for joining us other important tidbits you got cut off
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:49.720]  of the break you want to part the folks about the crypto currency revolution you
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.880]  I mean it really is like printing press level internet invention level I mean
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.440]  clearly eight years in this is this is something that we can't ignore yeah we
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:03.680]  uh at fulcrum news which is my startup news company we think it's a big deal we
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:08.360]  put up an article and a couple of videos Bitcoin and Ethereum have elites in a
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:13.880]  global panic so that's the level of of disruption that's ahead that's important
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.880]  interrupt give us your website again
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:17.480]  fulcrumnews.com
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.880]  That's a great name I love fulcrum yeah go ahead
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:25.480]  uh so yeah they tried to attack Napster and then later technologies like BitTorrent
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:30.200]  were so good they just couldn't shut it down and here Bitcoin might be the same
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.160]  way certainly everybody has tried to attack it the media Reuters and the AP
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:39.000]  which are controlled in part by the Rothschild family who invest in them
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.600]  whenever there's a pullback in Bitcoin they always focus on that
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:46.680]  and they don't focus on the fact that overall the thing is up more than 50 000
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:48.840]  percent some of its biggest competitors
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.120]  well sure and look how the Rothschilds own the main carbon exchange as well and
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.080]  the Economist magazine and then Rothschild you name it
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:59.080]  I mean they they want a global carbon tax be the new fiat currency they
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:01.320]  really don't like cryptocurrency
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:05.240]  yeah they are a money cartel and they have over-invested in media
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:09.560]  to keep us craving their dollar bills which they essentially loan out to our
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:13.160]  own country it's very bizarre doesn't make sense in a modern
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.840]  internet age and that's why crypto is coming of age is that our financial
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:20.600]  system is the last thing we're doing that is kind of a throwback
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:25.240]  to the middle ages we elected a president on the basis of videos
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:30.120]  and social media posts so why doesn't our money catch up now it is
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:33.160]  but again for people out there final point to remember
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:37.400]  please store your own coins once you learn enough about Bitcoin or about
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:41.640]  Litecoin or even Ethereum take the extra step to learn about
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:45.560]  cold storage store it yourself because even though Coinbase is a good
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:49.800]  business in my opinion a part of the ethos of crypto is you
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:52.440]  hold your own money you don't trust Coinbase
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.200]  to remain good people and to not be compromised one of the crew
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.920]  one of the crew wants to pop in just real quick and ask you a question go
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:02.120]  ahead hey David long time investor here I've been curious
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.800]  about whether or not it'd be worth it to hold on to
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:09.160]  cryptocurrency or sell it off for cash because it's the whole point of this is
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:14.600]  supposed to take place of US dollars someday what's your advice on that
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.280]  yeah I can't give financial advice in terms of whether or not caching out
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:22.120]  now would be ideal I can't tell you if it's going to go up in the future
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.600]  but I can tell you personally uh the little amount of Bitcoin that I have
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.480]  and a lot of people that I have I want to sell it back
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:34.040]  by selling that currency and so then I'm mostly holding I have an income
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.320]  this is as Alex said at the beginning it's still speculative it's still
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.840]  we're out of time but Connor that's a great question I would do a mix of it
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:43.640]  and that's how you do it in investments normally David Seaman thank you so much
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.680]  for talking to us about the revolution of cryptocurrency a lot of really
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:49.960]  thought-provoking points that I needed to ask because I want to know we'll be back
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.280]  stay with us
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:58.840]  another former Facebook executive has come out against the social media giant
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:02.680]  former Facebook vice president Chamaf Paliha Petia revealed that he feels
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:06.040]  tremendous guilt over his role in heading a company which is aiding the
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:09.080]  destruction of society he believes social media networks are
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:12.520]  employing tools that are destroying society's social fabric
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.120]  pointing to the insatiable need for hearts likes and thumbs up
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:20.040]  you don't realize it but you are being programmed he also highlighted the way
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:24.440]  social media is able to manipulate mob mentality by referring to an incident
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:28.600]  in which seven Indian people were lynched due to a WhatsApp hoax
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:32.280]  that's what we're dealing with he said imagine taking that to the extreme
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:36.120]  where bad actors can now manipulate large swaths of people to do
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:39.080]  anything you want similar to tech giants before him
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:42.760]  Paliha Petia says his children are not allowed to use Facebook
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:45.960]  and he recommends the rest of us take a hard break from the app
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:49.640]  I've just removed all social media apps and games from my phone and
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:52.200]  surprisingly I've got a lot more free time

[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.200]  the trev's trying to bring back and they're telling us that we're not
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:50.280]  patriotic like the fbi agents that made up the pp gate dossier kept saying
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:53.000]  they're so patriotic but how much they hate americans
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.840]  and they hate flyover country and they hate bitter clingers
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.440]  projection everything she says is her here it is
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:04.200]  the white house i'm talking about the entire white house all the men around
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.640]  this president do you really go home to your wives and daughters
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:11.480]  and say this president knows what he's doing this president stands up for women

[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.400]  against each other with some harpy sitting up there like a
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:49.080]  buzzard perched at the failing msnbc let's finish it
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:52.440]  she doesn't have a difficult job she has an easy job
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:57.000]  tell the truth to the american people she's an assistant to the president of
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.640]  the united states she swore an oath to the constitution of the united states
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:05.560]  which he disgraces every day as she serially lies
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:09.560]  hour after hour after hour every day it appears mentioning i just for just for
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:13.640]  a moment how abnormal this is uh... the assault
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:17.960]  the constant assault on the dignity in the majesty of the office of the
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:21.560]  president and this is exactly the reason
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:26.280]  the president united states is not welcome in the united kingdom
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.920]  because his presence standing next to her majesty the queen
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.040]  the queen so they're literally saying
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.720]  there's an assault on women because we have president trump the very group in
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:40.600]  the wiki leaks trying to cause a race war so they tried race war
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:44.040]  they tried russia gate now they're moving on to men and women killing each
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:46.360]  other we're gonna have tather rosson fits riding shotgun with us throughout
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.440]  the hour roger stones will be popping in
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:51.560]  so we'll have a three-way going here where we're all discussing things
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.120]  they'll probably say i meant that sexually that's how their minds are dirty
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:56.760]  i'd like to think about mika brzezinski you know we'll have three people on like
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.400]  a three-way on the phone but they'll they'll probably make that something
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:02.600]  in the news here like i i mean i mean there's no
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.560]  into it like that lady doing it for campaign contributions you know you
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.200]  always talk about the politics people wanting to you know you can make
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:11.320]  contributions like he's on the thing these senators here used to beg me for
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:14.520]  money they do anything for money he didn't mean to have sex with those men
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:17.080]  he didn't mean that there katherine austin fits
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:20.600]  salari.com your amazing magazine is here in my hand
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.040]  your great work i'm gonna go over all your work at the heading up hud no
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.280]  300 billion in financial assets you manage but you're you're a big dog in
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:31.800]  the whole fight and so you're an expert on this you're
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:38.360]  your bipartisan patriot what do you make of just all the insanity going on
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:42.200]  well i think alex a lot of it is a distraction we
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.880]  launched a report on a website in september about 21 trillion dollars
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.480]  missing from the department of defense and had a working in
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:52.840]  partnership with a group of scholars led by dr marx get more at
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:58.360]  michigan state university and dr skidmore did an excellent
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:03.720]  excellent interview on december 3rd that really went viral about the 21
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.640]  trillion missing that's 65 000 per person in america
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.520]  so for a family of four or five you're talking about a quarter of a million
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:14.680]  dollars and interestingly enough forps picked it
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:18.600]  up dr kotlakov picked it up and it started to get
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.720]  real headway in the financial media and wham
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.400]  department of defense announces they're gonna come out with an audit
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:28.520]  they had been scrambling they took it down all the documents i was about to
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.040]  say the word is trump trump saw the piece and ordered that i should have
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.560]  led with the great work you and your colleagues are doing
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:39.640]  so well but here's the problem you can't pay pension fund benefits with
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:43.880]  audit reports so an audit is something that happens
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:48.120]  next year is completed two years from now after the 2018 elections in the
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:52.200]  mistime in the meantime there's 21 trillion dollars that needs to be
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.080]  accounted for and as far as we know is out is functioning outside of the law
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.160]  so the reality is if if somebody's getting on morning
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.000]  network tv and talking about you know sex is the great
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.080]  distraction and right now we're purging all the sort of old people and we're
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.880]  using sex to do it so we have purges going on
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:16.040]  but that's really cleaning out the old expensive high you know high overhead
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:20.520]  leadership and moving in a group a new group of leaders i don't see it as
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.800]  making meaningful changes really in the system so i think
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:29.640]  i think there is an enormous amount of distraction going on in the major media
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:32.600]  and you know and that's all it is they're they're
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:35.880]  they're doing anything to create noise and entertainment away from the real
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:38.680]  issues well let's talk about that and give us
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.640]  your report card on how trump is i know you were here a few months ago and it
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:44.280]  was mixed catherine austin fits is gonna talk about
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:47.880]  the tens of trillions of dollars missing that they admit and now they're
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:54.120]  talking about it on it hey that's exciting we'll be back
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:57.960]  heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.400]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.640]  but the symptoms are there loss of energy blood sugar spikes and drops
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:09.400]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can

[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:33.960]  it all corporate and turn it to holidays and say that's politically
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:38.840]  incorrect it's christmas week and we've got free shipping store-wide
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:44.040]  over 100 items 50 to 67 percent off but a lot of these are going to have to end
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:48.120]  because we already sold out of brain force once it was out for a few weeks
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:51.800]  it's not going to be back till the new year our great uh new tropic super high quality

[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:11.640]  uh stamina libido energy strong is formerly out there from our research
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:15.480]  that's out of the gate 50 off the real red pill that's got the
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:19.080]  hormone precursor prenatinone we're pronouncing that right
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:22.440]  that's got all the vitamins and minerals amino acids it takes about a week to

[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:30.920]  fill in like 30 minutes all those other products are at info or
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:34.920]  store.com and when you purchase the products it funds what we're doing
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:38.440]  exposing the globalists and bringing you game changing info i mean
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:42.840]  you know chatharosson Fitz was on here a month and a half ago and her
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:45.880]  organization grips at salari.com and their economists were
[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:48.360]  beating the drum about the tens of trillions missing that she's been
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:52.840]  doing for a decade plus and boom now they're you know calling for a
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:57.320]  audit which i agree is too little too late so getting into this then what do we
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:01.320]  do right now uh why is this so central why is this
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:04.840]  so important and what do you see going on with trump
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:09.640]  so so here's the issue alex crime that pays is crime that stays
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:13.960]  and the reality is if you have right now we live in a society where things are
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:16.760]  run by force we see the stories for example
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:20.280]  and you've carried many of the doctors and natural health practitioners who
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:23.880]  are being violently assassinated so we have a society
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.240]  that's run by force you can't change that with a financial product you can't
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.960]  that change that by tinkering with the information
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:33.160]  systems frankly what you've got to do is cut off the money
[02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:37.240]  it's like a car that's running on our gas we're putting the gas in the car
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:40.440]  if the you know if the car is running around killing people you've got to
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:43.800]  turn off the gas so this comes down to citizens and
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:48.120]  state and local officials saying wait a minute you know uh if the courts aren't
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:51.640]  going to assert jurisdiction over the financial management laws if congress
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:54.680]  isn't going to do it then we're going to have to do it and there are many
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:57.720]  different ways of doing it but it starts with recognizing
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:00.520]  that there's only one way to stop the lawlessness
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:03.560]  i mean you've covered the lawlessness at the department of justice you've seen
[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:05.640]  what's come out over the last couple weeks
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:08.840]  it's gonna continue unless we shut off the money i mean
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:11.880]  when you were a kid and your mother wanted to you know get you to change
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:15.240]  your behavior what did she do she cut your allowance right
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:18.440]  exactly that's why they're so arrogant what do you make of these congressional
[02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:21.800]  revelations where it's all like six or seven FBI agents
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:25.880]  a few just department people their wives and people are getting millions at the
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:29.160]  g at the gps group to make up the full stuff
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:32.680]  they get fake warrants the judges have recused themselves
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:37.160]  i mean this is spectacular how this is unraveling
[02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:41.160]  well you know there are many questions but clearly if you look at the anecdotal
[02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:44.200]  evidence it looks as though the department of justice and the
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:48.040]  intelligence agencies were deeply compromised in the conduct of the
[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:51.960]  campaign and even more frightening in the conduct of the transition
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:55.000]  now i was about to say why are they so arrogant
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.680]  as to send emails and and and text to each other just
[02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:02.360]  admitting it's all a fraud that's crazy it shows
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:05.640]  delusional nature i mean if you're going to commit crime why not
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:08.920]  be slick about it you know well but here's why
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:12.120]  that you know in the annual wrap-up we're about to publish our annual wrap-up
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:16.120]  in january and we pick out the most important news videos of the year
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:19.400]  one of the most important news videos the year is about to say i'm not a cheque
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:23.800]  schumer fan but he did us all a service he did an interview i think on cnn or
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:27.960]  he said the intelligence have seven ways to sunday to get you
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.720]  right but what he was saying is the intelligence agencies run the executive
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:37.320]  branch not the duly elected president and so trump could be good or bad
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:41.080]  but the point is for me if i'm wrong in your view he's trying to be president
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:44.120]  that's why they're so upset
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:47.560]  well but this is a fundamental governance structure because our problem in
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:50.760]  this country is the governance structure does not have integrity
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:53.960]  and people are getting assassinated left and right it's become a third world
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:57.320]  country the question is who's in charge who's responsible
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:00.760]  who's accountable is that does the president run the executive branch in
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:04.120]  the congress run the congress i mean is the congress allowed to pass a law
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.000]  without getting shot at their local baseball game
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.760]  i mean that's the question and so are we going to allow the intelligence
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:13.560]  the intelligence agencies have run this country
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.880]  since the president was assassinated in 1963 in broad daylight
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:21.880]  so the reality is we have a governance structure issue who's in charge of the
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.320]  country is it the people behind the intelligence agencies the big
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:29.080]  investors in the corporations is that the intelligence agencies or is it the
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.840]  people and this is coming down to a fundamental flaw in the
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:36.040]  governance structure nothing's going to work until we get
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:39.400]  get it fixed i'm very you know it's always i always get
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:43.400]  frustrated with the people who say cryptocurrencies are a solution
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:47.000]  because in fact all we're doing is inventing their next digital currency
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.240]  now i respect you and that's why i've not promoted all this i just feel dumb
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:55.080]  not getting involved myself and i got offered 18 million dollars of it once
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:58.120]  and it was too lazy at my laptop to put it on because i didn't want to fiddle
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:01.240]  with it this is i'm not you know i'm not into things like that because once i get
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:03.960]  into securities and i obsess on it want to know all about it then
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:06.520]  and i don't have time to do the radio show and try to figure out news you have
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:09.640]  to you know choose who you like like like bob dillon says you got to serve
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:12.920]  somebody i serve the news and information warfare not not financial
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:17.080]  stuff i have experts like you on but but what are the issues with now these
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:22.360]  cryptocurrencies being so gigantic well what are the problems
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:26.200]  well here's the thing if we you know if if you're going to a world where seven
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.040]  billion people have smartphones then you want digital currencies i mean the
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:33.640]  leadership is one of digital currencies for decade you got to build the train
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:37.480]  truck so this is how they make it trendy this is how they make it trendy
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:42.040]  right so so the here's the thing i could hire i could try and hire all the top
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.600]  software developers in the world and all the top hardware guys in the world and
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.480]  pay them a fortune it's much cheaper for me to engineer you know a run-up in the
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:53.720]  price and get them doing it and then when the
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:57.160]  tuition period is over when you shut them down and
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:00.680]  and you take over which the central banks ultimately will do so
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:04.840]  it's very very clever and the reality is the price can go much higher if you
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:08.040]  look at what needs to be right now blockchain
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:11.240]  is not scalable to the extent that they need it
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:14.440]  on an economic so who do you think's really behind the original launch of
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:17.720]  bitcoin you know i know max keiser is a nice guy i know he's been involved with
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:21.560]  some of the sorrow sons and i'm not saying he's a he's a bad guy
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:24.120]  i'd like him to come on and answer those questions about that hopefully he will
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:29.240]  soon but i that's been my concern from the beginning
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:33.080]  so i you know i can't tell you but ultimately the people who most
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:37.400]  want this system and you did the you did the premier interview on this is that
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:41.000]  it's the bankers who want a shipping system and you did the interview with
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.480]  Aaron Russo we're right before he died Aaron decided to tell all and explained
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:48.520]  you know what the plan was and how the shipping system will work well you're
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:52.520]  going to get there a lot faster if you get everybody inventing and i said the
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.960]  market's so small and so the ownership is so consolidated it's very easy
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:01.640]  to manipulate this price up and you know the question for a lot of people
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:05.160]  listening to this is they're looking to make money on the speculation how far
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:08.760]  does the innovation period run how high can they take the price
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:12.600]  no one knows it's a political question this could go on for quite a while you

[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:42.520]  first called for a special counsel investigate the fake muller
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:46.040]  clinton crime family investigation of trump for russia gate
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:49.160]  that's now openly being pushed by congressman jim jordan
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:51.960]  and many others boy when he first talked about two months ago they acted like
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.800]  he's ridiculous you can't do that the democrats attacked within hours
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:59.320]  when he said that on the show because they're afraid of it roger stone
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:03.480]  coming up in a moment but finishing up with katherine austin fits of salari
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.720]  ladies and gentlemen an amazing website salari.com amazing
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:11.480]  quarterly report by katherine austin fits calling for the investigation of the
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:14.840]  missing trillions and the pentagon and more it's now starting to happen
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:17.320]  no it's not as much as she'd like to see but it's in the right direction
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:21.080]  katherine in the few minutes we have left what are other tidbits
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:25.000]  predictions angles you'd like to bring forward
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  on you know trying to restore the republic trying to restore jobs
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:33.640]  trying to restore a future so one of the reasons i think that
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:38.040]  the bitcoin uh the growth of bitcoin and the growth in the price is going to
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:42.920]  continue for a while alex from what i'm seeing bitcoin is the laundry of
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:46.360]  choice to finance a world of activists
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:50.120]  coming into the 2000 election and doing a lot of the divide and conquer when you
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:53.800]  talk to the activists who are doing all this crazy stuff they're all
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:57.480]  financed with bitcoin i saw a presentation not long
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:01.320]  ago in september by an activist who's basically traveling the country
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:05.640]  planning on running for president in the libertarian party promoting
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:10.280]  a rape of russia plan exactly the same plan that we the intelligence agencies
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:15.320]  did in russia after the wall came down something that would devastate you know
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:19.240]  russia the the population dropped 10 to 20 percent
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:22.440]  overnight is a result of literally people starving to death and
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:25.560]  and if you look at what was being promoted it would be the same thing it
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:28.600]  was very funny i got back and did a report and one of my favorite colleagues
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:33.480]  said oh this is hitler's wet dream an infinite amount of free money to finance
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:38.280]  armies so i think this is if you if you look at who
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:43.240]  is being saying bitcoin is a globalist black ops weapon
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.120]  it's many different things it's many different things so i'm not saying this
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:49.320]  but if you look at coming into the 2018 election
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:52.600]  you know whatever the laundry is being run by bitcoin i think they're going to
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:55.960]  have a tremendous impact and we need to understand that if we're going to push
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:59.080]  back but couldn't pandora's box get out of your
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:02.360]  correct and then it couldn't send up things like it being used for good
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:05.400]  you know people going direct direct peer-to-peer instead of
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:10.040]  through middlemen sure you know anything can but remember we're
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:14.520]  talking about a financial system and an information system that has no integrity
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:17.800]  so no financial system can have integrity when the
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.160]  governance system doesn't have integrity and is run by force
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:24.200]  well my gut as everybody knows the last six seven years
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:27.480]  was even if it's legitimate they're going to grow it up they're going to let it be
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:29.720]  while while less and they're going to come take control of it
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:33.080]  we'll have our global digital currency we've already created the pathway
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:36.760]  people already adopted it not fearing a global digital currency as big brother
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.040]  but thinking it was avant-garde kathryn austin fits always thought
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:43.880]  provoking salari.com thank you for spending time with us
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:47.240]  thank you alex have a great day you too so many people
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.720]  say to me they go alex last hour you were up there promoting cryptocurrency
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:55.000]  and i do want to start dabbling in it and learning so i get it's so important i
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:56.840]  better figure it out that's what's happening
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:00.280]  it's like if i go take a boxing class i mean i'm gonna go be a heavyweight
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:04.440]  boxer or you know whatever i'm admitting i'm not an expert
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:09.320]  i know more than most people because i've studied the generalities but i
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:11.880]  i'm gonna start doing some investment and some studying and having more guests
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:15.480]  on because it can't be ignored uh and i'm gonna have guests on that are
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.160]  anti-crypto i'm gonna have people that are pro because
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:23.320]  that's what we do here we actually try to figure stuff out and then we remember
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:27.080]  and watch who's been accurate who's been on target
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:32.040]  who do we trust who's who's who's got the savvy the gravitas
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:35.640]  now one of those people is roger stone it is
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:39.480]  ridiculous how much he predicts how much he breaks
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:45.720]  and he doesn't get fed an idea he develops most of them on his own
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:48.920]  ten of us we develop ideas together but nine times out of ten he's got a big
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.200]  idea about politics and and and that's why he's so respected and feared in
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.680]  washington when i've been there with him i've seen it it's amazing
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:57.640]  of these big wigs that just he thinks he's a rock star and that's why the
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:00.280]  left so scared of him blaming him for everything
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:03.080]  you know this is the you know the women that came out against frank and they
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:05.960]  said he made it all up even though frank admits it
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:09.000]  because he first broke it here well he had a fox news source
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.520]  but he was the first guy months ago to go a special council he can't fire me
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:15.160]  or now because they're gonna spend that a special
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:19.240]  council that will expose him well some say we'll let the let the inspector
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:22.440]  general do it and it seems like they've been pushed into that now so a lot of
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:25.720]  great stuff coming out these hearings were sensational i mean the whole
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:28.520]  house of cards is coming down that was all fake
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:33.320]  for me it's money paid by the just department head of the russia
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:37.480]  investigation to his wife when they gave two plus million it's to his wife
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:41.080]  that got hundreds of thousands that we know of i mean just right there this is
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:44.680]  just conflict of interest this is this is looking to me criminal
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.560]  nobody's pointed that out yet but so so what does he think now
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:53.720]  about this because uh here it is here's jim jordan who's asking the toughest
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.360]  questions long trigger out he gotta say he's asking the toughest ones
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:59.560]  such a fan of this guy saying exactly what roger stone's been calling for for
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:03.320]  two months here it is this is unbelievable so
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:07.000]  what's it going to take to get a second special council to answer
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.400]  these questions and find out was peter struck really up to what i think he was
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:15.000]  i think it's important to understand congressman we have that's enough to see
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.320]  general asher roger stone uh what do you make of this what's
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:25.480]  the next big shoot a drop well alex rod rozenstein certainly proved to be the
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:31.880]  artful dodger today under relentless probing from uh trey gaudy and jim
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.600]  jordan uh and uh matt gates uh he dodged and
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:39.880]  weaved and kept referring every question to
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:44.040]  someone else on the question of text messages from
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:50.280]  the muller staff on the question of mccabe's refusal
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:54.280]  to uh respond and testify for the congress
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:40:01.880]  became being the deputy fbi director on the question of the contributions
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:07.640]  uh to various democrats clinton obama and so on from members of the and the
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:10.920]  very same russia gate people are the ones covering up for russia gate for the
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:15.640]  clintons i mean this is a very tight group uh really an inner conspiracy it's
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:18.760]  so tiny that only like seven people are running everything
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:23.720]  so i think what happened today is the the move for a special prosecutor
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:30.360]  to hone in on uranium one hone in on what muller and the get trump brigade which
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:36.120]  is really what his strike force is is up to uh and their various biases and
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.640]  evidence of of uh of uh political democratic activism
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.800]  uh really picked up speed today i really have believed
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:50.280]  as you do that now given the mainstream media position
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:54.840]  the president can't just unilaterally fire muller it would appear that he was
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:00.280]  firing him to obstruct justice but he can put muller under investigation
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:04.200]  himself in which case he could not continue to sustain his position
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:08.120]  for a few days but won't they bring in a new little creature
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:13.240]  well it kind of depends uh since the focus of the new special prosecutor
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:18.120]  would have to be rozenstein himself given that he was the supervising us
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.360]  attorney on uranium one i would argue that the public wouldn't
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.200]  stand for it rozenstein would have to recuse himself also
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.000]  and the decision would go to the solicitor general but regardless we're
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:32.040]  going to break i mean i don't you know me i won't sit there and put positive
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:35.160]  stuff out of it if it's not positive i'm a killjoy and you're like hey this is a
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:39.160]  victory they are falling apart they are scared they are panicking so they're
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:43.240]  changing the subject to me too and roymor and and you know special hearings on
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:47.240]  trump i mean they are really moving away from the russia fable
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:52.840]  all of their uh bias all of their prejudice all of their true true motives
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:57.160]  have been exposed in the last 10 days it is it is incredible
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:03.400]  between the the rogue fbi agent the text messages uh all their dirty laundries
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:06.440]  out there in public and the american people are getting it
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:11.240]  they are definitely getting it it's the this is beyond a perry mason show these
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:14.680]  these three congressmen you mentioned it's so riveting it's like beyond a movie
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:17.800]  i'm like on the edge of my seat and they're just devastating them and it's
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.880]  so good to see congressmen not being wimps but being strong and being informed
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.960]  well and the other guy frankly who's been terrific is senator chuck grassley
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:29.080]  who has got this thing by the horns and is uh in
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:33.640]  full full forward charge against the deep state

[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.640]  o'reilly is predicting a huge onslaught against president trump in january
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.720]  based around fake accusations of sexual assault o'reilly says there's an
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:15.560]  audio tape of an anti-trump person offering 200 000
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.320]  dollars to a woman to accuse donald trump of untoward behavior
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.840]  o'reilly says trump knows about the tape and he should be drawing attention to
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:27.000]  it to highlight how the entire raft of sexual assault allegations against him
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.600]  is an industry that there are false charges and money changing hands
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:34.920]  o'reilly says democrats now feel they must go all in to destroy trump because
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:38.200]  he has a good chance of getting reelected it's funny how the mainstream
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:42.280]  media never got around to addressing the very serious allegations of sexual
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:45.640]  misconduct against bill clinton but with hillary's chance at becoming the
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:49.880]  president nothing more than a pipe dream accusations of sexual assault are

[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:35.160]  hear those war drums
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:46.920]  we're watching the whole global system go down right now it doesn't mean we're
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:49.400]  offering some of you tell me on the other side but
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:52.520]  i was hard to think of this this morning one of the crew members said we don't
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.440]  want to die on this roymor hill which is a military term about this is not the
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:59.960]  hill for us to die on it's not a bridge we got to take it's not a fortress
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:03.560]  it's it's it's it's it's them throwing everything they had at it problems with
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:06.520]  the candidate a perfect storm they're trying to make
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:11.320]  this a bellwether of republican losses so that the house and the senate could
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:14.440]  take it in 2018 i don't think that's gonna happen
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:18.920]  but i'm gonna get roger stone's take on that i remember roger privately
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:23.240]  agreeing with the president months ago saying you know boy we could have done
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:26.760]  something better than this more but we saw it as a tea party victory that the
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:30.040]  republicans won a luther strange and we got this the question is would have
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:34.600]  luther strange have won matt drudge came out and you said hey
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:39.080]  sometimes stuff's just a little too much but we also saw fake polls showing
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:43.400]  him losing by 10 to 15 points that creates a bandwagon effect for jones
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:48.600]  we also see them said they're gonna expunge the records of the voting
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:52.040]  unprecedentedly the day after the election so
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:55.800]  my gut tells me that we're seeing all the election fraud uh that that there was
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:59.160]  some serious fraud here that they didn't count most of the military ballots and
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:03.080]  he only lost by half a point but again die on that hill
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:07.160]  uh does the recount have any chance i haven't asked your opinion on this roger
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:11.640]  uh what do you think really happened in alabama well alex first of all i think
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:15.960]  it's important to understand how we got here because the president essentially
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:21.880]  i think was misled into making a series of bad choices
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:27.560]  the way alabama's primary system works uh there is an initial primary in which
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:30.760]  there were not two but four candidates
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:34.440]  luther strange the attorney general who'd been appointed
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:39.800]  the to the u.s senate in a dirty deal with the outgoing governor who was on
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:42.520]  his way to prison luther was supposed to be
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:47.000]  investigating him instead he was in protruding him for an appointment
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:52.920]  congressman mo brooks uh who although friendly with steve bannon
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:57.960]  was a never trump her during the 2016 race uh
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:01.480]  dr randy brinson who appeared here at info wars
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:06.280]  an early original trump supporter and former chairman of the alabama
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:09.080]  christian coalition that's who you thought would be the really the best
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:13.400]  i thought he would be the strongest candidate uh and then
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:18.200]  roi moore now of those only brinson was at trump supporter
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:21.960]  but every time dr brinson was able to find substantial
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:26.360]  financial support mitch mcconnell and the boys at the senate committee would
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:30.840]  mobilize and cut that money off the president was told
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:34.680]  by his advisors that this was a two-person race
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:39.480]  and that he had to choose between luther strange and mo brooks
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.880]  that was never true the president was kind of shocked when
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:47.880]  suddenly a judge he had never heard of won the nomination
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:52.280]  now i'm a libertarian as you know roi moore was
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:56.360]  never my cup of tea on the other hand i didn't want a
[02:50:56.360 --> 02:51:02.200]  liberal democrat in that seat now in essence i think we have avoided a whole
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:06.840]  new controversy because i can tell you directly if more would have gotten in
[02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:11.480]  they were going to make a canard out of it a red herring it was going to be
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:16.520]  uh really out of the whole me too hysteria uh even worse uh the uh
[02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:19.640]  mitch mcconnell and the senate campaign committee had
[02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:25.160]  investigators in alabama this past week digging into judge moore's personal
[02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:29.480]  finances seeking to prove that he lied on his
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:33.800]  financial disclosure forms a felony that would certainly
[02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:37.800]  prevent you from being seated in the senate so
[02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:43.800]  they were ready had he won frankly i doubt the judge would ever have been
[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:48.680]  seated do you think we dodged a bullet here i really do now here's what i would
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:52.840]  do if i were the president right now i would call
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:56.200]  doug jones and i would invite him to the white house
[02:51:56.200 --> 02:52:00.360]  doug jones has to run in alabama in three years
[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:04.360]  alabama is not and will never be a liberal state
[02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:07.880]  and so he's smart if he's smart he'll make a compromise with the president
[02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:12.520]  well it's a ruby red state if doug jones wants to get reelected that he's got to
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:18.840]  be a democrat in the mold of howl hefflin or rick shelby when he was a democrat
[02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:23.560]  they're not going to elect or i should say reelect a liberal democrat then
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:27.480]  howl did one of the most ruby red states fall the democrats
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:31.240]  just all the money the more because moore did kind of hide
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:36.760]  a lot once this stuff came out that was a huge factor you can't be invisible and
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:40.440]  be a candidate riding your horse is not going to get you votes
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:47.800]  moore was too extreme even for alabama uh even his wife's comments at the
[02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:51.240]  rally the night before oh we're not anti-semitic
[02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:58.200]  one of our lawyers is a jew uh it was so so so expanding on that
[02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:01.560]  matt drudge is right that you just can't push it this far
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:05.880]  well look uh i i you had roi moore saying
[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:10.440]  that homosexual activity between consulting adult should be illegal
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:15.160]  i'm sorry i'm a libertarian what consenting adults do behind closed doors
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:21.640]  is their business i hear you and it's so extreme even for alabama too extreme
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:24.840]  uh so moore was too far out of the mainstream
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:28.760]  he was a poor campaigner he wasn't terribly articulate
[02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:33.560]  and when attacked he didn't punch back he disappeared
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:37.400]  that is a cardinal mistake a cardinal rule
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:40.840]  if you're gonna get attacked you gotta respond we had a friend that come on the
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:43.240]  show off and and and i just didn't
[02:53:43.240 --> 02:53:46.280]  wasn't off record discussion they were just afraid i'd ask tough questions
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:50.200]  and i said yeah i'm gonna bring up how young girls as you day because i think
[02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:54.200]  it's a little creepy but so so they passed up the
[02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:58.680]  opportunity to be seen by millions of liberty minded voters
[02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:05.000]  and thousands of them in alabama it was an inept campaign a poor candidate and
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.560]  unfortunately the president was pushed into a series of unfortunate choices
[02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:13.480]  all right let's check yours here what are they gonna do where do you think the
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:16.520]  russian investigation goes now that it's literally a point
[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:20.040]  exposing the fraud and it's unraveling by the day as new documents come out they've
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:24.360]  been trying to hold them back it's now it's a deluge a a a a collapse
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:28.440]  level floodgates have been opened what do they do now
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:31.880]  we know it's me too that's their go-to uh but if
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:34.920]  trump doesn't roll over or the republicans don't roll over to all this
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:37.720]  ridiculousness it doesn't do anything so where do they go
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:40.920]  and they're hysterics because they're reaching new levels
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:44.840]  but actually i give you credit for this the instant the Weinstein
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:49.880]  thing broke you said on this show they're going to recycle the phony charges
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:53.560]  against trump now you predicted it before anyone
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:56.840]  i know and that's precisely what we see unfolding
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:00.120]  but i can see the pr rollout they did this on purpose they couldn't cover
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:02.120]  this up anymore his brother wanted to burn him
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:05.560]  they've been spending it was already coming down so they decided to do it
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.800]  it's it's clear rollout but what i think the answer
[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:14.520]  alex is uh as i told the new york daily news and the washington times this week
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:20.680]  and uh vanity fair i still believe that the only two people on the planet who
[02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:23.480]  don't realize that muhler is going to bring a
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:27.480]  charge of either obstruction or perjury against the president
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:31.960]  are the president's two lawyers now it's very important to understand that
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:37.080]  ty cobb one of the president's two lawyers does not work for donald j trump he
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.200]  works for the hold on stay there you're supposed to the fourth hour i'm gonna tell

[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:38.360]  algreen he's back again with more impeachment
[03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:41.000]  pushes after it failed earlier this week we're gonna play that
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.800]  video coming up roger stone's gonna be hosting after that i'm gonna turn the
[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:48.200]  baton over to him but roger i saw it as a big deal
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:52.680]  over the weekend on the cbs's weekend show
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:57.480]  they had the former head of the cia he was enter them had former deputy
[03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:01.880]  director come out and say we were wrong we
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:04.600]  spot on the president elect we spot on the president
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:08.920]  it was political uh it was wrong and he's been a hillary supporter and a
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:12.920]  democrat so to have michael morrell do that i i see
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:16.600]  that as a real white flag and that they realize they've been caught on this
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:20.360]  Russian thing i don't want to over celebrate that
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:24.920]  and it could be a foil you you're smarter with your instincts when it comes to
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:28.200]  this but i mean these guys don't usually come out and do this unless they
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:31.240]  know that they're they're rolling over and showing their little pink bellies
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:34.920]  what do you say well the evidence is now so
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:39.800]  overwhelming you know the fisa court handed down these documents in
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:44.120]  november that showed that the the nsa under obama
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:47.400]  essentially conducted political espionage on
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:51.320]  30 000 americans you may remember when
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:56.680]  judge napolitano reported this at fox that the president had been
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:59.720]  surveilled said it was insane and fake and then he'd been fired
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:02.680]  or he'd been at least and when he'd just gone on vacation it wasn't true
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:06.920]  plus it's all been proven correct right so when are they gonna apologize to him
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:13.320]  the answer sadly is never he was right on the money so i think it's abundantly
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:18.120]  clear they were spying on the president they were spying on his son-in-law
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:22.920]  they were spying on paul manifold they were spying on the entire campaign
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:26.840]  apparatus this is a an egregious crime far worse
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:30.120]  than water it's a violation of the election the voters
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:33.080]  the trust using all this thing against the people
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:36.920]  that i mean yeah this is serious felonies it's a violation of the
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:41.080]  fourth amendment now let's compare that to what happened in watergate
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:45.320]  where some private contractors as it were
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:49.240]  failed to put bugs in the democratic national
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:53.400]  headquarters compare that to using the power of the state the
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:57.480]  investigative might and capability of our
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:01.160]  taxpayer finance surveillance agencies to conduct
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:05.560]  political espionage on the republican presidential candidate
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:09.400]  post convention that is an outrageous crime
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:14.200]  clapper rice brennan roads and that's my next question
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:18.440]  where are the indictments i like to laugh at it but it's actually scary that
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:23.560]  they're this hubert is filled and arrogant and crazy and to be sending
[03:03:23.560 --> 03:03:28.760]  emails and text messages bragging i mean these people are insane
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:32.280]  it's brazen is what it is and if we had
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:36.920]  an attorney general who was awake it's also criminal by the way you've been
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:41.720]  harping on this forever and rightfully so but i gotta agree with you now
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:46.120]  sessions has been compromised what in hades is going on
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:49.720]  no rod rozenstein is the de facto attorney general
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:54.600]  of the united states uh i don't know whether jeff sessions who i think was
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:57.480]  a very good man in the senate i don't know whether he's
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:04:01.480]  compromised i don't know if he is manipulated i don't know
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:05.480]  how he is being controlled but all he seems to care about
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:10.680]  is a crackdown on state legalized marijuana in the 29 states where they
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:16.680]  use literally the sad caricature of a 1940s boss hog now and i used to love
[03:04:16.680 --> 03:04:19.800]  him for leaking stuff about immigration things he was a good senator but
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:23.240]  he alo alabamans are mad at him too i mean he needs to go
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:27.800]  now he it's time to resign now it was publicly reported that he had
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.760]  recused himself in uranium one and then dr jerry coursey dug into that and
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:36.200]  found out it was not true therefore to be clear
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:39.480]  sessions could appoint the special prosecutor we need
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:43.960]  to dig into Mueller and uranium one today that's right he recused himself on
[03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:47.560]  the fake russia investigation not right uranium one
[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:53.480]  not uranium one we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen

[03:06:03.960 --> 03:06:09.880]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:15.720]  you know it's a death-defying life i lead i take my chances
[03:06:15.720 --> 03:06:19.800]  and i don't say that to act tough i don't say that we're crashing through the
[03:06:19.800 --> 03:06:23.960]  lies and disinformation to act like i'm big boy
[03:06:23.960 --> 03:06:27.880]  i don't want to be a big boy i don't want to risk my life
[03:06:27.880 --> 03:06:31.960]  but you know i'm not one of these cowardly souls that rolls over to tyrants
[03:06:31.960 --> 03:06:36.040]  and i'm i'm here to make war on them and we've proven
[03:06:36.040 --> 03:06:40.760]  that liners from 15 years ago at least
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:49.560]  so it's like 19 years old crashing through the lies and disinformation
[03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:56.680]  we play that liner one more time because that's been around since at least 1999
[03:06:56.680 --> 03:07:01.480]  so i guess that's like 18 years and that's what we do that's what you do
[03:07:01.480 --> 03:07:05.320]  we have we have like we were fighter races
[03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:08.680]  we've got the decals all down the plane and what we shot down and you did that
[03:07:08.680 --> 03:07:11.960]  too our victories are your victories
[03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:17.960]  and the plane is like covered with our shootdowns
[03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:21.400]  the number of tanks we bombed the number of ridges we blew out the number
[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:25.240]  of other aircraft we took out you know the number of buildings we strafed i
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:29.320]  mean it is ridiculous the body count politically
[03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:32.680]  but we're firing americana which they won't you forget about and that way
[03:07:32.680 --> 03:07:35.320]  doesn't exist we just dug up x caliber it's not even
[03:07:35.320 --> 03:07:40.680]  i was like whoa what's this thing free market success decent things
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:44.680]  and i get mad at myself not the crew because i don't see us as that important
[03:07:44.680 --> 03:07:49.080]  like info wars dot com news wars dot com this has been out i've learned
[03:07:49.080 --> 03:08:00.920]  for over an hour and a half and i hadn't refreshed info wars dot com my fault
[03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:04.760]  but i plagiarize that plagiarize that's a rush one ball thing
[03:08:04.760 --> 03:08:10.040]  roger stones about to join us this article high level fbi agents this is in
[03:08:10.040 --> 03:08:13.400]  the new emails more coming out they're doling them out hoping we don't see
[03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:16.680]  all this because they threatened contempt of congress
[03:08:16.680 --> 03:08:20.520]  high level fbi agents discussed insurance policy
[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:26.760]  in case trump won the election they said we can't take the risk this is
[03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:30.600]  strokes or strokes or however you say it
[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:35.480]  i want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in andy's office
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:39.000]  and the prayer revered fbi director andrew mccabe
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:42.840]  good god they've got running stuff this is a literal operative like stones that
[03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:47.080]  weeks ago that there is no way he gets elected but i'm afraid we
[03:08:47.080 --> 03:08:50.360]  can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:53.720]  unlikely event you die before 40 page goes on
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:57.080]  to appear to respond according so they made up the whole dossier
[03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:00.120]  paid the wife of the justice department official to make it up in
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:06.680]  threat gps and it's all out or fusing gps it's all out and the new emails just
[03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:10.440]  came out god it's every hour this is unbelievable
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:14.120]  this is open and shut in front of a jury conspiracy to commit fraud
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:18.040]  conspiracy to get false indictments official oppression
[03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:21.480]  uh in conspiracy to defraud taxpayers for fake money
[03:09:21.480 --> 03:09:25.080]  for fake dossiers i mean roger stone this
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:28.680]  article everybody listening has got a tweet this out at real
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:30.680]  elix jones they've got a tweeted out poll watching
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:34.600]  we just got to go crazy i just cannot believe
[03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:37.960]  that this is coming out i mean you add this to everything else roger
[03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:42.760]  this is beyond sensational this is an extravaganza
[03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:46.680]  of evidence alexie it's the drip drip drip of chinese
[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:50.600]  water torture they are dying the death of a thousand cuts
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:55.640]  as their lies uh in their partisanship in their true plans and motives because
[03:09:55.640 --> 03:09:59.640]  they thought hillary would get in so the dumb people are on the official fbi
[03:09:59.640 --> 03:10:03.320]  email talking about the criminal actions they're involved in
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:06.840]  right because they were confident they'd be able to cover it all up the way they
[03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:09.960]  covered up the clinton's crimes in the 80s
[03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:16.120]  uh the headline is fbi agents caught attempting to frame trump i mean
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:20.280]  well and notice the andrew mccabe who is referenced in that story
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:25.720]  is the same gentleman who is stonewalling the house intelligence committee
[03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:30.120]  stonewalling uh chairman who who represented that mccabe would be fair
[03:10:30.120 --> 03:10:33.000]  and balanced because when trump finds out he's going to go ape
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  i mean we now have mccabe is like quarterbacking the whole operation
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.960]  so they get rid of one group and a whole not like shark teeth
[03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:44.840]  another larcenist group comes in but the other question is who advised the
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:50.200]  president to keep mr mccabe in his job see i believe that
[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:54.520]  comey should have been discharged literally the second trump hooked his
[03:10:54.520 --> 03:10:57.880]  hand off the bible he should have turned to comey and said
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:02.840]  you're fired uh for whatever reason they did not do that there was never
[03:11:02.840 --> 03:11:06.680]  any house cleaning at the fbi there was never any
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:10.920]  house cleaning at the doj so what you have in
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:15.240]  this administration is trump appointees at the very top
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:18.920]  and once you get to the second and third levels it's an army
[03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:23.400]  of obama apparatus and there's never been a house cleaning
[03:11:23.400 --> 03:11:28.360]  but i mean the overreach that they've been caught this is spectacular i can't
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:30.840]  imagine with the drip drip where this is going
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:33.640]  because you said the america people are paying attention they're awake they're
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:35.960]  getting it i mean they have been caught in the most
[03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:41.320]  classic kangaroo investigation uh will will muller still have the
[03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:45.240]  wavos to have his swamp jury his swamp grand jury out of dc
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:48.040]  indict the president when he is a literal russian agent
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:51.400]  muller well an incredible story also alex on
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:55.800]  politico which the justice department refuses to disclose
[03:11:55.800 --> 03:11:59.160]  the contents of a waiver that was given to
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:04.360]  mr. muller so that he could assume this very job as special counsel
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:08.360]  this is a waiver that presumably pertains to his
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:12.520]  conflicts at wilmer hail the law firm that he left
[03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:16.440]  to take this appointed position which is up to its eyeballs and shady russian
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:20.920]  deals now among other things now uh tyler nixon
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:26.360]  uh the young uh activist a california attorney and investigative
[03:12:26.360 --> 03:12:29.720]  reporter who's going to join us later on the war room oh good
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:36.200]  has determined that uh muller it is uh while uh a member of the california
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:40.200]  bar he is now inactive why well inactive
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:44.200]  members cannot be charged with ethical lapses cannot be brought
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:47.160]  out to expand uh nix is what the grandson of richard
[03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:51.960]  melhaus nexon he is uh i guess great nephew of the former president
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:55.960]  he's a bulldog as an investigator and a reporter
[03:12:55.960 --> 03:12:59.480]  and an attorney and he's been digging into uh
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:03.880]  muller's bar status you see when you're on inactive status
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:08.920]  you can't be disciplined by the bar remember after the enron investigation
[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:12.760]  there were dozens of complaints against andrew weissman
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:16.760]  for his conduct uh in violation of the bar ethics
[03:13:16.760 --> 03:13:21.000]  so they don't want to repeat that again they go to inactive status
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:24.920]  to put themselves above the laws or i should say the rules
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:30.840]  for attorneys i don't think they survived this and i don't
[03:13:30.840 --> 03:13:33.720]  you know we know they were going to launch the me too stuff next year
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:37.160]  i don't think they survived this i i don't want to celebrate victory yet
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:42.200]  i just think we just gained there was a boxing match you know we just gained
[03:13:42.200 --> 03:13:45.000]  the upper hand here i mean this is really good news
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:49.960]  well and we look we have done more than our shared infowars of breaking the
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:54.520]  key parts of this story we were the first ones who told you that the
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:14:00.760]  wall street hedge fund uh a billionaire uh paul singer had financed the
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:06.120]  dirty dossier before it was tossed over to the clinton campaign and then the
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:09.800]  financing was picked up by the justice department in essence
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:14.920]  the fbi uh but at the same time kudos have to go to
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:18.760]  tucker carlson shorn hannity and judge janine
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:22.840]  pyro who have been stellar in helping us break
[03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:26.760]  this story for the american people and they've been trying to boycott them
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:29.720]  they've been trying to shut them down for that but if we have to give credit
[03:14:29.720 --> 03:14:33.080]  where to do even though you've been banned on fox and i'm you know i've been
[03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:35.800]  banned on there for at least five years we will give credit because we're not
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:38.440]  in competition with any of those people and then they've all been called
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:43.240]  russian agents too just like we have they are all patriots every one of them
[03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:47.880]  and their friends and they have done extraordinary reporting in the last
[03:14:47.880 --> 03:14:52.040]  10 days helping bring this yeah let me ask you that question going to break
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:56.360]  fox got really bad during the ales coup and was really bad about two months ago
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:15:00.280]  and suddenly it got better and now i guess they realized that they couldn't
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:03.080]  hold back the truth now they're hardcore what happened
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:07.240]  well you can still go see uh no they're still bad people but i mean
[03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:11.560]  comparatively it was bad really bad a few months ago i think that it just
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:15.800]  appears better to us because uh the big stories that they are helping
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:20.760]  develop and break uh an incredible story in the new york times by the way
[03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:24.600]  last weekend that judge janine went into brief for the president
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:29.480]  on mueller's conflicts and general john kelly told her you're not helping here
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:34.520]  extraordinary general kelly you're not helping here we're trying to roast this
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:37.480]  guy we were walking him down the plank here don't tell him we're walking him

[03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:59.240]  life digestive enzymes assist in the digestive
[03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:02.280]  process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by
[03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:05.240]  breaking down foods into easily absorbable components
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:08.440]  they also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:12.040]  undigested food particles in the gut digestive enzyme production declines
[03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:14.520]  as we age carnivore is filled with digestive
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:17.240]  enzymes like those naturally present in the body

[03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:23.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:29.880]  it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[03:20:29.880 --> 03:20:33.400]  yeah that's an example from the 80s the feds wanted to drive at 55
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:37.080]  maximum speed people just said no now the top speed in the u.s is 100
[03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:40.360]  and at places like montana 80s the high places like texas i think that's a
[03:20:40.360 --> 03:20:43.000]  reasonable number
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:53.960]  judge said just one more
[03:20:53.960 --> 03:20:59.720]  i'm going to throw your rear end in the county joint
[03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:05.800]  all right we're back live roger stowe's about to take over i i mentioned alan
[03:21:05.800 --> 03:21:08.920]  green and again they're just getting everybody conditioned that
[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:12.680]  impeachment's okay he introduced it last week barely gotten in co-sponsors
[03:21:12.680 --> 03:21:16.280]  well he's back this is yesterday afternoon
[03:21:16.280 --> 03:21:19.800]  he's back because you know we can't have the recovery and all the great things
[03:21:19.800 --> 03:21:22.760]  that are happening i mean if trump wasn't delivering or
[03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:26.760]  fighting to deliver then i'd abandon him in 10 seconds but
[03:21:26.760 --> 03:21:29.480]  now that the president's patted me on the head a few times
[03:21:29.480 --> 03:21:33.160]  it's that this is real we're returning power to america
[03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:38.120]  doesn't mean we're executing perfectly no but he's bringing power back to be the
[03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:40.920]  president kathryn awson fitz said that last hour
[03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:43.880]  or earlier this hour that's what's happening here's that clip we'll get
[03:21:43.880 --> 03:21:48.920]  roger stowe's take on it there will be another vote
[03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:53.640]  to impeach this president and he just wants to say he's behind where
[03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:58.520]  happened vote because i will not stand by and watch this
[03:21:58.520 --> 03:22:04.920]  country the country i love be brought into shame and
[03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:11.320]  disrepute because of a person who is unfit to hold the
[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:16.120]  office of president mr. speaker history will judge us all
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:19.320]  i'm sorry for those who find that this is
[03:22:19.320 --> 03:22:26.760]  unacceptable but the country is greater than we are
[03:22:26.760 --> 03:22:31.080]  government of the people by the people is greater than we are
[03:22:31.080 --> 03:22:34.680]  maintaining and saving the republic is greater than we are
[03:22:34.680 --> 03:22:38.760]  hit pause it's the democrats the republican leadership
[03:22:38.760 --> 03:22:41.960]  creating globalism killing our sovereignty killing our
[03:22:41.960 --> 03:22:46.120]  prosperity and it's all coming back
[03:22:46.760 --> 03:22:51.480]  and then they sit around and act like trump did something bad
[03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:58.760]  it's just i don't know about this country because it produced so much wealth
[03:22:58.760 --> 03:23:04.120]  it's produced lazy stupid people like algreen
[03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:08.200]  who get elected and go to congress
[03:23:09.160 --> 03:23:12.280]  he lives here in texas he sees how our economy is growing others are falling
[03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:16.120]  apart he doesn't care he wants to pass everything like california
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:20.920]  and just follow what he's told and try to impeach the president
[03:23:20.920 --> 03:23:25.320]  and build this up what a buffoon
[03:23:25.320 --> 03:23:30.440]  but he didn't care
[03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:33.560]  because guys like him think mainstream media matters
[03:23:33.560 --> 03:23:37.720]  let's finish the clip one sense but in another sense
[03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:42.360]  it really is who we are i have a tie on that says
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:50.040]  we the people we the people we are the ones who can make a difference
[03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:55.000]  there will be another vote i yield back the balance of my time
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:59.080]  this is a guy literally for tpp literally for selling our country out
[03:23:59.080 --> 03:24:02.840]  bringing in unveted jihadis and then he talks about the republic
[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:07.000]  and saving it when they they bash the american flag the night circuit bands
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:10.920]  wearing it in schools in in in a bunch of states california name it
[03:24:10.920 --> 03:24:13.880]  they call it flyover country they say they hate it
[03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:17.400]  they put out clips saying they hate it they have liberal comedians saying oh
[03:24:17.400 --> 03:24:20.840]  my boyfriend had an american flag i couldn't believe it's so horrible i mean
[03:24:20.840 --> 03:24:23.960]  these are like space aliens in america they're so
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:29.160]  whacked out but now suddenly they're wearing american flags
[03:24:29.160 --> 03:24:31.880]  what do you make
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:38.520]  what do you make of this uh roger stone well alex i gotta be honest with you i
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:42.680]  liked uh algreen much much better when he was
[03:24:42.680 --> 03:24:47.320]  singing r&b in gospel who can forget his fabulous song love and
[03:24:47.320 --> 03:24:51.240]  happy oh it's oh it's not the same guy i'm sorry
[03:24:51.240 --> 03:24:54.600]  look the guy's a carney barker but this is part of a
[03:24:54.600 --> 03:24:59.480]  strategy this is to get the words trump and impeachment into a headline to
[03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:04.360]  begin to condition people there's no doubt in my mind
[03:25:04.360 --> 03:25:07.960]  that this is a two-part act first they get
[03:25:07.960 --> 03:25:14.840]  Mueller to trump up some phony process oriented charge against the president
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:21.880]  perjury obstruction uh both in connection uh with the firing of comey
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:26.040]  then if the democrats take the house in 2018
[03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:32.120]  well then mr green's dream will be fulfilled we have the excuse the the
[03:25:32.120 --> 03:25:37.560]  the rationale for impeachment uh the only people on the
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:40.920]  face of the planet who don't seem to understand this
[03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:44.840]  are the president's lawyer and that's why i played it because coming exactly the
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:49.960]  president's lawyers get into that well they they're looking at algreen and
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:53.400]  they're saying oh this guy doesn't have the votes they don't
[03:25:53.400 --> 03:25:56.440]  understand that this is just an early salvo now
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:26:03.000]  this is very important uh although uh mr dowd john dowd works for the
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  donald j trump personally ty cob who i guess got his name from a baseball
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:12.840]  player uh works for the office of the president
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:16.360]  that means that none of his communications with the president are
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:19.880]  privileged that means that muller can question him
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:24.360]  can demand his notes and records i i think this is
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:30.360]  reckless to say the least but the president as recently as last night
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:34.600]  told someone i spoke to that he is expecting a letter
[03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:41.240]  imminently from the special counsel clearing him of any russian collusion
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:45.080]  i don't know any savvy observer in washington
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:48.520]  who believes that that's about to really happen
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:51.560]  uh and i still believe the president's lawyers
[03:26:51.560 --> 03:26:55.720]  who are outgunned and outmanned by the vast
[03:26:55.720 --> 03:27:01.800]  get trump squad employed by mr muller at taxpayer expense
[03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:05.560]  is slow walking our president to the gallows
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:09.240]  they just completely misunderstand the level of
[03:27:09.240 --> 03:27:12.760]  enmity that the two-party duopoly and the
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:16.840]  ruling elites the clintons and the bushes at all
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:21.080]  have for donald trump and the miracle that he pulled off in last year's
[03:27:21.080 --> 03:27:25.160]  election they want to negate the results of the
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:28.680]  last presidential election they want to achieve
[03:27:28.680 --> 03:27:33.000]  through a coup what they could not achieve at the ballot box
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:36.520]  remove donald trump
[03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:43.960]  continue roger so so i look i think that uh it is vitally important that the
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:48.920]  president understand this that he not be lulled into this
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:55.560]  false sense of security uh the fact that he is now going to
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:27:59.400]  florida on the weekends the fact that he is now
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:03.400]  back to his habits of roaming his palatial
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:08.280]  estate marlago that he is mixing with old friends
[03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:11.960]  alex it's not incidental that he went to palm beach
[03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:15.160]  and when he came back he posted those incredible
[03:28:15.160 --> 03:28:19.880]  videos showing uh the islamic terrorists killing a
[03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:24.680]  handicapped dutch man general kelly was tearing his hair out
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:27.880]  oh my god the president stumbled on to the truth
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:32.280]  and he posted it on his twitter feed wow okay roger stone's taking over on the

[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:33.720]  biden this morning on cbs they held him over for an extra
[03:33:33.720 --> 03:33:39.080]  segment and he actually said with a straight face
[03:33:39.080 --> 03:33:43.640]  that in the eight years of barack obama there was never even a
[03:33:43.640 --> 03:33:49.720]  hint of scandal what planet does this man live on
[03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:53.880]  there was the irs targeting scandal the
[03:33:53.880 --> 03:34:00.680]  veterans administration waiting list scandal the gsa spending spree
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:07.480]  scandal the attack on the ben gazi compound scandal the clinton

[03:34:28.040 --> 03:34:34.840]  but it's clear that he's warming up for a campaign for president
[03:34:34.840 --> 03:34:41.480]  we can only be so lucky my second choice after crooked hillary
[03:34:41.480 --> 03:34:47.320]  would be a dumb joe every time he has run for president
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:51.400]  his candidacy has been has come crashing down
[03:34:51.400 --> 03:34:58.040]  with no votes and then extraordinarily he has the audacity
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:05.480]  to excoriate judge roi moore and excoriate the president on the issue
[03:35:05.480 --> 03:35:13.720]  of sexual harassment when we can see photo and video upon video upon video
[03:35:13.720 --> 03:35:20.200]  demonstrating the fact that creepy old joe can't seem to keep his hands
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:27.480]  off of children can't seem to know when to give up in that warm embrace
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:32.280]  with grown women my all-time favorite is the picture of him
[03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:36.200]  embracing hillary and not knowing when to stop
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:39.560]  she has one of the most uncomfortable looks on her face
[03:35:39.560 --> 03:35:45.560]  i've ever seen joe biden this guy is a real fraud
[03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:49.720]  somebody told me a great joe biden story not long ago
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:56.360]  there's a racino that's a casino that has a racetrack that has

[03:36:16.040 --> 03:36:21.400]  lower delaware so popular that the line of customers starts at the door and
[03:36:21.400 --> 03:36:27.640]  almost goes around the block well who should show up for the buffet
[03:36:27.640 --> 03:36:31.240]  and go right to the head of the line but the

[03:41:28.600 --> 03:41:33.240]  uh yesterday i told a prominent conservative publisher
[03:41:33.240 --> 03:41:37.000]  uh that if the president is brought down in a
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:41.400]  coup d'etat i was going to write the successor book
[03:41:41.400 --> 03:41:45.640]  the unmaking of the president and i had begun
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:48.760]  sadly taking notes now if the president
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:52.440]  thrives and survives if he beats back the globalist
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:55.880]  cabal that seeks to sack him in a takedown
[03:41:55.880 --> 03:42:00.360]  i of course will not write this book but right now i've begun
[03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:03.560]  taking notes because the president's lawyers
[03:42:03.560 --> 03:42:07.720]  are walking him towards the gallows and fortunately
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:11.640]  we at info wars are the clarion call

[03:42:20.120 --> 03:42:25.800]  and if they take the president down these people will not go back to sleep
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:30.440]  i'm roger stone and you're at info wars
[03:42:30.440 --> 03:42:45.720]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic

[03:42:51.800 --> 03:42:56.040]  another former facebook executive has come out against the social media giant
[03:42:56.040 --> 03:43:01.080]  former facebook vice president chamath polyhapitia revealed that he feels
[03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:04.520]  his role in heading a company which is aiding the destruction of society
[03:43:04.520 --> 03:43:08.120]  he believes social media networks are employing tools that are destroying
[03:43:08.120 --> 03:43:11.960]  society's social fabric pointing to the insatiable need for hearts
[03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:15.960]  likes and thumbs up you don't realize it but you are being programmed
[03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:20.200]  he also highlighted the way social media is able to manipulate mob mentality
[03:43:20.200 --> 03:43:23.960]  by referring to an incident in which seven indian people were lynched
[03:43:23.960 --> 03:43:27.400]  due to a whatsapp hoax that's what we're dealing with he said
[03:43:27.400 --> 03:43:31.880]  imagine taking that to the extreme where bad actors can now manipulate large
[03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:36.200]  swaths of people to do anything you want similar to tech giants before him
[03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:39.880]  polyhapitia says his children are not allowed to use facebook
[03:43:39.880 --> 03:43:43.080]  and he recommends the rest of us take a hard break from the app

[03:48:01.960 --> 03:48:06.440]  from the white house to the inauguration of the
[03:48:06.440 --> 03:48:10.200]  new government in Haiti which was essentially
[03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:14.760]  the old government with a different front man
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:21.320]  these are the same people who participated in the rape of Haiti in the
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:25.240]  wake of the earthquake this is an issue that
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:28.920]  president trump himself raised during the campaign
[03:48:28.920 --> 03:48:32.120]  you see bill clinton got himself appointed
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:40.200]  un special ambassador to oversee the aid to haiti in the
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:44.280]  wake of that horrific natural disaster
[03:48:44.280 --> 03:48:47.960]  and the clinton's and the clinton crime family
[03:48:47.960 --> 03:48:53.800]  boosted literally millions of dollars from the Haitian people
[03:48:53.800 --> 03:48:59.080]  hillary controlled the federal dollars bill controlled the international
[03:48:59.080 --> 03:49:04.840]  dollars and the bids for housing roads hospitals and
[03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:11.160]  other uh uh relief efforts were put out to the clinton's
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:17.800]  cronies the people were raped but instead
[03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:24.200]  amorosa who knew that they had stolen two elections was working with the
[03:49:24.200 --> 03:49:29.240]  haiti support project and the shady democratic
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:36.200]  operative ron daniels so uh this finally came to not
[03:49:36.200 --> 03:49:40.520]  when amorosa formally asked whether she could hold
[03:49:40.520 --> 03:49:48.200]  her wedding in the rose garden she was denied that because by tradition
[03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:52.440]  only the presidential families who were married during
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:57.880]  the family's time in the white house can hold such a ceremony
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:01.000]  for example president nixon's daughter
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:08.040]  trisha uh nixon married ed cox in such a ceremony
[03:50:08.040 --> 03:50:11.720]  when she was denied didn't seem to stop
[03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:18.040]  amorosa white house guards were astounded when her entire wedding party
[03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:23.640]  showed up unannounced at the white house and began to party down
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:28.760]  in the rose garden it was only a matter of time before
[03:50:28.760 --> 03:50:36.440]  general john kelly bagged amorosa and now she is gone
[03:50:36.440 --> 03:50:40.520]  physically dragged and escorted off the white house crowns
[03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:45.800]  on the orders of general john kelly good riddance
[03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:50.680]  all amorosa did was enable the continued rape
[03:50:50.680 --> 03:50:54.520]  of the Haitian people by the same gang of criminals
[03:50:54.520 --> 03:50:57.720]  who raped them under bill and hillary
[03:50:57.720 --> 03:51:05.240]  clinton we are still pardon me trying to ascertain
[03:51:05.240 --> 03:51:12.120]  the damage done by yesterday's alabama election the pundits of course have
[03:51:12.120 --> 03:51:18.600]  immediately tried to project that this is a coming indicator
[03:51:18.600 --> 03:51:26.440]  for the 2018 off-year elections i can tell you after 40 years in american
[03:51:26.440 --> 03:51:30.040]  politics one special election does not a
[03:51:30.040 --> 03:51:37.720]  cycle make and in politics a day is a lifetime look at the way
[03:51:37.720 --> 03:51:44.840]  that the veneer for example of the once respected and wanted fbi
[03:51:44.840 --> 03:51:49.080]  and the justice department is being stripped away
[03:51:49.080 --> 03:51:55.960]  day by day as robert muhler and his confederates are exposed
[03:51:55.960 --> 03:52:03.640]  as the partisan hit team that they are we have the incredible activities of
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:09.800]  mr sprock now how ironic that the fbi agent
[03:52:09.800 --> 03:52:14.920]  who general mike flinn is accused of lying to
[03:52:14.920 --> 03:52:20.440]  is the same fbi agent who interviewed sharyl
[03:52:20.440 --> 03:52:27.400]  mills and uh the uh the top obama staff including
[03:52:27.400 --> 03:52:34.760]  whom i abed him uh and who gave both of them immunity in the email
[03:52:34.760 --> 03:52:41.560]  scandal how ironic that mr strach is that same fbi agent
[03:52:41.560 --> 03:52:46.520]  who provided the wording for mr muhler's pardon me
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:50.600]  mr comey's final assessment of the hillary
[03:52:50.600 --> 03:52:55.720]  email scandal claiming that she was uh careless
[03:52:55.720 --> 03:53:01.960]  rather than negligent thus avoiding a criminal charge
[03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:05.800]  seems that there are different standards for these
[03:53:05.800 --> 03:53:12.520]  uh justice department crusaders uh under uh obama looking into hillary
[03:53:12.520 --> 03:53:20.120]  and now looking into donald trump so uh it is a mistake to assume
[03:53:20.120 --> 03:53:27.960]  that the defeat of roy more uh is uh a a stunning uh a portend of the elections
[03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:33.720]  to come maybe maybe not a strong and vibrant economy
[03:53:33.720 --> 03:53:38.040]  is the real key to the republicans holding
[03:53:38.040 --> 03:53:44.680]  both houses of congress but there is without any question
[03:53:44.680 --> 03:53:52.440]  subterfuge and an effort to undermine our president i learned this week
[03:53:52.440 --> 03:54:00.360]  that speaker paul ryan was aware as early as september of last year
[03:54:00.360 --> 03:54:04.520]  that the awan brothers the two pakistani
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:09.960]  it consultants brought into the house of representatives by
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:15.080]  debba waserman schultz the former democratic national
[03:54:15.080 --> 03:54:19.560]  committee chairwoman and congresswoman who got caught
[03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:24.760]  red-handed rigging the democratic nomination process
[03:54:24.760 --> 03:54:31.720]  for bernie sanders uh but ryan was aware that the awan brothers had stolen
[03:54:31.720 --> 03:54:38.360]  almost 16 million dollars in a cyber crime he also
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:54:45.000]  was aware that the awan brothers had tapped into the email of
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:52.440]  45 members of congress and it can only be presumed that the
[03:54:52.440 --> 03:54:58.280]  fact that no democrat has been willing to step forward to testify against them
[03:54:58.280 --> 03:55:02.520]  that these emails will be used for the purpose of blackmail
[03:55:02.520 --> 03:55:07.160]  now if paul ryan had made this known to the american people
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:12.120]  prior to the election it would have helped donald trump and hurt the
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:18.280]  democrats so what reason is there for the speaker
[03:55:18.280 --> 03:55:22.600]  delaying the public's knowledge of this
[03:55:22.600 --> 03:55:29.240]  burgeoning scandal until after the election you can email us right here
