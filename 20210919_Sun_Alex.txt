[00:00.000 --> 00:19.920]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:19.920 --> 00:26.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:26.200 --> 00:33.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a live Sunday transmission, September 19th, 2021.
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.400]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from Washington, D.C. and the Internet just went out in our
[00:38.400 --> 00:41.920]  hotel about 30 minutes ago with it not come back in.
[00:41.920 --> 00:46.600]  Our hotspot is not working, so major sell out it's here, but we'll be back soon.
[00:46.600 --> 00:53.800]  Oh, employer is in the ATX and we'll be riding shotgun with us for the next four hours.
[00:53.800 --> 00:59.680]  Look, I've told everybody that I get on air, I've been on air 27, 28 years and I've used
[00:59.680 --> 01:04.520]  to say every once a year this is the biggest, most important show we've ever done.
[01:04.520 --> 01:08.360]  About 10 years ago I'd say it every couple months and then in the now the last couple
[01:08.360 --> 01:13.400]  years I've been saying it every week because things just get more intense, more insane.
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.840]  That's called a quickening and so I have a ton of news and a ton of notes here on so
[01:19.840 --> 01:26.280]  many fronts but it all shows the globalist 10 to 2030 destabilization and take down to
[01:26.280 --> 01:30.120]  the United States because we have nuclear weapons, they can't take us down that way,
[01:30.120 --> 01:35.400]  they have to take us down by infiltrating us and by demoralizing us and by turning us
[01:35.400 --> 01:38.600]  against each other on a mass scale.
[01:38.600 --> 01:44.160]  So I want to bring Owen Schreuer in here because what I tend to do is and the show is successful
[01:44.160 --> 01:52.280]  but at exposing the globalist sometimes we need to just pull back, things are so frantic,
[01:52.280 --> 01:56.760]  take a deep breath, I'm speaking to myself right now, I'm not lecturing you, take a deep
[01:56.760 --> 02:02.480]  breath and just look at the big picture, understand God is in control, there's actually a great
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.320]  awakening happened, we let evil grow so much and get away with so much that God removed
[02:07.320 --> 02:12.400]  the part of the protection and so now we're seeing evil make its move as it always does
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.120]  and it's going to generate a great awakening but let me just tell you what's coming up
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.520]  today and I'm going to shoot a report on this either tonight or in the morning and so I'm
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.040]  just going to build this up as it needs to be built up.
[02:26.040 --> 02:35.080]  We had conversations with individuals let's just say on Biden's detail on September 10th,
[02:35.080 --> 02:42.560]  September 11th inside the Secret Service and I'm going to leave it at that and they confirmed
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.080]  to us that they're really concerned about the country and that the people controlling
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.640]  Biden are basically communist Chinese agents and this is directly from the Secret Service
[02:52.640 --> 02:59.280]  inside the White House and the details separately and that Biden when he said I just got my
[02:59.280 --> 03:06.640]  butt wiped it's true he's defecating all over himself because he has dementia and they follow
[03:06.640 --> 03:13.360]  him around with a whole pelican case that's about two feet long and about a foot wide
[03:13.360 --> 03:20.280]  full of drugs he's on that he's injected with and that Biden doesn't know who he is at three
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.640]  a.m. at night and roams around the White House yelling at people and not knowing who he is
[03:24.640 --> 03:32.400]  and defecating on himself and that when he was in New Jersey to survey some of the damage
[03:32.400 --> 03:39.200]  there on the 10th that he had to change clothes repeatedly because he kept defecating on himself
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.440]  and you can see those days he did this and this is a very sad thing they put this puppet
[03:43.440 --> 03:48.000]  in so they can commit all these crimes destroy the border bankrupt the dollar launch all
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.520]  these wars engage in all these crimes and then basically it'll be seen as America doing
[03:53.520 --> 03:58.920]  it that's the globalist model so I have all that news directly from the Secret Service
[03:58.920 --> 04:03.960]  that they're just the Federation total peril Biden is completely off his mind out of his
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.840]  mind on drugs just like JFK he's being injected with pharmaceutical graded methamphetamine
[04:09.840 --> 04:17.480]  he could die at any moment we have that news then we have this news we've confirmed the
[04:17.480 --> 04:22.360]  video from our sources and law enforcement in Texas you've got McCallan that is hours
[04:22.360 --> 04:27.360]  away from Del Rio on the Texas Mexico border I'll tell you about that as well there is
[04:27.360 --> 04:35.120]  a caravan a second caravan of thousands of Haitians marching right now from the major
[04:35.120 --> 04:41.840]  town in Mexico that there were there's a few hours ago we know so they have now arrived
[04:41.840 --> 04:47.240]  there and there's no law enforcement or anybody waiting in McCallan when they slam in in the
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.440]  next few hours then we have even bigger news on the vaccine front with the FDA coming out
[04:51.440 --> 04:55.440]  saying don't give people the shots basically yellow carding it the media trying to spin
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.280]  it it was just about boosters all hell is breaking loose the quickening is here we'll
[04:59.280 --> 05:04.560]  cover it all straight ahead without destroyers there was globalist general Milley has revealed
[05:04.560 --> 05:09.280]  to the world that the United States is not a free republic but it's run by a permanent
[05:09.280 --> 05:15.640]  state by network bureaucracy the big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone he felt that
[05:15.640 --> 05:21.440]  he was safe to talk of an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by not
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.840]  just our government the five eyes the Russians and the Chinese he wanted the world to know
[05:25.840 --> 05:30.880]  that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state this permanent
[05:30.880 --> 05:36.800]  bureaucracy sees America as its enemy it sees the American people as its enemy it sees prosperity
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.840]  as its enemy and it conspired with the communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say
[05:41.840 --> 05:47.240]  Trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond
[05:47.240 --> 05:52.400]  first that's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in
[05:52.400 --> 05:56.880]  their own vetted bubble they try to get away with this Milley and all of his accomplices
[05:56.880 --> 06:17.040]  need to go to prison now for life big brother mainstream media government coverups you want
[06:17.040 --> 06:27.320]  to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones

[09:43.120 --> 09:50.000]  a secret service they told us back in two thousand sixteen two months before the election
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.320]  they said you just got to follow him in the ambulance that follows hillary and they said
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.840]  hillary is falling down having convulsions every 45 minutes on average she's got a brain
[09:58.840 --> 10:02.800]  tumor she's got to have surgery but they want to wait to laugh at the campaign and she's
[10:02.800 --> 10:07.200]  having convulsions because they got to take her off the drugs so she's not all drugged
[10:07.200 --> 10:14.080]  up uh the anti-seizure medication but then when when they do that so she can be on stage
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.240]  she tends to have seizures so they were having to like follow with multiple ambulances remember
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.920]  we caught her mentally we were caught her inside the tent in uh in ohio in cleveland collapsed
[10:23.920 --> 10:28.800]  for an hour and a half we didn't catch the actual collapse okay well then a man i guess

[10:34.320 --> 10:39.360]  know a potato or a side of beef so we have those sources were on record telling you she
[10:39.360 --> 10:43.200]  was collapsing and then of course it happened with a convulsion you can see on video so
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.920]  biden and i'm not this is very sad for our country folks they really positioned us for
[10:47.920 --> 10:52.240]  massive falls so we've got all that news for you okay and then we've got huge news we're
[10:52.240 --> 10:59.920]  going to cover next segment i'm going to start getting into uh the situation uh a holder situation

[11:06.480 --> 11:11.520]  we can put all that on screen for you and we'll do it next segment but tim inlow who's here
[11:11.520 --> 11:17.440]  with me in dc he also is reporting for us he went down there with some of the rest of our crew and
[11:17.440 --> 11:23.120]  some other former law enforcement military people when it peaked out at about 12 000 people by the
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.120]  time they left uh on friday from the border got back to austin we had an airplane saturday morning
[11:29.120 --> 11:35.280]  flew up here for the event um on the 18th expose him a new process is being violated
[11:35.280 --> 11:42.240]  and now he has all the sources down there we've been down there better nine times on the border
[11:42.240 --> 11:47.360]  and so mcallon is hours and hours away from del rio it has a giant care of annotations
[11:47.360 --> 11:53.520]  in the thousands about the slam into it and all the resources have been sent to del rio
[11:53.520 --> 12:00.400]  where it's now not 15 000 like you're saying okay it's it's it's more like 20 000 and like i told you
[12:00.400 --> 12:05.760]  the un always runs these caravans at 50 to 100 000 they're testing the level getting us trained
[12:05.760 --> 12:12.400]  first it's a thousand then it's 10 000 then it's 50 000 then it's 100 000 and they usually break
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.480]  those up in five or six attacks to totally overwhelm everything they're loaded on buses
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.680]  taken by the democrats to be put on welfare and farmed for their money so we have the secret
[12:21.680 --> 12:28.160]  service news we have the giant fda news we have the collapse of the border news and more but this
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.840]  really is an emergency broadcast this is the globalist in control of the federal government
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.480]  with millie who literally is on tape saying china will defeat america china will take over america
[12:36.480 --> 12:41.840]  and that's a good thing we will recede they will take over with their values he is a sycophant
[12:41.840 --> 12:47.360]  globalist and a lot of them are china files meaning they follow that you know if you were a rusa file
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.000]  you love the russians if you're a anglophile you love the english it's kind of files love rape

[13:11.680 --> 13:16.960]  century warfare and they could normalize the fact that we're being attacked and gaslight us in the
[13:16.960 --> 13:22.240]  mass pockham syndrome and we go into the normalcy bias they have now demoralized us and conquered us
[13:22.240 --> 13:27.680]  the good news is all over the world when the authoritarian police try to block people being
[13:27.680 --> 13:32.080]  able to go from one state to another which is you know there's no borders in australia they're
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.920]  beating men women and children they're now overrunning the police everywhere the police dare

[14:03.360 --> 14:09.600]  three weeks ago but the headline from wane allen root is the radical communist takeover of our
[14:09.600 --> 14:16.320]  country is here and if they succeed america is finished unless we move quickly and remember alex
[14:16.320 --> 14:20.880]  we were having a discussion about a sense of urgency what separates info wars and quite frankly
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.480]  this audience it's it's all of us combined the crew us on air the audience what separates us from
[14:26.480 --> 14:31.680]  the rest of the media and and and just people to follow politics is that we have a sense of urgency
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.560]  we've had a sense of urgency about all this stuff for years now alex and now it's coming to a head
[14:36.560 --> 14:43.760]  our border has been surrendered our foreign policy is being used against us our politicians i mean
[14:43.760 --> 14:49.600]  for god's sakes we have feinstein swalwell biden all caught in bed with the chinese communist
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.840]  milley no punishments no investigations but then what happens oh yet another event that the media
[14:55.840 --> 15:02.800]  wants to be a false flag in in dc this week turns out that you have feds at the event with guns
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.880]  masked they're the only ones that get arrested that day and they flash their badge and say oh
[15:06.880 --> 15:10.960]  we're fed no and that's the other area i didn't get into we have the collapsing border more caravans

[15:15.600 --> 15:20.080]  the incredible news of them admitting and an fda scientist almost unanimously saying the whole
[15:20.080 --> 15:23.920]  vaccines have failed they're all bad stopped them the media trying to hide what they really said
[15:23.920 --> 15:29.200]  we've got all those video clips and and we it's just incredible and then you've got uh biden let me
[15:29.200 --> 15:32.880]  understand we've talked directly to the people involved that were there with him what he was
[15:32.880 --> 15:37.280]  had feces running down his legs crafting all over himself and them having to give him all these
[15:37.280 --> 15:43.440]  drugs people even operate i mean this this is emblematic of how the position does for a fall
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.200]  we'll be right back with no one shroyer this is the olshon so sunday edition sunday live comes up
[15:47.200 --> 16:05.200]  six p.m central what was the most important point in joe biden's declaration of war against america
[16:05.200 --> 16:12.640]  on thursday september night 2021 was it the announcement of forced inoculations of eight
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.280]  to a hundred million americans was it the announcement of federalization of all the major
[16:17.280 --> 16:23.440]  cities the bypassing of state governors the threat to basically remove them no it wasn't that was
[16:23.440 --> 16:30.960]  all bad enough it's the fact that he's following a un globalist great reset blueprint that australia
[16:30.960 --> 16:37.840]  the uk europe and the rest of western world is and that this is just the beginning more lockdowns
[16:37.840 --> 16:43.040]  national medical ids approved by the united nations carbon taxes that don't just track
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.440]  and trace you attach you but actually tell you when you could go somewhere and what you could do
[16:47.440 --> 16:54.560]  it's all been announced at the un level this is a un world government takeover corporate revolution
[16:54.560 --> 17:00.960]  through global governments it's illegal and congress must stand up and stop it now humanity
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.760]  is the main stakeholder on this planet but the big corporations for a hundred years is told us
[17:05.760 --> 17:10.400]  that humans are bad and evil and the pestilence on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.600]  and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet
[17:15.600 --> 17:21.040]  if you let a clown swab to have the daily scripts own wikipedia page he brags on there about how
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.080]  they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate
[17:26.080 --> 17:33.120]  dictatorship under the un they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns they release the viruses
[17:33.120 --> 17:38.560]  they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.000]  total social control over you and your lives that's how i was able to predict everything they did
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.280]  in decades before they executed word for word with total precision because they have a detailed

[19:03.520 --> 19:07.440]  alleging that general milley had called the head of the chinese military and said trump
[19:07.440 --> 19:12.160]  might nuke you he tried to overthrow the u.s. government but basically i'm protecting you
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.880]  and i'll warn you if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason us history that has
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.200]  ever been committed people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's former
[19:21.200 --> 19:26.160]  naval intelligence he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted
[19:26.160 --> 19:31.280]  to put it out said that billy was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent bureaucracy
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.920]  stay behind network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over america that's
[19:35.920 --> 19:40.400]  what he put bite in he's so incredibly weak to undermine the idea of the presidency well people
[19:40.400 --> 19:45.360]  said i was making it up with bob woodward's line well now milley admits he did it you see i didn't
[19:45.360 --> 19:50.480]  need to trust bob woodward i remember philosophy on january eight bragging that she got the call
[19:50.480 --> 19:54.720]  for milley that he'd take you control the nukes so this treason was hiding in plain view back then
[19:54.720 --> 19:59.360]  and we covered it see i have a memory folks i remember all this stuff that's why i know it's true and
[19:59.360 --> 20:16.000]  what's false you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:17.840 --> 20:22.320]  america is being taken over by consortium of corporations and communists china their goal
[20:22.320 --> 20:26.800]  is absolute power for all of our bodies in a genetic revolution build a program as hardware
[20:26.800 --> 20:32.960]  they want and or tell us now i've got again this is a show show on sunday i want royers and the atx
[20:32.960 --> 20:37.440]  in the studio i'm over the phone because the total internet's gone out in our hotel here in dc the
[20:37.440 --> 20:42.160]  tv's are out people can't even watch the football games that are happening so that's crazy so is
[20:42.160 --> 20:46.960]  our hotspot but that's okay that's why i'm over the phone here we are we got backups getting set up
[20:46.960 --> 20:52.880]  soon and i'll be also co-host of the show tomorrow the weekday show but listen here's the big news up
[20:52.880 --> 20:58.400]  front it's more like 20 000 that are already there in mcallin they're officially saying almost 16 000
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.920]  or not in mcallin in del rio with the Haitians and all of the incredible footage where it looks like
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.880]  gilligan thailand now where they've caught all the bamboo and trees down and built huts but a lot of
[21:08.880 --> 21:12.480]  them are just going around uh the police and military and it's going wherever they want being
[21:12.480 --> 21:18.080]  loaded up on democrat vans be taken wherever they want a month ago the very charities in that area
[21:18.080 --> 21:23.600]  said we can't take any more it's thousands a day so now thousands of more are marching
[21:24.880 --> 21:28.960]  down the border at a long distance away tim et al will give you all the information in a moment
[21:30.080 --> 21:35.360]  towards mcallin and they are very very close to the texas border right now we're going to play
[21:35.360 --> 21:41.760]  your footage it's about two hours old it's in spanish but there are subtitles for everybody
[21:41.760 --> 21:45.680]  and so oh and as best you can the key parts as you can see the subtitles i'm over the phone
[21:45.680 --> 21:49.280]  uh read the folks uh any key parts while i play this video here it is
[21:51.920 --> 21:57.520]  thousands of Haitians march past a mexican checkpoint on their way to the city of reynosa
[21:57.520 --> 22:02.720]  across mcallin texas this was just this morning a few hours ago
[22:02.720 --> 22:22.000]  and you can now see the massive crowd it's like exiting a playoff football game
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.440]  after the game just a massive humanity just a massive crowd of people
[22:25.440 --> 22:37.600]  as they reach the checkpoint and just overwhelm it again the audio here you can hear is in spanish
[22:39.520 --> 22:47.600]  as the massive migration invasion crosses the checkpoint and just overwhelms law enforcement
[22:47.600 --> 22:54.080]  there and oh and it's key to understand that the very same NGO that soros ran in europe
[22:54.080 --> 22:58.320]  with the very same man that broke europe's borders the last eight years has been brought to texas
[22:58.320 --> 23:03.280]  to run all this and it's NGOs and control of the border patrol and even the military now
[23:03.280 --> 23:08.160]  and they call all the shots so this was again this video came out hours ago it's from this
[23:08.160 --> 23:13.120]  morning we've called sources uh in mcallin and they say that this is indeed happening and the
[23:13.120 --> 23:18.400]  Haitians are now showing up uh near the border so this is all confirmed so let's explain to
[23:18.400 --> 23:23.760]  the listeners and viewers i should set this up front we've confirmed from the mexico side and from
[23:23.760 --> 23:29.200]  our sources in mcallin texas this is hours away from del rio and that area where there's 15 to
[23:29.200 --> 23:35.120]  20 000 Haitians and more coming this is a whole new caravan slamming into an area many many miles
[23:35.120 --> 23:41.200]  away to give you details is tim inlow our reporter who was just down there two days ago getting all
[23:41.200 --> 23:48.160]  that exclusive footage here he is now on sunday giving you the latest yes so it appears that this
[23:48.160 --> 23:55.040]  second caravan has now received intelligence as they were moving they were originally ahead of
[23:55.040 --> 24:01.520]  two del rio texas and that's what the concerning part is in this story is this caravan was headed
[24:01.520 --> 24:06.320]  in the direction of del rio texas to join the migrant camp there but somehow they received
[24:06.320 --> 24:12.000]  intelligence that there's been a crackdown in del rio and that they're under threat of deportation
[24:12.000 --> 24:20.240]  if they go into that camp so mid midway they changed directions and now head toward mcallin texas
[24:20.240 --> 24:26.800]  now the concerning part of this is mcallin texas is five and a half hours away by vehicle
[24:26.800 --> 24:33.200]  from del rio texas and we have hundreds all our state's resources hundreds of state troopers
[24:33.200 --> 24:40.000]  national guard troops everything the governor could muster up has been sent to del rio to deal
[24:40.000 --> 24:49.280]  with the 14 000 to 16 000 Haitians there and now the second caravan is being directed to another
[24:49.280 --> 24:56.160]  location five and a half hours away where there's minimal resources so this makes it very likely
[24:56.160 --> 25:01.760]  that mcallin will be completely overwhelmed within a couple of hours and they will be completely
[25:01.760 --> 25:07.360]  overrun because they just don't have the resources there hey tim let me ask you a question from all
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.080]  the intelligence you're gathering and i'm not hearing this question asked anywhere and it should
[25:12.080 --> 25:17.600]  be one of the first questions i would assume is how are these Haitians getting here uh it's not
[25:17.600 --> 25:23.520]  landlocked to central america we know about Hondurans El Salvadorans right and all these others
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.440]  how are the Haitians getting here by the tens of thousands when they're out there on an island
[25:27.440 --> 25:32.960]  not landlocked to central america how are they getting here well so there's several ways that
[25:32.960 --> 25:38.480]  they're getting here but one of the ways uh that that we know of is they would trickle out in boats
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.280]  and then they would kind of consolidate either in central america some of them have actually been
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.920]  living in central america for a number of years waiting for the opportunity to come into the us
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.120]  and and that's what the the viewers have to understand here when alex says this is a
[25:55.120 --> 26:02.800]  un soros funded operation that's exactly right they they send them they direct them to these these
[26:02.800 --> 26:09.040]  countries in central america and the very southern part of mexico and they hold them there until they
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.960]  have enough of them that the caravans grow so large that it will be impossible for the mexican
[26:14.960 --> 26:22.400]  authorities to stop them as they swarm to the us border so and that's the exact same tactics that
[26:22.400 --> 26:28.800]  the muslims used in europe and that's what they're doing now in mexico so this is absolutely orchestrated
[26:28.800 --> 26:34.320]  and so they they land there by uh in boats in central america southern part of mexico
[26:34.960 --> 26:40.480]  they then gather them there in camps and they just wait they wait until they their numbers are big
[26:40.480 --> 26:46.240]  enough to launch their invasion and now those numbers are big enough and as you can see this
[26:46.240 --> 26:51.680]  is all strategic because the caravans are sent in staggered formation just like the like the
[26:51.680 --> 26:58.320]  military would do right they don't put all the troops in an attack in one formation right and so
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.120]  that's exactly what they're doing they're staggering these caravans so that when the first caravan
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.800]  encounters resistance it gets the second caravan time to divert and go to a more vulnerable part
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.880]  on the border here's alex and and and oh this is all as you know un tactics the un admits
[27:14.880 --> 27:19.120]  at replacement migration this is america under attack we need ted cruz and rand paul mothers
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.640]  to talk about how it's a un invasion like nigel farage does like they do in europe this is a fact
[27:24.640 --> 27:29.360]  this is talked about in the parliaments of europe if americans don't understand this is coordinated
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.080]  and and and you know ted cruz's out there going joe biden's an incompetent idiot moron well that's
[27:34.080 --> 27:38.480]  why they put him in but the people behind him soros gives them thousand and two thousand and
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.120]  three thousand dollar debit cards he's easy and reuters admitting it the un and state department
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.400]  until trump stopped it funds it now now biden started it back again right when he got an office
[27:48.400 --> 27:53.120]  this is an organized invasion and listen i'm not happy that we're the folks giving us exclusively
[27:53.120 --> 27:59.440]  four went on air we check this no one knows this we have contacts tim inlow called check this is
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.640]  confirmed this is going on and we're the ones reporting it info wars this little organization
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.040]  that's how much trouble our government's in because they watch fox news you act like they're there to
[28:09.040 --> 28:12.640]  protect you and tell you what's really going on but they don't tell you this is all orchestrated
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.200]  Owen well that's the thing that people need to understand and that's why we have a sense of
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.960]  urgency this isn't some uh happenstance this isn't a coincidence this isn't something organic
[28:22.960 --> 28:29.440]  this is designed this has been planned for years this is an operation against the united states
[28:29.440 --> 28:36.000]  of america and and ultimately it will be an economic disaster it will cause even more
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.000]  poverty and chaos and and criminal activity in our cities yes it's cloud and i'd love to
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.200]  keep talking about this and we will tomorrow on the show you're all seeing with me but we've got to
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.520]  move on to the big victories we've had in the really negative stuff how they tried to set us up how
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.560]  the cops really basically attacked us yesterday and so much more at the event on september 18th
[28:54.560 --> 28:58.800]  very very shameful we're gonna cover it all straight ahead huge broadcast folks call about it you
[28:58.800 --> 29:04.080]  know and tell them to tune in you are fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the
[29:04.080 --> 29:09.920]  globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[29:09.920 --> 29:15.680]  tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting
[29:15.680 --> 29:21.840]  caught flat-footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.720]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.880]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[29:30.880 --> 29:34.960]  the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda
[29:34.960 --> 29:38.720]  but we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high
[29:38.720 --> 29:43.040]  quality storeable food you've got the best food ready to ship at very important prices
[29:43.040 --> 29:48.400]  at infowarstore.com so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets

[29:53.920 --> 29:59.360]  long lines and waits because believe me serious times are coming get ready at infowarstore.com
[30:00.560 --> 30:05.840]  we've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in
[30:05.840 --> 30:10.800]  world war two that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up
[30:10.800 --> 30:14.160]  and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up
[30:15.120 --> 30:19.680]  and finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up well the global social
[30:19.680 --> 30:23.680]  credit score that china's putting in that's banning people the three hours of video games a week and
[30:24.240 --> 30:28.720]  if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought
[30:28.720 --> 30:33.760]  here all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now they're
[30:33.760 --> 30:37.760]  saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do
[30:37.760 --> 30:43.040]  and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept
[30:43.040 --> 30:48.160]  that you'll accept anything so again the leftist having fun right now with all the censorship
[30:48.160 --> 30:52.080]  and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted
[30:52.080 --> 30:56.720]  by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us
[30:56.720 --> 31:02.560]  will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists it is through our five senses
[31:02.560 --> 31:08.240]  that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through
[31:08.240 --> 31:15.120]  this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too
[31:15.120 --> 31:21.280]  much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[31:21.280 --> 31:26.160]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras aligned with the
[31:26.160 --> 31:31.840]  endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described
[31:31.840 --> 31:37.520]  as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[31:37.520 --> 31:43.680]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping
[31:43.680 --> 31:50.000]  our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your
[31:50.000 --> 31:56.080]  drinking water fluoride free and the proprio showerhead will seal the deal get them both today

[33:30.000 --> 33:37.360]  you are the resistance well we knew coming a long time ago the globalist takeover the
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.960]  united states and i knew that if we warned people and exposed their battle plan was
[33:40.960 --> 33:45.440]  that most people wouldn't listen to me back then other than really serious minded focused
[33:45.440 --> 33:50.240]  christians mainly understand it was also biblical but i knew that once the tyranny hit and once
[33:50.240 --> 33:54.320]  people remember what we'd said that they would then start standing up against the new world
[33:54.320 --> 33:59.440]  order and that is happening and all glory goes to god and then temporarily i thank all the listeners

[34:39.200 --> 34:44.960]  thing is turning the power grid off and saying hackers did it the next big move in the cards

[34:49.200 --> 34:54.080]  we're behind it the new world order is making its move but here is the good news we should all just
[34:54.080 --> 34:58.240]  sit back and look at this i've seen so many hundreds of videos a day we can't play them all here
[34:58.240 --> 35:04.800]  of all over the world people saying no to these injections and people standing up and in australia
[35:04.800 --> 35:11.040]  where they are bringing in total martial law where they are literally trying to forcibly inject
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.080]  children without parental consent and they've been doing it they admitted and say oh no big deal
[35:16.080 --> 35:19.840]  where they're saying permanent lockdown apps on your phone that tell you when you can leave your
[35:19.840 --> 35:25.920]  house where you can go forever for the carbon tax for the un program we're going to play some
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.440]  video now of what's happening in southern australia where they try to keep people from marching down
[35:31.440 --> 35:36.800]  the street going to the beach or going to see their relatives in the next state and again it's
[35:36.800 --> 35:42.320]  like trying to go into texas into oklahoma and a lot of police trying to stop you on every major
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.160]  road and these police are beating men women and children there's footage of them literally knocking

[36:11.280 --> 36:16.080]  next thing well next you know what's gonna happen so they started the fight i don't want it to go
[36:16.080 --> 36:19.680]  there because the police are just useful idiots in this case this is what happens when you get left
[36:19.680 --> 36:37.360]  as policers the video and the video goes on and on and on and on there's all these other videos of
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.960]  it happening all over the world and why are they mad well let's go ahead and show them

[36:55.520 --> 37:00.960]  who are such nice people well there's countless footage of them brutally running over people
[37:00.960 --> 37:07.200]  with cars beating men women and children grabbing a dad to forcibly inject him or forcibly PCR test
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.360]  him while they drag his nine-year-old daughter away kicking screaming and crying this is authoritarianism
[37:13.360 --> 37:16.880]  they're building permanent camps they're building roundup operations they're building him in europe
[37:16.880 --> 37:21.840]  canada the us it's all the same system called shelter and shielding in place where when you're
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.240]  quote healthy they're going to take your children so they don't get covered you go that's preposterous
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.920]  it's been announced as official cdc plan just like they announced that they control the rents in
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.880]  america which of course they don't people have to say no to them you have to say no to the criminals
[37:36.880 --> 37:42.880]  but we haven't been saying no so the criminals are pushing it so let's show footage now of who
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.000]  they're calling the dark night and this is in that melee when they charge through that crowd of
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  police is happening all over australia all over europe all over canada right now and the police
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.840]  of military are finally starting to join the people because they know what a fraud this is and
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.520]  what a scam it is let's play the clip they're calling the dark night here is the clip of the dark
[38:01.520 --> 38:08.880]  night in the space of four seconds takes out and knocks down four police here is the footage ladies
[38:08.880 --> 38:20.320]  and gentlemen so again ladies and gentlemen we are not looking for a fight with the police their
[38:20.320 --> 38:23.840]  brainwash their compartmentalize when they act like this most police in the u.s or some of the
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.080]  most awake people and know what's going on are saying no but this is what's exciting and now
[38:28.080 --> 38:35.040]  let's expand on it what's even more powerful two months ago the main private advisory agency that
[38:35.040 --> 38:41.520]  has a law passed that the government's supposed to listen to them of a board of top scientists and
[38:41.520 --> 38:48.080]  virologists said we yellow card these so-called vaccines they're not yellow they are not vaccines
[38:48.080 --> 38:55.760]  they are they are gmo gene editing gene therapies and they're very dangerous and this is not authorized
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.400]  they called for it to be pulled almost no news coverage then the two top scientists at the
[39:00.400 --> 39:07.200]  FDA two and a half weeks ago come out and you you heard the news they quit over booster shots no
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.080]  they said it's political Fauci and the White House are running all this Biden shouldn't be calling
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.240]  the shots you shouldn't have boosters you shouldn't give any of these shots to children it shouldn't
[39:16.240 --> 39:21.600]  be controlled and these vaccines are not studied they've not been given real authorization then
[39:21.600 --> 39:25.280]  they wrote a letter a week and a half ago they got no coverage that I don't even know about till
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.080]  Friday when I got sent up a very well-known talk show hosting have you seen this I was like no it
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.840]  turns out those two top scientists the number one number two virologists at the CDC over the
[39:33.840 --> 39:40.160]  vaccine program for 40 something years 45 years together once when they're 30 something years 115
[39:40.160 --> 39:46.160]  they they sent a letter to the Lancet medical journal probably the most procedures in the world
[39:46.960 --> 39:54.080]  and said we should not be giving these injections it's going to get vaccines banned for generations
[39:54.080 --> 39:57.840]  this is going to get everything a bad name and destroy our governments destroy our agencies
[39:57.840 --> 40:04.960]  this is dangerous you should stop right now and these drugs quote do not work and have a bad
[40:05.680 --> 40:11.360]  track record they call them drugs this is not a vaccine it's a drug now on Friday the second
[40:11.360 --> 40:18.400]  largest board voted 26 to 2 to say don't give these shots don't give boosters don't give children
[40:18.400 --> 40:24.080]  and that is political then on Saturday they had an emergency meeting that that that Biden basically
[40:24.080 --> 40:29.680]  called trying to overrule it and the top commissioners and the top advisors of all the groups in the
[40:29.680 --> 40:36.160]  FDA voted 16 to 2 and they said at the meetings don't just give boosters and don't just not give
[40:36.160 --> 40:42.640]  shots to kids under 16 say the same things as the EU regulators same thing as the British regulators
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.960]  going against all their bosses these are people bought and paid for by big pharma realizing
[40:46.960 --> 40:49.920]  they've been off more than they could chew they're all probably going to be going to Nuremberg too
[40:49.920 --> 40:55.200]  or maybe they care about their grandkids ladies and gentlemen they came out and said the same
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.240]  quotes that was in the lens of the letter saying these drugs are not working they're hurting people
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.960]  this is going to discredit us for generations this is going to destroy our agencies and they went on
[41:04.960 --> 41:11.360]  to say the vaccines themselves aren't vaccines and don't work and and we better stop now so I want
[41:11.360 --> 41:15.360]  shroyer thank god for this thank god for everybody's prayers here's the problem the globalists are
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.040]  just going to push harder and blow up one of their vaccine facilities in blamonos we know that
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.800]  but this is their whole world idea their total medical training they would have been smart to
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.960]  give us a placebo shot that didn't kill so many people or maim them but they went for hard kill
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.120]  up front thinking they would then cover up the deaths like i did with hiv cup and gulf
[41:31.120 --> 41:35.360]  force syndrome that was really the the uh injections doing it and the drugs that treated doing it
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.760]  they thought they'd cover it up on but instead it blew up in their face so this is devastating
[41:39.760 --> 41:45.040]  i've been under 28 years i've never seen the new order so devastated as they're being devastated
[41:45.040 --> 41:50.960]  right now brother well as the world is waking up the only problem alex i see is that humanity is
[41:50.960 --> 41:58.960]  kind of on a tightrope right now where the the true world elite that want to see the world collapse
[41:58.960 --> 42:04.560]  they're cheering this on they like to see police getting overthrown and overrun and and they like
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.760]  to see uh borders collapse and they like to see citizens being pit against one another because
[42:09.760 --> 42:14.720]  they just sit up in their ivory towers laughing and clinking glasses and thinking oh you brought that
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.240]  up i'm glad you brought that up that's why you're here that's the key to the whole show it's why
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.280]  i'm going to say right up front i guess i did but i need to be very clear we're forced to defend
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.240]  ourselves but we need to understand the globalist put us together go back to from russia would love
[42:28.240 --> 42:35.920]  in flaming high-level mi6 os s and world war two and we come back i'll explain this he in that film
[42:35.920 --> 42:40.640]  with the chinese fighting fish he describes how the whole thing works where the one fish kills
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.720]  the other but it's wounded and the third fish comes in and kills it that is claus Schwab's
[42:44.720 --> 42:49.840]  admitted plan is to stage this collapse and then have our governments blamed for what they did no
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.160]  these are globalist agents that will go to prison with Schwab it wasn't our government was these
[42:54.160 --> 43:02.720]  hijackers of the government that's letting it happen in late august info or saw an explosion
[43:03.280 --> 43:09.920]  of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet

[47:06.600 --> 47:28.600]  All right folks, Alex Jones here in Washington D.C.
[47:28.600 --> 47:31.640]  Total internet outage, basically sell outage,
[47:31.640 --> 47:34.200]  something going on in the area we're in.
[47:34.200 --> 47:36.720]  Owen Schroyer is back in the ATX, I'm coming to you over the hotel
[47:36.720 --> 47:37.720]  phone.
[47:37.720 --> 47:39.920]  And again, the quickening is here.
[47:39.920 --> 47:42.440]  I want to recap some of the things that have happened.
[47:42.440 --> 47:44.480]  And then whether I've got to go to another part of D.C.
[47:44.480 --> 47:46.440]  or whatever I'm going to do tomorrow before I leave,
[47:46.440 --> 47:48.520]  I will be back on video with you tomorrow.
[47:48.520 --> 47:50.560]  But Owen's going to take over in the next hour.
[47:50.560 --> 47:55.120]  We've got Sunday Live coming up as well, 6 to 8 PM central.
[47:55.120 --> 47:57.960]  OK, now I want to show you some incredible footage
[47:57.960 --> 48:02.160]  in a minute in what is now a little Haiti under the bridge
[48:02.160 --> 48:07.520]  with over 15,000 people just in Del Rio, Texas.
[48:07.520 --> 48:10.560]  And again, the key is thousands and thousands more,
[48:10.560 --> 48:14.520]  five plus hours away by car, now slamming in to McAllen, Texas.
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.640]  This is all you in, Ryan.
[48:16.640 --> 48:17.520]  That's an operation.
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.640]  But now I want to talk about what Owen was getting into.
[48:19.640 --> 48:21.480]  And I know it's personal for him because he's
[48:21.480 --> 48:24.760]  been criminally charged, faces years in prison,
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.480]  for being peacefully at the January 6 thing at the ellipse
[48:28.480 --> 48:31.080]  and then going with me to try to stop any violence
[48:31.080 --> 48:33.320]  at the Capitol on record.
[48:33.320 --> 48:35.960]  That's how corrupt and evil the prosecutors
[48:35.960 --> 48:37.920]  and the Democrats and the people are
[48:37.920 --> 48:39.520]  and the type of bizarre FBI agents
[48:39.520 --> 48:42.320]  that they've hired that would actually put their name
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.680]  on a charging order like this.
[48:45.680 --> 48:48.680]  So I flew out Saturday morning.
[48:48.680 --> 48:51.080]  I wanted to go to the 18th event.
[48:51.080 --> 48:54.040]  It wasn't about, as Pelosi said, cheering on people that
[48:54.040 --> 48:56.040]  came to murder people at the Capitol.
[48:56.040 --> 48:57.160]  That's not true.
[48:57.160 --> 48:59.520]  It was about saying, do process for these folks.
[48:59.520 --> 49:01.680]  The left wants to do process for people in Guantanamo Bay.
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.640]  And I agree because once you take it from them,
[49:03.640 --> 49:05.080]  you take it from us.
[49:05.080 --> 49:07.640]  And so I got there at the end of it.
[49:07.640 --> 49:11.560]  There was probably 500 people that weren't feds or media.
[49:11.560 --> 49:12.760]  It was crawling with feds.
[49:12.760 --> 49:17.440]  They had probably 50 BLM and Antifa over another area
[49:17.440 --> 49:20.080]  fenced off screaming and yelling right across the fence
[49:20.080 --> 49:22.840]  to everybody and throwing things.
[49:22.840 --> 49:25.040]  I didn't want to become a distraction or anything.
[49:25.040 --> 49:26.480]  Plus, I knew I was a target at that.
[49:26.480 --> 49:28.600]  So we just sat back, got our footage.
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.240]  And then after everybody dispersed,
[49:30.240 --> 49:32.080]  I decided to walk all the way around the Capitol
[49:32.080 --> 49:34.960]  in the big fences that they put up.
[49:34.960 --> 49:37.560]  And at least six times, the police would surround me
[49:37.560 --> 49:39.200]  and say, why are you here?
[49:39.200 --> 49:40.440]  And I'd say, I'm a journalist.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.040]  I'm here to cover this event.
[49:42.040 --> 49:43.640]  And then they would say, do we have guns?
[49:43.640 --> 49:44.640]  We planning to attack?
[49:44.640 --> 49:47.680]  And I explained, we have off duty police officers
[49:47.680 --> 49:49.360]  here from the area.
[49:49.360 --> 49:52.080]  As long as they don't have guns on federal property, that's fine.
[49:52.080 --> 49:54.880]  They then harassed them, of course.
[49:54.880 --> 49:55.520]  That went on.
[49:55.520 --> 49:57.080]  They would then come and rev their motorcycles
[49:57.080 --> 49:58.880]  while we were doing an interview, streets were all
[49:58.880 --> 50:01.400]  blocked off, no one's around, everybody left.
[50:01.400 --> 50:07.400]  And then they came up to me on video and said, you're a wreck.
[50:07.400 --> 50:09.280]  You look sick and ugly.
[50:09.280 --> 50:10.240]  This is on camera.
[50:10.240 --> 50:11.960]  And we were about to upload for the show.
[50:11.960 --> 50:14.800]  And the internet went out here about two hours ago.
[50:14.800 --> 50:16.400]  That was about two hour and a half ago.
[50:16.400 --> 50:18.480]  And so we'll have that footage for you tomorrow.
[50:18.480 --> 50:20.360]  And they literally sat there and laughed at us.
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.240]  We were in a third world place.
[50:24.240 --> 50:27.600]  I mean, the stuff you imagine of corrupt police acting really
[50:27.600 --> 50:28.840]  bizarre and weird.
[50:28.840 --> 50:30.320]  But they were all SJWs.
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.120]  The ones that did it all were real soft.
[50:34.120 --> 50:36.800]  They were calling me obese, but they were fatter than I am.
[50:36.800 --> 50:38.160]  And they were all real nelly.
[50:38.160 --> 50:39.960]  So it was basically a bunch of leftists
[50:39.960 --> 50:44.000]  would follow us around, about nine police cars at a time.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.600]  All these armored vehicles and thousands of police
[50:46.600 --> 50:48.000]  had already left.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.560]  And most of them, I'm sure, were nice.
[50:49.560 --> 50:52.000]  But the ones that decided to harass us
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.960]  just acted in a very, very bizarre fashion,
[50:53.960 --> 50:56.640]  which, again, illustrates that they don't even care or I
[50:56.640 --> 50:58.840]  don't think even know that the globalists are collapsing
[50:58.840 --> 51:01.240]  the country, that their pension funds are going to be worthless,
[51:01.240 --> 51:02.720]  that the new old order is coming in,
[51:02.720 --> 51:04.600]  that they're mass smuggling children for sex
[51:04.600 --> 51:07.000]  trade on record Senate report.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.080]  And the misery coming, they just select their part of the system.
[51:10.080 --> 51:13.200]  And they have all this high tech video surveillance
[51:13.200 --> 51:15.880]  that my military guys were saying they had in Afghanistan
[51:15.880 --> 51:21.920]  that can see somebody in the dark at 5,000 yards away.
[51:21.920 --> 51:24.960]  And like zoom in on the color of their eye during what they like.
[51:24.960 --> 51:26.480]  And they had these things watching us,
[51:26.480 --> 51:28.320]  watching everyone listening to us.
[51:28.320 --> 51:30.880]  I mean, it looked like something that was like 1,000 times
[51:30.880 --> 51:32.960]  worse than 1984.
[51:32.960 --> 51:35.440]  So they're all there just giggling and laughing
[51:35.440 --> 51:38.440]  and then shouting insults at us out of their police cars.
[51:38.440 --> 51:40.840]  And it was just very sickening for America.
[51:40.840 --> 51:42.680]  It made me feel pathetic, not because they
[51:42.680 --> 51:45.320]  were calling me pathetic, but that they had fallen this far
[51:45.320 --> 51:47.640]  or maybe were raised in such families of trash
[51:47.640 --> 51:50.040]  that they thought this was normal.
[51:50.040 --> 51:52.560]  So this went on for about three and a half hours.
[51:52.560 --> 51:54.000]  We walked all the way around the Capitol
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.920]  because they had it blocked several streets out on most areas.
[51:56.920 --> 51:58.480]  And so they kept saying, when do you leave?
[51:58.480 --> 52:00.080]  And we're sick of you being here.
[52:00.080 --> 52:03.520]  Well, we were trying to start a fight with me.
[52:03.520 --> 52:04.720]  So here we have.
[52:04.720 --> 52:06.400]  The Secret Service are nice.
[52:06.400 --> 52:08.120]  And I'm not going to say much more than that.
[52:08.120 --> 52:10.360]  But I mean, the people on his detail
[52:10.360 --> 52:12.160]  and the people in the White House,
[52:12.160 --> 52:15.280]  and this is 100% confirmed on my children, folks.
[52:15.280 --> 52:16.720]  I can tell you Hillary was collapsing
[52:16.720 --> 52:18.240]  on that happen two weeks later.
[52:18.240 --> 52:19.200]  This is all going on.
[52:19.200 --> 52:23.120]  They told us that he just likes to crap his pants.
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.680]  And then he likes the staff cleaning it off of him.
[52:25.680 --> 52:29.440]  And then he refuses to wear diapers.
[52:29.440 --> 52:31.400]  And I'm going to do a whole report on this.
[52:31.400 --> 52:32.600]  I've got notes.
[52:32.600 --> 52:33.920]  I've got everything.
[52:33.920 --> 52:35.760]  I met with these people.
[52:35.760 --> 52:37.200]  This is going to cause a huge deal.
[52:37.200 --> 52:38.200]  They don't care anymore.
[52:38.200 --> 52:40.720]  In fact, they're probably going to just start going public.
[52:40.720 --> 52:43.120]  That Biden runs around at 2 or 3 in the morning,
[52:43.120 --> 52:46.480]  speed bombed out of his head, that the doctor has
[52:46.480 --> 52:48.520]  a huge pelican case with all these drugs in it.
[52:48.520 --> 52:50.920]  They're injecting him with stuff.
[52:50.920 --> 52:52.240]  And then, like you saw him, in fact,
[52:52.240 --> 52:54.760]  let's play the clip in a moment where he says,
[52:54.760 --> 52:55.640]  they wipe my butt.
[52:55.640 --> 52:56.400]  They wipe my butt.
[52:56.400 --> 52:57.760]  They wipe my butt.
[52:57.760 --> 53:00.080]  He literally, people that have dementia,
[53:00.080 --> 53:02.720]  get into their butt and into pooping
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.320]  and into riding on the walls with it.
[53:04.320 --> 53:06.120]  He hasn't gotten to the riding on the walls yet,
[53:06.120 --> 53:07.720]  but he's obsessed with his poop.
[53:07.720 --> 53:10.400]  And then if they make him mad, he'll just
[53:10.400 --> 53:12.360]  start defecating all over himself.
[53:12.360 --> 53:13.480]  He throws temper tantrum.
[53:13.480 --> 53:15.560]  So this is directly going on.
[53:15.560 --> 53:17.880]  And you can see how they kept changing his clothes
[53:17.880 --> 53:19.000]  on September 10.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.480]  It was a particular day where they believe he
[53:21.480 --> 53:23.860]  crapped his pants multiple times.
[53:23.860 --> 53:24.200]  OK.
[53:24.200 --> 53:26.000]  So we've got all this information for you.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.800]  Here he is, talking about a month ago,
[53:27.800 --> 53:29.760]  about getting his butt wiped.
[53:29.760 --> 53:50.840]  Okay guys, I just got breaking news from, is this from the law enforcement there?
[53:50.840 --> 53:51.840]  Yeah.
[53:51.840 --> 53:54.640]  Are you hearing anything about this?
[53:54.640 --> 54:00.960]  That's being told to evacuate their families, HSI, CPB, and AUSA is telling their agents
[54:00.960 --> 54:06.960]  to get their families out of Del Rio, 20,000 more migrants in around 48 hours.
[54:06.960 --> 54:12.480]  I told you to hit Del Rio with thousands now, five and a half hours away by car, now hitting
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.480]  McCallan.
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.320]  So understand, they put a crazy man in that loves his pooping on himself, who's on countless
[54:18.320 --> 54:20.280]  drugs that they can blame for all this.
[54:20.280 --> 54:23.640]  They have top generals with the Chinese saying Trump was going to nuke them when he wasn't.
[54:23.640 --> 54:27.280]  They could have nuked us to ingratiate themselves and destabilize the country.
[54:27.280 --> 54:28.600]  They're trying to bankrupt everything.
[54:28.600 --> 54:33.280]  They collapsed Afghanistan on purpose, and the police literally chased us around laughing
[54:33.280 --> 54:36.400]  at us, saying I was a wreck, saying get out of here.
[54:36.400 --> 54:42.040]  I mean, just on camera, un-American horrible stuff, and I was polite to them.
[54:42.040 --> 54:46.400]  So that is what America is, a cursed, demonic sinking ship, except this will now wake people
[54:46.400 --> 54:50.720]  up and it is waking people up Owen, but is that not completely insane?
[54:50.720 --> 54:57.480]  I guess it's just symbolic of, and you have a better idea of the attitude and the energy
[54:57.480 --> 55:02.160]  obviously being down there, but I would say it sounds like it's just symbolic of a conquering
[55:02.160 --> 55:08.080]  force just, you know, trampling upon, spitting upon, laughing upon the force that they think
[55:08.080 --> 55:09.080]  they've conquered.
[55:09.080 --> 55:10.280]  I guess they think Americans are dead.
[55:10.280 --> 55:12.320]  I guess they think free speech is dead.
[55:12.320 --> 55:15.080]  I guess they think everything you represent is dead, Alex.
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.840]  And like you were saying, the joke is they don't understand that whatever your fate
[55:18.840 --> 55:23.320]  is that they think is funny to mock you, they will share the same fate.
[55:23.320 --> 55:25.680]  They will share the same fate as Alex Jones.
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.440]  They will share the same fate of the crowd that was out there today for that protest.
[55:30.440 --> 55:34.680]  And then what do you make of, I mean, I guess it's good news, I don't really know how else
[55:34.680 --> 55:35.680]  to say it.
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.000]  The fact that the one arrest that was made at this event that they built to be the next
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.880]  big attempt was a Fed.
[55:41.880 --> 55:45.800]  I mean, this goes into the big story that Tucker Carlson was covering, saying how many
[55:45.800 --> 55:48.920]  feds were involved in these events, it ties in.
[55:48.920 --> 55:50.200]  They purposely arrested him.
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.540]  I was at Bilderberg, like 13 years ago at Chantilly here in Virginia, nearby, and they
[55:55.540 --> 55:58.800]  arrested the guy in front of the cameras with a gun and turned out he was a Fed later.
[55:58.800 --> 55:59.800]  They just do this.
[55:59.800 --> 56:00.800]  It was all overseeing it.
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.600]  They arrest a man with a gun and then later it's a tiny, you know, tiny little retraction.
[56:05.600 --> 56:06.600]  Absolutely.
[56:06.600 --> 56:09.880]  And listen, those people, America's thinking that they think I'm a wreck.
[56:09.880 --> 56:11.760]  I am a wreck for fight for this country.
[56:11.760 --> 56:13.280]  They are the ones that live here.
[56:13.280 --> 56:14.680]  My children live here.
[56:14.680 --> 56:18.720]  And they just think it's all funny because they've never really seen any adversity.
[56:18.720 --> 56:21.720]  They've grown up in the lap of freedom and now that rug's being pulled out from under
[56:21.720 --> 56:22.720]  them.
[56:22.720 --> 56:23.720]  I feel sorry for those people.
[56:23.720 --> 56:24.720]  I don't want to go to war with them.
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.440]  I mean, Biden has listed the American people, veterans, gun owners, people that question
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.920]  of the election and question lockdowns as the main terror threat.
[56:31.920 --> 56:34.040]  They literally want to start a war with us.
[56:34.040 --> 56:35.040]  They want our blood.
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.200]  It's spiritual.
[56:36.200 --> 56:37.200]  They want our children.
[56:37.200 --> 56:38.200]  They want our future.
[56:38.200 --> 56:39.200]  They want our bodies.
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.200]  They want our rights.
[56:40.200 --> 56:41.200]  They want our medical rights.
[56:41.200 --> 56:44.200]  They want to kill us because they have a spirit of Satan in them.
[56:44.200 --> 56:48.280]  I'm not saying the cops do, I'm talking about in general, their controllers do, and they're
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.560]  trying to appease evil.
[56:49.560 --> 56:51.280]  That always gets you destroyed, Owen.
[56:51.280 --> 56:57.600]  Well, I'm just trying to figure out how this is going to go when, again, it's odd.
[56:57.600 --> 56:59.240]  You talk to most police officers.
[56:59.240 --> 57:04.240]  They seem to be in line with our way of thinking or at least protecting free speech, protecting
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.480]  America, not like seeing the country brought down.
[57:07.480 --> 57:13.440]  But you see law enforcement being used against law-abiding citizens while we have lawlessness
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.760]  at the southern border, lawlessness in D.C. and you just wonder what's going to give
[57:18.760 --> 57:19.760]  here.
[57:19.760 --> 57:20.760]  I mean, something's got to give.
[57:20.760 --> 57:21.760]  We don't just have lawlessness.
[57:21.760 --> 57:23.160]  We have total invasion.
[57:23.160 --> 57:26.520]  The exact guy that ran the European takeover is running absolutely right.
[57:26.520 --> 57:28.120]  I know you're about to take over.
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.320]  I'm going to try to calm down because I've got all these notes.
[57:30.320 --> 57:31.320]  I want to go through these.
[57:31.320 --> 57:35.000]  I'm going to shoot a report on the fact that Biden is completely insane according to the
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  Secret Service.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.840]  Also, the huge, really positive news that can't be overshadowed that the main regulators
[57:39.840 --> 57:44.240]  all came out almost unanimously and said these shots are total fraud, total vindication,
[57:44.240 --> 57:47.280]  victory there, and then we've got the border collapsing and all this.
[57:47.280 --> 57:50.640]  We're going to cover it all until everybody can know, tune in to info or hear how this
[57:50.640 --> 57:51.640]  info gets out.
[57:51.640 --> 57:54.560]  General Lee, it's General Milley.
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.280]  I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow the U.S. government two days ago
[57:58.280 --> 58:02.920]  on January 6th and I just want you to know I've taken control of the nuclear weapons
[58:02.920 --> 58:08.280]  and if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let you know first the attacks coming.
[58:08.280 --> 58:09.960]  That is from the transcript.
[58:09.960 --> 58:14.680]  Then he called Pelosi, Schumer, and others to say, I'm loyal to you.
[58:14.680 --> 58:17.280]  I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons.
[58:17.280 --> 58:21.160]  When Trump was going for detente with China and North Korea at the time, Trump's responded
[58:21.160 --> 58:22.400]  saying it's a total lie.
[58:22.400 --> 58:24.400]  Pelosi came out and admitted it happened.
[58:24.400 --> 58:29.480]  Hell, she bragged back on January 8th that it took place then and is saying that she
[58:29.480 --> 58:33.480]  honors Milley and that he's this courageous person, so are all these other Democrats.
[58:33.480 --> 58:37.720]  So this is the permanent deep state who has been in control for a long time now coming
[58:37.720 --> 58:39.240]  out of the shadows publicly.
[58:39.240 --> 58:43.360]  Remember, these people literally hate you and your family, now they're injecting you
[58:43.360 --> 58:46.600]  with poison, soft-kill injections.
[58:46.600 --> 58:49.480]  Wake up America or be destroyed.
[58:49.480 --> 58:55.000]  I'm 59 years old in good health.
[58:55.000 --> 59:02.960]  I'm not working in the front line, so my time is not recommended to get vaccinated.
[59:02.960 --> 59:09.160]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago on a national TV interview
[59:09.160 --> 59:17.360]  saying, oh, he doesn't need to take the so-called MRNA, Maxine Astrology Therapy.
[59:17.360 --> 59:19.040]  He said, you know, he's 57 years old.
[59:19.040 --> 59:20.040]  He's healthy.
[59:20.040 --> 59:21.040]  He doesn't need it.
[59:21.040 --> 59:25.680]  It's at risk people, but that's not what his PR firms that have bought off the politicians
[59:25.680 --> 59:27.440]  over 100 countries say.
[59:27.440 --> 59:32.400]  They say, you've got to take a job or leave your house or get on a plane or a train or
[59:32.400 --> 59:36.280]  even get outside your home for one hour a day to live in Australia.
[59:36.280 --> 59:41.360]  So remember, the White House is exempt, Congress and their staff are exempt, the Postal Service
[59:41.360 --> 59:46.160]  is exempt, all these big corporate heads are exempt, they're not taking their poison vaccine,
[59:46.160 --> 59:48.000]  they're pushing it on you.
[59:48.000 --> 59:53.880]  Wake up folks, wake up.
[59:53.880 --> 1:00:09.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:14.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:19.040]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:24.080]  There really is so much to cover, but the images that we're seeing coming out from the
[1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:29.720]  southern border are truly of a science fiction movie, a nightmare, a dystopian nightmare.
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:35.960]  I always think of District 9 is the movie I always think of where it's just, it's almost
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:41.240]  a million of people just living in tiny little hut cities out in the desert.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.440]  And it's a lot like what we're seeing here on the southern border.
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:47.920]  And we have new breaking news coming from the southern border from our crew that's been
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:51.680]  down there covering this for months really off and on.
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:58.240]  And so this is confirmed now, a UN agenda, Tim Inlow on the line.
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:00:59.240]  Right on.
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:03.360]  Yeah, so it's very disturbing what some of our sources and law enforcement sources down
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:05.200]  there are telling us.
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:12.080]  They are now sending out alerts, basically telling some of the Border Patrol agents that
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:19.080]  are in the path of these caravans to consider getting their families to safety and moving
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:20.560]  them to other locations.
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:23.480]  I mean, that is just unbelievable.
[1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:28.360]  And you know, now we have a second caravan that's getting ready slam into McAllen, Texas
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:30.800]  with thousands and thousands more.
[1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:33.400]  That city is now going to become overwhelmed.
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:38.760]  Basically our border is 100% now completely collapsed.
[1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:44.360]  And I think at this point, what I would like to stress and what I hope that we can get
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:49.000]  out to all the Border Patrol agents, all the customs agents and all the law enforcement
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.200]  agents currently on the border.
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:59.000]  You have to now look in the mirror and ask yourself if you want to continue being a part
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:05.640]  of this, or if you want to come out, speak out and tell the truth to the American people
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:08.360]  about what's going on on the border.
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:10.080]  We can protect your identity.
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.480]  We can protect you if you're honest, but you have to speak out what's going on now.
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:20.400]  Because even they now can see that even their own families are at risk now.
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:24.200]  I mean, they're down there trying to stem the tide, but even their own families are
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:25.320]  at risk now.
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:29.960]  And so we would like to encourage them to come forward, contact us.
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:31.980]  You can do it discreetly.
[1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:36.600]  We will protect your identity, but get the word out to the American people what you
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.960]  yourselves are seeing with your own eyes on the border.
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:43.360]  And just like the Secret Service came to us, it's time to expose it because these are
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:44.360]  the traitors.
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.040]  They're telling the Chinese everything about us.
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:47.040]  We have to stand up as Americans.
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:48.440]  Now's the time to blow the whistle.
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:49.840]  It's prison if you don't.
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:53.360]  And that's exactly right, Alex, because here's the thing, right?
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:59.720]  As long as the politicians feel they can operate in the dark, then our law enforcement and
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:04.240]  our military are nothing more than puppets.
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:06.200]  And nobody wants to be a puppet.
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:11.240]  So our military down on the border, our law enforcement on the border, speak out, contact
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:12.760]  us, get the truth out.
[1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:14.520]  We will help you get the truth out.
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.720]  We want to do that for America.
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:17.720]  And get it out anywhere.
[1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:19.320]  Get it out wherever you can.
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:20.320]  Just get it out, folks.
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  Get it out now wherever you get it out.
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:22.320]  Get it out yourself on YouTube.
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:25.440]  There's only no country left, folks, if you don't stop this.
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:26.440]  Owen?
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:30.920]  Well, and one of the big lies that we're told or that's fabricated by the media and
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:36.920]  our politicians, that, hey, these people add to our country, they add to our culture, they're
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:38.680]  bringing benefits and all this stuff.
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:43.080]  Well, not to slight these people, but how is that the case?
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:46.760]  Most of them, if not all of them, don't speak English.
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:49.080]  Most of them have no education or experience.
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:52.680]  They're bringing people here they control with a permanent underclass state, just like
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:53.680]  they did in Europe, Owen.
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:59.360]  Well, and that's what I want people to understand, and they want to, they'll pretend it's some
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:01.000]  sort of insensitive commentary.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  No, it's a fact.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.240]  These people aren't coming here to create businesses or open restaurants or contribute
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:07.240]  to our society.
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:08.440]  Again, not a knock against them.
[1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:09.440]  They can't.
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:10.440]  They don't speak English.
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:11.440]  They don't have any job skills.
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.440]  They don't have any prospects.
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:13.940]  They're going to put you in front of the ghettos, the Democrats control.
[1:04:13.940 --> 1:04:15.440]  Owen, I'm going to let you take over.
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:16.440]  Doing a great job.
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:17.440]  Listeners, call everybody you know.
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:18.440]  Tune in now.
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:22.640]  Tomorrow, tonight, if I'm able to get internet back up, I'm going to upload all these incredible
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:23.640]  videos.
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:27.480]  I mean, you understand, Owen, this is the real secret service, telling us that Biden
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:31.360]  is literally hopped out of his mind on drugs, pooping all over himself.
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:32.360]  Completely insane.
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:33.360]  Well, let me know.
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:37.760]  Let's not get into too much behind the scenes, but I mean, they want to know who contacts
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:38.760]  you.
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:39.760]  They want to know who contacts us.
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.520]  They want to know who contacts Jack Mesobic.
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:45.280]  They're freaked out that there's actual people from the inside trying to let Americans know
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:46.280]  what's going on.
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:48.560]  Yeah, this wasn't done over the telephone, so they can burn in hell.
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:49.720]  Well, and that's the other thing.
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.320]  I don't, I don't need sources.
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:52.320]  I don't have any sources.
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:56.640]  I have video of 50,000 people at the border getting ready to pour in here.
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:57.640]  The source.
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:04.080]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:08.440]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group, so he
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:09.440]  didn't stand up.
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:13.240]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group, so he didn't
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:14.240]  stand up.
[1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:17.200]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:20.440]  Well, the global social credit score that China is putting in, it's banning people the
[1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.080]  three hours of video games a week, and if you criticize the government, you can never
[1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:25.360]  buy or sell again.
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:30.080]  Well, that's, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:31.080]  vaccine passports.
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:32.080]  They even admit it.
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:34.680]  Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:38.160]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what
[1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:39.160]  you can do.
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:40.960]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:41.960]  They'll accept that.
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:42.960]  They'll accept anything.
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:47.720]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:50.680]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:05:51.680]  nightmare as well.
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:55.800]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved
[1:05:55.800 --> 1:06:17.800]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[1:06:17.800 --> 1:06:21.360]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:22.360]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:23.360]  Hi, folks.
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:30.320]  We're in the second hour now of the Sunday broadcast that is here because of your support
[1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:31.320]  and your prayers.
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:34.800]  We thank you all for keeping us on air as we'd be on air during this critical time.
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:36.240]  We knew the globalist attack was coming.
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:37.720]  We chronicled exactly how they would hit.
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:38.720]  They've now hit.
[1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:39.720]  I studied them.
[1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:40.720]  We know how they've had other countries.
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:41.720]  We know their plan.
[1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:46.280]  If one thing these criminals love to brag, so Owen has a ton of knowledge to cover.
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:50.240]  But I mean, I'll tell you out of all this huge news that Biden's even more insane than
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:56.560]  we thought incontinent out of his mind, the huge news of the invasion of the border and
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:01.440]  it collapsing and more giant caravans coming on that exclusive footage from Mexico five
[1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:06.560]  and a half hours away by car, like 200 miles away, the Texas border is huge.
[1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:11.760]  In McAllen, with thousands more now hitting the border, law enforcement being told get
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:15.960]  their families out of Del Rio because 20,000 more are coming.
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:20.960]  That's what I told you, these UN things always come in the 50,000 at least once they hit.
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:27.840]  And so they follow an exact blueprint, but the biggest news is that months ago, the British
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:32.400]  main advisory panel that by law is supposed to be listened to said we should stop all
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:33.400]  these shots.
[1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:35.640]  They give it a yellow card being pull it.
[1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:36.640]  No boosters.
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:37.640]  No, nothing.
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:40.200]  That's why all these regulators around the world, the EU and the US are quitting saying,
[1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:44.920]  I mean, the top regulators, the top two people over the vaccine program for 45 years
[1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:47.760]  when you combine it, 133 years or like 12 years.
[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:50.840]  So it comes out to 45 years.
[1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:54.920]  And the number one, number two, both quit saying, this is not an authorized vaccine.
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:55.920]  You're lying.
[1:07:55.920 --> 1:08:00.840]  Don't give it to children under 16 and then don't, of course, the people booster shots.
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:05.360]  Well, they came out and said, this is going to destroy vaccines trust for generations.
[1:08:05.360 --> 1:08:09.840]  That's a quote in their letter to lands that the media suppressed so well.
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:12.320]  I learned about a Friday when it was eight days old.
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:16.440]  I learned about that letter eight days after they did it from another national talk show
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:17.440]  host that sent it to me.
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:24.760]  So folks, if Alex Jones doesn't know, imagine, but thank God this what the FDA just did and
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:28.840]  their own because the other people resigned and now, and now their own boards came out
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:35.760]  16 to two and 26 to two or no, 26 to one on the two top boards and said, do not do this.
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:36.760]  This is insane.
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:37.760]  That is the scientists.
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:38.760]  That is the facts.
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:40.760]  They were, they believe in vaccines because vaccines work.
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:42.760]  They just have side effects that can be tainted.
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:43.760]  This isn't a vaccine.
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:45.200]  This is a dangerous gene therapy.
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:48.200]  And so folks, the fact that this came out is so massive.
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:52.600]  Jamie White wrote about the letter to lands it of the two top FDA scientists on Friday.
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  That needs to go mega viral.
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:56.000]  We can put it back on the main page if we can.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:02.720]  Then today he posted a whole article and yesterday about how huge the FDA is as bad as they are.
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:04.720]  They realized this is so over the top criminal.
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:05.720]  They have had to back off.
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:10.240]  These are the same folks that said oxycodone was okay for children and illegalized fentanyl
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:11.240]  for a while.
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:16.000]  And they're saying, pull this, I mean, this is fricking serious folks, I couldn't believe
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  it.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.960]  Now, you know, back in December of last year when Wolfgang Wudard, the top advisor to the
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:23.940]  EU I've interviewed before, came out and said, this is going to kill everybody with
[1:09:23.940 --> 1:09:25.440]  cancer and blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:26.840]  I thought that's a little extreme.
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:30.120]  And then when the yeet on the former head of Pfizer science division came out who was
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:33.080]  over their vaccine program, and so this is going to be the same thing, I thought this
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:34.080]  is a little extreme.
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:35.080]  I haven't told listeners.
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:36.080]  I said, my God.
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:37.080]  And then it's fricking happening, folks.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:39.440]  I know a bunch of people who've died from the shots.
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:42.440]  They tell them they died, little kids, adults, you name it.
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:46.960]  So we have lived to see it and they can normalize, listen, I'm hysterical on purpose.
[1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:47.960]  This isn't fake.
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:49.680]  But I let the dog off the leash.
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:52.520]  I could be totally calm talking about this right now, but I want to, but I decide to
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.160]  get upset because we have these emotions for a reason to get people motivated.
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:57.880]  So it's not fake when I'm emotional.
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:02.360]  It's I have the energy to do this because I get in an emotional space, but I intellectually
[1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:05.440]  sit here and study all of this information constantly.
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:08.520]  And we've got more information coming out right now about the border.
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:09.520]  It's breaking them.
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:10.520]  We're in a fricking war room.
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:11.520]  Where's our government?
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.640]  I don't want to be the one that's always right.
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:16.280]  I don't want to be what they call the brain and all the rest of stuff.
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:17.640]  I'm not.
[1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:19.120]  I know about the globalist attack.
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:20.120]  I know their background.
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:21.120]  I know their profile.
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:24.200]  I know their operations and I know what they're hitting us with.
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:28.240]  And I'm telling you, Ted Cruz and all the rest of them know as well.
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:29.920]  It's not that Biden is incompetent.
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:30.920]  He's a puppet.
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.520]  The people behind him are running the collapsing United States.
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:38.000]  We need agenda 21, agenda 2030, replacement migration hearings.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.120]  We need to expose Soros and the State Department program that Trump killed to his credit that
[1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:44.920]  Biden put back in eight months ago.
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:48.840]  We need to understand what's going down and we need your financial support.
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm burning the candle at both ends financially.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  We've got so many operations.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.080]  We need to launch against these people.
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:56.600]  And so I've got the heart and I've got the spirit.
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.080]  I've got some of the crew I need.
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:00.600]  We're trying to get more people, but I need financial support.
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:04.320]  We have ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 is so good for your immune system, your
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:05.320]  whole body and your way of life.
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:06.320]  Look how much energy I've got.
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:10.000]  I mean, I've had some coffee day and that said, this stuff gives me so much energy.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.800]  We have the X2, I-9, same thing, keep your immune system, some of you are deficient.
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:17.920]  And then we have winter sun, 50% off, which is the highest quality three of your immune
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:20.200]  system, your body at infowarstore.com.
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:22.280]  Get your orders in now.
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:23.280]  Support the operation.
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:26.600]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get your storeable food ready to ship to you now
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:29.240]  before the new war starts, the power outage or whatever they're going to pull.
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:30.240]  You can see it.
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:33.520]  We are at war and I will sit here on the air fighting as hard as I can.
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:36.440]  I came to DC to cover this event yesterday.
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:37.640]  I've got other irons of the fire.
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:38.640]  You'll know about soon.
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:41.400]  I'll just leave it at that very good, important, journalistic interviews and things that we're
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:42.400]  up to.
[1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:45.640]  And I'll be back Tuesday with Owen on the show, but I'm going to turn the baton over
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:48.680]  to Owen and just shut up here because you've got a lot to say and a lot to cover.
[1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:52.600]  And I just want to say God bless the crew and thank all of our listeners because this
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.800]  is an incredible time and good things are happening.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:57.880]  Praise God with this vaccine news coming out because it's not a vaccine.
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:00.440]  And just get that information and share it with everyone you know because they're trying
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:02.360]  to bury it or they're trying to spin it.
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.280]  It's just some scientific disagreement.
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:05.280]  It's healthy.
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:08.640]  And Fauci smiles on TV today, trying to act like it's no big deal.
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:10.200]  He just got mortally wounded.
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:15.120]  He is a mass murderer by design since the 80s with HIV and the drugs that killed people.
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:19.560]  There's a Gregory for PortlandForWords.com and he's a confessed premeditated mass murderer.
[1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:21.920]  And people, you're being hit by a mass murder.
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:27.320]  Oh, by the way, oh my God, oh my God, I discovered something about Fauci today that is the most
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:28.920]  amazing thing ever.
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:32.560]  And you know, just in case I die in a car wreck tonight, knock on wood, I'm going to
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:33.560]  say this is going to happen.
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:34.560]  I'm going to go ahead and tell you.
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:39.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, on the side of the search, Fauci's family background, on the side of
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:43.280]  the search, what his name means, it sounds like Faust, you know, deal with the devil.
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:44.280]  It does.
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:45.280]  It has nothing to do with Faust.
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:46.280]  Faust in German means strong.
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:50.440]  Guess what Fauci, the ladies and gentlemen, means?
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:55.880]  It's from southern Italy and it means the sickle and out of what is Italy today, out of that
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:03.760]  little nation state, 600 years ago, during a black plague, the Fauci and the sickle out
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:07.560]  of Italy was associated with the grim reaper cutting the wheat and taking large parts of
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:09.160]  the population.
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:13.280]  And Fauci's family means the angel of death.
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:18.440]  So he's not just like Joseph Mingola, his name means the sickle and the grim reaper.
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:23.360]  And his family crest, if you go back far as the town they're from, was not a grim reaper
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:26.960]  with a sickle, but a grim reaper with an arrow killing people.
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:30.320]  So Fauci is absolutely satanic incarnate.
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:32.240]  His name means angel of death.
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:35.440]  Now ladies and gentlemen, you understand why he's like Joseph Mingola, the angel of death.
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:37.120]  His name means sickle of death.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:40.680]  Owen, I love you, my brother, can you believe this stuff?
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:48.600]  You know, Alex, what's so frustrating is how much control the media has over America,
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:54.240]  whether it's with the fear porn about the virus or whether it's praising Anthony Fauci
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:57.360]  or hey, don't look over here at the border.
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:02.520]  You know, it's so frustrating because we don't want to brainwash our audience.
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:05.960]  We just want our audience to make informed decisions and understand what's going on.
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:12.480]  But the frustrating thing is, Alex, if we had even a fraction of the programming, it's
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:17.160]  like imagine being a computer programmer and there's two computer programmers in a room
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:21.200]  and the one computer programmer is the one working on this computer and he can't get
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:26.000]  the program to work and it just keeps failing and failing and failing and the other computer
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.600]  programmer is there like, I know how to fix that, I could fix that right now.
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:32.440]  And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm going to do it, I'm going to program
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:36.200]  this and then all the other scientists or whoever's watching is like, no, this computer
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:39.240]  programmer, we're going with this guy and you just have to sit there and watch this
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:44.200]  program fail and fail and fail and fail and then you're just sitting there and you realize
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.240]  after a time, it's like, wait a second, they want it to fail.
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  There's a reason.
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.160]  Yeah, they're throwing the computer in the water or they're peeing on it.
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.160]  Absolutely.
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:57.960]  So Tim just discovered something else huge and I'll see if he's going to call back in
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  here.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:14:59.960]  We're trying to get the internet back up.
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:00.960]  We've got a bunch of big stuff going on.
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:04.480]  But I'm telling you, folks, this is totally insane.
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:10.000]  Oh, and his name means the sickle and then it's from Italy and the Grim Reaper and that
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.800]  name basically means people associated with death.
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:19.800]  Well, it may just be time to just focus on Fauci in the 80s and we've got reports that
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:23.800]  we're going to air tonight on Sunday Night Live and Alex, if you guys file some special
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:25.360]  reports there, we'll air it tonight.
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:29.360]  I know you're having some internet troubles, but we'll air whatever special reports or
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:31.760]  breaking news you guys have been coming up on Sunday Night Live.
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.240]  I got a ton of news to get into now.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:34.240]  I appreciate you guys.
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:35.240]  Spread the word, folks.
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:36.240]  You're Paul Revere.
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:37.240]  Tell people to it now.
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  This is a damn war.
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  Get excited.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.240]  This is a total slave forever.
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:47.880]  All right, when we come back, I will get into all the latest when it comes to the media
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:54.040]  and COVID and the vaccines and how the dam is starting to break and the water is starting
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:59.040]  to drown the city.
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:04.480]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:05.480]  happening in the atmosphere.
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:09.800]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments
[1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:14.360]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:19.240]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:22.200]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:26.560]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s, 80s, and then it's going
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:29.400]  to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:31.640]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:37.040]  Did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:40.960]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:46.360]  They have weather control trees from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:47.360]  for a very long time.
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:52.000]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists wanted a Nobel Prize for an idea of spring different
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.720]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:58.560]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.360]  Thomas General Milley has revealed to the world that the United States is not a free
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:08.640]  republic but is run by a permanent state-bound network, bureaucracy.
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:11.480]  The big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone.
[1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:17.880]  He felt that he was safe to talk of an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:21.760]  by not just our government, the Five Eyes, the Russians, and the Chinese.
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.000]  He wanted the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  by the deep state.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.520]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy, it sees the American people as
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:36.720]  its enemy, it sees prosperity as its enemy, and it conspired with the Communist Chinese
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:41.640]  to threaten them basically and say, Trump may nuke you, but if he tries, we'll call
[1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:44.800]  and say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:45.800]  That's beyond treason.
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:50.840]  But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own vetted bubble that try
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:52.320]  to get away with this.
[1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:58.200]  Really in all of his accomplices, you need to go to prison now for life.
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.560]  We're already halfway through September 2021.
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:03.560]  It's just incredible.
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:08.520]  And now the world is waking up that Info Wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on.
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:10.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep us on air.
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:14.680]  And I thank you all for your support, your prayers, and your word of mouth that is key
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:17.360]  to circumvent and override the censors.

[1:18:57.080 --> 1:18:58.080]  Please take action.
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:03.440]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:08.800]  set in the year 2020 where a world government is being established, where members of Congress
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:13.680]  and former presidents are censured by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:19.640]  injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:22.240]  to fly on an airplane.
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:24.880]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:29.720]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us just five years ago, if somebody told you this
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:34.920]  would be happening, but it is happening now, and then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:38.720]  a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you've got to take it every
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:39.720]  few months.
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:44.040]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:47.520]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[1:19:47.520 --> 1:19:51.720]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:54.600]  of the virus, and that's in mainline studies.
[1:19:54.600 --> 1:20:01.600]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:28.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:34.200]  We're back here live, I want to show you're in studio.
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:40.800]  Last three segments of the Alex Jones show, and then on Sunday Night Live, I am just going
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:45.320]  to take phone calls, and then as you heard from Alex, we're going to have a lot of special
[1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:47.640]  reports coming up as well.
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:53.200]  We're going to get some of those up and ready to go for the Sunday Night Live transmission
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:54.200]  as well.
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:56.480]  So it's going to be your phone calls, and then some special breaking reports as the
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:00.000]  news continues to break.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:06.040]  Let me get into the stack of news over here when it comes to COVID and the vaccines and
[1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:08.320]  the damn breaking.
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:17.080]  And it's always what happens in tyrannical regimes, whatever oppression or edicts, it's
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:22.760]  always for the people, it's never for the elite, it's never for the government.
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:26.520]  You could point to a bunch of different examples of this in modern U.S. history, whether it's
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:29.760]  Pelosi shutting things down, she goes out to get her hair done.
[1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:32.760]  All these Democrats telling you to wear a mask, they go out and have massive parties,
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:37.640]  they're not wearing masks, AOC acting like the rich are her enemies, but she rubs elbows
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:39.840]  with the rich all day long, the list just goes on and on.
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:46.800]  But with the vaccine, here it is, stories at info wars.com, global elite is exempt,
[1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:52.520]  kind of like the Biden administration in Congress, exempt from New York's COVID-19 vaccine
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:55.080]  mandate for UN General Assembly.
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:22:00.600]  And there's been other examples like this too, like for Euro Cup, a bunch of elite
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:03.680]  were traveling in and they didn't have to quarantine, they could go right to the ball
[1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:09.040]  games and then leave immediately without quarantining, even though, you know, the citizen would
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:12.840]  have had to quarantine because it's not for the elite, it's not for the rich, it's only
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:16.680]  for you.
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:17.680]  It continues.
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:24.600]  Gavin Newsom's office refuses to say whether Newsom, the California governor, is quarantining
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:27.240]  after two of his children test positive for COVID.
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:34.080]  So see, it's this new thing that, quite frankly, we're all buying into is the fear of the virus.
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:37.840]  It didn't used to be this way two years ago, three years ago, you get the flu, you get
[1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:42.120]  a call if you get whatever, yeah, okay, maybe you stay home, you try to avoid contact, whatever.
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:47.640]  But you're not panicking, you're not quarantining, everybody that comes around you is not quarantining,
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:53.000]  oh, no, now that's the thing, now that's what's in for you and everybody else, but not for
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.680]  Newsom, not for his family because he either knows the whole thing is a sham and there's
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:04.240]  nothing to be afraid of, or he just thinks he's better than you, most likely, probably,
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.120]  I would say both.
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:15.600]  It just continues, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blanghiardi caught maskless leaving his birthday party
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:21.440]  of 23 closest friends with wine and artwork in hand as he, as the serfs are forced to
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:22.440]  stay home.
[1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:26.920]  That's right, big COVID tyranny in Honolulu, you quarantine, you wear a mask, you be a
[1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:33.920]  nice little peasant, but there is the mayor there with his spoils after getting bombed
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:38.160]  out with a good time, maskless partying with his friends.
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:42.640]  Hey, good for him, I like a good party, what about you, you guys like a good party, I like
[1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:45.160]  a good party, you like a good party, I like a good party.
[1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:49.800]  I don't like wearing a mask at a party, I don't like social distancing at a party, I
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:54.280]  don't like people asking me private questions about my medical history at a party, I like
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:55.280]  a good party.
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:59.680]  And it looks like the mayor of Honolulu likes a good party too, oh, but he doesn't want
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:05.320]  you to be able to party, he doesn't want you to be able to have a good time and not wear
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:09.640]  a mask and not quarantine and actually get close to your friends and hey, maybe hug a
[1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:16.480]  loved one, wild idea, wild, crazy idea, you might want to hug a loved one, but the mayor
[1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:21.000]  of Honolulu doesn't want you to enjoy those simple pleasures in life as he gets bombed
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:22.960]  out on the simple pleasures of life.
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:29.080]  Yes, once again, rules for you, but not for them.
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:33.120]  And now more pushback against the vaccines that the media will never tell you about that
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:38.400]  probably contractually obligated from their big pharmaceutical sponsors, not to say anything
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:44.040]  negative about the vaccine, NIH director says booster shots to be expanded despite FDA advisors
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:50.320]  voting them down and there was a vote, I have the number somewhere on here, but we've been
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:55.760]  sharing them on the screen, they're lost in my stack here, but yes, actually multiple
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:05.200]  panels including an FDA vaccine panel voted against the booster shots and two of the top
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:09.560]  members, senior members of the FDA actually left because they knew that this was going
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:14.600]  to be the case and they did not want to be there when the vaccines for boosters were
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:18.920]  approved by the FDA when they actually weren't approved.
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:26.320]  And again, more former health advocates from these departments are calling out the vaccines,
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.360]  former vice president of the World Health Organization, European advisory group, unvaccinated
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:36.080]  people are not dangerous, vaccinated people are dangerous and they should be quarantined.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:43.800]  Yeah, that's kind of a bit of a judo reversal.
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:49.480]  It's kind of a reversal into a German suplex, if you will, of what the media is telling
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:52.600]  you, but that is the reality.
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:58.360]  And that is coming from the former, the UK column was able to interview former European
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.320]  advisory group of experts in immunization at the World Health Organization, the vice
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:09.000]  president, Professor Christian Perron, last August where he specified that the COVID-19
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.080]  policy is completely stupid and how it should basically be reversed.
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:16.680]  It's the vaccine people that need to be quarantined because they're the ones that have created
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:17.920]  all these variants.
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:24.200]  It's the vaccine variants, the vaccine variants are getting people more sick than the original
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:30.160]  that came out of the lab that Fauci was funding and advocating and it's the vaccine variants.
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:34.560]  Hey, you know what, look, I don't even, I'm not even calling for people to get a vaccine
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:36.200]  to be quarantined.
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:40.800]  I'm sure I rub elbows with them plenty and they serve food if I go out to dinner or if
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:45.200]  I go out to a bar, they're probably all around me or say I go to a UT football game, they're
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:48.440]  all around me, but I don't say they should be quarantined, they should be allowed to
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:50.640]  live life just like everyone else.
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:55.200]  But if you really wanted to go with science and logic, it would be them that are the threat
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:57.480]  with the vaccine variants and that should be quarantined.
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:02.200]  But hey, I'm not for putting anybody in a cage, that's what the other side does.
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:07.120]  Sarah Palin, and it's sad to say that this is even so brave, but sadly it is the case
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:12.880]  these days so Sarah Palin bravely announces that she is unvaccinated because she believes
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:19.000]  in science, she did this with Dr. Drew and then Dr. Drew backs up her claims and of course
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:25.080]  you can talk about the natural immunity that is better than the vaccine immunity and then
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:32.400]  even Moderna comes out and says, if you have taken our vaccine, you are actually two times
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:34.560]  as likely to get COVID.
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:41.880]  Oh, wow, that's kind of a red alert thing there, but again the media is not allowed to
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:46.800]  talk about that and not allowed to cover that and they don't want that egg on their face.
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:51.760]  Megadeth's Dave Mustaine rails against COVID tyranny, calls for mass civil disobedience,
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:53.960]  I guess he's on tour right now doing that.
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:28:02.920]  He was in Austin a couple of weeks ago with Megadeth and so you're seeing who in mainstream
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:09.160]  art and entertainment is going along with the tyranny and who is not and it's very telling
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:10.160]  I think.
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:16.040]  You look at Nicki Minaj, you look at things, Pit Bull has said on his tour, Megadeth and
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:23.080]  then you see who gets ingratiated by the establishment like Lil Nas, fornicating with Satan and pretending
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:28.720]  he has a baby, he's a man or Olivia Rodrigo who nobody's ever heard of but she now gets
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:32.920]  big roles and big awards because she shills for the vaccine, she goes to the White House,
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:37.560]  she sells the vaccine, she tells all of her young audience get the vaccine, she's a zero
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:42.720]  brain nitwit herself with no talent but she's willing to show her boobs off to the world
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:46.080]  and she's willing to shill for the corrupt establishment so she gets recognized with
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:49.200]  awards and roles and that's the corrupt system that we live in.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.200]  Alright I'm going to continue through this stack of news when we get back, we're going
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:55.000]  to piled ride through all the rest of this news on the Alex Jones show and then take
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.600]  your phone calls on Sunday night live.
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:03.600]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out alleging that General Milley had called the head of
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.400]  the Chinese military and said Trump might nuke you, he tried to overthrow the US government
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:12.320]  but basically I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack which was
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:16.040]  the greatest treason in the US history that has ever been committed.
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:19.040]  People said oh Alex it must not be true and I might wait, Bob Woodward's former naval
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:23.440]  intelligence, he's a big insider globalist, he wouldn't have looked this out unless they
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:27.800]  wanted to put it out and said that Billy was a hero to set the precedent, you can have
[1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:32.280]  a permanent bureaucracy, stay behind network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:33.280]  coup over America.
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:37.760]  That's why he put five in, he's so incredibly weak he's to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:41.560]  Well people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line, well now Milley admits
[1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:42.560]  he did it.
[1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:47.320]  You see I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward, I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that
[1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:50.280]  she'd gotten a call from Milley that he'd taken control of the nukes.
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:53.320]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it.
[1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:56.960]  See I have a memory folks, I remember all this stuff, that's why I know it's true and
[1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:59.960]  what's false.
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:06.560]  Biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you, this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:13.760]  This is an engineered virus in a lab that they then injected into the public using their
[1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:20.720]  poison vaccine so the body then created mutations that actually spread even worse like the Delta
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:21.720]  variant.
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:27.040]  That is scientifically admitted, that is mainline science and not even debated, but the general
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:30.200]  public does not even know that.
[1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:37.520]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells
[1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:43.760]  you that you aren't a blame because you didn't take your poison shot, that is a giant lie.
[1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:49.680]  Countries like Israel and Singapore with the highest vaccine rate, at the highest death
[1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:53.360]  and highest illness rates, that is the facts.
[1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:56.680]  Get that information out to your friends, family and strangers like your life depends
[1:30:56.680 --> 1:30:58.880]  on it because it does.
[1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:04.560]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil and subsurface material
[1:31:04.560 --> 1:31:09.000]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:10.920]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:16.000]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.040]  products to the everyday consumer.
[1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:22.720]  Their first product they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:25.720]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:30.080]  Bioseptic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:32.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:37.120]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:41.880]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:46.320]  Bioseptic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:50.360]  Visit thebio-pros.com today and protect your septic system.
[1:31:50.360 --> 1:31:52.320]  That's thebio-pros.com.
[1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:56.440]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[1:31:56.440 --> 1:31:57.440]  Thebio-pros.com.
[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:01.160]  I'll tell you what's life and death.
[1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:05.960]  If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate,
[1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:08.320]  then you don't have a future.
[1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:11.720]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:13.880]  they finally start exterminating the population.
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:18.280]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global's directed
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:19.280]  great reset.
[1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:22.840]  That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and that all of us
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:23.840]  stay healthy.

[1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:50.720]  not just your hair and beard.

[1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:57.080]  us on the air.
[1:32:57.080 --> 1:32:58.080]  Take action.
[1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:01.080]  I thank you.
[1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:29.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:30.920]  Let's get right back into this news.
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:39.040]  So I can get it all off my desk and take at least an hour or more, hopefully, a phone
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:45.160]  call coming up on Sunday Night Live right after the Alex Jones transmission finishes.
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:52.120]  The people are rising up and in many different ways this is happening.
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:57.080]  You just had a massive protest in New York City again.
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:04.480]  The headline that is at infowarstore.com from Sputnik, FU Joe Biden, New Yorkers take to
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:12.320]  the streets to protest vaccine mandates, link COVID rules to Nazis.
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:19.680]  And there was another big protest somewhere against the vaccine mandates that I saw as
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:20.680]  well.
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:21.680]  I forget where that was.
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:22.680]  Maybe California.
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:23.680]  I'm not sure for certain.
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.840]  But the point is these are happening almost every day now.
[1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:33.240]  Peaceful protests against the vaccine mandate and that's a powerful exhibit right there.
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:39.720]  You see people pretending to be dead on the street with the vaccine needle in their back.
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:43.880]  Obviously illustrating all the people that have died from the vaccine.
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:51.280]  And by the way, they had the VAERS reporting system to report vaccine side effects.
[1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:54.680]  We had somebody in our audience actually go out and create a website.
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:56.680]  I believe it's VaxAction.com.
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:58.960]  I meant to actually follow up with this.
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:03.800]  And in fact, we should get that guy back on the war room maybe this week coming up.
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:04.800]  VaxAction.
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:05.800]  I think it's VAXAction.
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:06.800]  Yeah.
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:12.960]  VaxAction.com, open vaccine injury reports where you can go out and report vaccine injuries.
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:19.120]  And this is more of an interactive system than the VAERS system where you just jump through
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:24.080]  hoops to send them your report and then you're not even really sure if it goes up or not.
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:26.120]  This is interactive in real time.
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:30.440]  You can follow the report and then it's interactive there and you can actually see it go up and
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:32.960]  it's more personable as well.
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:37.320]  VaxAction.com, we should be plugging this more often because we need to have our own
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:43.640]  archives of this history because we know how history is controlled and rigged and massaged
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:44.920]  and maneuvered.
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:49.280]  So that's why VaxAction.com is so key, at least I believe.
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:50.880]  But back to the news here.
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:56.480]  College football fans chant F. Joe Biden for a third week in a row.
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:01.440]  It seems to be the trend, the number one trend for college football games this year where
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:03.880]  the stadiums are once again packed.
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:11.360]  And this time there was a massive chant of F. Joe Biden at a Virginia Tech game, at a
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:16.040]  Wyoming game, at a Tennessee game.
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:17.520]  The list just goes on and on here.
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:19.480]  We're actually compiling these videos.
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:21.400]  I don't believe at a Kentucky game.
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:29.640]  I don't believe we published them yet at Bandot video, but my crew on the War Room is actually
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:33.400]  we are compiling all these F. Joe Biden chants at the college football games, at the baseball
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:34.900]  games everywhere.
[1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:36.480]  It's an organic phenomenon too.
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:41.000]  It's not something that the media put them up to or that Hollywood put them up to.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.080]  It's an organic event to see these chants happening.
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.040]  So it's actually the real deal.
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:52.280]  And then didn't really go so well for Nancy Pelosi recently.
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:53.680]  You're not welcome here, Nancy.
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:54.680]  Trump won.
[1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:55.680]  Go back to Epstein Island.
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:59.580]  Nancy Pelosi greeted by hecklers at Northern England Stop is the headline with the video
[1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:01.240]  at the Gateway Pundit.
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:06.320]  Nancy Pelosi was greeted by loud, boisterous, and angry English protesters during her stop
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:08.200]  in the north of England on Saturday.
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:14.080]  So even across the pond, they know who the truly corrupt politicians are here in this
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:15.080]  country.
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:18.120]  Time for Americans to wake up.
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:26.760]  It continues with the clash of the police and the citizens in Australia that just want
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:28.280]  to be free.
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:34.040]  Elderly Australian woman knocked down and pepper sprayed by police in Melbourne during
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:35.880]  protests against lockdowns.
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:40.800]  And so it's sad to see that the police, and we knew this would happen, are basically put
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:45.800]  in a position where they are the front lines for the evil establishment.
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:47.360]  You're not going to have Bill Gates out there.
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:49.200]  You're not going to have Fauci out there.
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:52.720]  You're not going to have any of the politicians out there that are locking you down, telling
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:55.600]  you you're not free anymore, and you have to live in fear the rest of your life and be
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:58.920]  a slave to a virus and the big government.
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:02.520]  So they send the police out there to do their work after they demonize the police, put a
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:06.480]  target on the police back, and then pit the police against the very people that supported
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:08.400]  them throughout all of this.
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:13.400]  It truly is a crazy thing to witness and experience.
[1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:18.080]  Thousands marched through London calling on government to scrap plans to give COVID
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:20.800]  jabs to children.
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:24.200]  Massive signs saying don't jab our kids and big numbers in the street.
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:34.120]  So again, that's just an example or more examples of citizens waking up and trying to stand
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:41.360]  up against the New World Order government tyranny that we all see coming now, which started
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:48.880]  with the fear of COVID and has now reached the next level of the medical tyranny, just
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:51.800]  as it was planned.
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:39:02.720]  Now, same highway, but a different lane, the Lancet, which was being sorted and cited
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:09.320]  for all of these newscasts and people who wanted to say, see, the virus didn't come
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:10.320]  out of the lab.
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:11.320]  The mask works.
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:13.880]  I remember they were all citing the Lancet.
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:19.200]  Well, the Lancet is now starting to do a 180.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:26.360]  The Lancet U-turns over COVID lab leak theory and publishes alternative view calling for
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.520]  a transparent debate on the origins of the virus.
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  How convenient now, a year and a half later, when the origins of the virus aren't the story
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:38.440]  anymore and now the vaccine is, but there you go.
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:46.000]  So will the Lancet do a U-turn on Dr. Fauci, who it's now been discovered, has funded 60
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:51.200]  projects at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, all in conjunction with the Chinese military.
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:54.120]  So that's Fauci with ties to the Chinese military.
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:57.400]  That's Millie with ties to the Chinese military.
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:39:59.000]  Are you getting it yet?
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.600]  Will the Lancet change face on Ivermectin?
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:10.000]  India, state of 241 million people declared COVID free after government promotes Ivermectin.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.320]  And I forget what they call them.
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:14.000]  It's a blister pack.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.240]  I believe it's a blister pack.
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:17.120]  It's like seven bucks.
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:22.360]  And it's enough Ivermectin to get you COVID free and help you recover.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:27.800]  And it's now has a state of 241 million people COVID free because Ivermectin works.
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:30.000]  So will the Lancet change face on that?
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:34.840]  Will the Lancet change face on the face masks after all the studies that have come out on
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:41.320]  the face mask and how they test the children's face mask after a full day at school?
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:47.640]  And it's basically like 12, 13 different bacterias on it more deadly than COVID that are just
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:48.640]  sitting on that mask.
[1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:52.560]  It makes you question a lot of things, I think, and they're touching the mask and it
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:55.200]  causes all sorts of long-term side effects.
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:59.280]  You're breathing in your own carbon dioxide and all those studies are out there, but yet
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:00.280]  no scientific proof.
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.960]  It actually stops the spread of COVID, at least in mass scales.
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:06.080]  You could argue, hey, you know, you sneeze.
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:07.880]  There's a lot of molecules going out.
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:08.880]  Okay, fine.
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:12.560]  So where's the science that shows mask masking is actually doing anything?
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:13.560]  There is none.
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:15.960]  So will the Lancet change face on that?
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:21.600]  125 Indiana hospital employees quit over COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.680]  This is happening all over the country, including here in Texas.
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:32.720]  In fact, last night, I happened to overhear a conversation where an individual who runs
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:42.160]  a hospital was basically laughing about the fact that, now, first, so here, I'm in a public
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:43.160]  space.
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:44.160]  This guy's talking loudly.
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:45.160]  He really thinks a lot of himself.
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:46.840]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:51.160]  And first, he was telling the people around him how serious COVID was and how overwhelmed
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:55.120]  they are and how overworked and, oh, you know, he's a hero, but he's overworked and all this
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:00.440]  stuff, but he was having a good time at the event I was at.
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:04.800]  And then he goes on and he talks about all this handful of nurses.
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:09.680]  I forget the number, but it was a big number, not as much as a hundred, but it was a pretty
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:10.680]  significant number.
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:14.760]  And he talks about all these nurses that came in and were refusing to get the vaccine.
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:15.760]  And so they're going to get fired.
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:16.760]  And he laughs.
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:17.760]  He says, good.
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:18.760]  Good riddance.
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:19.760]  Goodbye.
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:20.760]  We don't want you.
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:21.760]  We don't need you.
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:22.760]  Get out of here.
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:25.440]  And it's just hilarious to sit there and listen to this guy who, by the way, is morbidly obese.
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.600]  To listen to this guy, talk about how serious it is in the hospital, how overwhelmed and
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:30.840]  how he's a hero.
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:35.560]  And then his next sentence, he laughs about these nurses and he's basically excited that
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:38.160]  they're going to be gone because they don't want to get the vaccine.
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:41.800]  So you're either overwhelmed and overworked and you need all the nurses or you're lying
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:47.280]  about that and you're a jerk because you're glad that these nurses aren't going to be
[1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:49.680]  employed anymore.
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:52.880]  And it really just puts everything into perspective.
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:55.920]  And you know, I wanted to turn around and talk to this guy, but I realized there's just
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:42:56.920]  no point, man.
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:42:58.040]  These people are already lost.
[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:02.360]  They're already halfway through September, 2021.
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:03.360]  It's just incredible.
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:08.320]  And now the world is waking up that Info Wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on.

[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:09.040]  term.
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:10.040]  It's for new listeners.
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:14.040]  The power structure works around the clock to try to debilitate you and try to make you
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:15.040]  sickly.
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:19.800]  Please research because this is life and death vitamins that are essential and minerals
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:20.800]  that are essential.
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.360]  Just type that into a search engine, you will see the coffee universities, CDC all of them
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:29.960]  telling you this but you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you
[1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:34.840]  with the big pharma companies to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:37.840]  from what's going on in the world on a routine basis.
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:43.240]  We now have back in stock winter sun the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your

[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:03.160]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:05.880]  for beta testing to operational.
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:10.640]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:11.640]  takeover.
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:14.800]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.680]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:23.640]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:25.480]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:27.960]  If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it.
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:32.200]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:33.880]  others is absolutely essential.
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:38.440]  And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:42.120]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[1:45:42.120 --> 1:45:44.120]  also funding our operation.
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:50.040]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold
[1:45:50.040 --> 1:45:54.280]  out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobetes and others.
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:58.880]  So get them today at infowarstore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:04.360]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:10.080]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:14.280]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:19.400]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:24.280]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:28.720]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:33.600]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there's only two things to do.
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:36.720]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:40.080]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:44.720]  But even when we win and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:51.000]  an end and so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:47:02.200]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life-saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:17.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:20.880]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:27.440]  All right, I'm going to get through all this news hopefully in this segment and I'm going
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:33.680]  to start taking calls and I'm going to take calls for over an hour on Sunday Night Live
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:34.680]  tonight.
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:35.680]  So stay tuned to that.
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:41.440]  I'm going to give out that phone number after this broadcast concludes and if you just are
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:46.320]  watching on Band-Aid video on the Alex Jones channel, Sunday Night Live is carried live
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:49.520]  right there at the conclusion.
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:53.080]  We just go live on Sunday Night Live, less commercial breaks there.
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:55.240]  All brought to you by infowarstore.com.
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:59.480]  So let me try to get all this news off my desk here so I can just focus on taking calls
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:03.160]  for Sunday Night Live this evening.
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:04.640]  Headline is zero hedge.
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:11.000]  Biden's border blunder, 15,000 migrants under Texas Bridge forces Governor Abbott to send
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:16.760]  in troopers and it feels like it's a little too late from Governor Abbott and then also
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:20.680]  the Democrats and the UN are playing games.
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:26.400]  They figure out where Abbott sends the troops and then they steer the migrant caravan in
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:27.600]  a different direction.
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:33.000]  So there's a bit of a cat and mouse game going on there between Abbott and law enforcement
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:36.760]  and the illegal immigrant invasion.
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:40.800]  Bizarro world, Haitians cross back and forth over Texas, Mexico border.
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:42.800]  Yeah, it's wide open.
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:46.320]  Can you imagine yourself though going into any other country?
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:50.400]  Can you imagine you just walking into any other country and getting freebies and just
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:51.400]  demanding it?
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:52.400]  Can you imagine that?
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:53.600]  Would that happen anywhere else on earth?
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:55.400]  No, it happens here.
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:58.200]  And if America is so racist, why are all these people wanting to come here?
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:02.520]  If America is so bad and sucks so bad, why are all these people wanting to come here?
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:06.880]  It's just the illogic of our mainstream media and our Democrat Party, which isn't really
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:09.760]  illogic, just lying through their teeth.
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:11.280]  It's an invasion.
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:16.600]  The authorities bust thousands of migrants to Bidenville bridge camp on Mexican side of
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:17.600]  Texas border.
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:20.360]  And again, you've seen the images coming out.
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:23.400]  If you've ever seen the movie District 9, in fact, the crew can probably even pull up
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:25.480]  the images of that, but it's irrelevant.
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:26.480]  It looks the same.
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:32.400]  It's like District 9, where you just have this mass of humanity out there in just third
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:39.200]  world status, just waiting to invade the country, just waiting to come in and get their freebies.
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:42.200]  They don't have any prospects, they don't offer anything.
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:45.160]  That's not insensitive commentary.
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:48.320]  That's just the truth.
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:50.080]  And so what are they doing here?
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:51.240]  How did they get here?
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:53.360]  Why are they here?
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:55.840]  It's just bringing in, collapsing the southern border.
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:02.000]  The southern border has been surrendered, collapsed the southern border into the U.S. to come into
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.080]  our major cities and collapse them into third world hell holes so that you then beg for daddy
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:11.400]  government to do something about the situation at hand.
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:15.040]  And seriously, the images coming out, it's just, there's nothing like it.
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:18.800]  If you've ever been to a music festival at the end of it, when the hordes of people are
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:23.800]  just pouring out, that's what it looks like pouring into our southern border right now.
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:28.480]  Governor Abbott deploys DPS Troopers National Guard to build barricade along border around
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:31.800]  Del Rio amid surge of illegal aliens, and then that's right.
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:40.120]  And so somebody gave them that intel, and they directed the caravan to then head back
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:43.920]  to McCallan, which was the original soft spot.
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:47.320]  And then it was Del Rio, now it's McCallan, and they're just playing cat and mouse with
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:51.240]  our law enforcement, and somebody is directing them to do so.
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:59.720]  There's a turd in the punch bowl, as they might say, a turd in the punch bowl.
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:05.160]  It is Biden on top, but he's not the one that's making sure these migrants can get in without
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:06.640]  being caught by law enforcement.
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:08.280]  That's somebody else.
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:09.800]  Where is Biden, you might ask.
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:12.960]  Well, Biden might even be asking himself that question every morning.
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:13.960]  In fact, he does.
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:14.960]  He admitted to that.
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:17.440]  Every morning he wakes up, he says, where the hell am I?
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:20.280]  But take what you want with that.
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:25.920]  Biden takes a casual bike ride by the beach as multiple crises sink his presidency.
[1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:30.360]  Well, yes, sink the nation, really, just some post-editing there on the Gateway Punnett
[1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:32.120]  headline for myself.
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:36.880]  And so Biden, though, is enjoying the beach and enjoying a vacation.
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:41.240]  And apparently he can ride a bike, at least he says he can.
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:43.160]  But it must be nice, Joe.
[1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:46.080]  It must be nice.
[1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:49.160]  I think that they gave up trying to pretend like Joe Biden can play golf.
[1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:53.160]  Remember, they tried to run that whole gambit, and then he literally hacked one run to a
[1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:55.240]  rock, almost knocked his block off.
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:58.640]  And so they just figured, OK, let's stop faking like Biden can play golf.
[1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:01.680]  Everybody knows he can't walk 18 holes, let alone nine.
[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:05.120]  But hey, let's mount him up on a bike.
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:08.560]  And let's get a little video of him strolling through on the bike, and that one.
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:11.840]  And now America will be convinced.
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:16.560]  Oh, boy.
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:17.720]  What an embarrassment.
[1:52:17.720 --> 1:52:21.640]  So that's what Biden is up to as the country is being surrendered.
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:24.760]  What about, remember Kamala Harris, she was going to be in charge of the border?
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:28.440]  Has she done anything at the border since then?
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:35.000]  Has Harris done anything at the border since then?
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.200]  Has she visited the border?
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:37.440]  Does anybody know what she's doing?
[1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:38.440]  What is she up to?
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:39.920]  Well, she's not at the border.
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:41.440]  But she is going to football games.
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:42.760]  Say good for her.
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:45.240]  Again, hey, I like going to football games.
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:48.600]  It's like, I'm saying like the guy at the mayor in Hawaii likes to party.
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:49.600]  He likes to drink.
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:50.600]  He likes to have a good time.
[1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:51.600]  I like to have a good time.
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:54.960]  Kamala Harris likes to go to football games, I like to go to football games.
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:52:57.560]  But I'm not the one telling people they can't go have a good time.
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:02.360]  I'm not the one telling people to social distance and wear a mask and stay home in quarantine
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:03.440]  and not see loved ones.
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:04.440]  That's them.
[1:53:04.440 --> 1:53:05.440]  That's Harris.
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:06.440]  That's the Democrat mayors.
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:07.800]  But here's Kamala Harris.
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:12.040]  What she's doing is the border has been surrendered and she's apparently in charge of the border.
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:17.600]  She's had a football game, cackling it up in her mask, you can even see it.
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:22.880]  Here's our Kamala Harris leads coin toss at Howard Hampton football game as thousands
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:25.200]  of illegal aliens storm the border.
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:27.000]  Does she even have any idea what's going on?
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Hey, good for her.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.480]  I like football games too, Kamala.
[1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:31.880]  You're going to enjoy a football game.
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:33.160]  It's part of the American way.
[1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:34.480]  It's part of the American culture.
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:39.840]  What this rich, prosperous nation made is we can go watch football and have fun.
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:42.480]  It's what the free market has done and capitalism is pretty great, right?
[1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:46.240]  You enjoy that as you want to destroy all of it.
[1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:54.400]  She's amazing and so there she is enjoying a football game, wearing her mask, wearing
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:54:02.280]  her mask as the southern border is completely surrendered and she is supposedly the one
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:04.720]  in charge.
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:07.600]  You think anybody got the old Willie Brown treatment after the game?
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:08.600]  All right.
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:09.600]  It's too much.
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:10.880]  Is that too much, guys?
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:11.880]  What?
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:13.880]  I'm just asking.
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:20.240]  I'm just asking, hey, ask Willie Brown about that, not me.
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:24.960]  No, but hey, we know she's abandoned the southern border.
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:25.960]  All right.
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:30.360]  Let's get into another stack here.
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:34.000]  Snapchat promotes child sacrifice.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:39.600]  Snapchat pushes video on their trading section explaining how the Satanic temple uses religious
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:41.760]  loopholes to allow abortion procedures.
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:48.240]  Wow, and Snapchat is promoting this video and it's the Satanic abortion loophole.
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:49.240]  Wow.
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.720]  It's not a loophole.
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:53.160]  It is.
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:54.640]  Abortion is Satanic.
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:55:00.320]  Yes, it's called child sacrifice, so it's not that that's a loophole.
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:04.760]  That is the operating procedure.
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:12.080]  It's not your loophole, that is the manifest destiny.
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:14.720]  That is the standard operating procedure.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:15.920]  That is the genesis.
[1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:17.480]  That is the origin.
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:19.160]  It is child sacrifice.
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:21.120]  It is Satanic.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:25.000]  Now they're just coming out and telling you.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.400]  And I would expect some charges or even an arrest in this story.
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:35.640]  A Texas abortionist says he's already violated the new heartbeat law.
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:39.800]  A Texas abortionist has admitted that he already violated the state's new law banning procedures
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:42.240]  after a fetal heartbeat is detected.
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:49.920]  Alan Brade at an OBGYN at Alamo Women's Reproductive Services in San Antonio wrote an essay that
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:55.200]  was published in the Washington Post admitting to his crimes.
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:55:59.840]  Wow, murdering babies.
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:01.160]  Or is it that or is it not?
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:02.920]  Are we going to have a debate on that?
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:04.280]  Either way, he's broke the law.
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:08.960]  Will he have to pay the price?
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:15.040]  Speaking of breaking the law and paying the price, the Durham investigation finally just
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:16.800]  had a little fart.
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:18.360]  There was a little tiny little fart.
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:21.880]  It barely was maybe a little silent one, maybe a little squeaker.
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:24.640]  But there was some developments there.
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:29.360]  Is Hillary attorney Mark Elias in legal jeopardy alongside attorney Michael Sussman?
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:31.200]  Is this why he left Perkins Cooey?
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:35.640]  So it's basically what we already knew about the whole Russian gate, Russia, PP tape.
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:40.760]  But this is more in regards to the Trump bank story.
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:46.000]  Totally fabricated, totally made up, paid for opposition research by Hillary Clinton.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.760]  Her lawyers were involved.
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:51.080]  And that's why there was an indictment filed by Durham on that case.
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:56.160]  It's just the beginning, I would hope, even if it is too late for anything to be done
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:56:58.360]  about that.
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:00.840]  And so Eric Trump made a comment.
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:04.920]  We didn't know until two days ago Hillary Clinton funded the Alpha Bank mainstream media
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:05.920]  scam.
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:12.280]  Actually, we did know it, but now we actually have the receipts to back that knowledge up.
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:17.800]  Okay, that does it for the Alex Jones show on this Sunday evening, but I'm sticking around
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:21.520]  here and I'm going to take phone calls for the next hour and a half.
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:28.080]  So stick by and we will continue and we will take your calls on all of this and more Sunday
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:31.240]  night live kicks off right after this, I'm going to give out the phone number right after
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:32.240]  the break.
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:38.800]  But folks, remember infowarstore.com, big specials on vitamin B12 right now, all to 1250% off,

[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:55.480]  is now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.800]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:05.440]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:07.280]  euphoric effects.
[1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:12.680]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:17.000]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:21.720]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:22.960]  loosen up a little.
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:27.440]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:33.840]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:40.560]  herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Balerian root.
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:47.640]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:58:47.640 --> 1:58:56.000]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:01.480]  New World Order, and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:07.280]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:08.280]  through the UN.
[1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:12.480]  And they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want, and to
[1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:19.160]  have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of
[1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:21.320]  their new world ID.
[1:59:21.320 --> 1:59:26.120]  And now their puppet vice has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans
[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:30.320]  to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:31.320]  This is criminal.
[1:59:31.320 --> 1:59:34.800]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it.
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:37.240]  They say that's a 20, 25 maybe.
[1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:39.240]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:42.720]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[1:59:42.720 --> 1:59:45.720]  Well, you live to see an absolute Nuremberg World Government.
[1:59:45.720 --> 1:59:51.720]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[1:59:51.720 --> 2:00:12.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
