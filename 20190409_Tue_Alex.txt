[00:30.000 --> 00:38.220]  this is the Alex Jones show. I'm Owen Schroyer filling in for Alex Jones today. I'm sure
[00:38.220 --> 00:49.740]  we'll be hearing from Alex. And I got to tell you, with all the news developing today,
[00:49.740 --> 00:57.900]  it was tough for me to decide what to lead the broadcast with. Is it the medical tyranny
[00:57.900 --> 01:05.480]  news? Is it the open border news? Is it the potential geopolitical struggle that could
[01:05.480 --> 01:17.560]  lead to World War news happening in Venezuela? Happening in Iran? Is it all the violence happening
[01:17.560 --> 01:29.560]  to Trump supporters right now? So much to get to. Is it the Russian collusion, delusion
[01:29.560 --> 01:38.280]  narrative falling flat today with the bar hearing being a total dud? I mean a total dud, folks.
[01:38.280 --> 01:44.260]  Pathetic. The Democrats up there bringing fake news and bars literally tired of it.
[01:44.260 --> 01:51.840]  He's up there yawning, drinking water, rolling his eyes. These people are a joke. But instead
[01:51.840 --> 01:57.280]  I decided to go with what's happening right now with Ilhan Omar and you've had a thwarted
[01:57.280 --> 02:03.960]  terror attack in Maryland that's getting almost no news coverage. But I want to play
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.480]  this clip of Ilhan Omar because we've reached an interesting point or we're just beginning
[02:09.480 --> 02:14.080]  to get there and I've seen this coming for a while. But I think we're about to reach
[02:14.080 --> 02:20.080]  ahead with this, especially with the rhetoric of Omar right now. But listen to what Ilhan
[02:20.080 --> 02:26.080]  Omar said in a speech to care just this week.
[02:26.080 --> 02:37.080]  Care was founded after 9-11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all
[02:37.080 --> 02:44.000]  of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.840]  Now I want to play that short clip one more time because I want you to hear what she's
[02:47.840 --> 02:55.960]  saying here and really think about what she didn't say. So listen to again. I'm not sure
[02:55.960 --> 03:00.120]  if she's actually speaking at a care event but she's speaking at an Islamic event. This
[03:00.120 --> 03:06.360]  is Ilhan Omar. Listen to what she says. Listen closely to what she says about 9-11. Play it
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.360]  again.
[03:07.360 --> 03:17.600]  Care was founded after 9-11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all
[03:17.600 --> 03:24.480]  of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.
[03:24.480 --> 03:34.320]  So according to Ilhan Omar on 9-11 some people did something. Now to the average American
[03:34.320 --> 03:40.440]  you just say wait a second here's a Muslim woman proud Muslim woman wears the hijab
[03:40.440 --> 03:46.320]  says some people did something they don't understand the layers of complexities to what
[03:46.320 --> 03:53.120]  she didn't say. Now what she's saying to her audience because they understand it is Jews
[03:53.120 --> 04:00.440]  did 9-11. That's what she sang to her audience a bunch of Muslims that hate the Jews. But
[04:00.440 --> 04:08.400]  the American hears that and says wait a second what didn't she say some people did something.
[04:08.400 --> 04:15.520]  So it wasn't radical Islamic terrorists. It wasn't radical Islamic terrorists that flew
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.680]  airplanes into the Twin Towers. It wasn't radical Islam responsible for that terror
[04:20.680 --> 04:30.800]  attack. Now look I don't want this culture war of Islam versus Jews in the West. I don't
[04:30.800 --> 04:38.000]  want it. I'm not interested in it. Say what you want about Jews and Zionists. The average
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.880]  American and the average Jew are compatible and the Jewish culture and everything has
[04:42.880 --> 04:49.200]  assimilated in the West. Islam is not assimilating folks and now you had a mass potential terror
[04:49.200 --> 04:56.080]  attack in Maryland thwarted where a young man wanted to drive and a truck and kill a
[04:56.080 --> 05:02.600]  bunch of people for Islam. More on the other side. The globalist the eugenicists are always
[05:02.600 --> 05:09.240]  talking down to us. They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.560]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[05:13.560 --> 05:19.680]  information so you can make your own decisions. They want you to believe you're powerless.
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.840]  But the truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say and
[05:25.840 --> 05:31.920]  what we do that changes the world. We are the power structure. We are the inventors.
[05:31.920 --> 05:39.240]  We are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they
[05:39.240 --> 05:44.800]  are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people. Now to help
[05:44.800 --> 05:48.920]  fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalist.
[05:48.920 --> 05:53.160]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[05:53.160 --> 05:58.040]  of the month of March we're going to have store wide free shipping and 50% off at m4store.com
[05:58.040 --> 06:17.480]  something everybody should take advantage of. Defending the republic from enemies foreign
[06:17.480 --> 06:42.040]  and domestic. It's Alex Jones. And now your host Owen Troyer. What a time to be alive.
[06:42.040 --> 06:50.000]  What an opportunity to change the world. We're live broadcasting from the Info Wars World
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.400]  Headquarters in Austin, Texas on this Tuesday, April 9, 2019. The Info Wars dot com Alex
[06:57.400 --> 07:08.240]  Jones show brought to you by you at InfoWarsStore.com. Now go ahead and give me a quick dot cam
[07:08.240 --> 07:19.400]  of the desk here because I've got stacks and stacks and stacks of news to get to. And it's
[07:19.400 --> 07:22.960]  all important and I'm going to need to stay focused for the next four hours. I'll be on
[07:22.960 --> 07:26.840]  air here and we're going to get to all this news. Hopefully we'll have time to take your
[07:26.840 --> 07:29.960]  phone calls. Dan Lyman may be joining us. He's got breaking news out of Europe, but
[07:29.960 --> 07:35.440]  here's the deal. I need to get focused. I've already done one broadcast today trolling
[07:35.440 --> 07:40.920]  the Democrats here in Austin. Avocado day. We'll air some of that later on, but I'm
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.720]  going to have to be focused and I'm going to need energy for the next four hours. So
[07:43.720 --> 07:50.360]  I'm going to go ahead and hit my turbo force right now at 1107 a.m. So I'll be I'll be
[07:50.360 --> 07:55.440]  energized and ready to go. I'm going to go ahead and hit the turbo force right now.
[07:55.440 --> 08:01.920]  And I got to give credit to one of our great reporters, Will Johnson for turning me on
[08:01.920 --> 08:08.760]  to turbo force with hot water drinking it like tea. I got to give him credit. I was
[08:08.760 --> 08:14.840]  just drinking it like you would an energy shot basically. And I was just pouring the
[08:14.840 --> 08:21.440]  turbo force packet and about eight ounces of water and then just downing it. But I got
[08:21.440 --> 08:27.200]  to say drinking it warm and sipping on it like tea. That's the kind of the way to go.
[08:27.200 --> 08:33.640]  I think during the live show, instead of just getting that immediate jolt and rush kind
[08:33.640 --> 08:39.120]  of having it sustain and last. So it's turbo force. It's at info or store.com and anybody
[08:39.120 --> 08:48.280]  who's tried it knows that the energy is real and that you get that burst from turbo force.
[08:48.280 --> 08:52.000]  In fact, should we do what we did yesterday? Can you get that doc cam shot again? Because
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.560]  here's what happens when I when I stir my turbo force like this on air. It's really satisfying.
[08:58.560 --> 09:04.480]  It's oddly satisfying. And then it helps me like find my chi. There's just something about
[09:04.480 --> 09:18.320]  it. Yes. Find your chi. Find the energy with turbo force at info or store.com. I'm getting
[09:18.320 --> 09:24.920]  ready for a long four hour broadcast and I need my energy. I'm sipping turbo force mixed
[09:24.920 --> 09:33.280]  with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones show. It's magic. It's turbo
[09:33.280 --> 09:42.680]  force from info or store.com. All right. So now that I've got that taken care of, you
[09:42.680 --> 09:49.000]  can get your turbo force at info or store.com experience the rush of energy for yourself.
[09:49.000 --> 10:10.240]  Now this is really complex because my goal is to put it widely change the world, but
[10:10.240 --> 10:21.080]  to put it specifically is to awaken people and to just open one mind, open one mind's
[10:21.080 --> 10:29.440]  eye, open one third eye, awaken one individual at a time. So when that is the goal, when
[10:29.440 --> 10:37.920]  that is the mission, there's different tactics and things that you do to accomplish that.
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.480]  And so for example, going out today as a Bernie supporter to the Democrat offices so they
[10:42.480 --> 10:45.760]  could kick me out and throw me under the bus just to prove how the Democrats hate Bernie
[10:45.760 --> 10:49.280]  and he's about to get thrown under the bus by the Democrats again, how Democrats don't
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.680]  care about their voters. That's just one example. We'll air that later. But what's happening
[10:54.680 --> 11:06.800]  right now with Ilhan Omar is another example because I don't like Ilhan Omar. She's a snake.
[11:06.800 --> 11:13.440]  I don't think she has good intentions for the West and for America. And yes, I'm not
[11:13.440 --> 11:20.720]  Islamophobic. I'm not worried about radical Islam because of 9 11. No, I'm worried about
[11:20.720 --> 11:28.240]  radical Islam because of everything that's happened since 9 11. I'm worried about Muslims
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.360]  that want to come to the West after seeing the Middle East destroyed for the last 20
[11:33.360 --> 11:40.480]  years and do a little destruction of their own like an individual in Maryland. Islamic
[11:40.480 --> 11:45.520]  terrorists behind planned Maryland truck attack wanted to kill as many non Muslims as possible.
[11:45.520 --> 11:49.560]  The stores at info wars.com. You're not hearing too much about that. Islamic jihadist. Are
[11:49.560 --> 12:04.640]  you? But here's the twist. I don't believe the official narrative of 9 11. Not one bit.
[12:04.640 --> 12:11.800]  Osama bin Laden was a boogeyman. Radical Islamic terror was a boogeyman that's now become a
[12:11.800 --> 12:20.040]  self fulfilling prophecy. So yeah, when you gaslight radical Islam, then it becomes a
[12:20.040 --> 12:31.600]  threat. When you let it in, it becomes a threat. But so then there's Ilhan Omar, who's like
[12:31.600 --> 12:39.320]  both sides of the coin. On one hand, in fact, let's play the clip so that we can have better
[12:39.320 --> 12:50.880]  context here. Listen to what Ilhan Omar said at a Muslim event. This week care was founded
[12:50.880 --> 12:58.840]  after 9 11 because they recognize that some people did something and that all of us were
[12:58.840 --> 13:04.200]  starting to lose access to our civil liberties. Let me translate what she's actually saying
[13:04.200 --> 13:10.520]  to her crowd. Jews did 9 11 and now Islam or Muslims are losing their civil liberties.
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.680]  That's what she's actually saying. Now she doesn't say that because she can't say that,
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.920]  but her audience knows what she means. Now the average American doesn't know what she
[13:21.920 --> 13:30.120]  means. The average American hears that and says, Wow, here's a radical Muslim who doesn't
[13:30.120 --> 13:35.720]  believe 9 11 happened or who doesn't believe the official narrative of 9 11. Well, yeah,
[13:35.720 --> 13:42.160]  we were lied to about 9 11. That's true. Doesn't take much research to learn that the official
[13:42.160 --> 13:49.760]  narrative of 9 11 is a bunch of bull Hickey. Oh, the biggest structure fire, the biggest
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.720]  skyscrapers, the only skyscrapers at that time ever come down from a fire. You had molten
[13:54.720 --> 14:01.160]  lava sitting at the base of the tower for two years. That's never happened before Oregon.
[14:01.160 --> 14:07.040]  But magically, the passports were preserved perfectly on top of the rubble. Oh yes, because
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.000]  that's how the world works. And that plane crash in Pennsylvania where there wasn't a
[14:12.000 --> 14:24.600]  plane and that plane crash in on the Pentagon, where again, you can't find a plane. Hmm.
[14:24.600 --> 14:37.680]  So Ilan Omar is right to insinuate that we've been lied to about 9 11. Absolutely. But now
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.800]  as an American, I have to realize what's happening on a larger issue. And again, this is what
[14:42.800 --> 14:49.440]  I've seen coming. The clash of civilizations, the clash of cultures between Jews and Muslims
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.760]  is now in the West, ladies and gentlemen. And guess what? You, the average American that
[14:54.760 --> 15:00.680]  has nothing to do with with Jews or nothing to do with Muslims, guess what? You're going
[15:00.680 --> 15:06.120]  to get tied up into it because you're going to be walking in Maryland one day and some
[15:06.120 --> 15:16.160]  radical Muslim is going to come up behind you in a truck and run you down. Again, the
[15:16.160 --> 15:24.400]  stories at info words dot com. A radical Islamic terrorist was planning a truck attack in Maryland
[15:24.400 --> 15:33.720]  to kill as many non Muslims as possible. Why? Because people like Ilhan Omar are here saying
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.240]  Muslims are losing their civil liberties because 9 11 was a lie. And in a certain aspect, she's
[15:39.240 --> 15:45.000]  right. But as an American, I see what comes on the other side of her approach to this.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.840]  And I lose my civil liberties because I've already lost my civil liberties. You see,
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.240]  I get groped in an anal probe every time I want to fly now. Thanks to 9 11. So we all
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.960]  lost our civil liberties on 9 11. Let's all figure out what happened. Maybe not today,
[16:00.960 --> 16:07.000]  not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're

[19:02.720 --> 19:07.560]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[19:07.560 --> 19:10.280]  you're bragging. It just gets old, man.
[19:10.280 --> 19:15.360]  I'm going to shut you down right now. We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you
[19:15.360 --> 19:20.360]  understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand
[19:20.360 --> 19:25.400]  I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean,
[19:25.400 --> 19:28.640]  what's it going to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[19:28.640 --> 19:29.640]  You know what, Alex?
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.920]  I'll put him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we
[19:34.920 --> 19:39.680]  are the tip of the spear? We're under attack. We need your help. As much begging as I do,
[19:39.680 --> 19:43.800]  we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not going to just stop growth
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.600]  and let them start pushing us backwards. Do you understand? I need your help, Frank.
[19:47.600 --> 19:49.880]  I need your help, Frank.

[20:18.720 --> 20:26.680]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now
[20:26.680 --> 20:32.080]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:32.080 --> 20:42.680]  This is a real difficult one, ladies and gentlemen, because right now the clash of cultures between
[20:42.680 --> 20:50.400]  Jews and Muslims is hitting the West, hitting America, which is a Christian nation, mind
[20:50.400 --> 20:57.840]  you. And so now Christian families in this Christian nation are about to have their lives
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.160]  impacted and their lives changed because of the clash of civilizations between Jews
[21:03.160 --> 21:09.640]  and Muslims. That's where this is headed. We've already had multiple, you're already
[21:09.640 --> 21:22.440]  having multiple radical Islamic terror attacks, not just happening in Europe but in the West.
[21:22.440 --> 21:35.280]  Really it all goes back to 9-11, though, where we relied to. We relied in the war. And what
[21:35.280 --> 21:44.320]  we were told happened was a bill of goods to send us into the Middle East, to destabilize
[21:44.320 --> 21:50.200]  enrich a bunch of people, bring in central banks, bring in regime change, control the
[21:50.200 --> 21:54.920]  new oil pipelines. It's pretty much all on record. It's all a joke. They do movies about
[21:54.920 --> 22:02.160]  it. So yeah, guess what? Then Obama gets elected, continues to bomb the Middle East
[22:02.160 --> 22:10.120]  for eight more years, more countries. You don't think those people want to kill the
[22:10.120 --> 22:14.760]  ones they feel are responsible, whether they think it's Jews or whether they think it's
[22:14.760 --> 22:26.240]  Americans. And so we have another radical terror threat just in Maryland. Islamic terrorists
[22:26.240 --> 22:35.280]  behind planned Maryland truck attack wanted to kill as many non-Muslims as possible.
[22:35.280 --> 22:39.680]  Now again, I'm going to play this clip one more time and then I'm going to bury this
[22:39.680 --> 22:45.200]  issue and maybe we bring it up later with phone calls. But listen to what Ilhan Omar
[22:45.200 --> 22:49.640]  said, and actually I think this was actually a couple weeks ago at an Islamic event. Listen
[22:49.640 --> 22:55.920]  to what she says because this is so key and we have to face this as Americans now before
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.240]  it gets worse, folks. Here's what Ilhan Omar said about 9-11.
[23:00.240 --> 23:10.200]  Care was founded after 9-11 because they recognized that some people did something. She means
[23:10.200 --> 23:17.800]  Jews. All of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. She means Muslims.
[23:17.800 --> 23:26.600]  And they now are bringing that war to the West, to America. So you better wake up, America.
[23:26.600 --> 23:30.680]  You better figure out what the hell happened on 9-11 or that's going to be used to bring
[23:30.680 --> 23:35.400]  the clash of civilizations from the Middle East with Jews and Muslims right here to
[23:35.400 --> 23:41.760]  your backyard. So if that's what you want, keep burying your head in the sand. But now
[23:41.760 --> 23:48.160]  all day long, all we're going to see is people pointing fingers at Ilhan Omar, people saying
[23:48.160 --> 23:53.880]  she's anti-Semitic. How about anti-Americans? Can we do something about all the anti-Americans
[23:53.880 --> 23:59.600]  in our government? I'm sick and damn tired of hearing about anti-Semites. How about
[23:59.600 --> 24:11.600]  anti-Americans? I'm American! And this is just like...
[24:11.600 --> 24:16.440]  But this is what you're going to hear. Back and forth, tit for tat. Jew, Muslim, Jew, Muslim.
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.200]  Ilhan Omar says Stephen Miller is a white nationalist. I think Stephen Miller is a great
[24:20.200 --> 24:27.560]  American. I think what he's doing for this country is great. Oh, but see, he's Jewish.
[24:27.560 --> 24:36.120]  And so these radical Muslims hate him. They blame the Jews for everything. They blame
[24:36.120 --> 24:42.920]  the Jews for 9-11, which then destabilized the Middle East with American intervention.
[24:42.920 --> 24:46.880]  They blame it all on the Jews. Do you know America has more Jews in it than any other
[24:46.880 --> 24:54.320]  country? Yeah. See what's going on, folks? You better wake up. So Ilhan Omar's right
[24:54.320 --> 25:01.560]  to insinuate that we were lied to about 9-11. We better make sure we're right in our response
[25:01.560 --> 25:11.680]  to what she says. Now, folks, here's the deal. It's because the way we approach and disseminate
[25:11.680 --> 25:16.600]  information is why we get banned and censored on such a mass scale. It's because we talk
[25:16.600 --> 25:21.360]  about inside jobs. It's because we talk about conspiracies. It's because we talk about
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.280]  government cover-ups. Who told you Russian collusion was all fake from the very beginning?
[25:26.280 --> 25:29.200]  Who told you they were going to plan something like the fake Russian collusion narrative?
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.200]  The night Trump was elected, InfoWars did. Now, I could go on and on and sit here and
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.280]  talk about how InfoWars is tomorrow's news today, but if you've been listening long enough,
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.240]  you already know that. But what you might not know is that we are the most censored
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.640]  news organization in the world, definitely in America. And I kind of have to laugh.
[25:50.640 --> 25:57.560]  And I don't know what's behind the humor I get from this, but every day you're seeing
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.880]  new conservatives get banned off YouTube. Other conservatives get banned off Facebook
[26:01.880 --> 26:06.360]  and this, that, or the other thing. And they make a big fuss about it. And I just kind
[26:06.360 --> 26:15.520]  of sit here and, and, and, and sip on my tea with my pinky raised, like, oh, oh, you've
[26:15.520 --> 26:24.960]  been banned now, have you? Oh, oh, you've been banned, have you? Well, I guess that's none
[26:24.960 --> 26:35.000]  of my business, is it? Oh, you mean everyone else is getting banned after InfoWars got banned?
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.320]  Wow. Who told you that was going to happen? Who warned you about that? What did you do
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.760]  then? Ah, what you did, you sipped your tea and you know what you said? That's none of
[26:44.760 --> 26:53.640]  my business. So you know what I'm doing now? Ah, it's none of my business. Now, I'm being
[26:53.640 --> 26:59.880]  a little facetious in that approach, obviously, because it is my business and it is all of
[26:59.880 --> 27:06.880]  our business that free speech is under attack. But I just, it's just funny to me. It's like
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.920]  people want to make this big. Oh my gosh, this YouTuber was censored. Oh my gosh, this
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.240]  YouTuber was censored. Oh my gosh, that person was kicked off Facebook. Like it's some breaking
[27:15.240 --> 27:23.360]  news. It's, and that's what it is. People tend to not care about what's happening until
[27:23.360 --> 27:27.080]  it hits their front door. So yeah, Alex Jones got centered. Most people didn't care. People
[27:27.080 --> 27:31.080]  don't tweet about info wars. People don't post about info wars. They're afraid to, oh
[27:31.080 --> 27:36.520]  Alex Jones, that guy, yeah, good band, whatever. Oh no, now my favorite person got banned. Oh
[27:36.520 --> 27:44.240]  no, now the person I've, oh no, no, I got banned. Oh, remember what happened to info wars?
[27:44.240 --> 27:57.280]  Oh, oh, that's none of my business. So, you know, it's, it's kind of just, I think the,
[27:57.280 --> 28:06.160]  the worldly, the worldly part of me that's just naturally human, just to kind of have
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.440]  a chip on my shoulder. And it's like, man, I got banned from YouTube and Facebook. You
[28:11.440 --> 28:17.080]  guys didn't say boo. Info wars got totally censored from live streaming on all these platforms.
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.440]  We're getting hit with everything. You guys didn't say boo. So, you know, I just, there's
[28:21.440 --> 28:24.840]  just a part of me that just kind of, like I said, picks up my glass and says, oh, you
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.760]  got censored too now. I guess that's none of my business. But no, I say that facetiously
[28:30.760 --> 28:35.800]  because we do all have to stand together against censorship, but we're able to exist and continue
[28:35.800 --> 28:41.280]  at info wars.com because of your supported info wars store.com. And that's the key here.

[32:00.400 --> 32:05.640]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us. They're always trying
[32:05.640 --> 32:11.720]  to make us feel small, to feel insignificant. They try to censor because they fear you and
[32:11.720 --> 32:17.200]  don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[32:17.200 --> 32:22.040]  They want you to believe you're powerless. But the truth is, it is we the people and
[32:22.040 --> 32:28.840]  our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world. We are
[32:28.840 --> 32:35.720]  the power structure. We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers. And the globalists
[32:35.720 --> 32:41.400]  understand that and they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal
[32:41.400 --> 32:46.480]  the future from we the people. Now, to help fund our operation, it's undoubtedly the very
[32:46.480 --> 32:50.320]  tip of the spear against these globalists. I want to encourage listeners and viewers
[32:50.320 --> 32:54.720]  to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have
[32:54.720 --> 32:59.240]  store-wide free shipping and 50% off infowarstore.com, something everybody should take advantage
[32:59.240 --> 33:24.240]  of.
[33:24.240 --> 33:45.200]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones show brought to you by infowarstore.com.
[33:45.200 --> 33:51.720]  Dan Lyman is going to be joining me at noon. He's got the latest story at Infowars Europe.
[33:51.720 --> 34:00.080]  Now, there is a new alliance forming with nationalists. And so he's going to be joining
[34:00.080 --> 34:08.720]  us at noon. And then Alex Jones is going to be coming on with us after that at 12.30.
[34:08.720 --> 34:18.960]  So that's coming up here shortly. In the meantime, let me just bear down and get into some of
[34:18.960 --> 34:26.960]  these stacks of news and kind of finish what I'm talking about with Omar. But you know,
[34:26.960 --> 34:36.160]  this is, honestly, it's a long time coming, folks, for us to face the music of 9-11 and
[34:36.160 --> 34:42.760]  the lies. And so you'll see the finger pointing at Jews, you'll see the finger pointing at
[34:42.760 --> 34:45.800]  Muslims, you'll see the finger pointing at Bush, you'll see all the finger pointing.
[34:45.800 --> 34:51.400]  It's all happening right now. And I want to be clear. I can't stand Ilhan Omar. When
[34:51.400 --> 34:59.200]  I see her, I see a snake. But if a snake tells you one plus one equals two, you have to give
[34:59.200 --> 35:05.000]  the snake credit. Snakes right. So when Ilhan Omar insinuates, we were lied to about 9-11.
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.240]  She's right. Now, when Ilhan Omar wants to bring radical Islam into the West, she's wrong.
[35:12.240 --> 35:19.160]  But that's who she is. So I'm just at a crossroads here. And you know, I apologize that I can't
[35:19.160 --> 35:24.520]  get over this. And I promise I'm going to. But it's just like, again, I can't stand Ilhan
[35:24.520 --> 35:33.280]  Omar. Please do not get me wrong. But I recognize that what she's doing, the conversation that
[35:33.280 --> 35:42.120]  she's spurring right now is long overdue. And I'm getting sick of something else, too.
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.840]  Because all I'm going to hear about now is how poor the Jews are. Oh, the poor Jews.
[35:47.840 --> 35:54.920]  Oh, the anti-Semites. I'm American. Israel's our ally. We have their back. It works fine.
[35:54.920 --> 36:00.120]  Jews assimilate. They get along in America. It's all good. But don't sit here and complain
[36:00.120 --> 36:08.320]  about anti-Semitism all day long when we've got anti-Americans in office. But again, this
[36:08.320 --> 36:14.960]  is all going to come to a head. And Ilhan Omar is spurring it. But all you're going
[36:14.960 --> 36:20.800]  to hear is, oh, who's she blaming? Oh, how could she say it's an inside job? Oh, it was
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.160]  Bush. Oh, it was the Jews. Oh, it was this. Oh, it was that. Well, let's actually maybe
[36:25.160 --> 36:30.200]  find out who it was. But if we're going to be so upset over anti-Semitism in Congress
[36:30.200 --> 36:38.160]  and make that a crime, what about anti-Americanism? You know, I'm getting sick and tired of this
[36:38.160 --> 36:43.520]  because they want the Democrats are now pushing for reparations for slavery. Do you realize
[36:43.520 --> 36:51.480]  that Americans, most Americans, A, didn't have slaves. B, Americans, white and skin
[36:51.480 --> 36:58.360]  color died during the Civil War. Should their families pay reparations because they fought
[36:58.360 --> 37:07.760]  to free slaves? It's all ridiculous. And it's all coming to a head at once, along with
[37:07.760 --> 37:13.080]  a series of other issues, the border being wide open, disease coming across the border,
[37:13.080 --> 37:26.160]  the Russian collusion narrative failing, the censorship, potential world war breaking out.
[37:26.160 --> 37:33.200]  President has his hands full, no doubt. He has to shut the border down. We're in a damn
[37:33.200 --> 37:40.480]  national emergency right now. The border needs to be shut down. This is a joke. This is a
[37:40.480 --> 37:55.960]  damn joke. But let me just focus here. Let me just focus here and get into the rest of
[37:55.960 --> 38:03.080]  this kind of cultural news here. Try to put the Ilhan Omar radical Islamic terror attack
[38:03.080 --> 38:16.840]  thwarted in Maryland thing behind me and move on to this from the ACLU. The ACLU breaking.
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.880]  We and partners have issued a travel advisory urging immigrants and people of color to use
[38:21.880 --> 38:29.120]  extreme caution when traveling in Florida. That's a real message from the ACLU. The
[38:29.120 --> 38:34.000]  state is on the verge of passing a draconian anti immigrant bill, which will endanger our
[38:34.000 --> 38:42.000]  communities. Do you realize the level of fake news right here from the ACLU? This is off
[38:42.000 --> 38:53.560]  the charts. Fake news. Travel advisory for immigrants. What in the hell are you talking?
[38:53.560 --> 39:05.240]  Oh, oh, oh. It says it's warning people of color against traveling in Florida. What the
[39:05.240 --> 39:11.280]  hell does that even mean? Don't go to Florida if you're black. Don't go to Florida if you're
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.360]  Latino. What are you joking? There's parts of Florida that are mostly Latino. There's
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.560]  parts of Florida that go, you know, they only speak Spanish. The state is on the verge of
[39:23.560 --> 39:27.920]  passing a draconian anti immigrant bill, which will endanger our communities and then no
[39:27.920 --> 39:32.840]  length of a bill, no quote from the bill, no text from the bill. They just say bill.
[39:32.840 --> 39:41.360]  Bill. Anti immigration bill. The ACLU. Anyone involved in it needs to be disbarred and the
[39:41.360 --> 39:51.600]  ACLU needs to be investigated into immediately to tweet this out and say immigrants and people
[39:51.600 --> 39:58.720]  of color need extreme caution when traveling in Florida. What are you insinuating? They're
[39:58.720 --> 40:08.160]  gonna pass an anti immigrant bill. No, they're not. I'm sick of the left lying about immigration.
[40:08.160 --> 40:17.040]  Illegal immigration is a thing. Do you realize the level of IQ that we have to go to now
[40:17.040 --> 40:24.760]  to debate these people? I literally have to use this as an argument. Illegal immigration
[40:24.760 --> 40:36.480]  is a thing. Yeah. Yeah. These people are breaking the law, but they don't. They never say illegal
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.120]  immigrant. They say immigration. And so then they conflate the two and then they point
[40:41.120 --> 40:46.800]  the finger and they say, see your anti immigrant. Well, no, you're the one that conflated illegal
[40:46.800 --> 40:53.680]  immigration with immigration. I'm pro immigration. Conservatives are pro immigration. Republicans
[40:53.680 --> 40:59.400]  are pro immigration. Democrats are anti immigration. They're anti immigrant. They're the ones
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.960]  that want non citizens to skip the line and cheat the system. Even Bernie Sanders gets
[41:05.960 --> 41:13.760]  it. Even Bernie Sanders says we can't have an open border and a welfare state. Oh my
[41:13.760 --> 41:22.640]  gosh, Bernie Sanders was right. Yeah, Bernie was right. You got to close the border. If
[41:22.640 --> 41:29.680]  you're going to have a welfare state. And so I went out, we'll air this later, but I
[41:29.680 --> 41:33.560]  went to the Democrat headquarters for the second straight day in a row, a different
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.520]  one here. There's two in Austin. I got sworn number three. I'm having like a Mandela effect
[41:37.520 --> 41:43.960]  here, but I went wearing a Bernie hat because Bernie just said it the other day. We can't
[41:43.960 --> 41:46.960]  have wide open borders and a welfare state. If we have open borders, the welfare state
[41:46.960 --> 41:50.000]  will collapse. So we have to close the borders. And if we're going to have this welfare state,
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.640]  he's right. So I put on my Bernie Sanders hat. I went to the Democrat headquarters as
[41:53.640 --> 41:58.520]  a Bernie supporter, brought them some avocados as a gift. And I said, can we end human trafficking
[41:58.520 --> 42:03.800]  at the border? Can we, can we shut down the border? I was kicked out. So maybe we'll just
[42:03.800 --> 42:09.320]  air that on the other side since I'm teasing it now. But, but look at this. Morgan Freeman
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.320]  tweets this out. We are witnessing the deliberate reincarnation of Adolf Hitler right before
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.560]  our eyes and Stephen Miller, who will stop at nothing to preserve some BS pure white
[42:18.560 --> 42:23.000]  bloodline. We should be very scared and must stop Trump from empowering this evil and hateful
[42:23.000 --> 42:32.440]  man. He just compared a Jew to Hitler. Morgan, dude, like you're a great actor. Are you?
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.120]  Has Morgan Freeman lost his mind? I feel bad for the guy. I think maybe he's lost his mind
[42:36.120 --> 42:46.400]  in old age folks. He's now comparing Stephen Miller, a Jew to Adolf Hitler. You know,
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.760]  it's almost impossible to find sanity in this world anymore because the left is just injecting
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.920]  so much insanity. You have to try to clear the dust before you can even say something
[42:56.920 --> 42:59.280]  that makes sense.

[47:03.440 --> 47:10.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:46.380 --> 47:47.260]  well, busy day today, big news day, big day on the hill. You've got William
[47:47.260 --> 47:53.160]  Barr testifying Democrats grilling and bring up fake news. He's literally rolling his
[47:53.160 --> 47:59.200]  eyes, laughing at them. I mean, it's a pathetic joke. These Democrats and Oh, Eric Swalwell
[47:59.200 --> 48:06.960]  is running for president. Did you hear he's going to nuke us? That's his campaign. Swalwell
[48:06.960 --> 48:13.880]  nuke them good for president. But no, so Candace Owens is on the hill testifying. William
[48:13.880 --> 48:19.600]  Barr is on the hill testifying. But you know, it's funny. And Candace is doing a great job
[48:19.600 --> 48:25.360]  today. She's trending on Twitter. It's funny. Candace Owens gets invited to testify on
[48:25.360 --> 48:31.520]  the hill, but they won't invite Alex Jones. Isn't that odd? Candace Owens isn't the one
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.120]  that's being censored across every platform. Candace Owens isn't the one that they have
[48:35.120 --> 48:40.440]  hearings on asking if they have the right to free speech. No, that's Alex Jones. Why
[48:40.440 --> 48:48.520]  isn't Alex invited to Congress? Why doesn't Alex get to testify? Well, good for Candace
[48:48.520 --> 48:54.560]  Owens. I'm glad that she's able to get through the system. And so she's on the hill testifying
[48:54.560 --> 49:03.000]  today. But that's good for the left to put her on trial like that. A black woman. The
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.920]  ones that they claim to stand for. They claim to be for women. They claim to be for black
[49:07.920 --> 49:15.360]  people. But oh, Candace Owens likes Trump will destroy her. We'll get her. Bring her
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.360]  on the hill. She can't. She's a young 29 year old. She doesn't have a chance against us
[49:20.360 --> 49:27.280]  Democrat Congressman. Oh, no, she's smarter than we thought. I immediately regret this
[49:27.280 --> 49:35.480]  decision. See, but that's why they don't invite Alex Jones. See, they probably assumed that
[49:35.480 --> 49:39.720]  they could walk all over Candace Owens and outsmart her. Maybe they assumed she had like
[49:39.720 --> 49:46.800]  a occasional cortex level IQ. No, but, but, but here's the thing though. It's not even
[49:46.800 --> 49:52.600]  about IQ Candace Owens. I mean, she's smart, but, but definitely she's just real. She just
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.560]  has real ideas. She has real things. And so it doesn't even matter how smart she is. She's
[49:57.560 --> 50:04.480]  just not a fraud. So of course she's going to have victory. Oh, oh, I need to correct
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.560]  myself by the way. I fake news myself last segment. I apologize to Morgan Freeman, the
[50:09.560 --> 50:16.080]  actor, even though I don't agree with his politics, but the tweet was not Morgan Freeman,
[50:16.080 --> 50:22.120]  the actor. It was Morgan Freeman, the leftist activist. So I do apologize to the actor for
[50:22.120 --> 50:27.840]  falsely labeling this tweet as his. It was actually Morgan J. Freeman. Oh, pull this
[50:27.840 --> 50:37.400]  guy's Twitter account. Who is this guy? Who is this douchebag? Morgan J. Freeman, filmmaker,
[50:37.400 --> 50:47.080]  V producer, husband, activist, father, fear supposer of Trump, 11th street productions,
[50:47.080 --> 50:56.080]  fear supposer of Trump. This guy just, this guy just compared a Jew to Hitler. Wow. Morgan
[50:56.080 --> 51:03.480]  J. Freeman. In fact, I'd like to invite Morgan on the show right now. Morgan J. Freeman.
[51:03.480 --> 51:07.240]  I would love to have you on the Alex Jones show to explain to me how Stephen Miller is
[51:07.240 --> 51:14.960]  like Adolf Hitler. I would love to hear you. I would love to hear you try to explain that
[51:14.960 --> 51:27.680]  in so many words. You douchebag. You'll never come on. You coward. You fraud. We are witnessing
[51:27.680 --> 51:34.280]  the deliberate reincarnation of Adolf Hitler right before our eyes in Stephen Miller, who
[51:34.280 --> 51:38.760]  will stop at nothing to preserve some BS pure white bloodline since winter Jews, white people.
[51:38.760 --> 51:44.960]  Like when did that even happen? I mean, fine, whatever. I don't care. But it's just like
[51:44.960 --> 51:48.080]  Jews used to not be considered white people. Now they're considered white people. So Stephen
[51:48.080 --> 51:54.400]  Miller is now a white nationalist, a white supremacist, trying to preserve the white
[51:54.400 --> 52:06.480]  bloodline. No, you jack leg. He's trying to preserve the border. Wow. Wow. The left knows
[52:06.480 --> 52:16.120]  no bounds to their hatred and bigotry. Pita. All right, now a little humorous antidote
[52:16.120 --> 52:20.680]  for you. Pita tweets us out. Have you ever really thought about it? And of course, the
[52:20.680 --> 52:26.480]  answer would be no, but Pita apparently did. Touch tanks encourage children to touch other
[52:26.480 --> 52:33.640]  people's bodies without their consent. The stories at PitaKids.com. Oh, thank God, Pita.
[52:33.640 --> 52:41.880]  Oh, have you ever really thought about it? No. No, Pita. We haven't really thought about
[52:41.880 --> 52:49.280]  it. We're not delusional like you. Pita, have you ever really thought about it? Touch tanks
[52:49.280 --> 52:53.680]  encourage children to touch other people's bodies without their consent. No, Pita. You're
[52:53.680 --> 52:57.720]  the sick freaks that thought about it. You know what we think about? Wow. This is a cool
[52:57.720 --> 53:04.000]  mind expanding experience for a kid to touch a manta ray. Wow. This is a cool mind experience
[53:04.000 --> 53:10.720]  for a kid to pet a living creature, a sea creature. Wow. This is so cool. Look at how
[53:10.720 --> 53:14.960]  much fun the kids are having at the petting zoo, feeding the goats and petting the donkeys
[53:14.960 --> 53:20.040]  and the llamas. Wow. It's so fun. Look at my kids holding that rabbit, petting it. Oh,
[53:20.040 --> 53:24.920]  my gosh. What a great time. I'll remember this for the rest of my life. What a great
[53:24.920 --> 53:28.800]  experience it was taking my kids to the petting zoo. That's how the average person thinks.
[53:28.800 --> 53:34.840]  But you know how Pita thinks? Do you have that animal's consent? Did you get that manta
[53:34.840 --> 53:43.040]  rays consent before you touched it? I just saw your kid petting a goat. Was that sexual
[53:43.040 --> 53:49.480]  in nature? Have you ever thought about that? I was just thinking about it. See, I'm Pita
[53:49.480 --> 53:55.800]  and what I think about is sex when your kid is touching an animal because I'm Pita. See,
[53:55.800 --> 54:01.200]  now have you ever really thought about it? That's rape. Your kid just raped that manta
[54:01.200 --> 54:08.000]  ray. You see, I'm Pita and this is the kind of stuff I think about. I'm a good leftist
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.760]  activist group. I'm called Pita. Rhymes with Pita because I think about kids touching animals
[54:14.760 --> 54:20.040]  and I consider it rape because that's where mine goes. My mind goes here at Pita. Your
[54:20.040 --> 54:25.480]  mind just thinks, wow, the kids are having a good time learning about animals and biology
[54:25.480 --> 54:30.480]  and life. Well, what the hell is wrong with you? Don't you know that's rape? You see,
[54:30.480 --> 54:34.120]  I'm Pita and I'm going to make sure that all these kids at the petting zoo are going to
[54:34.120 --> 54:41.960]  stop raping manta rays. I mean, what the hell is wrong with these people, man? That's where
[54:41.960 --> 54:50.920]  the average Pita mind goes. Why am I not surprised? Why am I not surprised? But I guess from
[54:50.920 --> 54:59.720]  now on, you know, Joe Biden, the Joe Biden petting zoo is going to have to be shut down.
[54:59.720 --> 55:07.880]  I know. I know. It's real sad. Yeah, yeah, Joe, it's okay. It's okay, Joe, but we have
[55:07.880 --> 55:17.120]  to shut down. We have to shut down Joe Biden petting zoo. Yeah. I know, Joe, I know it's
[55:17.120 --> 55:27.360]  tough. But you heard Pita, it's rape. You never thought about that man raised consent,
[55:27.360 --> 55:39.040]  Joe. What a joke. What a joke. The Joe Biden two way petting zoo. Oh God. Yeah, you get
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.880]  a little peanut butter too. You know what I mean? All right. Okay. Let's let's pump
[55:44.880 --> 55:51.240]  the brakes on that. All right. Moving on. The boy crisis statistics tell us that American
[55:51.240 --> 55:57.120]  boys are falling behind in just about every area. Well, this is a pretty obvious one.
[55:57.120 --> 56:05.120]  When they start giving participation awards, you kill that competitive edge that boys tend
[56:05.120 --> 56:11.360]  to have more than girls, not to say girls don't have it. Trust me, they do. Me and my sister
[56:11.360 --> 56:17.960]  were very competitive growing up. It's just boys tend to be more vicious when it comes
[56:17.960 --> 56:25.440]  to physical competitiveness. And then it's those experiences that build so many other
[56:25.440 --> 56:30.960]  characteristics in boys. But when you eliminate that competitive edge at a young age, which
[56:30.960 --> 56:39.720]  is like initiation process, you know, because, you know, the young kids aren't going to war.
[56:39.720 --> 56:44.040]  They're not training to fight. Most kids, you know, most kids aren't learning how to survive
[56:44.040 --> 56:50.120]  on the streets. Obviously, you do have that in some parts of America. But, you know, so
[56:50.120 --> 56:55.840]  they don't have any of that. So they play sports. And that's a way to kind of, you know,
[56:55.840 --> 57:00.800]  have that initiation of physical activity and then competitiveness, competing against
[57:00.800 --> 57:07.400]  others and having the camaraderie and even the tribalism in a certain way. I mean, you're
[57:07.400 --> 57:10.640]  wearing a jersey. You're playing other people from different places or whatever wearing
[57:10.640 --> 57:17.600]  a different color jersey. So there are different character building experiences in that. But
[57:17.600 --> 57:23.880]  now boys are falling behind in all areas because there's no point in competing anymore. So yeah,
[57:23.880 --> 57:30.560]  when you're a young kid and the, in fact, the crazy thing too is now with some of these
[57:30.560 --> 57:36.120]  sporting events, you'll find kids playing harder just like at a rec league or in the
[57:36.120 --> 57:40.280]  streets or something. Then they will an actual league play because in league play, there's
[57:40.280 --> 57:46.320]  no reward for actually playing hard. You see, everybody wins now. It's a tie, even though
[57:46.320 --> 57:51.960]  you won, you see? So now boys are losing. Getting your protein has never been easier

[58:47.320 --> 58:55.520]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is. But
[58:55.520 --> 59:01.440]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than
[59:01.440 --> 59:07.040]  it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body,
[59:07.040 --> 59:11.280]  heart, the cleanest, the best out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults,
[59:11.280 --> 59:14.480]  you've got the krill oil. If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the
[59:14.480 --> 59:18.360]  children's are really strong. They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best
[59:18.360 --> 59:21.840]  and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't
[59:21.840 --> 59:26.480]  get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view, I'm not a medical
[59:26.480 --> 59:30.160]  statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five canteens of krill oil before I
[59:30.160 --> 59:34.240]  go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[59:34.240 --> 59:43.160]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit
[59:43.160 --> 59:47.040]  off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't
[59:47.040 --> 59:53.440]  lie to you. I just can't do it.
[59:53.440 --> 01:00:04.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:11.560]  Center and the heart of the resistance. And now your host, Owen Troyer. Dan Lyman is going
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:21.880]  to join us in the next segment. In the meantime, the Democrat primary process is, boy, it's
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:28.200]  going to be fun watching these Democrats implode and then try to eat each other. But what's
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:34.400]  even more pathetic is the list of Democrats right now. So we're going to look at a couple
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:43.480]  of these here. Eric Swalwell. Let's go ahead and look at Eric Swalwell's presidential
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.880]  bid announcement.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:52.880]  The promise of America, no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love, who
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.480]  you worship, if you work hard, you do better for yourself and you look at your kids and
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.520]  dream bigger for the future. That's the promise. I think our country needs new energy, new ideas
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520]  and a new confidence.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.240]  Eric Swalwell, man who represents the town where I grew up.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]  Are you going to run for president?
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]  Running for president.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240]  You're going to run for president.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.240]  Running for president.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.360]  Are you running for president?
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:18.680]  I'm ready to solve these problems. I'm running for president of the United States. Go big.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.680]  Be bold. Do good.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680]  It's official.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.680]  Now it's official.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.680]  It's important to feel good to say that.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.680]  Now it's official.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680]  Congratulations.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680]  Congratulations.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:36.280]  Wow. And every dollar Swalwell raises will be a waste of money because that guy has as
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.600]  much chance as I do to be the president and I'm not even running.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.840]  Now let's go to this clip of Beto. He had another event and apparently the Beto attendee
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840]  didn't even recognize him.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.200]  I haven't seen this video yet, but I guess it comes from the men's bathroom or Beto
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.600]  was in the bathroom and the people in the bathroom at his event didn't even recognize
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]  that it was him.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.400]  So I guess when he's not up on the stage standing on a desk or riding a skateboard or flopping
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:11.440]  his arms around like a wacky waving inflatable tube man, I guess they don't recognize him
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.560]  or trying to feed his wife human crap.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:18.240]  But here is Beto talking about that encounter.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.120]  And to my friend Matt, who I met in the men's room as we were washing hands and he said
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.440]  are you here to see Beto and I said yes I am.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.160]  So thank you for being here.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160]  Thank you for being here.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160]  I was wearing the hat.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.160]  You couldn't tell.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.080]  His own supporters don't even recognize him.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.560]  I mean that is Beto's charm.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.720]  You gotta give him credit.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.960]  He does present himself as the average guy, as just one of you, that's why he's out in
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.840]  the bathroom washing his hands next to his supporters.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840]  But he's a total fraud.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.440]  He doesn't want to win.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.840]  He'll make $100 million campaigning and well I don't know, I don't know, I mean he couldn't
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.920]  be Trump but I just don't know what the Democrats are going to do right now.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.640]  They're obviously not going to go with Sanders, in fact here's the deal because Dan Lyman
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.880]  is about to join me.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:20.440]  I figured out Bernie Sanders and the guy is actually pretty smart now in his old age.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:28.680]  You see Bernie Sanders has figured out the perfect way to enrich himself via the political
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.080]  system without breaking the law.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.880]  So here's a lifetime independent.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:39.640]  He's always been independent, not a Democrat, but what he does is he runs for president
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.000]  as a Democrat because that's where the big money's at.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.920]  That's what'll get the attention on mainstream news but then he knows he can run as a Democrat,
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:55.640]  get the big donors, get the big attention, get big money but he knows because he's not
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.400]  actually a Democrat they'll never nominate him.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.840]  So he can run and run and run and reap all the benefits of all the donations and all
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.440]  the cash and never actually have to worry about winning.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.880]  It's the perfect crime.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.280]  Bernie Sanders has figured out the perfect political crime.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:23.320]  An independent who runs as a Democrat, very popular, raises a bunch of money, has a big
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.360]  fuss but then when the rubber meets the road he's never there because he knows he's
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.280]  not a Democrat and so the Democrats will never nominate him.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.140]  And I think we're about to find that out again.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.120]  So there was already a lawsuit filed last year by Bernie Sanders supporters against
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.920]  Bernie Sanders and the DNC.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.240]  Are we going to see round two this year when Bernie Sanders screws his supporters over
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:52.480]  for the second straight presidential election and the Democrats select God knows what loser,
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.480]  Harris, Beto, whoever they are.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.760]  Dan Lyman joins me on the other side.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.120]  We got news out of Europe.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:03.720]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.960]  you are changing the world.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.680]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globless.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.480]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bully, that stood against
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.200]  the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.000]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.080]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.160]  go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.040]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:45.600]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.000]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:32.200]  The most censored news broadcast in the world here and we're able to exist and be effective.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.800]  Thanks to your support at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.880]  It really is key and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it, folks.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.920]  I've been banned off Facebook and YouTube.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.500]  My last bastion is Twitter.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.800]  I hope they don't ban me there, but my fingers aren't crossed on that.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:55.120]  And so if that's the case, I'm going to be left with just InfoWars.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:02.560]  And so I thank you for supporting us at InfoWars.com because it ensures me to still do my work on
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.080]  Twitter despite the threat of the censorship being kicked off there because I know you
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.720]  will continue to support us at InfoWars.com so that I know I'll always have the platform
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720]  of InfoWars.

[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.400]  And I got some other events planned because I know that they're going to eventually probably
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.800]  either want to ban me, ban me, or they're already shadow banning me.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:08.240]  But I realize that risk of being kneecapped, but I have the safety net of InfoWars thanks
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240]  to your support at InfoWars.store.com.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.320]  So I appreciate you at InfoWars.store.com.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:20.040]  And also, when you shop at InfoWars.store.com, it allows us to expand and hire new reporters,
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.560]  writers, crew, build new studios, everything.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.960]  And one of the great reporters that's been part of this expansion journey for the last
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.120]  two years is Dan Lyman.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.880]  And Dan Lyman has the story right now.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:37.680]  In fact, really, there's a bunch of, I'm literally grabbing my whole stack here, of world news
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.280]  that we can get into with Dan Lyman.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.760]  But the big story that he's got right now at InfoWars Europe, Salvini forging pan-European
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.080]  populist alliance.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:53.560]  Now, Dan, I think that this is something long overdue, a nationalist alliance.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.000]  And I think that there's some other potential candidates outside of Europe, but this could
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.400]  be kind of a spark plug for a new ideology when it comes to forming these international
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.600]  alliances.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.880]  And that's nationalism to say, hey, we're going to take care of our country first, but
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.880]  we're fellow journeymen in that commitment, and we still want to have an international
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]  world market.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.360]  But we're going to make sure that we put our countries first.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.840]  And so tell us, what is forming right now?
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.320]  They're calling it the League of Leagues, and Salvini out of Italy is the figurehead
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.800]  of it right now.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.520]  What is forming right now in Europe?
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.360]  Good to be back with you all, and yeah, we have a League of Leagues coming together.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.480]  And that's actually something that Salvini called it about a year ago.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.720]  I would say they're probably not calling it that formally at this time.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:46.640]  But he did basically foreshadow his plans to bring together all the different nationalist
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.600]  populist groups across Europe.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:55.200]  Of course, the mainstream media is selling it as far right groups, anti-immigrant groups.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.280]  But basically, these are parties such as Alternative for Deutschland, which is one of the largest
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.640]  parties now in Germany.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.520]  We have the Finns in Finland, which is growing ever more powerful by the day, the Danish People's
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.200]  Party, also one of the largest, if not the largest party in Denmark, and of course, the
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.320]  League in Italy, which Salvini fronts, and they have only gotten more popular as Salvini
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]  has been in office.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.400]  The last check that I saw that they were pulling at about 32% popularity.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:32.520]  The next closest would be his compatriot, his fellow co-deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Demayo,
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.880]  who heads the five-star movement, which is declining in popularity in Italy.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:43.400]  So, the League is holding strong, and about a year ago, Salvini said he was hoping to
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.040]  make a League of Leagues across Europe and find these different movements together, even
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.440]  though they don't all see eye-to-eye on specific issues.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.360]  But in general, it is for a common sense Europe is what he is selling it as.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.480]  And this is not like common sense gun laws in the US, which of course are not common
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480]  sense.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.640]  It is a common sense immigration reform, security as a priority, and anti-globalism,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:13.240]  putting the sovereign state above the super state of the EU, which of course, the globalists
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.760]  are not excited about.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.960]  Well, and that seems to be the link that brings the countries together on this, is the immigration
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960]  issue.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:29.280]  There was a study that just came out of the UK, Britons in every demographic group want
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:35.160]  immigration reduced, so it doesn't matter what your background is, demographics, they
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.840]  all want immigration reduced.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.720]  Of course, they voted for Brexit too, they don't get that.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:44.240]  But it seems that that's kind of the linchpin holding this whole thing together, is they're
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.720]  just sick of having open borders.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:52.760]  So that seems to be kind of where the struggle is with groups like NATO and the UN.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.820]  They want open borders, flood European countries, flood First World countries with all of these
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:03.800]  Third World refugees, we can talk about what may be on the back end of that or what might
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.800]  be the motive of that.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.960]  But that's the agenda, flood the First World with the Third World, and so the new counter
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.600]  balance to that, if you will, is countries saying no, we're not going to have wide open
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600]  borders.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.320]  No, we're not going to let the Third World rush into our countries and make us the Third
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]  World.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.520]  Is that kind of what's bringing this and what's really spearheading this?
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:31.320]  100%, that is the number one issue in Europe, poll after poll, country after country, it
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.160]  is the top issues are immigration and related terrorism.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.520]  If you look at polling that is conducted last year or the year before there was done, they
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.920]  did 10,000 residents of Europe and they did 10 different countries.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.520]  The number one issue in every single country was immigration and number two in most of
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.040]  these countries was terrorism.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:56.960]  And now terrorism, of course, is not as big of an issue as you might believe it to be,
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.800]  the number of actual recognized terrorist attacks are not high in number.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.560]  However, they're much higher number than they used to be and most of the time they carried
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.760]  out by people from the Third World, we had a situation in Italy just a few weeks ago,
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.520]  I believe Paul Joseph Watson covered this, where an African migrant who for some reason
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:20.880]  was allowed to drive a bus full of children back from, he was a school bus driver, I guess,
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.680]  or a field trip driver.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.640]  And he basically was angry about the fact that Salvini and the Italians have clamped
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:33.440]  down on Mediterranean crossings from Africa and he took this entire bus hostage, he bound
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.480]  all the children and also the counselors and told them that they weren't going to live
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.080]  to see the end of the day and he tried to set the bus on fire eventually.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.280]  And one of the children was able to break out and free everyone and they were able to call
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.040]  the police, but this is what migration is brought to Europe and Italy and of course Salvini
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.720]  is now leading the charge back out of this unfortunate situation that Europe is in.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.120]  Well and that story you just mentioned out in Italy, most people never even heard of
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.840]  it and we're lucky, I don't remember how many kids were on that bus, I think it was like
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.120]  50 kids, we're lucky 50 kids didn't die by a flaming bus incident by a terrorist out
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.240]  there, but this is what they're dealing with in Europe, there was also a story here in
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.920]  the west where you had in Maryland a radical Muslim wanted to engage in a truck attack
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.760]  and kill as many non-Muslims as possible.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.720]  So this is going on, but I mean when I look at some of the news, you know, you don't just
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:37.760]  have this forming in Europe right now, this comes out of RT, Bolsonaro says Brazil and
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.080]  the West focusing on creating rift within Venezuela army to Aos Maduro, so that's kind
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.440]  of what's going on as far as the geopolitical stuff, but it seems to me that in the west
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.760]  you have the potential for kind of a legal leagues too with the United States, with Brazil,
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.240]  with Columbia, with maybe new leadership coming out of Argentina.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:01.240]  So Europe could end up being a catalyst for spurring something similar in the west.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.720]  Absolutely, you know, everyone was looking first to Brexit, then to Trump and this started
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.720]  the basically the ball rolling and now that it's just washing across the west, especially
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.660]  in Europe at this time, we've seen the Trump movement has been plotting along at this point
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:23.520]  and you know, we will hopefully continue past Trump, you know, the MAGA movement in general.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.240]  But now people are really looking as to what is going on in Europe and seeing how the Europeans
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.240]  going to handle this, what we know who's going to rise up and I think it's definitely showing
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.200]  to be Salvini at this time is the man in Europe along with the Prime Minister of Hungary, Victor
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.920]  Orban and of course the Brexit movement in the U.S.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.920]  And Macron, is Macron still hiding in a cave?
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.680]  Macron is just doing his thing.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.720]  He has somehow survived up until now.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720]  I don't know how.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.160]  He's literally like hiding in like a storm shelter.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.720]  You don't even hear from the guy anymore.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.920]  We'll be right back.

[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.160]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.720]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.680]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.120]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.640]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.400]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:22.000]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.920]  popular like it's always been.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.880]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.760]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.280]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.720]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.320]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.240]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.160]  done because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.120]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:04.160]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:10.800]  there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:19.440]  and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.320]  like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.240]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:32.080]  They don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.680]  and others are trying to shut Infowars down.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.760]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.200]  sovereignty away.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.480]  This country is in a war.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.280]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done but I want to remind you, if you don't
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.680]  spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great products we have
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.000]  and fund us and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  I'm in your hands.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  You're in my hands.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  Thank you.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:24.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:32.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, brought to you by Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.840]  So Candace Owens is now testifying on the Hill.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.760]  Candace Owens is a black lady.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:44.440]  She's now being forced to testify about how she's not a white nationalist.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:52.360]  This is the level of political commentary we have reached in Washington, D.C., a black
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:59.440]  woman on the Hill testifying how she's not a white nationalist.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.160]  What's next, America?
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.160]  What's next?
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.960]  They'll probably say that Trump colluded with Russia to win the election.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.320]  Oh, they already did that.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.480]  Well, they'll probably stage some hate crime and blame Trump's wife.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.840]  Oh, oh, they already did that too.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.440]  Well, they'll probably blame a bunch of young men, say they're racist for winning in Trump.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.640]  They did that too?
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.640]  My goodness.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.480]  Where were the madness of these people stopped?
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480]  Dan Lyman is with me.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:32.480]  He's got the story we just covered in the last segment, Salvini forging Pan-European populist
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:40.360]  alliance, a nationalist alliance with powers in Europe, which could lead the way for people
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.920]  in the West to follow suit.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:49.240]  But there's some other world news happening right now, Dan, that I wanted to get your opinion
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.600]  on.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:58.360]  And with all the clash of civilization we're seeing happening right now, there's a lot
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.200]  of developments.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.000]  Donald Trump basically says, Iran, you're a bunch of terrorists.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.280]  Iran responds, convening with chance of death to America.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.880]  You've got the reselection, I would imagine, of BB Netanyahu happening right now.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.440]  I don't expect him to lose.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:22.040]  So I don't think that issue is going anywhere, and I mean, this is a build-up right now.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.480]  And Iran in the Middle East with Israel, that is getting worse.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.400]  Now who knows, that fighting could happen in the Golan Heights.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.640]  It doesn't seem that it's gotten too bad there right now.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:37.080]  But you've also got Venezuela, where China and Russia have moved in on Venezuela, and
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.800]  the United States is kind of sitting back waiting to figure what the next move is for
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:47.840]  our interest, but Dan, just kind of as an overall, I mean, where do you think the world
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.480]  is at right now geopolitically?
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.280]  I mean, are these things going to go the wrong way?
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:56.960]  Are we looking at inevitable wars, or are these things going to get worked out?
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.760]  And maybe we're looking at a more peace than we would have ever expected.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.520]  I mean, how do you think this is going to go?
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.360]  Your guess is as good as mine as to how it's going to go, because things do seem quite
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.960]  volatile, and there is such a massive shift taking place, and there are so many different
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:19.520]  factions that are trying to strengthen their grip on power, if not grow it.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.400]  Personally, I'm not of the interventionist type.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:27.360]  I wouldn't like to see us go into Venezuela, or Iran, or get involved in any of that.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.240]  I'd like to see us just sit back.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.160]  But I do think that diplomatic pressure is fine.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160]  That's great.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.240]  I think that Trump, basically denouncing Maduro in many different ways, is effective, and
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.680]  I think that that's a good thing.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.800]  I don't think that I'd like to see us sending any troops there personally.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:48.080]  I think we've had enough foreign intervention to last many lifetimes.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.000]  So your guess is as good as mine as to how it plays out, though, because it's all going
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.240]  to matter who Trump listens to.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.960]  But it is interesting that all the generals at this point that were kind of surrounding
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.880]  him early in the administration are kind of, they're gone now at this point.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.040]  So we'll see how it plays out from here moving forward.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:10.280]  Yeah, and of course, Bolton, the war mustache is still in there.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.280]  He's never seen a war.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.800]  He didn't want to send somebody to die in, but we'll see if that's the guy that has
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.800]  the final say.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]  Hopefully not.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.560]  Again, John Bolton, he's never seen a war.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.320]  He'd like to see someone else die in.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.520]  But this is just kind of the geopolitical struggle that's now moving into the West with
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.320]  Venezuela kind of being the tipping point, I think, for either American intervention
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:36.000]  and then either a further struggle with China and or Russia who have already moved in.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.880]  There's some other news developing right now in the West, Dan, you're over there in Europe
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.000]  covering news for Info Wars Europe.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.280]  But are you seeing what's happening right now at the southern border?
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:55.680]  Because I know that you're obviously following this, but it's reaching new proportions of
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.400]  desperation every day.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:03.160]  I mean, is this because to me, this is the number one topic for Americans, quite frankly,
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.960]  is the border crisis.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.560]  Is this something, I mean, because we talk about Europe's borders all the time here in
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560]  America.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:12.800]  Do Europeans talk about America's borders and what's happening here?
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:13.800]  Sure.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:19.280]  To an extent, you know, it's just I'm out on these variety of islands that are owned
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.320]  by Portugal kind of out in the middle of nowhere at the moment and have just encountered some
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.080]  various different interesting things.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:32.480]  But I did encounter a guy from Venezuela who is now living in Portugal, and he's very
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.960]  up on what's going on in America, big Trump supporter, which was quite surprising.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.320]  He actually just lived 30 years in Germany.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.800]  And the first thing out of his mouth was I had to get out of there.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.480]  It is totally Islamized and it's Germany is toast was what he was saying, but he was
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.440]  definitely in tune with what's going on at the US border, southern border.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.320]  And I've been covering what's been going on at the border as well.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.880]  I find it disconcerting just that how little is being done right now and that it seems
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.320]  like nothing is making anything better and no one's making any move to make anything better.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.920]  And as soon as, you know, Trump opens his mouth, it's, you know, the MSM comes down
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.280]  on him so hard.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.280]  And it's just it's so obviously such a monumental crisis.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.440]  And you have the now he's the acting border patrol chief and he was formerly commissioner
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.600]  of ICE, I believe recently, Kevin Macalene and he said that the system has reached the
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.600]  breaking point.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.480]  And that was a couple of weeks ago.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.680]  And at this point, you know, we're seeing that over 50%, something like 55% according
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.560]  to officials of these people that are coming to the border are just being released into
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.060]  the United States.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:45.120]  It's a we are a laughing stock at this point and Central and Americans know that and that's
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.280]  why they are charging the border at this time.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.600]  It's worse than it was even under Obama, which is just shocking.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.560]  But you have to wonder who is behind this, who's orchestrating this.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.360]  And I think we have some good ideas as to who's providing these people with the organization
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:05.320]  that they need to travel so rapidly at times and in such large numbers to, to get to our
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.400]  southern border and then just penetrate at will.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.040]  Well, and I'm not even sure if you saw this story, but you're more right than you realize.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.640]  Human smugglers, you know, coyotes are literally laughing at us right now.
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.160]  The story is from the American mirror.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.560]  Miller taunts never been easier to sneak illegals into the United States.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:33.200]  And so now Cubans are seeing this and now Cubans are forming migrant caravans to try
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.800]  to come here and seek asylum.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.360]  So like you said, it's really a laughing stock.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.440]  And anybody who wants to come in here realizes, okay, well, we figured out the loopholes.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.600]  We figured out how to do it.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.760]  They're just going to let us in and give us everything we'll shoot our guys.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.520]  I guess we might as well go, but, you know, you asked or you said, you're not sure if
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.240]  there's any positive momentum.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:01.160]  I'm hoping that Kevin Macalenean, who comes from the Border Patrol, who comes from CBP,
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.240]  hopefully he'll get in there and actually do the things that that that Nielsen did
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.040]  not do.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040]  I hope so too.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.280]  There was, so there's been some conflicting feedback as to what, you know, whose side Macalenean
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280]  is on.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.560]  We had yesterday, former director of ICE, Thomas Holman said he gave him his full endorsement,
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.120]  said he'll be great for the job.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.800]  But then we had a retired sheriff from Arizona, Paul Babbo, who has been on Fox all the time
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.400]  talking about, you know, border security.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.880]  And he thinks that Macalenean is a deep state operative who was the architect of Obama's
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880]  catch and release.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880]  So I don't know what to think.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.240]  I just hope for the best.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.840]  But at this time, I mean, it's just, it's a madness down there for you for all.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.160]  Yeah, and I guess then only time will tell, but now Dallas and Houston are considering
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:56.440]  building new migrant shelters as monthly apprehensions are meeting 100,000 a month now.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.440]  It's record.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.040]  Ooh, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:05.040]  Bad breath and bad gas, PD stopped eating, all of his hair fell out, itching, licking,
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:11.600]  missing fur, at least $5,000 in that bill, creams, antibiotics, sprays, no results, everything
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.680]  we tried failed except the Dynavite, D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.640]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you've got to feed this hungry, healthy, D Omega
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:25.840]  3 fatty acids, flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.840]  dog food.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.960]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.800]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.440]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.440]  She's got life.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.440]  She's got energy.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.440]  Tons of energy.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.440]  No more bad smell.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.920]  She's the mom.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:47.120]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.120]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.120]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.120]  Dynavite for life.

[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:19.720]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:24.160]  and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it, and that's really where this goes.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.400]  But yeah, God's got a big war for you ready, and so if you can't face George Soros and
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.000]  Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.560]  face the other stuff?
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:37.880]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:38.880]  ready to fight.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.760]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back, and I mean,
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.440]  I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:47.080]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.280]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:53.480]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers, they're cold
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:33:00.920]  and failed and those that are being atomb, I want life, I want Jesus.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:18.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:26.920]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:35.080]  Democrats are just a joke, straight up, end of sentence, nothing more, well, actually,
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:41.600]  I shouldn't say nothing more, actually a lot more, criminals, liars, I mean, the list goes
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:52.800]  on, dirt bags, traitors, I just can't believe, I mean, it's just Democrats, they want to
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]  kill America.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.720]  I mean, literally, they are anti-American.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:04.360]  We have anti-Americans in office, they go under the title of Democrat.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:13.440]  So they're grilling Candace Owens right now, a black woman on how she's a white nationalist.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.600]  I mean, these people know no bounds.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.600]  They sit here, they cry about global warming, they all suck water out of plastic water bottles
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.640]  all day long, they fly on jets around this country.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.520]  You Democrats make us sick.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.440]  You Democrats make us Americans sick.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.400]  And if it wasn't for your rigged, cheating elections with tens of thousands of votes
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.280]  coming on in the twilight hour of elections that you were within a couple thousand votes
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.760]  of, you wouldn't have no power right now.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.760]  And you know it.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.400]  And that's why you hate Candace Owens so much.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:55.400]  You see, you see, Democrats enslaved black people in this country.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.280]  And then when Americans tried to take their slaves away from them, the Democrats went
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.480]  to war.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:09.600]  The Democrats literally fought to keep their slaves, their property.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.320]  Then they started the KKK after they lost that war.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:22.320]  But when the physical shackles were lifted from black people in the country, the Democrats
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.760]  put mental, psychological shackles on them.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:36.680]  And I wish there was, there needs to be some sort of cartoon drawn where it's like Democrats
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.600]  mind slavery over black people.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.320]  I mean, they literally expect black people to jump when they say jump.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.120]  The Democrats are the most racist group of people.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.040]  And then they just destroy every inner city they go to.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:55.200]  Baltimore dubbed most robbed city in America, run by Democrats, 50 plus years.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.000]  While making $300,000 in San Francisco can still mean you're living paycheck to paycheck,
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.320]  run by Democrats, a liberal bastion.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:08.480]  And you know what ends up happening when leftists get in control for 100 years?
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.600]  Desperate Venezuelans looting cemeteries, rotten corpses for jewelry.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.840]  That'll come to Democrat cities near you if it hasn't already, folks.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:26.720]  But these Democrats are so, I mean, I just can't even believe it.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:32.480]  And now they want medical tyranny with Mayor de Blasio forcing people to get vaccines.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.480]  We'll cover that in a minute.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.840]  But I want to cover this viral video and just explain something because there's a kind of
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.560]  conspiracy theories running rampant.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.280]  And I can kind of give a little clue into this because I have experience.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.920]  But in clip 14, people are going crazy over this video of CBS cutting the cameras when
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.200]  Texas Tech players kneel to pray.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.880]  So let me just first show you this short video.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.840]  Texas Tech won a big basketball game a couple nights ago afterwards.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.520]  They were celebrating and they were about to kneel for a prayer when the cameras cut
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.520]  away.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.880]  But before I break this down, here is that clip.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.720]  This is called a downback, downback basketball.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.160]  So they've got the camera in the locker room.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.160]  They're celebrating.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.160]  They're jumping.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.160]  They're clapping.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:26.400]  The coach walks in and he says, just wait a second, guys, we need to do our team prayer.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.200]  So now they get ready to kneel.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:37.000]  They take a knee to pray, clench hands and they cut prayer in the Texas Tech locker room
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.720]  and the knowledge that there is one more game to go and that will be Monday night.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:47.560]  Now look, I've worked in sports media, I've worked these games.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:52.120]  I mean, I've literally been in that role in the truck when these things happen.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.720]  So I know how this stuff goes and for people out there saying CBS is trying to censor Christianity
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.440]  or people praying, I don't think that's the case.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.760]  Now this was a big game, but they still had four different crews out.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:12.600]  So it could have been A to D crew, but there would be no mandate.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.320]  The people in the truck are not thinking, let's censor Christianity, let's censor prayer.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.120]  They're thinking, I'm just telling you how this goes.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.880]  So people freaking out thinking CBS is censoring Christianity here, that's not the case.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.000]  The people in the truck just said, let's go to a different shot because we don't want
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.400]  to see these people praying.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.400]  It has nothing to do with censoring people kneeling to pray or let CBS has some sort
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.960]  of agenda to censor that.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:44.960]  But I will say what's interesting about this is the fact they didn't want to go to it.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:50.200]  I mean, you even heard Ernie Johnson say they're kneeling in prayer, but here's the difference
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.760]  that I think is a legit thing people are bringing up.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.280]  If that were players kneeling for the national anthem, it'd be the big story.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:02.840]  If that were players kneeling to disrespect America during the national anthem, they'd
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.960]  keep the cameras on them and they'd leave the cameras on them.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.000]  So that's the big takeaway from this.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.200]  It's not a story, don't leave the cameras on the players coming together to kneel and
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.320]  camaraderie and pray to God.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:17.640]  They're not interested in showing that.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:22.840]  A player kneeling though for the anthem to disrespect America and divide this country,
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.760]  they do want to show that.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.360]  That's what they want to show.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.920]  And the average TV truck producer slash director, the directors making that final call is not
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.320]  thinking politically in that moment.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.360]  And I'm just telling you this as somebody that came from that exact, I mean, that was
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.680]  my job before I started here.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.280]  So I'm just telling you what was going on in that truck.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.480]  So for people out there thinking, oh, they're clearly censoring Christians.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:52.280]  Oh my gosh, they were told to cut the cameras during prayer.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.280]  Just relax.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.000]  Now, they obviously had no interest in showing the prayer.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.200]  I'm not disagreeing with that.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:03.160]  They had no interest in not in showing the prayer, so they didn't want to show the prayer.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.680]  But the directors making a call to say, all right, we're not going to sit the camera on
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.080]  these guys praying and kneeling for the next two or three minutes.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.200]  Let's just go back to our live set.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.640]  So I just wanted to kind of put put those things to rest.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.480]  Quite frankly, maybe even I have a little bit of a soft spot because I probably even
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.800]  knew the people working in that truck.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:31.000]  But the real takeaway is that they'll show players kneeling for the anthem that drives
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.160]  division.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.320]  They won't show players kneeling for prayer, which drives unity.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.000]  And to me, that's the real takeaway from this.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.160]  Not that there's some agenda or directive at CNN to censor Christianity or people praying.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.080]  Now if it was a group of Muslims, maybe the story is different.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.920]  So maybe there's something to be said about that.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:59.480]  I just don't want people assuming that a bunch of people working in a truck for CBS who probably
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:04.320]  have no care in the world when it comes to politics in that moment are cutting away.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.200]  So I just kind of wanted to address that now.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.400]  We're going to get on to some new news in the next segment.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.440]  And Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next hour as well.

[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.800]  They don't invite Alex Jones, folks.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.960]  Alex Jones is banned.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.800]  Alex Jones is totally censored.

[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.240]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side

[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:33.000]  And now Democrats are wanting to know who invited her because it's going to end up being a
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.320]  Republican and because now they want to shame that Republican publicly for inviting her.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:47.760]  But you have all this liberal media now that's all confused because Candace Owens has gotten
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.240]  so upset and fiery today.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:48:02.760]  You accused a black woman of being a white nationalist, excuse me, black woman, you're
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.000]  a white nationalist racist, how do you respond?
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.560]  Oh my gosh, calm down, how dare you respond to that, whoa, whoa, why are you out of hand?
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.360]  Who invited you anyway?
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:21.480]  So this is just, the Democrats just have no pulse right now or no finger on the pulse
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:27.120]  of America right now or they just don't care because they are just embarrassing themselves.
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:34.040]  And so the Republican that did invite Candace Owens is going to end up looking like a genius.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:39.240]  Watching the Democrats try to destroy Candace Owens today is just going to haunt them for
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:50.640]  a long time and you watch, you're going to see it all night probably if you watch the
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:56.280]  liberal progressive Democrat media, white nationalist Candace Owens says Hitler was
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.520]  not that bad.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:05.400]  They'll probably start publishing those stories before I'm off air today.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.960]  You people don't get it, do you?
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:16.520]  The rest of the country hasn't gone completely mad like you have.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.200]  They don't see a white person and immediately think the worst.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.320]  They don't see a Trump hat and immediately think the worst.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:33.920]  They don't see Trump and immediately have a psychological breakdown.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.880]  And the biggest frustration is the Democrats have already been defeated culturally.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.920]  The Democrats have already been defeated intellectually.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.760]  The Democrats just can't be defeated politically because they cheat because they have the whole
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.360]  damn system rigged.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.680]  And I don't know what I can do about that.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:53.840]  I can sit here all day.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:57.520]  I defeat the Democrats culturally and intellectually like it's a cakewalk.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:05.000]  I mean, how many avocado challenges do I have to do?
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:12.280]  Tell you what, Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:19.720]  So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to bear down and I'm going to do a news splits.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:25.240]  So judicial watch uncovers FBI docs discussing cover up over Hillary Clinton's server.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:33.600]  Jamie White has that story at info wars.com so judicial watch continues to get more emails
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:39.520]  and continues to expose all the criminal activity that Hillary Clinton was engaged in that was
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.760]  then covered up by the Obama administration by James Comey, who then perjured himself
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.840]  when testifying about that investigation.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:57.400]  Booming measles cases rocket towards record up nearly 100 from last week, but they don't
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:01.160]  tell you how many of these people are vaccinated.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:07.840]  They don't tell you how many of these people are noncitizens, but now de Blasio is taking
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.960]  it to the next level.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:14.200]  They already tried to make a medical tyranny curfew.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:18.000]  They already tried to make a medical tyranny proclamation saying if you're under 18, you
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.360]  can't even go out on the streets unless you've been vaccinated.
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.360]  That's totally unconstitutional, totally illegal, total tyranny.
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.680]  That was what New York tried to engage in that failed miserably.
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:33.520]  You know what, actually, I just remembered this.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.520]  I was looking at this specific area because I had a caller that piqued my interest.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.680]  So I did a little bit of more digging into this.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:45.720]  Now let's not forget what the government has done in this country.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:53.320]  The government has tested syphilis on people, AIDS on people, other diseases on people.
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:56.000]  There was a story from St. Louis, I think it was in the 40s.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.280]  They took a whole building of low-income people, it was mostly black people in St. Louis, and
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.000]  they sprayed it.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.040]  They sprayed a whole building, could have contaminated.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.720]  Who knows what, it was a total test.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:15.000]  The government tests, they do mass tests on people all the time, and I looked into it
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.840]  and what was happening, I think it was Rockport or Rockford, New York, I can't remember, if
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:22.680]  you guys can pull up a story.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:30.160]  And so they went out and they were giving all these vaccines out, and there's a strong
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:33.200]  Jewish community up there.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.880]  And I realized what I think is actually happening here.
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:42.880]  I think they're actually testing something right now on that community of people, just
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:48.200]  like they tested syphilis on black people.
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:53.800]  Because they brought all these vaccines out there to give to this community, and of course
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:53:00.440]  they frame it perfectly, oh you can't go out in public without your vaccine.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:05.080]  Now, DeBlasio is saying he'll find you a thousand dollars.
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:08.280]  I think Adon Salazar just published that story, if you guys could bring it to me at
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:14.800]  Empores.com, so first they say you can't leave your house.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:19.120]  That doesn't really work, but they hit this community, they force vaccinate them, then
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.680]  they say you're going to have to pay a fine if you don't get your vaccine.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:34.640]  Boy, New Yorkers, you better watch out, I wouldn't take that vaccine in a million years.
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:40.040]  And you know what I'd do, if they try to force vaccinate you, I would take all of the stories
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:45.640]  about how the government has illegally tested disease on American citizens, specifically
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:51.160]  minorities, and say you know what, I don't trust the government, I don't trust that
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:56.920]  vaccine, you can take that vaccine and shove it right where the sun don't shine, because
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:00.840]  I ain't taking it.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:10.120]  I would not be surprised one bit if they are running a medical test right now in New York.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:20.080]  And using this framework of measles outbreak caused by unvaccinated people to do it.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.200]  That's what our government's done for decades.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:32.640]  And you know the Democrats that run New York, I mean de Blasio folks, do you know how pathetic
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:34.840]  Bill de Blasio is?
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.280]  I don't know how this guy won re-election, this guy says America's not great, this guy's
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:46.080]  top staffer who was destined to be the next John Podesta of the Democrat Party, his top
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:51.880]  staffer gets busted as a major pedophile, gigabytes of child porn on his computer.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:56.800]  I think the guy's name was Zach Schwartz or something, you can find that story.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:01.320]  It was de Blasio's top staffer, next upcoming big Democrat, you know people said he might
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:04.640]  be the next big John Podesta, he gets busted total pedophile.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:14.960]  That's de Blasio's top aide, got re-elected after that, telling you, Spidey's senses
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:18.440]  are tingling on this deal.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:24.520]  They don't roll this type of thing out without a sick ulterior motive.
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.000]  I mean you don't force vaccinate people for fun.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.600]  Yeah, there's the story from 2017 de Blasio employee arrested for child pornography.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.920]  The guy was a raging pedophile folks.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:44.120]  I mean so much child porn on his computer, it's unbelievable.
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.880]  Where do you even get that much child porn?
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.880]  How about that?
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  How about that?
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:55.440]  You've got all that child porn, where the hell does it even come from?
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:02.280]  Open borders, undocumented children crossing the border.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:08.760]  You want to know why Democrats, you can throw Republicans in there, you had Dennis Hastert,
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.040]  you had that one Arizona rep saying oh, I don't think child trafficking is a big deal.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:20.280]  That was the guy who got caught trying to pay kids for sex, you know.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.400]  They got to get their kids over here, man.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:32.120]  Just like a heroin addict needs his heroin, pedophile needs its victim.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:40.160]  That's what this is all about, and they're getting away with it.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.360]  I just can't believe it, man.
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.600]  Pull up the de Blasio staffer story again.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:52.840]  I want to actually recall how much child porn that guy actually had.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:59.720]  Because again, folks, you got to ask yourself, where is it coming from?
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:10.000]  Keeping more than 3,000 images and 89 videos, child porn.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.360]  This is de Blasio's top aid.
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:20.120]  The Bill de Blasio that now wants to find you if you don't take a forced vaccination.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.120]  My God.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.760]  Oh my God.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:32.480]  You just get chills when it all hits you, folks.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.480]  I mean, you're talking about pedophiles, you're talking about medical tyranny, you're talking
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.480]  about the government testing people.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:45.680]  I wouldn't be surprised if that vaccine rollout is a big medical test right now happening
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.680]  in New York.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.680]  You better watch out.

[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:53.320]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:56.120]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.840]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:02.400]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:07.160]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:11.480]  works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back, and lo and behold, it's
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:14.680]  super popular like it's always been.
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:18.680]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.160]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine, so whatever you do, continue

[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.040]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:44.000]  done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:55.120]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:24.520]  Well, if a Republican looks at a woman wrong, it's
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:52.800]  a
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:01:07.580]  way of making it.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:13.340]  Before Biden burned down any bridges, he was trying to rebuild, recently celebrating his
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:21.020]  own ego over any strategic attempt at repositioning his still unannounced candidacy for the presidency.
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:25.580]  Joe Biden trying to get past the controversy over his behavior ad-libbed a joke making
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.580]  light of it.
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:32.580]  I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.860]  And again after inviting children to the stage.
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:38.020]  By the way, he gave me permission to touch him.
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:41.540]  It went over well with the friendly audience of union members, mostly men.
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:47.180]  I say I get it, I get it, I believe in women, I advocate for women.
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:48.980]  That's not what I saw from this speech.
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:51.820]  I'm not sorry for any of my intentions.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:54.140]  I'm not sorry for anything that I have ever done.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:02:00.140]  I've never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or woman.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:05.260]  I know it sets, not the reputation I had since I was in high school, for God's sake.
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:10.420]  Confused Biden supporters like Nancy Pelosi have even flip-flopped on their criticism
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:11.900]  of Biden.
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:20.700]  I'm sorry I invaded your space, but not I'm sorry you were offended, because that's not
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:26.540]  accepting the fact that people think differently about communication.
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:31.260]  And also, for example, my grandchildren, when they were little, like 5 and 6, now they're
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:38.500]  more 10 and 11, they would say play games and then they'd say open sesame, except we
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:42.100]  don't say sesame, we say open Biden.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:47.340]  That's the magic word, because he was just so lovely to them and paid attention to them.
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:57.420]  He doesn't understand, he has to understand in the world that we're in now that people's
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.260]  space is important to them.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.860]  Amnesia must be rampant amongst the Democrats, as Democrats like Senator Gillibrand recently
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:11.420]  forced Democrat Senator Al Franken to resign after just six women accused him of inappropriate
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.420]  touching.
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:19.380]  I'm announcing that in the coming weeks, I will be resigning as a member of the United
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:20.380]  States Senate.
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:24.820]  Biden has inappropriately touched so many women and children, it makes Franken look
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:26.140]  like a boy scout.
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:30.420]  Biden's wife even hinted at just how bizarre his behavior was to her.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:34.540]  At the beginning of their relationship, as reported by the Daily Mail, she admits that
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:39.960]  being thrust into a family of huggers made her feel strange and uncomfortable, writing
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:45.540]  that Joe and his two young sons never wanted to miss a chance to hold a hand, wrap their
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:49.500]  arms around each other, or give a kiss, gross.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:54.660]  Now the Democrats are, in the words of their savior Barack Obama, positioning themselves
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:04:00.180]  into a circular firing squad, while Biden stumbles with what the Democratic Party has
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:24.140]  become.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:30.280]  If Biden continues down this path, soon we will hear all about the resurfacing of Biden's
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:42.400]  skinny-dipping exploits in front of female Secret Service agents.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.640]  Run Joe, run.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:56.720]  You are guaranteed four more years of Trump, John Bowne, reporting.
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:02.520]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:07.000]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  damage.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  We stopped her.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  We got a nationalist in.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.900]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:15.900]  We are winning.
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:21.360]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:22.360]  attack.
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:26.760]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:32.200]  This is about who wants it most, and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors,
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.200]  they've taken everything.
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.200]  I am in your hands.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.200]  You are in my hands.
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:38.720]  I need financial support, and I got products you and your family need.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:39.720]  It's that simple.

[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:28.360]  Alex Jones has dialed in to the broadcast live from an undisclosed location.
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:29.360]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:30.360]  Good to be here.
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:33.760]  I've got some big breaking news, obviously, that's central to understanding the enemy
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.040]  and the global smash of the planet, how they're defeated on the cover in just one moment.
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:42.000]  But first, obviously, I've not been on the vacation, I have been out in Los Angeles doing
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  a lot of big podcasts.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.440]  I also went on coast to coast to AM with George Dora over 600 radio stations last night,
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:52.760]  had a powerful two hours with him, and I'm about to appear on several giant podcasts
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:56.440]  and shows, some of the biggest in the country, but I'm going to let those be sneak attacks,
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:59.640]  so that's going to be happening in about two hours from now.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.160]  So stay tuned for that.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:06.280]  But the main reason I'm joining you here today, I want you to do an excellent job, and I really
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:10.480]  enjoyed the carpet, dunked him, a piece we should get that fellow on, a more often the
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:16.040]  great work he's doing, but Brian Stelter, saying he needs to be banned, we can't have
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:23.000]  him have 25 million views on Twitter on one video and 10 million on the same video on
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  YouTube.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  His average video gets like 5 million views.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.200]  I mean, Brian Stelter hasn't had 5 million people do that in the three years he's been
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.200]  on CNN.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.200]  So we can't let this happen.
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:38.080]  I'm sorry, I'm being overtaken here by the spirit of Brian Stelter.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.080]  It happens, Alex.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:40.080]  It's okay.
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.440]  Pennywise Stelter has that, has that capability, but you're back.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.920]  Well, here's what's going to happen.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:48.920]  I'm going to talk about several issues right now, but what I've got to cover is so big
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:53.160]  in the crystallization I had in my head earlier, the understanding of this.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.840]  And when people hear this review, yeah, we all understand that, but this is the key.
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:02.480]  And I'm going to cover it next segment, dealing with Ilhan Omar, and her statements about
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:07.560]  Stephen Miller being a white nationalist, and I'll talk about the fact that she's really
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:15.400]  a Islamist nationalist, they want a global Islamic worldwide state, they want an Islamic
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:21.000]  global government, and they're using a particular playbook that I've thought about before, but
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:27.120]  I was sitting there having lunch yesterday with an LAPD detective, and with another police
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.840]  officer, and we're on our security detail, went down the skin row, truly hellish.
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:37.840]  And they said, don't you see what this really is, and the playbook that's being run, and
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.160]  as soon as they said it all crystallized, and I had actually thought of that six months
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:43.840]  ago, because it was prima facia.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:49.800]  All its face, we're all seeing the same thing, truth is self-evident, but we've got their
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:50.800]  entire playbook.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:54.720]  So we're going to talk about that coming up in the next segment, but I got to tell you,
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:59.520]  it is just an incredible time to be out here in California, because it's a beautiful state,
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:02.600]  it's also a horrible state, because the leftists have infested it, but I got to tell you,
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:07.080]  I run into most of the trendies, people even dress like trendies, and they're listeners,
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:11.160]  and they're saying, hey, I used to be a big leftist, but you help deprogram me, I'll
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.600]  insure, help deprogram me, I'm Ed Cady, Hopkins of Hopkins World, out here, she got mobbed
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:20.840]  by people on the streets, so you've got really stupid zombies out here that don't know what
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:25.840]  ends up, or you've got a few hateful leftists, I've barely gotten any hate while I've been
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:30.800]  out here, just a few stared looks, and mainly people that are awake, so I'm always bashing
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:34.120]  California because of its leadership, but I think that's because, and we know because
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:39.760]  of massive systemic election fraud, anytime Democrats get control of a city, Republicans
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.960]  never get back into office, not that Republicans are perfect, but they're not the establishment
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:48.040]  like the Democrats are, the Democrats are cancer, they want total power, they don't
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:53.120]  even want a two-party system anymore, they want absolute, complete domination, and that's
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.040]  why they want to shut down this show, that's why they want to silence and demoralize the
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:00.480]  American people, that's why they use Hollywood to try to demoralize the people of this country,
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:05.960]  but I'm telling you, it's all a bunch of bull because even here in California, people are
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:07.440]  in fuego awake.
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.720]  Well, and there's kind of a weird phenomenon to Alex where, I mean, you were always the
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:17.000]  anti-establishment guy, I mean, that's just how, it wasn't even that that's what you were
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.280]  going for, you were always just true to yourself and true to what you believed in and the truth,
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:26.280]  but it was always kind of an anti-establishment thing, but it's like just because you've
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:31.400]  remained true to your principles and your values and the message that you bring on air, somehow
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:36.440]  now you are the establishment, just because you didn't stray away from what you believe
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:40.360]  in, you didn't stray away from being pro-America, it's like now you're the establishment, but
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:45.640]  I think what you were describing earlier, like the people in California that are anti-establishment,
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:50.120]  I think they're realizing, okay, wait a second, wait, Alex Jones was anti-establishment the
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.960]  whole time, I was kind of deceived by the media there for a moment.
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.400]  Well, I think you just hit the paradigm perfectly square here because it looks like a paradox,
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:58.900]  it's not.
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:03.400]  We're just rebooting what America really was that made it so popular, made it so successful,
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.240]  made everybody want to come here, not that we were perfect, but we were the best house
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.240]  in a bad neighborhood.
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:11.760]  I mean, humanity's had a lot of hard times, we've gone through a lot of hell together,
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.120]  a lot of good together, but we've got those mountains, we've got those valleys, those
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:19.840]  times we touch the face of God, those times we fall into bed with the devil and then that's
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:26.840]  really the paradox of being human, of having free will, but now intellectually, free market,
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:32.680]  family, common sense, competition, people not being wimps, people not being SJWs, people
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:39.960]  not being cream pies or powder puffs or whatever, they can't handle any type of pressure, people
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:44.120]  are more and more kind of making the turn, they're either completely falling into decadence
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:48.160]  and mindlessness and the Goldfish syndrome, I'm not knowing what ended this up, or they're
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.720]  starting the turn back towards the light and that's what we're really talking about here.
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:55.960]  You're not perfect, I'm not perfect, we're out of here beating our chest like leftists
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.360]  saying we have an orthodoxy, you've got to follow exactly what we say, we're going to
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:05.440]  ostracize you, we're going to bully you, we're saying, hey, historically we know what works,
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:10.280]  we want to be strong, we want you to be strong, we want to work together in a true independence
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:16.120]  movement but that collectively by having strong individuals creates a stronger, better collective.
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.200]  The upside down pyramid system that these people have built with them on the top creates
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.680]  dependency, creates ignorance and everybody knows that but they're consciously pulling
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:30.560]  back and going, oh my god, every blue city, every blue state is a hellhole, they produce
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:37.520]  collapse of civilization because these globalists are anti-human inherently so yes, as the worm
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.960]  turns and people come back to Americana, then the left pointed says oh look, we're the resistance
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:47.160]  to you now even though Info Wars has been the resistance, they say we're the resistance,
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:51.480]  you're the establishment, well it's more of a paradox as I said, we're getting beachheads,
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:56.400]  we're winning arts at minds, we're beginning to turn the tide but they are fearing we
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.320]  will become the establishment and set the campus free.
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:03.880]  Well and I could understand that when it comes to the larger issue of how power corrupts
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:09.400]  absolutely, but again, it's just sticking by your guns and just because Info Wars is
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:15.600]  having victories in the face of defeat doesn't mean that we're the establishment and I feel
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.480]  that those things kind of get conflated with the person that hasn't heard of Info Wars
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.680]  or Alex Jones and don't know the history, don't know where you came from or Info Wars
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.600]  comes from, they just say oh here's a man that helped get Trump in office, it must be
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:31.520]  the establishment, well no, there's a long history of anti-establishment here at Info
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:34.520]  Wars, there's a long history of calling out the corruption, most of the corruption that
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:39.920]  these people would claim to be fighting but Alex, I think that the answer here is it's
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:45.880]  time for conservatives to go out lovingly, politely, peacefully and just execute their
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:51.280]  First Amendment right, do it on your social media page, do it for just your own use, do
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:57.000]  it for whatever but the point is you go out peacefully, kindly in a Trump hat or an Info
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.320]  Wars shirt and you just do an event and the same thing will happen, a radical deranged
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:08.240]  leftist will expose themselves and it just encapsulates perfectly who the left is and
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.200]  where it's at and that's how we continue to have more victory in the culture war.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:17.760]  That's right, just like Muhammad Gandhi would go out and you say we're gonna march to sea
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:21.800]  and collect our own salt and not pay taxes on salt and then they would beat people with
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:25.400]  clubs, well because they didn't fight back, no one to hold them, no one to fold them,
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:30.400]  no one to walk away, no one to run, to quote Kenny Rogers, the man on the train, it's not
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.240]  that we're wimps, sometimes people rob in our house, we gotta fight them or sometimes
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:37.960]  if we lose the Info War and then it goes into a truceable war, we'll defend ourselves
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.440]  but we're winning right now, so knowing when to hold them like Martin Luther King on the
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:46.960]  road to Selma and letting people beat you, that shows people they're the authoritarians
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.200]  and then we win and so that's the process but you have to go out and engage the bullies
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:55.880]  and let them know that hey, you're the ones that are the tyrants, you're the oppressors
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:01.000]  like that crazy clown lady, that is so surreal you played yesterday, I did up last night
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.120]  when I was driving on the road, preferred a two hour show, another show I was going
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:09.000]  on, watching much of yesterday's broadcast was so incredibly good, I was like, wow, oh
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.440]  it's knocking out of the park with these guests and just all the points but she was just diabolically
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:19.320]  scary going clowns by the way, she's white supremacist and she's projecting this insanity
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:24.200]  on us and acting like a total buffoon and not even getting how crazy she sounds.
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:28.760]  Well, and that's why I think it's time for just the average conservative as we approach
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:34.120]  this important 2020 election to just go out, engage in free speech, you don't have to
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.840]  be mean, you don't have to be vitriolic, you don't have to be rude, just approach a Democrat,
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:43.320]  go to a liberal event in a Trump act with a camera rolling and just say, hey, I don't
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:47.160]  hate you, let's talk about these issues, let them get violent.
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:51.320]  Alex Jones is with us on the Alex Jones show, go to infowarstore.com during this break ladies
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:54.920]  and gentlemen, shop at infowarstore.com today to keep us on air tomorrow.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:17:03.960]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.080]  of control.
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:10.440]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.280]  using prescription drugs.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:17.160]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:20.520]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:23.800]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:26.600]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:28.040]  Get sober now.
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:31.400]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:32.120]  It's simple.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.400]  Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:36.680]  Please don't wait.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:38.200]  Your life matters to us.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:41.800]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:45.400]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.920]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:50.920]  Call right now before it's too late.
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:54.120]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:58.520]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:00.440]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:01.080]  It is.
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:05.880]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:07.240]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:09.080]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:14.680]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:16.040]  You've got the children's.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:17.160]  You've got the adults.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.120]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.560]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:24.120]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.480]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:26.280]  And I'm sorry.
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.360]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:30.280]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:30.840]  It's so good.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:31.400]  It might be.
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:33.560]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:36.520]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:38.200]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:44.600]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:49.800]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what?
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.320]  I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.280]  I just can't do it.
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:58.280]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:18:58.680]  Go ahead.
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:01.160]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:06.440]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, your bragging, it just gets old, man.
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:07.720]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:11.160]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:15.720]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:17.720]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:21.080]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:23.640]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.440]  Is that what you want?
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.800]  Frank, you know what?
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:27.480]  I'll put him on pause again.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:32.040]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.080]  We're under attack.
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:35.720]  We need your help as much begging as I do.
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:38.520]  We can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:41.640]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:42.120]  You understand?
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:43.720]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:45.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:50.600]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:52.360]  Do you understand?
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.880]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:55.480]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:20:05.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:11.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:17.320]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:23.560]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:26.200]  I'm Alex Jones calling in from the road of a lost angel.
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:31.480]  It's the city of lost angels, devil's headquarters, command base number one here in North America.
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:33.640]  And it's a big show this afternoon.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.400]  And then I'm going to be getting on a jet airplane coming back to the ATX tomorrow.
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:45.000]  Again, Owen Troyer is riding shotgun from the studios in Austin, Texas to the great job with our crew.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.360]  Okay, so here's the big enchilada.
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:50.360]  And I know everybody already knows this, but I wanted to really sink in.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:59.080]  Again, when you see Ilhan Omar from Somalia came here as an immigrant, constantly talking about how
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:06.200]  much America sucks, how evil white people are, how bad Christians are, how bad Jews are,
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:11.640]  how bad Israel is, just spewing like diarrhea out of her chicken neck head.
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:13.880]  Think about it.
[02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:19.240]  She came from a country where women are sold at slave auctions, mainstream news.
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:21.800]  She comes from a country where a Westerner, whether they're black or white,
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:27.320]  is kidnapped within five minutes, where our own military can barely even operate.
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:32.600]  Their main national product isn't something like oil, like Saudi Arabia,
[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:34.840]  or say farming or weapons like the U.S.
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:41.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's piracy and robbing ships and then kidnapping and then
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.200]  killing a few of the prisoners to scare everybody else into paying the ransom.
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:48.840]  Slavery, sex slavery, kidnapping, murder.
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:50.840]  And then I'm not against all Somalis.
[02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:52.040]  I'm sure some are great people.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:56.680]  But I can't go to their country and live in peace if I'm not a Muslim and I'm not black.
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:03.960]  So she is a radical racist black Muslim who wants a worldwide caliphate.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:09.960]  That means a world government by a religious monarchy run by the Islamists.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:17.960]  And that's what Ilhan Omar, running her stupid mouth, says over and over again.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.960]  She doesn't want to assimilate into something that's good that she wanted to get into.
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:29.640]  She wants to conquer it because her culture and her genetic map and what she wants to do
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:30.440]  is conquer.
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:32.280]  They attack everyone around them.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:37.240]  1400 years ago, the Muslims did not have one person in Africa.
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:41.080]  Today, they've got roughly half the population under their slavery.
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:44.680]  Just 100 years ago, they were 5% of Nigeria.
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:49.800]  They're now 50% of Nigeria, the most populous African country,
[02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:52.680]  way down in the middle to the west on the coast.
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:23:00.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is the house of Islam and everything outside of it is the house of war.
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:03.800]  And Ilhan Omar is here to hate America.
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.240]  The other Muslim woman that they put into Congress.
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:09.720]  Notice how they would never do that in the Islamic country to put a woman in power.
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:12.600]  But here, it's all part of suckering women into Islam.
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:14.440]  They stick their puppet up there.
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:21.880]  And then she says that Stephen Miller, White House speechwriter and White House advisor,
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:28.280]  very smart guy, only 37 years old, been fighting since he was in high school against globalism
[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:32.040]  in college, came from a liberal family, woke up to what was going on.
[02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:36.040]  We have the UN officially trying to break our country.
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:40.600]  We have the UN officially trying to smash our border.
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:45.800]  We have them in the UN and Soros with U.S. State Department money that Trump's trying to cut off
[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:51.720]  through USAID with hundreds of thousands every month trying to split, actually every month
[02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:54.840]  being caught, hundreds of thousands more not being caught.
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:59.480]  Total crisis, diseases pouring over, sex trafficking, sex slavery,
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.960]  half the people coming across are other than Mexican.
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:04.920]  That's what it's called in the Border Patrol listing.
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:07.240]  The Border Patrol says they're in a total emergency.
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:10.200]  Obama's former head of DHS says we're in a total emergency.
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:15.960]  And so Trump fires the head of DHS who was busy just jet-setting around Europe
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.840]  and not doing her job because she was giving him bad advice.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:24.280]  Then Trump learns from Miller and others that the new Border Patrol had that they were about
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:25.560]  to put in wasn't good either.
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:30.760]  So Trump does his job and CNN and MSNBC, that's their talking point,
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:36.360]  said that it's an active workplace of violence if the president fires someone.
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:40.920]  So these people are word terrorist, they're liars, they're assaulting logic,
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:42.360]  but here's the big enchilada.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.520]  I want everyone to understand.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:48.600]  I want everyone to have it burn into your minds.
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:50.440]  The globalists go with what works.
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:53.000]  These big mega banks that are tax exempt, the ultra rich,
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:56.120]  use communism and socialism to domesticate people.
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:59.080]  And if you look at what the Soviets did,
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.520]  funding different activities in attempts to overthrow South Africa,
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:11.640]  attempts to prop up Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and things that happened in Rhodesia,
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:16.040]  all of the things that happened were about the Soviets who were really globalist puppets,
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:22.760]  this is on record, trying to overthrow any civilization in Africa.
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:25.480]  And you see in the modern sense, they went and blew up Libya because
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.760]  Gaddafi was stabilizing much of Africa as well with investment and technology.
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:39.480]  And so they're running a 1960s, 1970s model of Angola war, of Rhodesia wars,
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:43.320]  of all of this, and it's all race based.
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.800]  So what Ilhan is doing, Ilhan Omar, what all the Democrats are doing
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:54.520]  is they aren't bringing a classic racial division model that they have used successfully
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:01.960]  in Africa to first demonize, then drive any whites out of a collective power sharing,
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:06.200]  and then finally force them out of the country or kill them as you're now seeing
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:09.560]  the same program being run in South Africa.
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:12.440]  So this is what they're trying with the demographics,
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.040]  with Hispanics and blacks supposedly thinking whites are inherently bad,
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:21.240]  and that literally have to be driven from the nation because being white is inherently evil.
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:25.480]  In first phase, they're going to bully and intimidate whites so much, this is the media,
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:27.960]  that they think the minorities will join in on it.
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:32.760]  Whites will then politically capitulate, even though the top nine richest groups in the U.S.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:34.680]  by race are Asians.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:39.720]  Whites will then become a subservient class politically who will then grovel the system
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:43.720]  in phase one, that even more illegals will be brought in from all over the world,
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:50.520]  and the race based system will accelerate towards a racially based dictatorship here
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:56.040]  in the United States carrying out this operation with a unifying caliphate
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:01.880]  Islamification as the new operating system over all these different disparate groups
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:05.640]  to unify them, and the only way whites are going to be left alone in Europe
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:10.200]  or the United States under this fusion of race based systems with Islam
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:12.280]  is if you convert to Islam.
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.560]  This is the globalist master plan.
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:20.040]  The class of civilizations was not just to bring in a new world war and a world government,
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:23.960]  it was meant to bring in a new world war and a capitulation of the west,
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:27.400]  of our western values, of the Renaissance and of Christendom,
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:36.280]  to this new world government system merging Islam with a satanic based world government
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:41.800]  type spectrum of new age garbage, because Islam has shown that it will always
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:44.200]  lump on the new things as well and merge with those.
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.120]  So this is the total abomination that the system is involved in,
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:50.520]  and that's why Russia is public enemy number one,
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:54.200]  because they've pulled out of globalism, kicked some of the oligarchs out,
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.120]  still fighting for their life like America, but are going back to Christianity,
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.680]  building churches everywhere, paying people to have kids,
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.120]  saying the west is trying to pump poison into their nation culturally and saying no.
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.160]  So when we hear about Russian collusion, the only Russian collusion is,
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:12.920]  they're nationalist, they're Christians, and if America gets back on that path,
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:17.160]  the poison that's been injected at us by satanic Hollywood to demoralize us
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:19.400]  so we can follow this satanic Islamic takeover,
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:23.240]  will not be effective if we vomit the poison out.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.000]  But that's what we have to recognize is the media, the fake culture,
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:32.840]  Hollywood, the main professors, the big universities are literally enemy bastions
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:36.520]  of tyranny, and we must not support them, we must withdraw from them,
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:39.080]  because this is a cultural and spiritual war.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:42.440]  We come back, I'm going to play from two years ago,
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:47.160]  that Bon Ivor Alex Jones song that got 30-something million views total,
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:49.240]  they realized that the hit piece backfired all of them,
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:52.760]  they started pulling it down everywhere, but we're going to air a special version
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:55.080]  where we put the facts on.
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:57.400]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:00.200]  Learn how to get sober after we've shared these stories.
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:05.240]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:10.200]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:12.440]  using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:14.600]  After my second DWI and arrest,
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:17.560]  my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.280]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:27.080]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:28.520]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:31.880]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:35.880]  It's simple, just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.

[02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:59.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.760]  to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:04.520]  heck even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:05.960]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:09.720]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:14.200]  every day, but thanks to SupermailVitality at infowarstore.com,
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:15.960]  I still have that energy.
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:19.240]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day
[02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:22.120]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water,
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:25.400]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:29.160]  and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance,
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:32.520]  energy and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park,
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:36.520]  and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:40.600]  So go to infowarstore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.

[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:58.520]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.760]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves,
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:05.160]  it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:09.640]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:58.920]  There are thousands of ideologies out there,
[02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:00.920]  hundreds of different political systems,
[02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:02.680]  and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:07.160]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:10.200]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:11.800]  I didn't invent all this.
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:13.640]  I went and researched the Renaissance,
[02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:16.520]  Americana, and what really works for humanity,
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:18.440]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:21.320]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:25.720]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:30.280]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:33.800]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:36.200]  by buying the great products at infowarstore.com,
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:38.440]  by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos,
[02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:40.040]  and by praying for this operation,
[02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:43.800]  and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:46.360]  For myself and the whole Infowars family,
[02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:48.600]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:51.640]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[02:32:51.640 --> 02:33:21.480]  You are the Infowars, and I salute you.
[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:29.480]  We are back live.
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:31.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:32.920]  Owen Schroeder is about to take over.
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:36.120]  We've got a new big Caitlyn Bennett piece that was on vice.
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:37.240]  It's pretty important, because it actually
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:38.360]  weren't even that negative.
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:40.840]  Some good information got out and so much more.
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:42.760]  But I want to just finish up with Ilhan Omar.
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:46.040]  You understand, folks, it's been publicly decided
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:51.400]  to flood the entire world with Muslims who do not convert,
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:53.960]  and who could then blow up and kill and stab
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:55.480]  and run over people all they want.
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:57.720]  And the media says it's never a Muslim when they do it,
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:00.520]  as they take over the entire planet.
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:03.800]  And as millions of Christians are displaced
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:07.160]  and slaughtered every year, as sex slavery expands,
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:10.280]  as no respect for women explodes,
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:12.920]  and leftist women literally praise Allah Akbar
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:15.960]  at their feminist events in the United States and Germany.
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:20.040]  This is mass political and cultural suicide.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:24.920]  And we're supposed to just sit back and take it,
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:28.120]  but people aren't just sitting back,
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:29.320]  and they're not just taking it.
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:33.400]  So think of the nerve of this woman
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.320]  who only spews her hate of this country
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:37.400]  and how bad it is and how she wants to overturn it.
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:39.480]  And I get noticed she's a Muslim,
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:41.800]  but she supports communism, she supports Venezuela.
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:44.360]  Well, that's what the Muslims did
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:47.000]  when they helped with the Russian backers
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:50.520]  invade areas of Africa.
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:51.880]  That's what they did.
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:54.520]  That's the operating system, is communism.
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:57.480]  And so, quote, democratic socialism is the gateway.
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:01.800]  Merged with Islam, and that's the operating system.
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.040]  Three billion Muslims in just nine years.
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:05.240]  1.8 billion now.
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:07.080]  Another 10 years after that,
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:08.520]  they're saying it's going to be something like
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:10.280]  four billion Muslims,
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:14.520]  four billion Muslims unified in their lust for power,
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:15.800]  their lust for control.
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:17.320]  Now, some Muslims aren't part of that,
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:18.520]  but they're not the leadership.
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:19.480]  They're not real Islam.
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:21.880]  So we call it radical Islam.
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:23.800]  This is orthodox Islam,
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.560]  and the establishment is allied with it.
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:27.880]  The filthy left is consciously aware
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:28.600]  of what they're doing.
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:29.960]  It's their master plan.
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:32.440]  So Stephen Miller says,
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:34.760]  oh, yeah, we've got a policy to bring in more workers
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:36.280]  for the factories or whatever,
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:37.240]  probably even too many
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:38.840]  because the left brainwashes them.
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:41.080]  It doesn't go as far as they should,
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:42.360]  because the factory's under total attack.
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:45.560]  But then you've got people like Ilhan Omar,
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:47.800]  saying he's a, quote, white nationalist folks.
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.480]  He is an Islamic world government caliphate supporter.
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:53.320]  That's what a global caliphate is,
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.800]  is an Islamic state worldwide forcing you into it.
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:35:59.720]  So they're going to create a class of civilizations,
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:04.920]  and then make us join a form of new age Islam
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:07.240]  with Islamists as the enforcers everywhere.
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:10.440]  Or the orthodox Islam has a big system of pedophilia in it.
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:11.720]  Left likes that.
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:13.800]  They hate Christians, left likes that.
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:15.160]  They're very expansionist,
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:18.120]  and they adopt socialism or communism, left likes that.
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:20.840]  And so it's here, everyone's being conquered.
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:23.080]  All these collaborators are rolling over to it.
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:25.320]  It's absolutely pathetic, absolutely sick.
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:29.960]  And all these pigs are all over television
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:31.400]  saying that the president,
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:33.560]  the articles up on infowords.com,
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:35.000]  that it's a form of violence.
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.240]  That's the talking point.
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:39.160]  When he fires people not doing their job,
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:41.880]  he tries to defend the country just a little bit.
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:43.800]  When he tries to stand up to the Chinese or anything,
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:45.480]  it's all workplace violence.
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:48.040]  When he fires people that aren't doing good deals
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:50.600]  for our nation, these people are the enemy,
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:52.440]  and they've got this incredible job
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:54.440]  of trying to convince us that loving our country,
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:57.080]  loving being successful, loving free market is bad.
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:36:59.080]  So that's it.
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:00.840]  We're going to go to this Bon Iver piece
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:04.280]  because we see the look back on the level of crime,
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.280]  the level of violence, the level of terrorism,
[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:08.760]  the level of terror plots in Europe and here,
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:11.080]  and the fact that the Somalis are
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:15.080]  the most violent group by demographic,
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:16.920]  most violent Islamic group,
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.920]  that will not accept us in their country,
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:21.880]  but we must accept them and commit cultural suicide.
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.880]  They want to adopt the Western standards
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.080]  and all the rest of it, that's fine,
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:26.680]  but they can't seem to do it.
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:28.280]  The left is there coddling them
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:33.080]  as an important cancer cell to bring down this country.
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:37.720]  Just like that Brian Stelter calling me a disease and a virus,
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:40.920]  and they had Stelter this weekend again with his guest saying,
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:42.920]  oh, the virus of right wing media,
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:44.760]  the virus of Tucker Carlson spreading
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.600]  with disease of nationalism.
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:48.600]  No, globalism is the disease.
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:52.120]  Free market, capitalism and nationalism
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:54.760]  and the family and Christianity is the cure.
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:57.320]  And everybody knows Christianity creates incredible wealth.
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:37:59.880]  It creates incredible success.
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:02.520]  That said, it takes wealth to fight this operation.
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:04.520]  I've been so busy the last two weeks
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:06.520]  that I never got rid of the big mega sale store
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:07.560]  right free shipping,
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:11.240]  but seven of our nutraceuticals sold out.
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:13.080]  So I've changed the name of the sale
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.160]  to the mega spring sale.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:18.920]  And we can put that up on screen
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:20.600]  because I've just had no time
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:22.760]  to even focus on marketing,
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:24.360]  which our marketing's just straight up.
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:26.360]  Here are the products, they're high quality,
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:27.800]  they work really well.
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:30.200]  So we've got this big spring special
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:32.200]  that's going on right now
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.120]  that is going to have to end
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:37.720]  because everything is selling out.
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:38.920]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:41.480]  a lot of our best selling items have sold out.
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:43.480]  A lot of the other great items are still there.
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:45.480]  So we have the spring super sale.
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:49.080]  We still have X2, the amazing deep breath crystal iodine.
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:51.880]  We still have super blue at 50 to 60% off.
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:53.480]  We still have super wound gel.
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:56.680]  We still have amazing DNA force at 60% off.
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:57.880]  That's unprecedented.
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:00.440]  Colloidal silver, silver bullets 60% off.
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:02.440]  Real red pill plus 60% off.
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.440]  Brain force plus 55% off.
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:06.440]  But these specials, I promise you,
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:08.440]  when I get back,
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:10.440]  this is just the original sale,
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:12.440]  but now more limited items,
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:14.440]  because again, seven items have sold out.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:16.440]  So this is an unprecedented sale,
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:18.440]  but whatever you do, go to infohorsetour.com
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:20.440]  and get a t-shirt.
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:22.440]  We've got hundreds of great t-shirts
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:24.440]  that spread the word, that help you meet
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  like-minded people, and I want to thank everybody.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:28.440]  For their support, we're under globalist attack.
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:30.440]  George Dory said last night with me
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:32.440]  that he's never seen
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:34.440]  someone under this much attack
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.440]  on any scale.
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:38.440]  He said now, even rivaling Trump,
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:40.440]  and he was a naval officer three-time
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:42.440]  Emmy award winner for his
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:44.440]  TV news production.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:46.440]  So he's a journalist,
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:48.440]  and he was asked to me privately,
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:50.440]  Ann O'Hare, what do you think's going on?
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:52.440]  And I said, well, it's like the amount of propaganda
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:54.440]  they put out before they invade a country,
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:56.440]  but more.
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:58.440]  He said, you're right, then what is it?
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:00.440]  And I said, they've chosen us
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:02.440]  to steal our identity of populists
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:04.440]  and people that support America.
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:06.440]  That image of victory
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:08.440]  with Trump getting elected,
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:10.440]  and turn into something evil, turn into a strong man,
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:12.440]  and then use that as a weapon against everybody.
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  So that's why keeping infohors on air,
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:16.440]  standing strong, fighting hard,
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.440]  and boldly is so critical
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:20.440]  because the enemy wants to capture us
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:22.440]  politically and then use us
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:24.440]  as an enemy against the people.
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:26.440]  Doesn't mean I'll literally do that,
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:28.440]  but it's captured fraudulent
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  persona.
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:32.440]  First they kill your identity,
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:34.440]  first they kill your name,
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:36.440]  then they put you in prison or kill you physically.
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:38.440]  So I'm fighting for my life here,
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:40.440]  but I'm fighting for all our lives,
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:42.440]  and I think people understand that, and they know that.
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:44.440]  So here's the piece they wanted to make fun of.
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:46.440]  They put my voice to music
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:48.440]  about we love our Somalis,
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:50.440]  we love our Muslims too,
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.440]  and I talked to years ago about how they're keeping
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:54.440]  babies alive and selling their organs,
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:56.440]  and boy, it was all a big funny joke,
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:58.440]  but it's not a joke now.
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:00.440]  So here is this piece,
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:01.440]  and back to Owen Schreuer,
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:03.440]  Caitlin Bennett and so much more.
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:05.440]  God bless you all, and whatever you do,
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:07.440]  spread the word today,
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:09.440]  because only you can override the censors.
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:11.440]  Only you can get around what they're doing.
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:13.440]  Only you can spread the signal,
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:14.440]  because you are the resistance.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:21.440]  I salute you, I thank you, God bless you all.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:46.440]  In the runner-up screamer,
[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:51.440]  we love Satan, we wanna eat babies.
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:53.440]  I have them on video.
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:55.440]  I fucking love Satan, so fuck you.
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:57.440]  I kill my kids.
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:01.440]  Hillary's in the creepy with six-dub-men.
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.440]  She came, she saw, she died.
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:06.440]  She sleeps in the same room
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:08.440]  with that creepy with a woman
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:11.440]  whose mother wears her foot over her head.
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:15.440]  That woman number one is ugly.
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:19.440]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:23.440]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:28.440]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:31.440]  There's a guy on the radio
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:33.440]  who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:35.440]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:37.440]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  Ain't that something?
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:41.440]  I have never seen or smelled
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:43.440]  any woman like that, ever.
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:44.440]  People are telling me she smells.
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:47.440]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:50.440]  We're the roof and fire part there, God bless.
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:54.440]  Goblin' round from after us.
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:57.440]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:00.440]  with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:58.440]  for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:43:59.440]  This was going to be a big loss
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:01.440]  because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:02.440]  for a year and a half fight,
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:03.440]  but we have the original producer,

[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:13.440]  It's been bottled.
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:15.440]  The labels are being put on today.

[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:37.440]  to reach your goals.

[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:41.440]  infowarstore.com.
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:48.440]  Our grandparents, great grandparents, know that they can food.
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:51.440]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:54.440]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarstore.com.
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:57.440]  With infowar select, it's the full spectrum
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:01.440]  of my patriots supply, one of the top, most respected customers

[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:12.440]  out there.
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:14.440]  But because I private label it, I'm
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:17.440]  able to go below cost on contracts
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:19.440]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:21.440]  But I want to be a market leader,
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:23.440]  and I want you to have storeable food
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  so it's a total win-win.

[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:36.440]  weak emergency supplies.
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:38.440]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.440]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:44.440]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:47.440]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:49.440]  and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:50.440]  infowarstore.com.
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:53.440]  And infowar select, high-quality storeable foods
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:47:07.440]  powered by my Patriot supply.
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  I go out and face these scum.
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:28.440]  That's right.
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:33.440]  We're out from a Democrat office.
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:44.440]  I fucking love babies.
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:46.440]  I kill my kids.
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:48.440]  We've gotten more videos since that
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:50.440]  original cut anyway.
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:52.440]  They brag about aborting babies.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:54.440]  She lives in the same room
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:56.440]  with that creepy weirdo woman
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:58.440]  whose mother wears her hood up.
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:00.440]  Huma Abedin, whose husband, Anthony Wiener,
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.440]  had to register as a sex offender.
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:07.440]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:09.440]  I'm torn her hand.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:11.440]  Obama just stink.
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:16.440]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:19.440]  There's a guy on the radio
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  who apparently trumps on his shoulder
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:22.440]  frequently.
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:24.440]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:26.440]  He said we smell like sulfur.
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:27.440]  Ain't that something?
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.440]  I had never seen or smelled
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:31.440]  any woman like that, ever.
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:33.440]  People are telling me she smelled.
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:35.440]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:40.440]  Oh, that's right.
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  They just reopened the Jeffrey Epstein pedophile case files
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:52.440]  only for unnamed attorneys trying to silence it.
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:01.440]  Maybe we're just in hell.
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:14.440]  Yeah, we realized it here.
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:28.440]  You just had like 50 stabbings in a week in London.
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:31.440]  It's really working over there.
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:43.440]  I was watching Fox News I worked out this morning
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:45.440]  and they had the police chief on making excuses
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:47.440]  from that town of Minnesota.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:49.440]  And they had the Fox News host.
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:51.440]  This is the fair and balance channel going.
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:53.440]  Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:56.440]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:58.440]  a bombing and Hillary's on him.
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.440]  And she's got some really good points.
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:06.440]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, you just had in Maryland
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:11.440]  a radical Islamic terror attack thwarted by the authorities.
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:14.440]  A young gentleman was planning a truck attack
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:18.440]  to kill as many non-Muslims as possible.
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:20.440]  I've got a couple more news stories to cover
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.440]  before I sign off.
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.440]  I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour as well.
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:24.440]  I'll open up the phone lines.
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:28.440]  Before I get into that, Vice featured Katelyn Bennett
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:30.440]  in a piece of theirs.
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:33.440]  We air that piece on the Alex Jones show now.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.440]  A young Yakuuni, Katelyn Bennett took some fun
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:38.440]  college graduation photos at Kent State.
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:40.440]  Oh, shit.
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:41.440]  Okay.
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:43.440]  She came through with the drink.
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:44.440]  Oh, nigga, it's a graduation.
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:46.440]  First of all, that's not even a look.
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:47.440]  That good.
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:48.440]  Just not going with that dress, Katelyn.
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:49.440]  Wow.
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:50.440]  Flop.
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.440]  Wow.
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:53.440]  I would award some nude pumps, not those black heels.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:54.440]  It's funky for you.
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:55.440]  Oh.
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:56.440]  She got her gun in a basketball shop
[02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  and the shoes from Charlotte Roots.
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:00.440]  Now that I graduated from Kent State,
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.440]  I can finally arm myself on campus.
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:04.440]  Today, Katelyn went on Fox and Friends
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:05.440]  to own the Liberals.
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:06.440]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:07.440]  Cup getting libertarian.
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:08.440]  Yeah.
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:09.440]  Got you, libtards.
[02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:12.440]  Why did you want to carry a gun on campus?
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:14.440]  Because Mad Niggas was gunning for me.
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:20.440]  Simply to express my second amendment right.
[02:51:20.440 --> 02:51:21.440]  Also...
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:22.440]  I have beef with a little tang.
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:23.440]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:24.440]  She's not playing out here.
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:27.440]  We were doing an event where we just opened a discussion
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:29.440]  to people to come talk to us about gun rights
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:32.440]  and my cameraman got assaulted.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:34.440]  If we had a firearm present,
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:36.440]  I definitely believed that wouldn't have happened.
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:37.440]  So you would have killed him?
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:38.440]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:39.440]  You would have.
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:40.440]  It wouldn't have happened
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:42.440]  because I would have clapped his ass.
[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:45.440]  I was not expecting the blatant racism
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:46.440]  that's been thrown at me.
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:47.440]  Why?
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:48.440]  What's racist?
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:49.440]  Because the gun's black?
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:52.440]  Yo, you're not going on Ellen.
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:53.440]  I'm sorry.
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:54.440]  I'm sorry, though.
[02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:55.440]  You got to at least...
[02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:56.440]  Even the Yolen kid is like,
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:57.440]  nah, you wild it.
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:51:58.440]  That's too much.
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:51:59.440]  I would do it again
[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:01.440]  and I wish that I could do it
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:03.440]  with a fully automatic machine gun.
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:04.440]  And, uh, you know...
[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:05.440]  Yo!
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:06.440]  Yo!
[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:07.440]  Yo!
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:09.440]  Yo, get the f*** out of here!
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  Get the f*** out of here!
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:13.440]  I know everyone else in school is like,
[02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:14.440]  yo, I'm glass.
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:15.440]  She's gone.
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:16.440]  That was crazy.
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:19.440]  And she's a senior brother.
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:22.440]  She really brought the gun to graduation.
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:23.440]  Well, back off, guys,
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:25.440]  because I know you're hot and bothered,
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:26.440]  but she has a man.
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:27.440]  That's right.
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:28.440]  Dun, dun, dun.
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:30.440]  And in Seth Curry,
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:31.440]  this guy's a man
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:33.440]  definitely ambiguous.
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:35.440]  He looks like a little Fortnite character.
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:37.440]  I can't tell what ethnicity is.
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:39.440]  Like, he's about to protect the gap.
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:40.440]  Bruh, he really...
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:41.440]  Wow!
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:42.440]  Bruh, he's dead ass,
[02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:43.440]  looks like a Curry brother.
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:44.440]  He's white and black at the same time.
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:46.440]  I can't... I can't...
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:48.440]  I can't get offended.
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:50.440]  Night roleplay, Caitlyn.
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:51.440]  Wow!
[02:52:51.440 --> 02:52:52.440]  Roleplay.
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:54.440]  You found the male Meghan Markle.
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:57.440]  You sly fox.
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:52:58.440]  He's like,
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:52:59.440]  am I black lives matter or blue lives matter?
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:00.440]  You'll never know.
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:01.440]  He's like, yo, look at the lineup.
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:03.440]  Like, the haircut says black.
[02:53:03.440 --> 02:53:04.440]  The shirt says white.
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:05.440]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:06.440]  Like, I don't know...
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:07.440]  How is this...
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:08.440]  This is not considered racist.
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:09.440]  I'll definitely be like white.
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:10.440]  Oh, because they're black.
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:11.440]  He's throwing us off, man.
[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:13.440]  With the boot cut kind of thing with the jeans.
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:14.440]  It's kind of boot cut.
[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:15.440]  If a conservative did a segment like this,
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:17.440]  they'd be called racist.
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:18.440]  Which, I don't care.
[02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:19.440]  I mean, say whatever you want.
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:20.440]  I love logic.
[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:23.440]  None of this even makes sense to me.
[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:25.440]  It's not even funny.
[02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:34.440]  What the hell did I just watch?
[02:53:34.440 --> 02:53:36.440]  That is the dumbest thing.
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:37.440]  What is that?
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:38.440]  No, seriously, what is that?
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:39.440]  I don't know what that is.
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:42.440]  Is that a show on TV?
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:43.440]  I guess the crew doesn't know either.
[02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:46.440]  They're just giving me silence over here.
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:58.440]  You know, I don't claim to be a comedian
[02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:00.440]  or a funny person here.
[02:54:00.440 --> 02:54:01.440]  But let me just tell you,
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:04.440]  the jokes that we have and the fun that we have here
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:09.440]  unscripted on Infowars is funnier than that.
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:10.440]  I didn't get...
[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:12.440]  But you know what, here's a funny thing
[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:14.440]  that I'm a little confused about.
[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:17.440]  Because these two guys, these two black guys,
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:19.440]  first of all, you're allowed to make racial jokes
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:20.440]  if you're black, I guess.
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:22.440]  If you're white, you can't know you can.
[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:24.440]  They'll just get called racist.
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:25.440]  But that's neither here nor there.
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:26.440]  I really don't care about that.
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:28.440]  And I'm sure these guys are fine.
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:29.440]  We'd probably get along.
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  But I'm a little confused about something here
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:39.440]  because, I mean, growing up to me,
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:43.440]  I had the most propaganda, if you would say,
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:47.440]  pro-gun propaganda, came from black people.
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:51.440]  It came from, like, the rap and hip-hop industry.
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:53.440]  Like, it was all about having your gun.
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:55.440]  And then they sit there and they say,
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:56.440]  whoa, is she threatening to kill someone
[02:54:56.440 --> 02:54:57.440]  because she has a gun?
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:02.440]  Again, this comes from the entertainment culture.
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:03.440]  I mean, it's like, yeah, yeah,
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:04.440]  you're in a situation in a movie
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:05.440]  and then what happens?
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:07.440]  Somebody flashes the gun.
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:09.440]  Like, that doesn't mean you're going to kill them.
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:10.440]  That means, yeah, I'm here.
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:11.440]  I got protection.
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:14.440]  Like, you know, don't mess with me.
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:16.440]  But this is really just low IQ humor.
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:19.440]  And they're just trying to pick at low-hanging fruit.
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:21.440]  They probably don't even believe half the crap they say on air.
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:24.440]  They just say it because they just want to be,
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:25.440]  I guess, entertaining or funny.
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:28.440]  But yeah, I mean, like, what happened?
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  Like, so, I mean, gun culture comes from black culture.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:38.440]  Like, the gun culture isn't something
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:40.440]  that's just from white people.
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:41.440]  Like, I don't get it.
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:43.440]  Like, you couldn't even watch a rap video
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:48.440]  from the late 90s without seeing a gun.
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:50.440]  Oh, but if a white girl does it,
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:53.440]  like, somehow it's cultural.
[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:56.440]  It's a cultural thing and she's threatening to kill you.
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:55:59.440]  If she shows you have a firearm for protection,
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:02.440]  whatever, my IQ just went down from that.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:03.440]  Wow.
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:06.440]  So, I'm going to really have to find a way
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:13.440]  to get my IQ back up from that low-level nonsense.
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:14.440]  Wow.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:16.440]  That's the kind of dribble that people put out.
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:20.440]  And, you know, it's so funny because of the internet era
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:22.440]  and the ability to go live
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:25.440]  and use all these different social media platforms,
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:27.440]  it's creating a lot new, there's a lot of new content,
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:29.440]  you know, a lot of options of content.
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:32.440]  And it's just so funny.
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:34.440]  I'm not trying to be rude to people out there.
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:35.440]  And I don't know who these guys are.
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:36.440]  Maybe they have a big following or whatever.
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:37.440]  I don't know their politics.
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:39.440]  Like I said, I'm sure we'd probably even get along.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.440]  But it's just funny to me to see all this new content
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:45.440]  sprouting up.
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:47.440]  And I'm encouraging it.
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:48.440]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  I'm encouraging people to go do new YouTube stuff
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:51.440]  and to go do stuff for themselves.
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:59.440]  It's just funny to me how, I mean, like, for example,
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.440]  Infowars, I don't know how to properly analyze this.
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:06.440]  All this new stuff that's cropping up,
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:09.440]  because mainstream television news is trying to get behind it,
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:10.440]  basically.
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:12.440]  Because you've got organically people sprouting up
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:16.440]  and making a name for themselves like Candace Owens.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:18.440]  You know, she didn't need to be promoted
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:20.440]  by television news to do her thing.
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:23.440]  But there's all this other stuff that television
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:26.440]  and major mainstream outlets are trying to do
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:29.440]  to get in on the Internet content revolution.
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:31.440]  And it just sucks.
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:32.440]  It just sucks.
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:33.440]  Like, it all fails.
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.440]  Like, how many Comedy Central shows have they had
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:39.440]  where they make fun of Alex Jones and make fun of Infowars,
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:41.440]  and they come and go overnight?
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:42.440]  It's not working, guys.
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:45.440]  Go with real content.

[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:10.440]  I know from using this myself the last few months
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:12.440]  and from seeing my friends and family use it
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:14.440]  that this new product is going to end up being

[02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:40.440]  Your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current run-down systems,
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:43.440]  it's time to go big and go home with the pro-pure
[02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:49.440]  whole house filtration system today.
[02:59:49.440 --> 03:00:15.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:15.440 --> 03:00:41.440]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:46.440]  I'm not sure where to go here.
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:51.440]  Honestly, to be honest, I'm still in shock from whatever I just watched in the last segment.
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:52.440]  My IQ is still low.
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:53.440]  I'm trying to get it back up.
[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:56.440]  I've already drank all my turbo-force.
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:01.440]  It comes in the sachet.
[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:05.440]  So I'm just trying to recover my IQ from that low IQ segment that I just witnessed.
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:10.440]  I don't even know what it was.
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:13.440]  I may have to do a second turbo-force or take some brain-force or something
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:16.440]  because this is just out of control.
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:21.440]  Let's do clip 20 actually and maybe put an end cap on this story.
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:26.440]  Yeah, guys, New York City Health Department puts Yeshiva schools in Williamsburg
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:30.440]  on notice on unvaccinated students.
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:35.440]  Neighborhood officials say the vast majority of Orthodox Jews in Williamsburg are vaccinated,
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:38.440]  but because this community is so tightly knit,
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:42.440]  even a few anti-vaxxers is causing the measles outbreak to grow.
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:45.440]  There is no religious exemption on the measles.
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:46.440]  This is unbelievable.
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:53.440]  All prominent rabbis have issued declarations clearly stating that everyone should vaccinate.
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:57.440]  Gary Schlesinger of Parkair Community Health Network in Williamsburg
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:01.440]  is trying to reverse false information being spread about the measles vaccine
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:03.440]  through the Orthodox community.
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:06.440]  They're spreading this information through hotlines,
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:09.440]  some publications, I've seen some mailings.
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:11.440]  Since the measles outbreak began in October,
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:17.440]  the health department says there have been 285 reported cases in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community,
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:22.440]  246 of which are children, and so far 21 people have been hospitalized.
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:24.440]  I think five active cases right now.
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:26.440]  This is all over-reported.
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:28.440]  It's like what they do with gun violence.
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  We'll face fines or possibly be shut down.
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:33.440]  Yes, me, I say do it.
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:37.440]  Now, DeBlasio says $1,000 fine if you don't vaccinate.
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:40.440]  It's people that are afraid, damaging.
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:42.440]  City Councilman Steven Levin represents Williamsburg.
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:47.440]  Every child has to be registered, and so we requested the schools to do this.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:51.440]  In Rockland County, there have been 167 cases of measles.
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:56.440]  Friday, a Supreme Court judge blocked an executive order banning unvaccinated children from public...
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:02:59.440]  Yeah, because that's illegal, good for the judge.
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:04.440]  It's only going to spread unless we fix the problems in the system.
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:06.440]  You know what? Pause this. Pause this.
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:08.440]  I'll tell you.
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:21.440]  You know, I kind of have a new outlook on life because of stuff like this.
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:27.440]  And it's actually helping me kind of accept my insomnia now.
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:31.440]  Where it's like I don't even try to sleep half the time anymore.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:37.440]  But it's moments like this where I actually think I'm living in a video game.
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:40.440]  These people can't be real.
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.440]  Because is there any applied logic here?
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:50.440]  How is it if you're vaccinated, you're worried about getting measles?
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:56.440]  And if the vaccine doesn't work, then why are you taking it?
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:04:02.440]  And then overall, above it all, why are you for medical tyranny?
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:06.440]  Religious exemption? You say doesn't exist? Alright, finish the report.
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:12.440]  Around New York State, it's only going to spread unless we fix the problems in the system.
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:16.440]  And the problems are we have way too much of a requirement.
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:22.440]  New York City ordered Ushivas to ban unvaccinated students in December, but says one in Williamsburg did not comply.
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:24.440]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you. You know what?
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:29.440]  This is a total confirmation. They're running a medical test in New York, folks.
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:34.440]  They're running a medical test on these Jews in New York. That guy's probably part of it right there.
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:36.440]  Right there.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:40.440]  Who's park air? Did we ever find out what park air is?
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:42.440]  Oh, there's de Blasio.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:44.440]  We have clear penalties.
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:46.440]  Yeah, the guy who employs pedophiles.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:50.440]  This is medical tyranny, man. This is...
[03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:52.440]  That's my red line right there.
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:54.440]  Nope.

[03:05:55.440 --> 03:06:19.440]  I'm talking to the crew. I'm actually struggling to put words to this.
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:25.440]  What about all the big medical tests that they've done with syphilis on black people and AIDS?
[03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:30.440]  Folks, we're all guinea pigs for the vaccine program if you really want to get down to brass tacks.
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:35.440]  But what's happening in New York right now to this Jewish community?
[03:06:35.440 --> 03:06:40.440]  You better watch out because I think they're testing something on y'all up there right now.
[03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:44.440]  Forced vaccinations.
[03:06:44.440 --> 03:06:49.440]  Finds if you don't get vaccinated. Telling you you can't go out in public.
[03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:51.440]  Folks, they're running a test.
[03:06:51.440 --> 03:07:01.440]  They are testing something right now in those vaccines on people in New York and specifically that Jewish community.
[03:07:01.440 --> 03:07:03.440]  Print that one up, media matters.
[03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:09.440]  And while you're printing that up, please link to the story about how governments tested when they injected Americans with plutonium.
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:11.440]  Did you forget about that one?
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:17.440]  The ones when they injected Americans with syphilis? The ones where they patented AIDS?
[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:21.440]  You sick freaks.
[03:07:21.440 --> 03:07:24.440]  So yeah, go ahead and put this one.
[03:07:24.440 --> 03:07:33.440]  Infowars conspiracy theorist Owen Schreuer says that forced vaccinations in New York is a big medical test on Jewish community.
[03:07:33.440 --> 03:07:36.440]  Print that one, media matters.
[03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:39.440]  See, that's when they don't print it. It's when I want them to print it.
[03:07:39.440 --> 03:07:43.440]  Like, I want you to print that. You think that makes me look bad?
[03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:47.440]  I'll look like a genius in 20 years when it comes out.
[03:07:47.440 --> 03:07:54.440]  Folks, this is not a coincidence.
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:08:02.440]  Please don't be this naive, ladies and gentlemen, that this tight-knit Jewish community happens to be where they're rolling out this test case
[03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:05.440]  and that they're going to find you if you don't take a vaccine.
[03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:08.440]  They're telling you can't go in public if you don't take a vaccine.
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:13.440]  But folks, wake up and smell the coffee, please.
[03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:21.440]  They sprayed an entire community of black people in St. Louis to see how they would respond to an adjuvant in the spray.
[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:23.440]  Sprayed an entire building.
[03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:26.440]  Came out years later. Government does this all the time.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:28.440]  And I think they're doing it right now.
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:30.440]  But that's what I'm saying.
[03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:40.440]  People in the break was telling me, since when is measles such a big deal unless you have an autoimmune disorder or you have a very weak immune system
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:43.440]  because you're up in there in age, it doesn't even matter.
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:44.440]  Here's the story.
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:50.440]  Army scientists secretly sprayed St. Louis with radioactive particles for years to test chemical warfare technology.
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:55.440]  Folks, wake up. Wake up.
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:58.440]  You are a guinea pig.
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:01.440]  You are a guinea pig for the New World Order.
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:07.440]  They're testing vaccines on you right now.
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:10.440]  5G is coming.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:12.440]  You're a guinea pig for 5G.
[03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:13.440]  But you know what?
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:16.440]  They've already done the experiments.
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:23.440]  They're going to blast you to death with 5G and they're going to make you upload yourself to a machine.
[03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:25.440]  It's all happening right now.
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:29.440]  It's all happening literally right now.
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:33.440]  Wow.
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:36.440]  I'm just floored by this.
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:44.440]  I just can't believe that this happens and people are just so clueless.
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:47.440]  This is scary.
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:49.440]  This is really scary.
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:52.440]  You got to understand, man.
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:55.440]  You don't know what they're putting in those vaccines.
[03:09:55.440 --> 03:09:58.440]  And look, I know people that make vaccines.
[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:03.440]  I've had people in my family that have actually been scientists on top vaccines.
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:04.440]  I'm not saying they're bad people.
[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.440]  I'm not even saying you guys are involved.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:12.440]  You guys are just running the scientific tests to produce the vaccines.
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:17.440]  Then they're rolling it out on a test case basis for multiple things.
[03:10:17.440 --> 03:10:19.440]  See if they can force you to take it.
[03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:21.440]  See what adjuvants they can get in there to make you take it.
[03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:24.440]  See what response people have to the adjuvants.
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:33.440]  And then who knows what else they're putting in there.
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:38.440]  I tell you, my heart hurts right now for New York.
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:40.440]  My heart hurts for you guys.
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.440]  What a beautiful state.
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:47.440]  And it's just, they're running a massive test right now with these vaccines, folks.
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:52.440]  They're literally running a massive test right now.
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:54.440]  And the measles is the excuse.
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:57.440]  And the American public are so ignorant.
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:02.440]  And you know what it is, honestly, and we all fall victim of this.
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:06.440]  Oh yeah, Ron Rosenstein's sister is the director.
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:07.440]  Or former director.
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:12.440]  I don't know if she still is, but I digress.
[03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:18.440]  I just, it's just so bad, man.
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:20.440]  Cuomo says America's never great.
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:25.440]  De Blasio has top staffers or huge monster pedophiles.
[03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:27.440]  Now they're forcing you to vaccinate.
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:30.440]  I mean, this is, this is bad news, man.
[03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:32.440]  This is bad news.
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:41.440]  And if they successfully do this in New York over measles, I can't believe this, man.
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:45.440]  This is like them saying they're going to force vaccinate for chicken pox.
[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:50.440]  I mean, folks, the measles is not that big of a deal.
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:51.440]  It's not.
[03:11:51.440 --> 03:11:55.440]  And I know it can be deadly for certain people, but overall it's not.
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:12:00.440]  I can't, honestly, there was a measles outbreak in Brazil.
[03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:03.440]  When I was down in Brazil two years ago, there was a measles outbreak.
[03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:06.440]  And they tested people coming back for measles.
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:11.440]  And Brazil, you have to take a measles vaccine in Brazil.
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:17.440]  In fact, it's so bad down there, every Brazilian has a scar on their arm from all the vaccines they take.
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:18.440]  Think about that.
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:26.440]  I mean, you want to talk Mark of the Beast in the flesh, but then there's a measles outbreak.
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:35.440]  I literally lived with an individual in Brazil who had measles for a week, for a week.
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:36.440]  You know what they told her?
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:41.440]  They said, you know, just don't, you're contagious.
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:43.440]  So, you know, wear a breathing mask.
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:44.440]  Don't touch stuff.
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:45.440]  Don't share germs with people.
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:48.440]  Most of the time she wasn't even wearing a breathing mask.
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:51.440]  She had a little bit of a swollen cheek.
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:55.440]  Her and her boyfriend were, you know, they didn't stop engaging in any activity.
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:56.440]  I'll just put it that way.
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:57.440]  He never got the measles.
[03:12:57.440 --> 03:12:58.440]  I never got the measles.
[03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:00.440]  I was hanging out with her for a week.
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:04.440]  I'm still here.
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:09.440]  I just can't believe they're going to get away with this.
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:11.440]  All right.
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:13.440]  All right.
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:14.440]  It's fine.
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:15.440]  It's fine.
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:17.440]  Just medical tyranny is here, folks.
[03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:20.440]  Just know that medical tyranny is here.
[03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:28.440]  And if they can get away with forced vaccinations and whatever tests they're running up there in New York, all bets are off.
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:32.440]  All bets are off, folks.
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:38.440]  I'm going to open up the phone lines and I'm going to take calls for the rest of the broadcast.
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:39.440]  Okay.
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:42.440]  So, I'm going to go ahead and give out the phone number right now.
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:45.440]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:50.440]  1-877-789-2539.
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:52.440]  You can call in on any topics.
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  Ilhan Omar, forced vaccines.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:03.440]  I'd say those are the two leading topics for today, though.
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:08.440]  Man.
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:18.440]  That's, I mean, when I think about, I mean, because you got to really actually kind of dig into your own consciousness and think about what your red line is.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:27.440]  I mean, what really, what is the moment where you really, like what they were saying about Caitlin Bennett,
[03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:29.440]  like, you know, I got a gun?
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:34.440]  I mean, what moment is it that you really, when someone's going to, when you really like, kind of take it from my cold dead hands?
[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:36.440]  Because I thought about this.
[03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:38.440]  I mean, even gun confiscation.
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:41.440]  Like, would you be willing to die?
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:47.440]  Would you be willing to get in that firefight if somebody came door-to-door gun confiscation?
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:53.440]  And for that part of me is like, well, I mean, I'd probably end up getting railroaded and die later,
[03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:56.440]  but I'm not sure if I was in that instance, maybe, depending on the situation.
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:14:59.440]  Forced vaccines? No.
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:01.440]  No.
[03:15:01.440 --> 03:15:02.440]  No.
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:08.440]  I already consciously, I already philosophically, I already intellectually know that's my red line.
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:18.440]  I'm telling you, even gun confiscation, even if they came to my house, I'm still unclear in my own head about whether I would actually go out in that firefight.
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.440]  But let me tell you something.
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:24.440]  Forced vaccines, I already, I'm already consciously philosophically, that's my red line.
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:25.440]  No.
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:27.440]  But if you want a microchip, that's the other thing too.
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:34.440]  If you come to my door and tell me that you have to give me a microchip or tell me that you have to vaccinate me,
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:38.440]  well, you're not going to need to vaccinate me when you're done with me because I'll be dead.
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:40.440]  Because it ain't happening.
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:42.440]  You're not putting a microchip in me, I'm human.
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:46.440]  You're not going to force vaccinate me, I have rights.
[03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:47.440]  I have freedoms.
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:49.440]  That is medical tyranny.
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:53.440]  America, please reject medical tyranny.
[03:15:53.440 --> 03:15:58.440]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:15:59.440]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:02.440]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:08.440]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:09.440]  I can help you too.
[03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:12.440]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:14.440]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:22.440]  Call 800-34-no-tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:28.440]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:31.440]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:37.440]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:41.440]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.440 --> 03:16:44.440]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:47.440]  The deep state began with World War I.
[03:16:47.440 --> 03:16:52.440]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:56.440]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:16:59.440]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.

[03:17:53.440 --> 03:17:59.440]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:06.440]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down.
[03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:10.440]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:13.440]  we've gone through two permutations.
[03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:16.440]  The seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source,
[03:18:16.440 --> 03:18:19.440]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:24.440]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:25.440]  That's been incredible.
[03:18:25.440 --> 03:18:32.440]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:38.440]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:46.440]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:50.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:53.440]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:18:53.440 --> 03:19:00.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:04.440]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:09.440]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:10.440]  It's made in the USA.
[03:19:10.440 --> 03:19:16.440]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:17.440]  and it supports the m4.
[03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:19.440]  It is a classical 360-win.
[03:19:19.440 --> 03:19:23.440]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:29.440]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:34.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:39.440]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be

[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:46.440]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:19:49.440 --> 03:20:00.440]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfowarsLive.com.
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:32.440]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.

[03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:06.440]  My IQ sunk drastically listening to that dribble.
[03:21:06.440 --> 03:21:10.440]  I had to hit some BrainForce just to get my IQ back up to operable levels.

[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:32.440]  So someday, they're going to have to change that saying from the best thing since sliced bread
[03:21:32.440 --> 03:21:35.440]  to the best thing since Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel.
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:39.440]  That's on sale right now at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:54.440]  I really do love my Alexa Pure Breeze air filter.
[03:21:54.440 --> 03:21:56.440]  I got a couple of them at my home.
[03:21:56.440 --> 03:22:02.440]  And if you have pets specifically, you will really appreciate the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:22:02.440 --> 03:22:08.440]  I mean, it helps with dandruff and hair, but really with the odor more than anything.
[03:22:08.440 --> 03:22:12.440]  It's just incredible. In fact, sometimes I'm not going to lie.
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:19.440]  Sometimes my Alexa Pure Breeze is a little rude because I'll walk by and it'll turn on.
[03:22:19.440 --> 03:22:22.440]  It's basically telling me I stink.
[03:22:22.440 --> 03:22:25.440]  So it does have a bit of an attitude.
[03:22:25.440 --> 03:22:28.440]  It will turn on if you have body odor.
[03:22:28.440 --> 03:22:31.440]  It will turn on to rid the air of those odors.
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:34.440]  Yes, that's how strong the Alexa Pure Breeze is.
[03:22:34.440 --> 03:22:43.440]  I've got a little tortoise, not so little anymore, but my tortoise farts from across the room and the Alexa Pure Breeze kicks on.
[03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:47.440]  So if you have a pet, you will really appreciate the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter
[03:22:47.440 --> 03:22:54.440]  and free shipping right now store-wide to orders inside the United States.
[03:22:54.440 --> 03:22:59.440]  All right, let's go out to our great audience here on the Alex Jones show.
[03:22:59.440 --> 03:23:04.440]  Let's begin. Let's go to my friend, Maga Titan in Florida.
[03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:08.440]  Well, technically at Roger Stone, I think, owes you the bullhorn,
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:12.440]  but I'm not sure if he can legally even touch a bullhorn right now.
[03:23:12.440 --> 03:23:16.440]  So we may have to find another plan, but Maga Titan joins me.
[03:23:16.440 --> 03:23:18.440]  He kicks it off today on the Alex Jones show.
[03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:20.440]  Go ahead, Maga Titan.
[03:23:20.440 --> 03:23:25.440]  Well, besides that bullhorn, I still love you, but I'm so freaking pumped right now.
[03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:27.440]  You want to know why, Owen?
[03:23:27.440 --> 03:23:28.440]  I want to know why.
[03:23:28.440 --> 03:23:35.440]  I just received super mail vitality, brain force, and ultimate fish oil for 70 bucks.
[03:23:35.440 --> 03:23:38.440]  I didn't even have to pay for shipping.
[03:23:38.440 --> 03:23:43.440]  Now, I've heard if you take the ultimate fish oil at night, you can talk to Santa Claus.
[03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:50.440]  Oh, listen, I saw Santa Claus twice last night, and, you know, Alex is right about that.
[03:23:50.440 --> 03:23:53.440]  But, you know, in all seriousness here, this is life-changing.
[03:23:53.440 --> 03:23:57.440]  I've got before pics, after pics are coming soon.
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:23:58.440]  That is life-changing.
[03:23:58.440 --> 03:23:59.440]  Get your product.
[03:23:59.440 --> 03:24:00.440]  Wait a second.
[03:24:00.440 --> 03:24:01.440]  Hold on a second.
[03:24:01.440 --> 03:24:02.440]  Wait a minute.
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:03.440]  Before and after.
[03:24:03.440 --> 03:24:08.440]  So did you do some like a cleanse or a body transformation or something?
[03:24:08.440 --> 03:24:10.440]  Oh, let me tell you something.
[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:16.440]  Before I decided to actually commit and diet and take the product, I was a flop.
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:20.440]  I was what you would call liberal.
[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:23.440]  And it actually woke me up and, you know, it changed my life.
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:24.440]  I mean, it really is.
[03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:29.440]  I mean, super male vitality gives your Wang weight.
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:30.440]  Wow.
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:32.440]  That's a punchline right there.
[03:24:32.440 --> 03:24:35.440]  That's a cell, that's a cell line right there.
[03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:41.440]  Well, listen, in all seriousness, you know, we're talking about the forced vaccine.
[03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:42.440]  It would never happen.
[03:24:42.440 --> 03:24:43.440]  I'll which you own.
[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:46.440]  I just, you know, we cannot, it could never happen.
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:49.440]  Not for me, at least not for anybody I know.
[03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:54.440]  They want to dumb down the conversation to reparations, so we don't think about these things.
[03:24:54.440 --> 03:24:56.440]  How about reparations for all Americans?
[03:24:56.440 --> 03:25:02.440]  How about reparations for us who had to, you know, go through GMO and the fluoride in the water?
[03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:05.440]  You know, and how about chemtrails or stratosphere?
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:06.440]  Yeah.
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:07.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:14.440]  See, see, that's, that's, that's actually a good, that's a good twist off of their reparations narrative.
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:21.440]  Yeah, how about reparations for all of us that have paid for foreign wars that we were lied into, like the Gulf of Tonkin?
[03:25:21.440 --> 03:25:27.440]  I mean, so that, yeah, yeah, and then, but you know, I don't even, it's an interesting angle,
[03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:32.440]  but it's not like, I don't want to go with the yang thing where he has the freedom dividend and he just gives everyone a thousand bucks a month.
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:36.440]  I just don't think handouts do anything, but I like the intellectual twist.
[03:25:36.440 --> 03:25:43.440]  It's like, oh, if we're going to do reparations, let's talk about reparations for the Americans that have been affected by all of it.
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:49.440]  The chemtrails, the lying us into war, or, or, or, you know, I think Trump should actually come out and say, you know what?
[03:25:49.440 --> 03:25:51.440]  We should do slave reparations.
[03:25:51.440 --> 03:25:55.440]  If you were a slave, come contact the White House.
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:25:58.440]  And if you ever owned a slave, come contact the White House.
[03:25:58.440 --> 03:25:59.440]  We'll take care of you.
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:00.440]  Guess what?
[03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:02.440]  No one's going to be contacting the White House.
[03:26:02.440 --> 03:26:03.440]  It's all a word game.
[03:26:03.440 --> 03:26:04.440]  It's all mind games.
[03:26:04.440 --> 03:26:05.440]  They're all lawyers.
[03:26:05.440 --> 03:26:06.440]  They're all actors.
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:07.440]  They're all fake.
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:08.440]  They're all that.
[03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:09.440]  That's what they do.
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:10.440]  They're paid to lie.
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:16.440]  They've sold out to the system, whether it's a satanic system, whatever it is, it's demonic, it's evil.
[03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:18.440]  It's anti-American and we're done with it.
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:19.440]  We see them.
[03:26:19.440 --> 03:26:20.440]  We'll never go back to sleep.
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:22.440]  We're making true the mainstream again.
[03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:24.440]  They will never shut us down.
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:25.440]  Oh, we're already the mainstream.
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:26.440]  That's what frustrates them so much.
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:30.440]  That's one of the biggest con jobs that they play is that we're not mainstream.
[03:26:30.440 --> 03:26:31.440]  We're not popular.
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:34.440]  We kick CNN's ass up and down the sidewalk.
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:40.440]  Brian Stilter can't even get out of bed before Infowars has run 300 laps around them.
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:44.440]  That's what makes them so mad and we have the greatest audience in the world that supports us.
[03:26:44.440 --> 03:26:49.440]  That's what makes them even more mad that they can't shut us down like you, Magatine, that supports us.
[03:26:49.440 --> 03:26:54.440]  I'm looking forward to seeing your before and after pics.
[03:26:54.440 --> 03:26:59.440]  I always like seeing transformation because it is hard.
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:07.440]  I mean, it's hard to have a busy day and then have enough energy to have the discipline to commit yourself to being physically as fit as you can be.
[03:27:07.440 --> 03:27:08.440]  So I admire that.
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:09.440]  So I'm looking forward to that.
[03:27:09.440 --> 03:27:14.440]  Well, listen, I literally got in a car accident after I met you at the Alex Jones rally.
[03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:15.440]  We hung out.
[03:27:15.440 --> 03:27:18.440]  We had a blast over there in Texas, shot off in Texas.
[03:27:18.440 --> 03:27:22.440]  I had a blast over there even though it's liberal, you know, city over there.
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:23.440]  We love it.
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:24.440]  We had a great time over there.
[03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:25.440]  But I got in a car accident for three months.
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:27.440]  I couldn't work out bad shoulder pain.
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:29.440]  And I wasn't really even taking the product.
[03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:30.440]  And I gained weight.
[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:31.440]  People see it in the videos.
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:32.440]  Man, gained weight.
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:34.440]  You know, and took the parts again.
[03:27:34.440 --> 03:27:39.440]  And man, I'll tell you what, right now it's a whole new life for me and the girl of my dreams.
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:40.440]  Literally.
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:41.440]  All right.
[03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:42.440]  Let's g-rated.
[03:27:42.440 --> 03:27:43.440]  Family audience here.
[03:27:43.440 --> 03:27:44.440]  Calm it down.
[03:27:44.440 --> 03:27:45.440]  Almost in the bag.
[03:27:45.440 --> 03:27:46.440]  Almost in the bag.
[03:27:46.440 --> 03:27:47.440]  That's it right there.
[03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:52.440]  Where can people see your before and after testimony from the Info Wars live products?
[03:27:52.440 --> 03:27:53.440]  It's coming soon.
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:27:54.440]  But I just put a video out.
[03:27:54.440 --> 03:27:55.440]  It's about seven minutes long.
[03:27:55.440 --> 03:27:59.440]  And I've got my friend, Roberto, the fake liberal who actually tried the product.
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:03.440]  But at Magga underscore tight, tighten on Twitter and Magga tighten on Facebook.
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:07.440]  You can see the video there where he actually tries it out and you'll have a great last
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:09.440]  watch it all the way to the end.
[03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:10.440]  All right.
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:11.440]  There you go.
[03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:13.440]  Magga Titan calling in from Florida.
[03:28:13.440 --> 03:28:14.440]  Good to hear from you today.
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:15.440]  All right.
[03:28:15.440 --> 03:28:19.440]  When we come back, I'm going to continue to pile drive through all these calls.
[03:28:19.440 --> 03:28:22.440]  I'm going to, I'm going to do my best to take every caller.
[03:28:22.440 --> 03:28:29.440]  If we've taken your name, I'm going to do my best to take every caller whose name is
[03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:33.440]  on the board in the last two segments of the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:39.440]  But make my job easier by going to infowarstore.com in this break, buying some toothpaste, buying
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:44.440]  the DNA force plus, buying the brain force plus, buying an electropure breeze air filter.
[03:28:44.440 --> 03:28:49.440]  Make my job easier by supporting us at infowarstore.com so that I can have more time to take your
[03:28:49.440 --> 03:28:52.440]  calls and we will do that on the other side.
[03:29:19.440 --> 03:29:35.440]  It's totally improved.
[03:29:35.440 --> 03:29:56.440]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:29:56.440 --> 03:29:58.440]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:29:58.440 --> 03:29:59.440]  It is.
[03:29:59.440 --> 03:30:05.440]  If you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:06.440]  it.
[03:30:06.440 --> 03:30:07.440]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:30:07.440 --> 03:30:12.440]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:30:12.440 --> 03:30:13.440]  You've got the children's.
[03:30:13.440 --> 03:30:14.440]  You've got the adults.
[03:30:14.440 --> 03:30:15.440]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:30:15.440 --> 03:30:19.440]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:23.440]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[03:30:23.440 --> 03:30:24.440]  burps.
[03:30:24.440 --> 03:30:25.440]  And I'm just sorry.
[03:30:25.440 --> 03:30:26.440]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:30:26.440 --> 03:30:27.440]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:30:27.440 --> 03:30:28.440]  It's so good.
[03:30:28.440 --> 03:30:29.440]  It might be.
[03:30:29.440 --> 03:30:31.440]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:30:31.440 --> 03:30:34.440]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:30:34.440 --> 03:30:37.440]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:30:37.440 --> 03:30:45.440]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:30:45.440 --> 03:30:48.940]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[03:30:48.940 --> 03:30:51.440]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:30:51.440 --> 03:30:54.440]  I just can't do it.
[03:30:54.440 --> 03:30:56.440]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:30:56.440 --> 03:30:57.440]  Go ahead.
[03:30:57.440 --> 03:30:59.440]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:30:59.440 --> 03:31:02.440]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:31:02.440 --> 03:31:04.440]  It just gets old, man.
[03:31:04.440 --> 03:31:06.440]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:31:06.440 --> 03:31:09.320]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:31:09.320 --> 03:31:13.440]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:31:13.440 --> 03:31:16.440]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:31:16.440 --> 03:31:19.440]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:31:19.440 --> 03:31:21.440]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:31:21.440 --> 03:31:23.440]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:31:23.440 --> 03:31:24.440]  You know what, Alex?
[03:31:24.440 --> 03:31:25.440]  Put him on pause again.
[03:31:25.440 --> 03:31:26.440]  Hey, Frank.
[03:31:26.440 --> 03:31:30.440]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear.
[03:31:30.440 --> 03:31:31.440]  We're under attack.
[03:31:31.440 --> 03:31:32.440]  We need your help.
[03:31:32.440 --> 03:31:36.440]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:31:36.440 --> 03:31:39.440]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:31:39.440 --> 03:31:41.440]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:43.440]  I need your help, Frank.

[03:32:52.440 --> 03:33:21.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.440 --> 03:33:28.440]  The secrets of the universe.
[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:31.440]  You already have all of them.
[03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:34.440]  Built into your own existence.
[03:33:34.440 --> 03:33:35.440]  Your own consciousness.
[03:33:35.440 --> 03:33:37.440]  Just waiting.
[03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:40.440]  Waiting for you.
[03:33:40.440 --> 03:33:44.440]  To harness the power of the universe.
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:46.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:46.440 --> 03:33:49.440]  We're going to be taking your calls for the next two segments.
[03:33:49.440 --> 03:33:52.440]  I want to mention a couple of things before I commit to that.
[03:33:52.440 --> 03:33:54.440]  Just to make this connection.
[03:33:54.440 --> 03:33:59.440]  Because there's more news coming about the lady that got in the Mar-a-Lago event.
[03:33:59.440 --> 03:34:00.440]  She had a bunch of cash.
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:02.440]  She had a bunch of high-advanced technology.
[03:34:02.440 --> 03:34:04.440]  Basically, it was a spy, is what it's looking like.
[03:34:04.440 --> 03:34:06.440]  This woman was a spy.
[03:34:06.440 --> 03:34:09.440]  For who or what, still being debated.
[03:34:09.440 --> 03:34:14.440]  But definitely sent in as a spy, was paid to be there.
[03:34:14.440 --> 03:34:23.440]  And I think that that's the main reason why Trump had fired the Secret Service Director.
[03:34:23.440 --> 03:34:26.440]  Michael Cohen, who's trying to get out of jail time by saying,
[03:34:26.440 --> 03:34:28.440]  Oh, I can give you more with Trump.
[03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:30.440]  I can give you more with Trump.
[03:34:30.440 --> 03:34:31.440]  Michael Cohen, you're a traitor.
[03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:32.440]  You're a rat.
[03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:33.440]  You're a loser.
[03:34:33.440 --> 03:34:39.440]  And if you thought for one second, you could work with these corrupt jack.
[03:34:39.440 --> 03:34:40.440]  You know what?
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:42.440]  And get out of jail.
[03:34:42.440 --> 03:34:44.440]  So I guess you learned the hard way.
[03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:46.440]  You rat.
[03:34:46.440 --> 03:34:50.440]  You.
[03:34:50.440 --> 03:34:52.440]  All right.
[03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:54.440]  Black holes picturing the heart of darkness.
[03:34:54.440 --> 03:34:58.440]  So now CERN is apparently about to, I think it's CERN.
[03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:00.440]  It could be wrong about that, actually.
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:04.440]  I mean, who knows how many black holes CERN has made or whatever else they're doing.
[03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:06.440]  But somebody, I read this story.
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:07.440]  I forget who it was.
[03:35:07.440 --> 03:35:10.440]  Somebody's literally about to make a black hole and then take a picture of it.
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:12.440]  I'm sure nothing will go wrong with that.
[03:35:12.440 --> 03:35:16.440]  Brain zaps boost memory and people over 60 studies finds folks.
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:18.440]  They've already had this technology.
[03:35:18.440 --> 03:35:23.440]  They already know how to access parts of your brain using electrical frequencies.
[03:35:23.440 --> 03:35:26.440]  But maybe now it's about to come out to the public though.
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:27.440]  All right.
[03:35:27.440 --> 03:35:29.440]  Oh, one more thing.
[03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:36.440]  For the second day in a row, I did the avocado challenge where I take a bag of avocados to Democrat offices.
[03:35:36.440 --> 03:35:38.440]  There's two offices here in Austin.
[03:35:38.440 --> 03:35:42.440]  I'm telling you, I think I'm living a Mandela effect because there were literally three the other day
[03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:45.440]  and I had planned on hitting all three of them this week.
[03:35:45.440 --> 03:35:47.440]  And then I went and looked and now there's only two.
[03:35:47.440 --> 03:35:50.440]  So I think they Mandela affected me out of one of those videos.
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:52.440]  But maybe that's from CERN.
[03:35:52.440 --> 03:36:00.440]  But if you want to watch my avocado video, you can go to my Twitter at all I do is Owen.
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:02.440]  My name is Beto right now.
[03:36:02.440 --> 03:36:03.440]  So people are kind of confused.
[03:36:03.440 --> 03:36:06.440]  I changed my name from Owen Troyer to Beto just to troll the dens right now.
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:08.440]  I'm just going to leave it up there for a minute.
[03:36:08.440 --> 03:36:16.440]  But we'll air that in the war room, which airs three to six p.m. Central weekdays at infowords.com.
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:20.440]  That's where I'm normally hosting, filling in for Alex while he's out.
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:22.440]  Now, let's go to your phone calls.
[03:36:22.440 --> 03:36:24.440]  Let's make them quick guys.
[03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:27.440]  I want to take as many as possible starting with Jim in California.
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:29.440]  Go ahead, Jim.
[03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:31.440]  How you doing, Owen?
[03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:33.440]  Good. Thanks for calling.
[03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:38.440]  Today, I know that you and Alex both are pretty smart guys.
[03:36:38.440 --> 03:36:40.440]  You read the Bible, I understand.
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:42.440]  At least you seem to.
[03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:54.440]  Is there any time that you have considered that the days you're living in now is the end of what Jesus called it, Matthew 24.14.
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:36:56.440]  The conclusion of the system of things.
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:36:59.440]  Well, more and more.
[03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:01.440]  That's a tough one.
[03:37:01.440 --> 03:37:09.440]  I would say that, you know, revelation is being revealed more and more, not to sound redundant.
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:13.440]  So yes, as far as that's concerned, but there's more of that.
[03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:17.440]  There's more metaphysical things that I go through in my mind.
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:22.440]  And when I see stuff, I'm almost beginning to wonder if we're actually in hell right now.
[03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:25.440]  We're actually in hell already.
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:31.440]  Look up what the word hell means, you're not. It's very interesting.
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:36.440]  I was looking up definitions of words and where they come from, and I thought, here's one that was interesting for you.
[03:37:36.440 --> 03:37:41.440]  The word Satan comes from a root word that means liar.
[03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:45.440]  And the word devil comes from the root word that means manslayer.
[03:37:45.440 --> 03:37:52.440]  And so when you think of these liars that are in the government right now, it's like, wow.
[03:37:52.440 --> 03:37:55.440]  Even Jesus said that they were like their father.
[03:37:55.440 --> 03:37:57.440]  They're liars like their fathers.
[03:37:57.440 --> 03:37:59.440]  And it fits so well.
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:03.440]  But I just wondered, because that was something that I consider.
[03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:10.440]  I think that you're, I'm speaking for myself, I guess, but I think a lot of people feel the same way.
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:17.440]  Your understanding, your interpretation of the Bible kind of changes with time, with age, with experience.
[03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:25.440]  And so I could definitely say that's the case for me, and just the way I kind of read the Bible now has even changed.
[03:38:25.440 --> 03:38:29.440]  But I grew up in a Catholic household, Christian household.
[03:38:29.440 --> 03:38:32.440]  I went to Catholic school and then a Christian high school.
[03:38:32.440 --> 03:38:35.440]  So I mean, I always grew up reading the Bible, studying religion.
[03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:40.440]  I had to take world religion classes, so I'm very familiar with all of it.
[03:38:40.440 --> 03:38:45.440]  But your interpretation and everything kind of changes over time, I think, with age and experience.
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:51.440]  And you start to learn that some of the things, because language changes over time,
[03:38:51.440 --> 03:38:57.440]  and you start to learn that some of the things in the Bible are written or said,
[03:38:57.440 --> 03:39:06.440]  and they're not even, in my opinion, meant to be interpreted or perceived in our current existence, in our current dimension.
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:16.440]  And I don't know if that makes sense, but that's kind of how I feel about it now in my older age, after experiencing what I've experienced in the world
[03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:21.440]  and what I've experienced spiritually and what I've experienced the side of good and the side of evil.
[03:39:21.440 --> 03:39:26.440]  But that's a loaded question, Jim. I don't know if I could, I'd have to keep going on that.
[03:39:26.440 --> 03:39:29.440]  I'm just going to leave it there and move on, but thank you for the call.
[03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:32.440]  Let's go to Phil in Ohio. Go ahead, Phil.
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:38.440]  I, oh, and God bless you and all those involved and dedicated.
[03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:44.440]  I have what I think may be a possible moneymaker for the fight.
[03:39:44.440 --> 03:39:52.440]  Start with MACA to MAGA.
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:58.440]  Make America Christian again, along with make America great again.
[03:39:58.440 --> 03:40:08.440]  Probably be adapted to a T-shirt best, but put the crucifixion cross at the top,
[03:40:08.440 --> 03:40:17.440]  and then under MAGA, put the word stand, and then the American flag.
[03:40:17.440 --> 03:40:21.440]  I think that kind of says it all.
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:32.440]  We put Jesus first, and if we do that and get in a fight, if anybody's going to win, it'll be us.
[03:40:32.440 --> 03:40:35.440]  Well, there you go. You just put the idea out there.
[03:40:35.440 --> 03:40:39.440]  And so if anybody wants to manifest that, they can.
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:43.440]  I mean, we've got so many T-shirts at InfoWars store, and then so many ideas we came and put out.
[03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:50.440]  Honestly, I don't even want to get involved with that because, well, again,
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:52.440]  I mean, we have so many T-shirts already.
[03:40:52.440 --> 03:40:59.440]  If we put out every T-shirt idea, nobody would buy any because we just watered down our own products.
[03:40:59.440 --> 03:41:04.440]  But it is a good idea, Phil, but maybe that's something you can make or if somebody wants to manifest that idea.
[03:41:04.440 --> 03:41:08.440]  But yeah, make America Christian again. That's one I haven't heard yet. That's an original.
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:13.440]  All right. Thanks for the call, Phil. Let's go to Mike in Texas. Go ahead, Mike.
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:15.440]  Hey, Olin. Can you hear me?
[03:41:15.440 --> 03:41:16.440]  Yep.
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:20.440]  Hey, I just wanted to say thank you so much for your products.
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:26.440]  I bought thousands of dollars for DNA force and the protein bars, and it's all so good.
[03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:29.440]  It's changed my life. It's changed my fiance's life.
[03:41:29.440 --> 03:41:33.440]  The iodine literally changed my best friend's life in one night.
[03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:37.440]  He woke up the next morning. It was awesome.
[03:41:37.440 --> 03:41:39.440]  I just wanted to say thank you for that.
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:42.440]  Well, thank you. Thank you, Mike. You make it all possible.
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:45.440]  I mean, we would not be here if it wasn't for people like you supporting us.
[03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:47.440]  So thank you.
[03:41:47.440 --> 03:41:55.440]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I am in total agreement that it's a really bad precedent with that measles vaccine right now.
[03:41:55.440 --> 03:42:01.440]  Because just like you said, especially with the relatively benign ones, like if they can get us to all agree to take them,
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:07.440]  then what else can they do? And with this time with 5G and the blockchain, you know,
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:12.440]  it's going to be potentially really possible in our lifetime for them to not just control us at this level,
[03:42:12.440 --> 03:42:19.440]  but to potentially even control our consciousness with blockchain technologies and certain things like that.
[03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:25.440]  I wanted to at least notify the public that there's a project called E-Residency in Estonia.
[03:42:25.440 --> 03:42:30.440]  The Pope has an E-Residency card. Obama has one. Trevor know us.
[03:42:30.440 --> 03:42:35.440]  So there's like big, big things going on with Bitcoin and Ethereum Enterprise Alliance.
[03:42:35.440 --> 03:42:41.440]  E-Residencies. E-Residency cards. That's a new one to me, Mike. I've never heard of that.
[03:42:41.440 --> 03:42:44.440]  We got to go to break, Mike. Thank you so much for the call.
[03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:49.440]  By the way, if there's ever been one person that I immediately change the channel, it's Trevor Noah.

[03:47:31.440 --> 03:47:40.440]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show. I want to give a shout out to Infowars Army Houston. In fact, I apologize. I'm working on other things all fair.
[03:47:40.440 --> 03:47:50.440]  I forgot to go talk to the social media folks to see if we ever got in touch with you guys, but Infowars Army Houston had a sign hold event over a bridge.
[03:47:50.440 --> 03:47:58.440]  Wanted to give you guys some love and there's a video some leftist came over and it was apparently triggered and crying over. It's okay to be a white sign.
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:10.440]  So we may try to link up with them and get them on the war room. I'm also going to have them air my avocados for Dems part two on the war room.
[03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:18.440]  So that's all coming up at three o'clock at infowars.com slash show infowars.com slash war room. That's where I'm normally hosting but filling in for Alex today.
[03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:26.440]  We're taking your calls. I just asked the callers. Yeah, there's the video right there from Houston Infowars Army Houston out on the scene.
[03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:41.440]  You guys are just the best. I love you guys. And there's the leftist. But see, you notice the difference like if you approach a conservative or a Trump supporter with a differing idea or with anything, they'll talk to you.
[03:48:41.440 --> 03:48:47.440]  But if you approach a liberal or a Democrat with a different idea, they shut you up and kick you out.
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:58.440]  All right, guys, just if you could keep the calls to 60 seconds because I'm going to try to squeeze through six calls here. Let's start with Eric in Ohio. Go ahead, Eric.
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:02.440]  Hey, Owen, how's it going? Can you hear me? Okay. Yes, go ahead.
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:12.440]  Okay, great. I was just watching a little bit ago on C-SPAN three, the hate crimes and white nationalist.
[03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:15.440]  Are you talking about the Candace Owens thing?
[03:49:15.440 --> 03:49:26.440]  Yes, the Candace Owens thing. I switched over from you guys to check out, see what was going on. Obviously, it was down on C-SPAN three, a little bit hard to find for people.
[03:49:26.440 --> 03:49:38.440]  But I looked at it and I'm like, when I looked it up online, it was just about hate crimes. Now, if you look on C-SPAN three, it specified hate crimes and white nationalists.
[03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:49.440]  So it's even like C-SPAN, which I believe is publicly funded, I might not be right on that, is also trying to cause that wedge, that wedge into American society.
[03:49:49.440 --> 03:50:00.440]  You know, actually now, since you're C-SPAN, I actually think it's privately funded. It's a cable broadcasting system.
[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:14.440]  Where it gets funding, though, that's actually a good question. I'm not sure if it's public or not. We can look into that. But there's no doubt that all avenues are being used right now to attack anything that's America or divide America.
[03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:30.440]  So yeah, but what they've done is they've levied this false equivalency on America's consciousness that nationalism equals white nationalism. White nationalism equals white supremacy.
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:40.440]  Therefore white supremacy equals racism. Therefore, following that formula, nationalism equals racism.
[03:50:40.440 --> 03:50:48.440]  So here it is. C-SPAN Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network is a private nonprofit company created by the cable television industry as a public service. No government funding.
[03:50:48.440 --> 03:50:59.440]  Yeah, I thought it was all funded by cable networks. But regardless, they do their own political stuff. It's all leaning left over there anyway, just because that's the political correct nature of it.
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:10.440]  But no, this is the left saying that, again, nationalist equals white nationalist equals white supremacy equals racist. Therefore, the formula nationalism equals racist.
[03:51:10.440 --> 03:51:18.440]  So yeah, if you're Candace Owens, who's black, you're a white nationalist. If you're Ben Carson, who's black, you're a white nationalist.
[03:51:18.440 --> 03:51:30.440]  So if you're a Latino American that puts America first, you're a white nationalist. So this is just the delusion. This is just the deranged, quite frankly, mental illness of the left in America today.
[03:51:30.440 --> 03:51:36.440]  Thanks for the call, Eric. Let's go to Christian calling in from Texas. Go ahead, Christian.
[03:51:36.440 --> 03:51:37.440]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:51:37.440 --> 03:51:39.440]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:51:39.440 --> 03:51:48.440]  Okay, so I just wanted to expand on what you were talking about earlier from the Jewish community in New York and how they're being targeted.
[03:51:48.440 --> 03:51:57.440]  So recently my kids, they got the flu. And I guess you can say I was brainwashed because I've been given them vaccines since they were born.
[03:51:57.440 --> 03:52:08.440]  And this year they got the flu shot. I took them to a local immunization center where they pretty much give you free vaccines or Medicaid vaccines.
[03:52:08.440 --> 03:52:19.440]  And I honestly believe that there was something in that vaccine that caused them to get the flu this year because I have never had a problem with them catching anything.
[03:52:19.440 --> 03:52:27.440]  Well, I can already tell you what was in the vaccine that gave them the flu. It was the flu. The vaccine gave them the flu.
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:31.440]  Yeah, they gave them a weakened flu.
[03:52:31.440 --> 03:52:38.440]  But you know, just as a principal thing, because you said something, the Immunization Center giving out free vaccines, I want to explain something.
[03:52:38.440 --> 03:52:49.440]  I'm not talking to you, but just overall, nothing is free, folks. If somebody's saying it's free, there's a string attached.
[03:52:49.440 --> 03:52:57.440]  Like, I don't know what people haven't learned about this yet. Like they say Facebook is free. No, they take all your data. Using Google is free.
[03:52:57.440 --> 03:53:02.440]  No, they take all your data. Like all these companies say, oh, it's free. No, they take all your data.
[03:53:02.440 --> 03:53:08.440]  So I don't know what they're taking or what they're testing with these quote unquote free vaccines, but I promise you they're not free.
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:11.440]  Anything else, Kristen?
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:27.440]  And also, I have a blood disorder and I got my spleen removed when I was 11. And according to doctors, I have to get vaccines for the rest of my life to prevent infection. And I have not had a vaccine since I was a little girl.
[03:53:27.440 --> 03:53:35.440]  And I'm fine. I never get sick. You know, my kids have the flu, like I said, and we're fine. I don't have the flu. I'm okay. So, you know,
[03:53:35.440 --> 03:53:45.440]  Yeah, it's all fear mongering because they had it's the same thing like a doctor will jump to write you a prescription. It's all big business. It's all money. It's all money.
[03:53:45.440 --> 03:53:51.440]  Push the vaccines, make more money. Push the pills, make more money. It's medical charity. Thanks so much for the call, Kristen.
[03:53:51.440 --> 03:53:56.440]  Let's go to Shamar. I hope I'm pronouncing that right in Washington. Go ahead, Shamar.
[03:53:56.440 --> 03:53:58.440]  No, it's Shamir.
[03:53:58.440 --> 03:54:00.440]  Shamir. Go ahead, Shamir.
[03:54:00.440 --> 03:54:04.440]  There we go. So I'm 70 years old.
[03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:08.440]  Wow. You sound great for a 70 year old. So good for you. Go ahead.
[03:54:08.440 --> 03:54:22.440]  Yeah. Anyway, when when I was a child, my mother, if she found out somebody had the chicken pox, the measles or the mumps, we would go visit them.
[03:54:22.440 --> 03:54:32.440]  Okay. I was the oldest of seven children. We were all exposed to those diseases before we became teenagers.
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:38.440]  Okay. And from then on, we had a lifetime immunity.
[03:54:38.440 --> 03:54:48.440]  Yeah. And this is common practice. Soon, you know what though? Soon they'll say that that's child abuse. Soon CPS will come to your door for doing that.
[03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:54.440]  I remember when I was a kid, and I don't know if I've always had a strong immune system. I've got a pretty good immune system now.
[03:54:54.440 --> 03:55:02.440]  I remember my mom may correct me on this later, but I remember because my neighborhood is pretty tight knit and a lot of kids.
[03:55:02.440 --> 03:55:09.440]  And when the kids my age all got chicken pox, I remember intentionally, and it's not like my parents even told me they were doing this.
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:14.440]  They wanted me to go play with the kids that chicken pox. They said, we want you to get chicken pox. Here's why I said, okay, fine.
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:21.440]  I like going to play whatever. I'll go play with my friends. And when it first happened, I think I didn't get them.
[03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:25.440]  And they kept trying to get me chicken pox. And I couldn't get them. And they're like, well, maybe he had them before.
[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:29.440]  And then my sister got them who's younger. And I think I may have got them on the second wave. I can't remember.
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:41.440]  But the point is, yeah, you used to do that. And that's kind of like natural organic vaccines is getting the disease when you're young and have a strong immune system so that then you can't hurt you or come back and get you again when you're older.
[03:55:41.440 --> 03:55:52.440]  I bet you, I bet you, if the medical tyranny industry gets its way within 10 years, that'll be considered child abuse.
[03:55:52.440 --> 03:56:05.440]  Well, we knew the dangers of vaccines back in the early 60s, back about 1960. The information was already out there.
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:12.440]  Well, and but people don't read the information now the information's more out there and they still don't read it. So thank you so much for the call.
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:18.440]  All right, one more call. Let's go to Leo in Boston. Final caller of the Alex Jones show today. Go ahead, Leo.
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:28.440]  Yeah, we're going to get December 15th on equal footing with July 4th. Do you know what that is all about?
[03:56:28.440 --> 03:56:34.440]  I'm trying to remember. I know the date is something, but I'm not going to waste time. So go ahead.
[03:56:34.440 --> 03:56:37.440]  1791. 10 is the clue.
[03:56:37.440 --> 03:56:39.440]  I'm sorry, what?
[03:56:39.440 --> 03:56:44.440]  10 is the number clue to what I'm talking about.
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:59.440]  It's a bill of rights that needs equal rights with just July 4th. Anyway, the problem is we have a duopoly and they won't tell the truth and they don't let anybody in won't play games with the duopoly.
[03:56:59.440 --> 03:57:07.440]  We've got to deal with Saudi Arabia and the elephant in the room that won't criticize them. Do you know who I'm talking about?
