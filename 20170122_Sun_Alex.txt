[00:00.000 --> 00:23.200]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:23.200 --> 00:24.200]  Move, bitch!
[00:24.200 --> 00:28.200]  Get out of the way!
[00:28.200 --> 00:34.200]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:34.200 --> 00:38.200]  Info wars help to rule the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:38.200 --> 00:42.200]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:42.200 --> 00:43.200]  I will not let you down.
[00:43.200 --> 00:48.200]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.200]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:50.200 --> 00:56.200]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:56.200 --> 00:59.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here live in studio.
[01:07.200 --> 01:11.200]  It is Sunday, the 22nd day of January 2017.
[01:11.200 --> 01:13.200]  We're going to be here for the next two hours.
[01:13.200 --> 01:19.200]  And Lord willing, I'll return tomorrow with the weekday transmission, 11am to 3pm central as well.
[01:19.200 --> 01:23.200]  That's 12 noon to 4pm Eastern.
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.200]  Donald Trump is over delivering.
[01:25.200 --> 01:34.200]  Even CNN and others basically came out and said he doubled down, quadrupled down on his populist America first rhetoric.
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.200]  He signed an executive order that begins the repeal of Obamacare.
[01:38.200 --> 01:47.200]  He's got the votes of the House and Senate to gut the entire thing and give women off time to take care of their children and free healthcare to poor people.
[01:47.200 --> 01:49.200]  That cost about a third as much.
[01:49.200 --> 01:51.200]  This is not a big banker ripoff.
[01:51.200 --> 01:56.200]  He's already gotten billions and billions and billions, hundreds of billions of jobs back.
[01:56.200 --> 02:02.200]  He's already gotten a trillion, 200 billion in more money in the stock market.
[02:02.200 --> 02:13.200]  Everything from carrier to Ford to Chrysler's coming back to Detroit and back to places like Texas and of course, Kentucky.
[02:13.200 --> 02:15.200]  I did a lot of interviews on the ground while I was there.
[02:15.200 --> 02:19.200]  We're going to have to go through these this week and kind of do a compilation of the more important moments.
[02:19.200 --> 02:24.200]  There's a bunch of videos, you saw them live on Facebook mentions down here on the radio and TV.
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.200]  When one would say, what has Trump done for jobs?
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.200]  And I'd say, well, I would do the litany.
[02:32.200 --> 02:34.200]  She'd say, oh, you're making that up.
[02:34.200 --> 02:40.200]  And I'd say, no, I mean, I started showing them on my phone that Chrysler was coming back in Ford.
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.200]  They'd go, well, well, I'm just not going to comment on that.
[02:45.200 --> 02:50.200]  She'd say, he's a billionaire. He's rich.
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.200]  He doesn't care about little people as if there aren't good billionaires and bad billionaires.
[02:55.200 --> 03:03.200]  Zuckerberg's that calls his users dumb efforts and openly wants to enslave the planet versus a Donald Trump that wants to empower people.
[03:03.200 --> 03:06.200]  And that's the difference here.
[03:06.200 --> 03:08.200]  Total class warfare, total class envy.
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.200]  We got Lee and Mac to do coming in the next hour.
[03:10.200 --> 03:21.200]  I'm going to show you exclusive proof that the entire operation was funded by the CIA and George Soros and Gloria Steinem admitting it was a CIA operation to basically break up the family.
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.200]  Oh, we've got footage of it.
[03:24.200 --> 03:26.200]  Yeah, nobody's really ever seen this.
[03:26.200 --> 03:27.200]  Get ready.
[03:27.200 --> 03:28.200]  It's coming up.
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.200]  I mean, I guess they saw it back on 60 minutes in the 1960s.
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.200]  So it's all coming up, not in my opinion, but what's behind it.
[03:36.200 --> 03:38.200]  But let me just stop here.
[03:38.200 --> 03:46.200]  I'm going to reveal the secrets of Donald Trump and the secrets of the relaunch of America.
[03:46.200 --> 04:01.200]  I've been revealing to you for years and saying what the leader up to and what we should really do and the type of true planetary 1776 that we need a way to take over globalism and use it to empower humanity.
[04:01.200 --> 04:02.200]  Well, guess what?
[04:02.200 --> 04:04.200]  Trump made good in the speech.
[04:04.200 --> 04:12.200]  The whole 23 minutes speech, including the Star Spangled Banner that I know made Obama and Hillary just absolutely curl their toes.
[04:12.200 --> 04:13.200]  We're going to lay it out.
[04:13.200 --> 04:17.200]  But there were a few little tidbits in there you might want to pay attention to.
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.200]  You might want your friends and family to tune in right now because I've talked a lot about this.
[04:22.200 --> 04:25.200]  I've talked a lot about what they call disruptive technologies.
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.200]  I'm not too concerned about the disruptive technologies, you know, that are 200 miles a gallon for gas.
[04:29.200 --> 04:31.200]  Sure, it's bad to suppress that.
[04:31.200 --> 04:34.200]  What about the cures for cancer?
[04:34.200 --> 04:37.200]  Diabetes.
[04:37.200 --> 04:46.200]  Oh, Trump's now in a position where he's being briefed on what they've really got.
[04:46.200 --> 04:53.200]  That's why he said we're about to discover the end of disease and his eyes gleam.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.200]  They are about to not hoard all the technology and deliver to the people folks.
[04:56.200 --> 05:00.200]  This is a magic moment.
[05:00.200 --> 05:10.200]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Info War when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[05:10.200 --> 05:16.200]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[05:16.200 --> 05:23.200]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[05:23.200 --> 05:32.200]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.200]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[05:36.200 --> 05:39.200]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[05:39.200 --> 05:52.200]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[05:52.200 --> 06:00.200]  It is exclusive to InfoWarsLife.com and the InfoWarsLife family of incredible products.
[06:22.200 --> 06:39.200]  Nobody is untouchable. No one is invincible. No one is untouchable by other men, much less God.
[06:39.200 --> 06:54.200]  And God is beginning to cut down the globalists like rats, the corrupt evil communist pope, the communist Chinese, the biggest mass murders in history, Saudi Arabians that oppress women and murder people worldwide.
[06:54.200 --> 07:01.200]  They are all panicking against our new president, Donald John Trump.
[07:01.200 --> 07:06.200]  My gut told me two years ago to get behind Trump, but Ted Cruz had better rhetoric.
[07:06.200 --> 07:11.200]  So I was for him the first few months, but then I saw some things I didn't like.
[07:11.200 --> 07:16.200]  And even before the dirty tricks in Iowa and places, I went for Trump.
[07:16.200 --> 07:22.200]  And I said, my gut's never wrong. And as I get older, I learned to always follow. When I was young, I wouldn't prove me right.
[07:22.200 --> 07:38.200]  And man, I am humbled by President Trump. I am humbled by his discernment, his knowledge, his piercing discernment and analysis.
[07:38.200 --> 07:44.200]  Now, in this first hour, I'm going to air 20 plus minutes of the entire inaugural speech.
[07:44.200 --> 07:50.200]  Some of it is him thanking the Clintons and other presidents, but it's all backhanded because then he says,
[07:50.200 --> 07:56.200]  but now you did a great job doing all this horrible stuff, but now that all comes to an end.
[07:56.200 --> 08:07.200]  And there are tidbits in there. And again, I was, I was there just, just, just, just two days ago.
[08:07.200 --> 08:16.200]  Just right below the podium, witnessing it and the rebirth of America and the biggest piece of news,
[08:16.200 --> 08:21.200]  the biggest Trump secret I'm going to give out here. And you're going to say, oh, I've heard this a bunch the last year on your show.
[08:21.200 --> 08:29.200]  Yes. Trump, but you notice what you hear on the show and even the New York Times and a bunch of other publications had to admit this.
[08:29.200 --> 08:33.200]  What you hear here, you then hear from Trump, but not because Trump's getting it from me.
[08:33.200 --> 08:40.200]  This is the spirit of America and the truth. Do you understand that it's admitted in congressional hearings,
[08:40.200 --> 08:46.200]  that they call it disruptive technologies, a 200 mile to the gallon carburetor.
[08:46.200 --> 08:54.200]  They had 25 years ago. Hell, 40 years ago, they had a hundred and something mile solar panels that basically never break,
[08:54.200 --> 09:01.200]  never go out and that have five times the gathering capacity of the very best systems today, things like that.
[09:01.200 --> 09:08.200]  They're slowly doling out the technology. The elites are on incredible power trips, sequestering it for a breakaway civilization.
[09:08.200 --> 09:12.200]  The future is here. It's just not evenly distributed.
[09:12.200 --> 09:23.200]  Trump intends to flood the entire planet with true globalism, with America as the operating system, the true America,
[09:23.200 --> 09:32.200]  not the modern liberal globalist eugenics America, but really working with people, really standing up for cultures that have good societies,
[09:32.200 --> 09:41.200]  crushing radical Islam and transferring to the public and transferring and ordering the pharmaceutical companies to know,
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.200]  we're not going to treat all these cancers. You're going to give them the cures.
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.200]  When I say cures, some people individually won't respond, but they've got stuff that's 99% effective.
[09:51.200 --> 09:57.200]  The elites are getting it. It's how they're living to 110, 115.
[09:57.200 --> 10:05.200]  So if you're educated and informed, you know all this. And a lot of people under the old globalist model were clamoring to be part of the new civilization
[10:05.200 --> 10:11.200]  that they thought would be separate from humanity. And if they groveled with the new world order, they would get the cancer treatments.
[10:11.200 --> 10:24.200]  They would get the life extension. They could be part of the secret programs and projects that I guess those on Elysium would have access to.
[10:24.200 --> 10:37.200]  That's not happening now. If Trump has his way, the biggest secret of Trump is that he intends to turn loose all these disruptive technologies
[10:37.200 --> 10:45.200]  and to actually let partners have them and to work with Russia and others that also have advanced technologies,
[10:45.200 --> 10:54.200]  because he knows a deal was made to let China take over with economic warfare and let them control the system because they'd proven themselves evil,
[10:54.200 --> 10:59.200]  killing over 100 million of their own people. So our elite went to work with China just like they had meant in the last month.
[10:59.200 --> 11:05.200]  I told you months ago, they'll plan on China propping up world government, China to save this collapsing system.
[11:05.200 --> 11:11.200]  And then they come out in the news in hundreds of publications, communist China to save the new world order and to defeat Trump.
[11:11.200 --> 11:16.200]  You see our own media siding with people that oppress their own population.
[11:16.200 --> 11:21.200]  People ask, especially intelligence agencies and military and others, they go, how does Jones know this?
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.200]  I had the New York Times walk into me and say, you had to talk to Trump. I talked to you.
[11:25.200 --> 11:34.200]  I said, yeah, you tweeted that Trump is going to declare the new American Century in godly providence and invoke God and take the birthright.
[11:34.200 --> 11:43.200]  Did you talk to him? I said, I said, I'm not going to comment because I just talked to him that week. I said, I said, I didn't talk to him about that.
[11:43.200 --> 11:49.200]  I listed that New York Times guy who was just empty sold an intellectual smart but empty sold.
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.200]  And I said, it's the spirit like the sixth sense, the ether, the brain's internet.
[11:54.200 --> 12:03.200]  I said, this is the destiny of America that people 500 years ago in England and Germany and the Netherlands in France envisioned in their minds.
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.200]  This whole future. Hell, 200 years ago, they were envisioning biometrics computers.
[12:08.200 --> 12:13.200]  They drew the double helix before an electron microscope was invented. They knew it.
[12:13.200 --> 12:20.200]  That's how beautiful humans are. And Trump knows that and wants to empower people, not enslave them.
[12:20.200 --> 12:33.200]  He feels small when you're small. The elite are so small, they feel good when you're down on the ditch, poor, a peon.
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.200]  So they're all over the news saying he's destroying the American run world government, the new world order.
[12:38.200 --> 12:45.200]  It's not American run. They used our power, our ingenuity, our system to build it and to destroy it.
[12:45.200 --> 12:58.200]  Build their world government while they destroy us. And they don't deliver any of the promises of the new global Atlantis that they got all the loving, smart, hardworking people to join them.
[12:58.200 --> 13:14.200]  They got so many members of my family in the last 60 years who were all tops of their classes or the best in the army or the best what they did to join them believing they were there to help poor people, believing they were there to deliver technology, believing they were there to really do all this.
[13:14.200 --> 13:27.200]  And it was all a lie. Well, Trump knows about all this and this is now not a lie, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why the enemy of humanity is freaking out, pulling out every stop, having convulsions.
[13:27.200 --> 13:41.200]  Next hour, I'm going to show you what has just recently been re-released from 60 Minutes in 1964. Gloria Steinem of Miss Magazine and the whole feminist movement admitting she worked for the CIA.
[13:41.200 --> 13:53.200]  And the whole plan was to get women to work for the government and to basically end the family. They are so arrogant. They are so evil. This is all coming up in the next hour.
[13:53.200 --> 14:13.200]  Donald Trump's new world order puts nation over globe. Trump challenge the world order. Trump's new world disorder. Will Trump be the end of the Pax Americana? Trump's taking office spells end of the world for 20th century German FM Steinmeier, the end of liberal world order.
[14:13.200 --> 14:28.200]  The liberal world order? I saw him this weekend going, it's the end of the liberal world order. China will save it. He'll save the democratic order as the Chinese president spoke at Davos. China's unelected.
[14:28.200 --> 14:35.200]  China enslaves its people. Trump was elected.
[14:35.200 --> 14:47.200]  Their world government's anti-human, anti-nation state, anti-prosperity. Let me tell you what Russia's involved in. Russia kicked the oligarchs out about 17 years ago and I wasn't sure if it was real for a while.
[14:47.200 --> 14:58.200]  And they started teaching Christianity and family and paying people to have kids and paying people to not eat GMO. And they say they're stopping the vaccines and they're going to be the world distributor of non-GMO food.
[14:58.200 --> 15:08.200]  And the light came back in the Russians' eyes all of a sudden. That was an example of the world. I was already doing this before Russia did it. But they didn't get it from me. They just were rediscovering their humanity.
[15:08.200 --> 15:23.200]  And now Trump and everybody else and Brexit and Spain and Italy pulling out of the Euro. It's happening everywhere. They're in crisis because their world government was admittedly about austerity and starving people and eugenics and anti-human.
[15:23.200 --> 15:34.200]  And it was a breakaway civilization where they steal all the treasure of humanity and give it to themselves, not us.
[15:34.200 --> 15:44.200]  So does Trump take me serious? When his top advisor is his generals, he name it, or listeners, he damn well he does. But his discernment spirit already believes it and knows it and loves it.
[15:44.200 --> 15:58.200]  So people ask why I talk to Donald Trump. Talk to him every day, right here on the air. So get that through your heads, folks, who are freaking out. Yeah. We talk to Donald Trump, the president, every day, and you too.
[16:15.200 --> 16:22.200]  The inside baseball, the current battles and a blueprint for the future and what Trump and others are really planning to do to restore the Republic of Prosperity.
[16:22.200 --> 16:32.200]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium. It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more. And it supports him and it supports info wars and our whole operation.
[16:32.200 --> 16:37.200]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[16:37.200 --> 16:49.200]  So Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing. They're in full crisis mode. National's movements are exploding. Everybody needs to go pre-order. So you get it first at infowarstore.com, the making of a president by Roger Stone.
[16:49.200 --> 16:58.200]  I'm Alex Jones, jumping on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump. Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now. So you're the first to have a trip to you.
[16:58.200 --> 17:08.200]  I respect my audience. I know that our viewers and listeners are among the most informed, pro-liberty, pro-human, God fearing people on the face of the earth.

[18:24.200 --> 18:31.200]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years, people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding, what they really say about them.
[18:31.200 --> 18:38.200]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it. A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[18:38.200 --> 18:42.200]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[18:42.200 --> 18:47.200]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.

[19:57.200 --> 20:21.200]  Check it out for yourself today.
[20:21.200 --> 20:32.200]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:32.200 --> 20:44.200]  So, you don't have to believe me, just listen to Trump's speech. We're about to discover the keys to ending disease and death. The keys to hell and death.
[20:44.200 --> 20:51.200]  All of it, now manifesting. We're about to discover the secrets of energy in the universe and space travel.
[20:51.200 --> 21:00.200]  You look at his face, he just looks happy but disgusting as he's getting the briefings. Everything he was already told by the top generals and the patriots, sir, we've got everything.
[21:00.200 --> 21:03.200]  They've already got it. They don't know how to deliver it to the people.
[21:03.200 --> 21:10.200]  Well, the answer is export the excess population to space. Give people the technology, give them the life extension.
[21:10.200 --> 21:15.200]  Let them know how magic the universe is. Don't keep them diverted with a bunch of NFL and fake culture.
[21:15.200 --> 21:24.200]  You've artificially fed them. Put wind into humanity's sails. And America is not going to just shrink away and not be strong.
[21:24.200 --> 21:28.200]  We're going to be stronger than ever. We've been used to empower the world government.
[21:28.200 --> 21:33.200]  Let me actually start getting to the speech. It'll take the rest of the hour to get to.
[21:33.200 --> 21:40.200]  And then the next hour, guess who was funding? I mean, I already knew this as I checked a few of the groups. I didn't know.
[21:40.200 --> 21:45.200]  I didn't know that 40 of the 52 groups were Soros funded. I said it was obviously Soros.
[21:45.200 --> 21:57.200]  A bunch of women in little pink, purple, color revolution hats screaming, F you white male Alex Jones, go to hell. Hope you die.
[21:57.200 --> 22:05.200]  And then saying, but we love you. Love Trump's hate. And I'm sorry, I said 40 for memory.
[22:05.200 --> 22:09.200]  It's 50 partners of the woman's march on Washington, which is almost every group.
[22:09.200 --> 22:17.200]  The other major group was funded by the Islamic jihad. And I saw all these women, including American, you know, I mean American women,
[22:17.200 --> 22:25.200]  Hispanic, black, white in a jib saying, this is how we empower women. You're bullying Muslims. We're going to put hoods on and go under Islam.
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.200]  Talk about being cuckold. Talk about Stockholm syndrome.
[22:29.200 --> 22:34.200]  Woman's march organizer recently met ex-Hamas operative family as ties to tear group.
[22:34.200 --> 22:39.200]  Yeah, the leader of it is a woman that promotes just like the evidence mother did genital mutilation.
[22:39.200 --> 22:43.200]  She's the leading person pushing it.
[22:43.200 --> 22:51.200]  And that's how women are empowered is wearing hoods, not being able to drive cars being stoned to death if they go outside and don't follow their husband's orders.
[22:51.200 --> 22:59.200]  And I'd bring this up to him. We have a clip coming up next hour where one of our reporters brings it up.
[22:59.200 --> 23:02.200]  And the women go, that's a lie. Trump was funded by Saudi Arabia.
[23:02.200 --> 23:08.200]  Trump got zero money from Saudi Arabia, zero money from Goldman Sachs, zero money from the big globalist, but it doesn't matter.
[23:08.200 --> 23:15.200]  They should scream and spit at us and say he did.
[23:15.200 --> 23:21.200]  And it's just a bunch of weird corporate owned. I mean, I love drudgereport.com. Can we punch that up?
[23:21.200 --> 23:27.200]  I'm a woman. Hear me roar. It's Gloria Stein. I've had a bunch of kids, but she says you shouldn't have a kid.
[23:27.200 --> 23:30.200]  She's proud of abortion. Says, I'll tell you, prove your woman's kill your baby.
[23:30.200 --> 23:33.200]  I'm not attacking you if you had abortion. The point is she makes it a sacrament.
[23:33.200 --> 23:40.200]  And then she's admittedly CIA funded to break up the family, turn men into betas and make us easy to assimilate.
[23:40.200 --> 23:47.200]  And she admits that in a book she wrote and interviews. And there she is out there smiling with her victims.
[23:47.200 --> 23:53.200]  This is how you kill cultures and society. This isn't my opinion. This is declassified.
[23:53.200 --> 23:56.200]  It's all coming up in the second hour.
[23:56.200 --> 24:02.200]  But let's start. Let's start with the beginning.
[24:02.200 --> 24:07.200]  Let's start with the beginning of the speech with the Star Spangled Banner because I was watching the Jumbotron.
[24:07.200 --> 24:12.200]  Because I couldn't see the Obama's. They were kind of back because I was so close. I was looking up at the podium.
[24:12.200 --> 24:18.200]  The only people they were up speaking at it, there was just the top of Donald's head.
[24:18.200 --> 24:21.200]  I could see the rabbi and the preachers, just the top of them.
[24:21.200 --> 24:29.200]  I could see them on the Jumbotron and they just looked so pissed off the whole time.
[24:29.200 --> 24:36.200]  And so entitled because they never worked for this. They were just given it as minions of this corporate takeover.
[24:36.200 --> 24:43.200]  America on its deathbed finally awakened to globalism and said no to it.
[24:43.200 --> 24:47.200]  And you could feel the title resistance surging. They're so scared.
[24:47.200 --> 24:52.200]  So let's just play the intro and him being nice. But I love how he wrote this himself.
[24:52.200 --> 24:55.200]  No president since Kennedy has written a speech himself.
[24:55.200 --> 25:08.200]  I mean, they admit this. I love it.
[25:08.200 --> 25:27.200]  And again, there's also a Star Spangled Banner. We're going to play later. A lot of stations cut away from that.
[25:27.200 --> 25:53.200]  So again, here they are singing. Talking about America the free.
[25:53.200 --> 26:00.200]  Here they are singing America the free. And then Trump comes up and he says, oh, you've done an exceptional job.
[26:00.200 --> 26:05.200]  Yeah, raping the country. But now all that is. And then he gets into the real meat and potatoes.
[26:05.200 --> 26:17.200]  And there aren't words to describe how ultra, how ultra over the top cool this is.
[26:17.200 --> 26:24.200]  Everything he says is dialed into truth. It countermands how America was used to build the tyrannical world government.
[26:24.200 --> 26:32.200]  It was designed to fall after it was set up with all this internal strife and racial strife and strife in the family.
[26:32.200 --> 26:35.200]  And all of that against declassified. All that is admitted.
[26:35.200 --> 26:40.200]  My film in game breaks it down the plan to break down the family, the plan to turn us against each other,
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.200]  the plan to say, don't say have a mother and father, somebody else might not have it.
[26:44.200 --> 26:50.200]  The plan to destroy free speech. America's not perfect, but the ideal of it changed the world,
[26:50.200 --> 26:53.200]  empowered the planet, invented most of the technologies we have.
[26:53.200 --> 26:59.200]  Because the idea of empowering humanity and innovation, the American dream just being 10% realized,
[26:59.200 --> 27:07.200]  created the modern world we have. And then it was hijacked and turned into a system of total control.
[27:07.200 --> 27:10.200]  And the technologies were hidden. They were twisted.
[27:10.200 --> 27:16.200]  They were given to people like the smart phones and other things with back doors and Trojan horse control systems.
[27:16.200 --> 27:19.200]  Think about that.
[27:25.200 --> 27:29.200]  And they dumb the public down to where they say he's rich, he wants to be poor.
[27:29.200 --> 27:34.200]  No, America's about wealth and empowerment and individual liberty and free association.
[27:34.200 --> 27:41.200]  And that creates the incredible wealth. The problem is it then creates a decadence.
[27:41.200 --> 27:44.200]  Now, they come back from break.
[27:44.200 --> 27:51.200]  We're going to go right to Trump's speech and I'm even going to skip the part at the intro to it where he says
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.200]  she chefs us Roberts and Carter and Clinton and all the rest of them.
[27:55.200 --> 28:01.200]  We the citizens of America are now joining a great nation effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all our people.
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.200]  We will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. That's true.
[28:05.200 --> 28:12.200]  We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
[28:12.200 --> 28:18.200]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transition of power.
[28:18.200 --> 28:28.200]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious and throughout this transition.
[28:28.200 --> 28:33.200]  They have been magnificent. Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[28:33.200 --> 28:39.200]  We're going to start there, there. When we come back on the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[28:39.200 --> 28:45.200]  This is the Info War. We're breaking down the secrets that are now being revealed of the real national treasure.
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.200]  It's not a Hollywood movie. What is the American dream?
[28:49.200 --> 28:52.200]  I will break it all down straight ahead.
[28:52.200 --> 28:59.200]  For I alone am your chronicler. Stay with us.
[28:59.200 --> 29:03.200]  Despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works, here's five reasons why it won't.
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.200]  Number one, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.
[29:07.200 --> 29:10.200]  Yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting.
[29:10.200 --> 29:14.200]  Number two, Paris, France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world.
[29:14.200 --> 29:18.200]  But those laws also did nothing to stop the November 13th ISIS attacks.
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.200]  It's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws.
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.200]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago.
[29:28.200 --> 29:33.200]  Yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007.
[29:33.200 --> 29:41.200]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who are openly defying Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense militias.
[29:41.200 --> 29:46.200]  Number five, President Obama has been arming and funding ISIS-linked Syrian rebels for quite some time.
[29:46.200 --> 29:50.200]  In fact, Obama approved the rearming of these so-called moderate rebels on October 1st.
[29:50.200 --> 29:55.200]  The same day he called for gun control in response to the committee college shooting up in Oregon.
[29:55.200 --> 30:17.200]  You can find out more at infowars.com. Let's get Daniels reporting.
[30:26.200 --> 30:32.200]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[30:32.200 --> 30:38.200]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[30:38.200 --> 30:44.200]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[30:44.200 --> 30:51.200]  I'm taking it now every day. This is soaking. Biotru selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.

[33:19.200 --> 33:31.200]  If you want answers, well, so does he. It's Alex Jones.
[33:31.200 --> 33:40.200]  Well, Foxconn has a slave. Nets and the Suicide Nets is announced that they're going to build factories in the U.S.
[33:40.200 --> 33:47.200]  There won't be slaves there, obviously. That's under Trump. All those other big companies are announcing they're coming here as this accelerates.
[33:47.200 --> 34:02.200]  President Trump has declared a new Declaration of Independence for America against the multinational, unelected corporations that have set up a world where it's acceptable for China to have slave factories and have us buy goods.
[34:02.200 --> 34:15.200]  Or it's acceptable for Obama to open up the borders and let people with TB, syphilis, gonorrhea, every other disease you can imagine, even wet leprosy to come into America.
[34:15.200 --> 34:19.200]  These globalists are very evil and they look like demons being exercised yesterday.
[34:19.200 --> 34:25.200]  So let's go into John Roberts administering the oath. Let's go into what happened and then it'll go a little bit of the next hour.
[34:25.200 --> 34:31.200]  I want to start really just getting to this historic speech. I'm just going to write notes here and then have brief comments to analysis.
[34:31.200 --> 34:40.200]  But in the next few days, I'm going to shoot a special report where I break down and decode the larger meanings of what Trump's saying.
[34:40.200 --> 34:47.200]  You know, it's very, very boilerplate. I mean, it's very, very clear. We're going to release the secret technologies, the life extension.
[34:47.200 --> 34:54.200]  We're going to harness the secrets of the universe. We're going to have America lead by freedom again, not by control.
[34:54.200 --> 35:06.200]  So this isn't America. We're link machine control. This is America recognizing and helping dismantle a corrupt world government, a corporate world government that's been set up that we've been used to create.
[35:06.200 --> 35:16.200]  So this is America getting redemption back from the crimes that we've been used to basically commit. This is incredible.
[35:16.200 --> 35:24.200]  And only Donald Trump can write this. He wrote this speech admittedly himself. They made fun of him for it as if a president couldn't write his own speech.
[35:24.200 --> 35:30.200]  Donald Trump is a godsend, ladies and gentlemen. Let's go to a swearing end. Here it is.
[35:30.200 --> 35:40.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor to introduce the Chief Justice of the United States, John G. Roberts Jr., who will administer the presidential oath of office.
[35:40.200 --> 35:42.200]  Everyone please stand.
[35:42.200 --> 36:10.200]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[36:10.200 --> 36:36.200]  That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.200]  So help me God. So help me God. Congratulations, Mr. President.
[37:06.200 --> 37:22.200]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[37:22.200 --> 37:48.200]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[37:48.200 --> 38:02.200]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[38:02.200 --> 38:24.200]  Again, folks, I've heard a lot of this already on the show. We don't have time to ask why was there so much of this info horse. It's not info horse. It's Americana. Here's President 45, now President. Said it couldn't happen. Holds it two years ago it was going to happen.
[38:24.200 --> 38:34.200]  Thank you all for what you've just as Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama.
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.200]  He does this just to be classy. He knows their enemies. And people of the world, thank you.
[38:40.200 --> 38:46.200]  But he knows they're public, some of the brainwashed so he wants to diffuse things as they're creating division.
[38:46.200 --> 39:00.200]  The citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[39:00.200 --> 39:18.200]  We will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
[39:18.200 --> 39:36.200]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[39:36.200 --> 39:48.200]  The truth is they didn't burn Hillary. They have been magnificent. It was Hillary and Soros fighting. Obama actually set it out. I don't want to give him credit, but I'm going to let you know the inside intel. Obama backed off. Keep going.
[39:48.200 --> 40:00.200]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[40:00.200 --> 40:10.200]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[40:10.200 --> 40:18.200]  We are witnessing history. Unbelievable.
[40:18.200 --> 40:37.200]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[40:37.200 --> 40:56.200]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories.
[40:56.200 --> 41:12.200]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs, and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[41:12.200 --> 41:27.200]  Unlimited wealth, I have. With the technology folks, we can have anything. That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.
[41:27.200 --> 41:34.200]  Not the state, but the people. You just did it. You did this. Folks, they've got actuaries.
[41:34.200 --> 41:51.200]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today, and everyone watching all across America. This is your day, this is your celebration, and this, the United States of America, is your country.
[41:51.200 --> 41:57.200]  That's right. The globalists that conquered America, they'd hijacked it. We now have peacefully had a counter to and restored it.
[41:57.200 --> 42:07.200]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[42:07.200 --> 42:25.200]  Let's pause. Back it up. Ten seconds when we come back, we'll continue there. It just gets more epic. If you know what you're hearing. For the first time ever, this isn't about parties. This is about who controls the government. It's about do they stand with the people and prosperity in the billarizing constitution?
[42:25.200 --> 42:34.200]  What do they actually do instead of a bunch of infighting? And then he goes into racially coming together. And by the way, the Trump plan is public.
[42:34.200 --> 42:47.200]  He's always took it out of context. I've met people that have been here 20 years legally that can't become citizens because the Republicans and Democrats made it almost impossible because they want you illegal, poor as a new permanent underclass who they control.
[42:47.200 --> 42:59.200]  No, no, no. Under Trump, you don't have a criminal record. You're hardworking. No matter what color you are, you're here a year or so. You work hard. You do good stuff. Boom. Boom. You're right in. You're a felon. You're gone.
[42:59.200 --> 43:21.200]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic.

[44:28.200 --> 44:38.200]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[44:38.200 --> 44:53.200]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[47:02.200 --> 47:12.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:12.200 --> 47:20.200]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:20.200 --> 47:35.200]  Look, the enemy media has already figured out that we can see for thousands of miles. They've already figured out that we're not playing games. Keep it rolling for a minute.
[47:35.200 --> 47:50.200]  You can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[47:50.200 --> 48:04.200]  I mean this show's not talk folks. This is a real deal. This is Americana. I can't believe how honored I am to be 100% Americana and to be in the zeitgeist and to be part of the plan to launch humanity to the stars.
[48:04.200 --> 48:16.200]  I got goodwill. I want to empower you. I don't want to put you down so I can rule over you. I don't have a competition in me that if somebody else is doing well, I want to destroy them.
[48:16.200 --> 48:28.200]  I want you to do well as long as it's not at my expense and with the large yes in the non-zero sum game, the 360 win as I call it, that we have with technology, it's there.
[48:28.200 --> 48:41.200]  In fact, there's more than you could ever imagine or want to do with what this species can do. Look how far we've come from the fire and the wheel, the spacecraft and all the medicine we have.
[48:41.200 --> 48:53.200]  And the biggest thing from his speech is America's ideas and culture. That's what's going to make us dominate worldwide, but in free trade and openness, globalism is all about making people poor.
[48:53.200 --> 48:59.200]  Nico was just telling me, he said, hey boss, you know, you skip a lot of breaks. You never plug anything. The network's the ones that run all the ads.
[48:59.200 --> 49:07.200]  You want to plug something? Yeah, we're running a special that ends today. We've been running since Christmas. We extended it to call it the inauguration special.

[49:32.200 --> 49:37.200]  We have the amazing and nanotech body armor only available in the military.
[49:37.200 --> 49:52.200]  You know what the crazy part about meeting people in the military who are big listeners and fighting for this country and fighting for Trump is that they don't even tell you don't talk about it.
[49:52.200 --> 50:05.200]  And then you just, it's so crazy that you can't even tell people. I mean, some of it got caught on tape when I was in DC, but one guy, you look like the Flash or who's the guy that's real fast?
[50:05.200 --> 50:14.200]  It was like Ant-Man, but who's the Flash? It's like this guy's attacking me and all of a sudden people are like, is that real? It's like, boom, knock this guy down.
[50:14.200 --> 50:24.200]  And then it's like, it's like, is that even real? Like, oh, we're just here to help you protect you because this is a threat against you.
[50:24.200 --> 50:32.200]  And then after they leave, like, you know, that wasn't like, no, I don't know. Well, that's such as like, it's like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[50:32.200 --> 50:42.200]  But they are hitting this with polonium and killing people though every day. I mean, so to actually watch the real American government come in, like, Alex, you're crazy enough to come down here, watch what happens.
[50:42.200 --> 50:51.200]  And then boom, it's like, I mean, I'm a tough guy. Okay. These guys would probably kick my ass in about 30 seconds.
[50:51.200 --> 51:01.200]  And it's just, it's just so crazy to be in the heart of the American dream now. And it's so real. Everybody can feel it and see it.
[51:01.200 --> 51:07.200]  I got to get to this because Lee has come up about 20 minutes. There's like 13 minutes left to his speech. It's so epic.
[51:07.200 --> 51:20.200]  Let's hear some more of this and I'll try to limit my comments. But this is such an amazing time to be alive. Here's Trump being inaugurated 48 hours ago, right there in the district of criminals as he turns the tide.
[51:20.200 --> 51:30.200]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[51:30.200 --> 51:33.200]  That's it for the people. You never hear that.
[51:33.200 --> 51:45.200]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[51:45.200 --> 51:56.200]  Paul, back it up. This is January 20th is the new July 4th. If we deliver on this, if this happens, if we're moral and good and work hard and do this,
[51:56.200 --> 52:06.200]  in 100 years it will be celebrated as bigger than July 4th. It's a fact. But Trump is doing this selfishly. He loves his kids, his grandkids and the kids to come after that.
[52:06.200 --> 52:16.200]  He understands the continuum. He understands how big this is and that globalism is designed to make us poor.
[52:16.200 --> 52:25.200]  All we got to do is turn that off. It's not that he's even perfect. Again, Donald Trump marked this down is not out to get you.
[52:25.200 --> 52:33.200]  He has a vision and he loves America and he knows about the secret destiny, which in days to come I'll lay out fully, but believe me, folks,
[52:33.200 --> 52:40.200]  life extension technologies alone saying we have them. We're going to give them to you. That's come up in a moment.
[52:40.200 --> 52:48.200]  Yes, people that own chemotherapy patents are not going to make any more money. You already made hundreds of billions shut up.
[52:48.200 --> 52:53.200]  They're like, well, what do we do when people can live to 200? It's going to happen. We'll figure it out.
[52:53.200 --> 52:59.200]  But then we won't be in control of it. I mean, the public, a bunch of dumbasses, we can't give it to them. You made them dumb.
[52:59.200 --> 53:07.200]  How about you die? I don't want to kill you. But stop saying we got to die. We're going to get some of this dirt, dammit.
[53:07.200 --> 53:15.200]  We built it. We made it. Stop it. Latin America and Africa should be jewels. Those are strong good people.
[53:15.200 --> 53:23.200]  They've been suppressed, never got off from under colonialism. We're going to end that and you turn loose the super storm of human potential.
[53:23.200 --> 53:30.200]  I don't care what color you are. That spirit's right. I mean, I'm going to be honest with you just because I don't want to be condescending.
[53:30.200 --> 53:37.200]  Like, oh, I like gay people or I like black people. Oh, really? Some of your best friends, I was out there and there were Indians and black people in the
[53:37.200 --> 53:46.200]  Hispanics, people coming up, speaking on the microphone, early life feeds that were so eloquent. Their spirits were so strong that I didn't feel weak that I was next to the spirit so strong.
[53:46.200 --> 53:56.200]  I felt good like, oh, thank God there's people out there that get it. I just love them so much. And it didn't matter what color skin was, even though, quite frankly, I try to get the best tan I can get.
[53:56.200 --> 54:03.200]  I thought their dark skin looked great. The point was, is I love them as fellow humans and they were my brothers and sisters because they got it.
[54:03.200 --> 54:15.200]  And most of the people I saw that were minorities, they totally understood it and rejected it from the Kenyan driver of my SUV back to the airport to the Mexican driver that picked me up to everybody I met.
[54:15.200 --> 54:28.200]  It was like they were free. But let me tell you, if I saw some black man or Hispanic or whatever person who looked good and was strong and had strength and had a light in their eyes, I knew before I talked to them they loved me or agreed with me.
[54:28.200 --> 54:39.200]  But if I saw somebody who looked like their soul had been sucked out, they hated me. It's spiritual. It's what's in our hearts and what's in these people's hearts that love God and liberty is the same as mine, the same as in Trump.
[54:39.200 --> 54:48.200]  He feels it. He wants to be the one that delivers us. He wants to be the new Moses. He wants to do it.
[54:48.200 --> 54:58.200]  And I don't even want to sit here and say this, but the truth, the truth, Donald Trump's so good, ladies and gentlemen, that I don't even know if we deserve him. He is so fricking strong.
[54:58.200 --> 55:09.200]  He's so high on the spirit. He works 20 hours a day without even coffee and he can't stop working and he just sees every, it's incredible.
[55:09.200 --> 55:13.200]  He's a modern prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:13.200 --> 55:22.200]  I've only got a few minutes to break. I'm going to go as long as I have to to finish this for Leigh Ann. Let's just go back to it. Here it is.
[55:22.200 --> 55:34.200]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.200]  July 4th, party.
[55:38.200 --> 55:40.200]  True collectivism, our will together.
[55:40.200 --> 55:46.200]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[55:46.200 --> 55:52.200]  They've turned us against each other so we don't join wills together. See, they have a false collectivism.
[55:52.200 --> 55:54.200]  The real thing is...
[55:54.200 --> 56:03.200]  You've taken by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[56:03.200 --> 56:09.200]  Back Trump, you go to the stars. You don't. Genocide and death. And the elite are crazy to merge with computers.
[56:09.200 --> 56:17.200]  This movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[56:17.200 --> 56:28.200]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[56:28.200 --> 56:35.200]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people.
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.200]  It's the social contract. You're going to give it to us.
[56:39.200 --> 56:47.200]  Too many of our citizens a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
[56:47.200 --> 56:54.200]  Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
[56:54.200 --> 57:05.200]  An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[57:05.200 --> 57:17.200]  And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[57:17.200 --> 57:25.200]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[57:25.200 --> 57:31.200]  See, it sounds like talk, but if you invoke it, you will have it. See, he knows he says, you have the power.
[57:31.200 --> 57:34.200]  I need you to step into your destiny.
[57:34.200 --> 57:36.200]  We are one nation.
[57:36.200 --> 57:41.200]  Yeah, one nation. They keep saying divide, divide. That we're dividing.
[57:41.200 --> 57:49.200]  We'll be back folks. I'm going to do two more segments to play this. He's getting into the suppressed technologies next.
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the Inauguration Special.
[57:52.200 --> 57:56.200]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the New Year.
[57:56.200 --> 58:02.200]  I'm extending them as the Inauguration Special right through this weekend and then it's over.
[58:02.200 --> 58:05.200]  We have some new products coming out next week, some other sales we're going to be doing,
[58:05.200 --> 58:13.200]  but many of these sales are going to have to come to an end. If you want across the board, massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items like

[1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:10.200]  Watch me! Watch me!
[1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:12.200]  I got something!
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:14.200]  Watch me!
[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:15.200]  Yeah!
[1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:17.200]  I got it! Hey!
[1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:21.200]  I got something that makes me want to shout.
[1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:25.200]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:29.200]  I got something that's super bad.
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:34.200]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:36.200]  And I'm super bad.
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:39.200]  It feels so good.
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:41.200]  Now I gotta move.
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:43.200]  That tells me what to do.
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:45.200]  Sometimes I do.
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:46.200]  Gotta move.
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:47.200]  That tells me what to do.
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:49.200]  I think Trump's gotta move.
[1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:50.200]  That tells him what to do.
[1:00:50.200 --> 1:00:53.200]  And he knows a devil when he sees it.
[1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.200]  Devil doesn't want you to do good.
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:56.200]  He wants to trick you.
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:57.200]  He wants to run your life.
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:59.200]  God wants to empower you and see you grow.
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.200]  Let's go back to the epic speech of President Trump.
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.200]  Here it is.
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:06.200]  We are one nation.
[1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:09.200]  And their pain is our pain.
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:11.200]  Their dreams are our dreams.
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:15.200]  And their success will be our success.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:16.200]  All connected.
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:19.200]  We share one heart, one home,
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:22.200]  and one glorious destiny.
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:24.200]  Now that's the key.
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:26.200]  The oath of office I take today
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:30.200]  is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:36.200]  For many decades.
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:37.200]  Good pause.
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:39.200]  This is too big.
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:42.200]  This oath of office is an allegiance to you.
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:44.200]  I'm no president.
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:45.200]  This is it.
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.200]  That's what he tells you personally and on air.
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:49.200]  I'm not gonna let you down.
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:50.200]  I'm fully committed to you.
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:51.200]  I'm gonna do the best I can.
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:53.200]  And he does it.
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:55.200]  And I can't believe how dumb the leftists were out on the trail.
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:57.200]  They don't think Trump brought any jobs back.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:59.200]  When he was president-elect, he was already doing it.
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:00.200]  Let's go back.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.200]  Enriched foreign industry
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.200]  at the expense of American industry
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.200]  subsidized the armies of other countries
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:11.200]  while allowing for the very sad depletion
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:14.200]  of our military.
[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:17.200]  We've defended other nations' borders
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:20.200]  while refusing to defend our own.
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:27.200]  And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:31.200]  while America's infrastructure has fallen
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:35.200]  into disrepair and decay.
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.200]  We've made other countries rich
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.200]  while the wealth, strength and confidence
[1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:46.200]  of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:50.200]  One by one, the factories shuttered
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:54.200]  and left our shores with not even a thought
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:58.200]  about the millions and millions of American workers
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:01.200]  that were left behind.
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:03.200]  The wealth of our middle class
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:06.200]  has been ripped from their homes
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:11.200]  and then redistributed all across the world.
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:16.200]  Which is what globalism admitted it was.
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:18.200]  But that is the past.
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  And now we are looking only to the future.
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.200]  America first.
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:26.200]  Which means build ourselves up, be independent,
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:27.200]  then help others.
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.200]  Not have capitulation dictated to us.
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:34.200]  We assembled here today
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:39.200]  are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city,
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:41.200]  in every foreign capital
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:43.200]  and in every hall of power.
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:44.200]  America first.
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.200]  From this day forward,
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:50.200]  a new vision will govern our land.
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:53.200]  From this day forward,
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:58.200]  it's going to be only America first.
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:00.200]  America first.
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:05.200]  This means humanity first.
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:10.200]  Every decision on trade, on taxes,
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:13.200]  on immigration, on foreign affairs
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:17.200]  will be made to benefit American workers
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:19.200]  and American families.
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:21.200]  We must protect our borders
[1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:24.200]  from the ravages of other countries
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:26.200]  making our products,
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:28.200]  stealing our companies
[1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:30.200]  and destroying our jobs.
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:32.200]  Yes.
[1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:35.200]  All right, we're going to come back.
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:37.200]  So America first.
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  Which simply means we won't be slaves to the globalists.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:42.200]  We're going to come back, finish up with a speech.
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:44.200]  I'm going to detail how these big women's marches
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:46.200]  are openly run by the CIA,
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:48.200]  the Time Jack by Foreign Powers.
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:50.200]  Can Trump clean up the CIA?
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:52.200]  Or will he fail?
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:54.200]  All this and more trade ahead.
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:56.200]  Do you want the cancer cures?
[1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:59.200]  The question is up to you.
[1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:01.200]  The Constitutional Convention 1787
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:03.200]  was held strict secrecy,
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:05.200]  and at the end of the preceding,
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:07.200]  citizens gathered outside Independence Hall
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:09.200]  to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.200]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall,
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:12.200]  a lady asked him,
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.200]  well, doctor, what have we got?
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:16.200]  A republic or a monarchy?
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.200]  To which he responded,
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:19.200]  a republic, if you can keep it.
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:21.200]  But today, not only have we lost a republic,
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:23.200]  but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:25.200]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:27.200]  A republic operates under the rule of law,
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:29.200]  which protects individual liberties
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:31.200]  so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:33.200]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:35.200]  all abide by the same laws,
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:37.200]  regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.200]  A democracy, on the other hand,
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:41.200]  only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:43.200]  In a democracy, the individual
[1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.200]  or any groups of individuals composing the minority
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.200]  have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:49.200]  It is a case of majority over man.
[1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:51.200]  In other words, under democracy,
[1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:53.200]  two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:54.200]  But under a republic,
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:56.200]  a sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[1:05:56.200 --> 1:05:59.200]  This is Kit Daniels with DimpleWars.com.
[1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:29.200]  We've seen the end of the Clintons.
[1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:31.200]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:34.200]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:36.200]  It's not true.
[1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:39.200]  That's impossible.
[1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:57.200]  It's the things you know it to be true.
[1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:05.200]  This is the heart of 1776.
[1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:07.200]  You're a white male.
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:12.200]  So what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones?
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:16.200]  Move, kids! Get out of the way!
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:19.200]  We pledge allegiance to one flag,
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.200]  and that flag is the American flag.
[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:24.200]  InfoWars helped to know the rumor
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:26.200]  that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:30.200]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:32.200]  I will not let you down.
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:35.200]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope,
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:37.200]  that we'll be speaking a lot.
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:39.200]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:41.200]  This means that Donald Trump will be
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.200]  the 45th president of the United States.
[1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:47.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:49.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:53.200]  Well, folks, we are impressed with Donald Trump
[1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:55.200]  and what he's done.
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:59.200]  He's a pro-human, pro-liberty,
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:03.200]  president and rightist world government
[1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:05.200]  that is suddenly being announced
[1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:08.200]  like a phoenix under the fire of hell.
[1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:10.200]  Our republic is rising again.
[1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:14.200]  I want to finish up with his historic inaugural speech
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:18.200]  January 20th, Friday, 2017.
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:20.200]  We're going to come back and get into
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:22.200]  the global counter-offensive
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:24.200]  of how they helped to enslave humanity.
[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:28.200]  But he gets to the key points here about life extension technology
[1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:31.200]  and other technologies that are going to be deployed to the public.
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:34.200]  I tell you, many of these are suppressed.
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:36.200]  They're seen as disruptive.
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:39.200]  And it will be disruptive when people can easily live to 200.
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:41.200]  But that's the big secret.
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:43.200]  Let's go to it.
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:52.200]  Every decision on trade, on taxes,
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.200]  on immigration, on foreign affairs
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:59.200]  will be made to benefit American workers
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:01.200]  and American families.
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.200]  We must protect our borders
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:06.200]  from the ravages of other countries
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:08.200]  making our products,
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:12.200]  stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.200]  The game raping's over.
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:23.200]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:28.200]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:32.200]  and I will never, ever let you down.
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:40.200]  And that will start winning again.
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.200]  Winning like never before.
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:49.200]  We will bring back our jobs.
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:52.200]  We will bring back our borders.
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:55.200]  We will bring back our wealth.
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:59.200]  And we will bring back our dreams.
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:08.200]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:12.200]  and airports and tunnels and railways
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:16.200]  all across our wonderful nation.
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:21.200]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work,
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:24.200]  rebuilding our country with American hands
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:27.200]  and American labor.
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:31.200]  We will sabotage.
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:34.200]  We will follow two simple rules.
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:38.200]  Buy American and hire American.
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:40.200]  If everybody else does, at our expense.
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:42.200]  The whole world has built on us.
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:44.200]  We will seek friendship and goodwill
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:46.200]  with the nations of the world,
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:49.200]  but we do so with the understanding
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:52.200]  that it is the right of all nations
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:55.200]  to put their own interests first.
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:00.200]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone,
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.200]  but rather to let it shine as an example.
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:08.200]  We will shine for everyone to follow.
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:10.200]  America didn't need to take over them.
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:12.200]  We had the best.
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:15.200]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:21.200]  and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism.
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:25.200]  We will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:26.200]  Huge.
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:28.200]  The left is totally allied with it.
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:29.200]  I was there.
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.200]  They admit like the million woman march was run by the Muslims.
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:36.200]  The bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.200]  to the United States of America.
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.200]  And through our loyalty to our country,
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:46.200]  we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:47.200]  That's right.
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:50.200]  When you open your heart to patriotism,
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:53.200]  there is no room for prejudice.
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:55.200]  That's right.
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:58.200]  Just because the left is all this anti-white stuff,
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:00.200]  people need to not buy into that,
[1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:01.200]  because you want these people to win.
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:02.200]  You better come together.
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:06.200]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:10.200]  when God's people live together in unity.
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:13.200]  We must speak our minds openly,
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:15.200]  debate our disagreements honestly,
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:20.200]  but always pursue solidarity.
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:22.200]  When America is united,
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:25.200]  America is totally unstoppable.
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:26.200]  That's right.
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:28.200]  They hate it.
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:30.200]  Come together for prosperity and treat people good,
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:32.200]  just be nice, and stop being a bunch of...
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:34.200]  There should be no fear.
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.200]  We are protected, and we will always be protected.
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:39.200]  It's the key by God.
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:41.200]  We will be protected by the great men and women
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:44.200]  of our military and law enforcement.
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:49.200]  And most importantly,
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:52.200]  we will be protected by God.
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:53.200]  Key.
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:54.200]  Rob God back in.
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:55.200]  And ask God for the protection.
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:59.200]  You just did it.
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.200]  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:08.200]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:11.200]  as long as it is striving.
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:12.200]  That's right. Innovation.
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:16.200]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.200]  and no action, constantly complaining,
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:21.200]  but never doing anything about it.
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:22.200]  That's right. You let a terror attack happen.
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.200]  You lose your job.
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:25.200]  You deliver.
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:30.200]  You don't get more power when you screw up.
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:34.200]  The time for empty talk is over.
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:38.200]  Now arrives the hour of action.
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:39.200]  The hour of action.
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:41.200]  Notice it's all from stun.
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:43.200]  We have the power. Humans can do anything.
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:48.200]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:49.200]  It's a tens of thousands of years.
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:51.200]  No challenge can match the heart and fight.
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:53.200]  To build to the point we have everything now.
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:54.200]  The secrets of the atom.
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:55.200]  It will not fail.
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:56.200]  Genes, everything.
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:59.200]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:00.200]  God gave us this.
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:04.200]  We stand at the birth of a little millennium,
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:08.200]  ready to unlock the mysteries of space,
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:12.200]  to free the earth from the miseries of disease,
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:15.200]  and to harness the energies, industries,
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:18.200]  and technologies of tomorrow.
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:19.200]  A new net.
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:20.200]  Back it up ten seconds.
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:21.200]  I'm going to come back, finish it,
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:24.200]  and go to the heavenly end and for the rest to get into the counter
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:26.200]  strike against all this with the brainwashing of women
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:28.200]  and turning the species against itself.
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:30.200]  That's how you kill fire ants or anything else.
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:34.200]  You turn the species against itself.
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:35.200]  We're going to end the ravage of disease.
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:36.200]  We're going to build this.
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.200]  We have it.
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:38.200]  We've already done it.
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:39.200]  Folks, they already have it.
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:40.200]  It's admitted, okay?
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:42.200]  It's in major white papers.
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:45.200]  Not 100% cures, but in general, they've got it all.
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:48.200]  They're suppressing a ton of stuff.
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:49.200]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.200]  I'll be able to hear this again.
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:53.200]  And Trump wants you to have that.
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.200]  He doesn't want to just go to Switzerland
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:56.200]  and get it for himself, because he feels like crap
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:58.200]  getting that when you don't get it,
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:00.200]  like the Queen of England does.
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.200]  He's like, okay, so what?
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:02.200]  There's about too many people.
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:04.200]  We'll just figure it out and do something in space.
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:06.200]  We're not going to do this.
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:08.200]  So let's go out to break.
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:09.200]  Here's President Trump.
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:10.200]  He's now president.
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:11.200]  I told you he'd be president.
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:12.200]  We will not fail.
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:17.200]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:21.200]  We stand at the birth of a little millennium
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:24.200]  ready to unlock the mysteries of space
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:28.200]  to free the earth from the miseries of disease
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:31.200]  and to harness the energies, industries,
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:34.200]  and technologies of tomorrow.
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:37.200]  A new national pride will stir ourselves,
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:40.200]  lift our sights, and heal our division.
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:41.200]  That's right.
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.200]  The U.S. has all the secret technologies.
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.200]  It's time to remember that old wisdom,
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:46.200]  our soldiers, will never forget.
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.200]  We're going to deliver this to everybody.
[1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.200]  America will fulfill the promise.
[1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:52.200]  Black or brown or white,
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:55.200]  we all bleed the same red.
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:57.200]  We'll be back with the conclusion.
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:15:58.200]  Stay with us.
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:15:59.200]  I'm Alex Jones, Dr. Grip.
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:01.200]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:02.200]  It took you over a year to do it.
[1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:03.200]  Why is this so good?
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.200]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.200]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:11.200]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:14.200]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:17.200]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites,
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:20.200]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:22.200]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:25.200]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:28.200]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:29.200]  These are all parasites.
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.200]  Tell us about all the stuff I said.
[1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:32.200]  There's so many things that are in it.
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:33.200]  You have the neem in there,
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:35.200]  you have the organic clove bud,
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:36.200]  the organic wormwood.
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:38.200]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse
[1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:39.200]  at least twice a year.
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:40.200]  All right.
[1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:41.200]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:43.200]  because I'm going back on it today.
[1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:44.200]  It just came back in yesterday.

[1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:34.200]  and support your body's natural systems.
[1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:39.200]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:41.200]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.200]  through red blood cell formation
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:45.200]  and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:48.200]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.200]  Electrify your mind and body

[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:29.200]  and so much more.
[1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:31.200]  And it supports him and it supports infowars
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.200]  our whole operation.
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.200]  So it's essential that this book
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:35.200]  go to the top of the charts in the political area
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:37.200]  if not to the very top of the charts.
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:38.200]  Joe Biden has come out and said
[1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.200]  world government is collapsing.
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:41.200]  They're in full crisis mode.
[1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:43.200]  National's movements are exploding.
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:45.200]  Everybody needs to go pre-order.
[1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:47.200]  So you get it first at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:49.200]  The making of a president by Roger Stone.
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:50.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:52.200]  Jeff Garner, playing to go to the inaugural event
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:53.200]  with Trump.
[1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:55.200]  Please pray for us and please continue to support
[1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:57.200]  the operation and get his book now.
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:03.200]  Sir, the first to have a trip to you.
[1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:15.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:17.200]  The globalist's great error is to believe
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:19.200]  that as they collapse humanity,
[1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:21.200]  they end up on top.
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:24.200]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast.
[1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:30.200]  But we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:34.200]  I'll see you again at Alex Jones show.
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:36.200]  So Trump is delivering on every front,
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:38.200]  getting more intense as he becomes president,
[1:20:38.200 --> 1:20:40.200]  not selling out the constituents.
[1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:42.200]  Again, there's so much wealth on the planet.
[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:44.200]  It's in all the big globalist books.
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:45.200]  They admit it.
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:46.200]  They want to make people poor.
[1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:48.200]  It's their own admission.
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:50.200]  And their argument is being wealthy hurts the earth.
[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:53.200]  No, we just create clean versions of it,
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:55.200]  which they're suppressing.
[1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:57.200]  Landmackers about to jump off the balance of the hour
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:20:59.200]  looking at their counter strike against all this.
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:00.200]  I was there.
[1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:02.200]  But first, let's finish up with President Trump's speech
[1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.200]  where he's breaking down,
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:06.200]  unlocking the secrets of the universe,
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:08.200]  which I can tell you.
[1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:12.200]  My father at UT in high school in the Plan 2 program,
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:15.200]  in the mid-60s, they had CD-ROMs and computers
[1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:17.200]  we didn't see until the 80s.
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:19.200]  They have suppressed technology 30 years behind.
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:21.200]  Trump knows it.
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:22.200]  He wants it rolled out to the public.
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:24.200]  This is the biggest issue.
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:26.200]  You want disclosure about all the secret technologies,
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:27.200]  the rest of it?
[1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:29.200]  They admit they're suppressing AI, you name it.
[1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:32.200]  You want a pro-human world in the future?
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:33.200]  Donald Trump.
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:34.200]  Let me explain something.
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:35.200]  People ask, is Trump real?
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:38.200]  Saying this destroys the enemy.
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:41.200]  The entire globalist program is against Trump right now
[1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:43.200]  and is in death throes.
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:45.200]  They're panicking everywhere.
[1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:47.200]  He got a standing ovation at the CIA.
[1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:49.200]  CNN said the CIA hated him.
[1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:51.200]  They said nobody showed up and showed a shot
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:54.200]  of the morning early before the gates opened.
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:56.200]  They said he took Martin Luther King's bust out
[1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:57.200]  and threw it out the street.
[1:21:57.200 --> 1:21:58.200]  It was right there.
[1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.200]  They are freaking out.
[1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:01.200]  I'll talk to Leigh Ann in a moment,
[1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:03.200]  but here's the conclusion.
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:05.200]  That it cannot be done.
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:08.200]  No challenge can match the heart and fight
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:10.200]  and spirit of America.
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:12.200]  We will not fail.
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:16.200]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:21.200]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:24.200]  ready to unlock the mysteries of space,
[1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:28.200]  to free the earth from the miseries of disease,
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:31.200]  and to harness the energies, industries,
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:34.200]  and technologies of tomorrow.
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:37.200]  A new national pride will stir ourselves,
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:42.200]  lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:46.200]  It's time to remember that all wisdom,
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.200]  our soldiers will never forget,
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:53.200]  that whether we are black or brown or white,
[1:22:53.200 --> 1:22:58.200]  we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:07.200]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms,
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:17.200]  and we all salute the same great American flag.
[1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:21.200]  And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit
[1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:24.200]  or the windswept plains of Nebraska,
[1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:27.200]  they look up at the same night sky,
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:30.200]  they fill their heart with the same dreams,
[1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:34.200]  and they are infused with the breath of life
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:38.200]  by the same almighty Creator.
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:41.200]  You know Bill Corrigan, the smashing pumpkin,
[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:42.200]  a couple years ago, he said,
[1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:44.200]  Alex, the key of what you do is you talk about
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:46.200]  looking up at the night sky.
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:49.200]  Coming together as humans.
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:53.200]  From mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean,
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:55.200]  hear these words.
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:23:59.200]  You will never be ignored again.
[1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:02.200]  Again, you say, oh, that's just hype.
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:04.200]  No, he's saying, you little people have the power.
[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:06.200]  You're powerful.
[1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:08.200]  Demand action, demand the truth.
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:10.200]  It's like Bannon said, keep us on,
[1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:12.200]  stay on us, help us, spur us.
[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:14.200]  And he's saying, you have the power.
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:16.200]  Everything else is about, oh, you need us to be powerful.
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:18.200]  No, no, you come first.
[1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:21.200]  You are what dictates the destiny, all of us together.
[1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:23.200]  Let's finish the speech.
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:32.200]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:35.200]  our American destiny.
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:38.200]  And your courage and goodness and love
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:41.200]  will forever guide us along the way.
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:42.200]  Let's pause again.
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:44.200]  To get back in five seconds.
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:46.200]  What did I say on that promo video?
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:47.200]  We've been running for two weeks.
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:48.200]  I said, this is American destiny.
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  It was taken, but we have to be good.
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:51.200]  We have to be loving.
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:53.200]  We have to come together racially, culturally.
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:55.200]  We have to do this.
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:24:56.200]  We are the power.
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:24:57.200]  And notice Trump's saying it.
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:24:58.200]  He didn't get it from me.
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:24:59.200]  It's the truth.
[1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:01.200]  This is the true spirit of humanity
[1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:04.200]  that America was the greatest example of.
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:06.200]  And that's why the enemies and controllers
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:08.200]  are now making a joke out of themselves.
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:10.200]  Let's finish.
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:13.200]  And your courage and goodness and love
[1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:17.200]  will forever guide us along the way.
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:22.200]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:25.200]  We will make America wealthy again.
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:28.200]  We will make America proud again.
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:31.200]  We will make America safe again.
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:37.200]  And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:38.200]  Thank you.
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:39.200]  God bless you.
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:44.200]  And God bless America.
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:47.200]  And you understand the entire global program is about
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:49.200]  making individuals disempowered, dependent.
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:51.200]  He's saying, no, you're the power.
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:52.200]  We're going to empower you.
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:54.200]  You're going to empower us.
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:57.200]  There's no way he's not real because this message
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:25:59.200]  is like sunlight to vampires.
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:02.200]  This is the antithesis of the New World Order.
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.200]  Leanne, we're going to cover all this coming back.
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:06.200]  Your view as a woman of the supposed million woman,
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:09.200]  March, which got damn close to what I was there yesterday
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:11.200]  and what they were saying and doing.
[1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:14.200]  I mean, they were so evil and horrible, it was like cartoonish
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:16.200]  what was happening, but I want to show how the CIA runs it
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:19.200]  and saw rows of the Muslims, a Muslim group,
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:22.200]  literally was running it that would put you in a dungeon.
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:23.200]  I mean, this is a...
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:25.200]  A Sharia law advocate.
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:26.200]  One of the top ones.
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:28.200]  But overall, I don't know your view.
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:31.200]  I haven't talked to you until you got her 10 minutes ago at the studio.
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:33.200]  But I mean, what is your view of what you saw?
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:36.200]  Well, you know, for me, I think obviously protesting
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:38.200]  is kind of a cornerstone of our republic.
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:41.200]  So I'm like, fine, go out there, do what you need to do.
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:45.200]  I feel truly like we are living in a dual reality with these people.
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:49.200]  Truly, the dimensions have split and we are superimposed on top of them
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:52.200]  because we could listen to Donald Trump's speech and say,
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.200]  wow, incredible.
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:55.200]  This is...
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:57.200]  All about unity.
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:26:59.200]  We the people have the power back.
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:01.200]  He's even getting white supremacists to stop being racist right now.
[1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:02.200]  Right.
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:04.200]  I mean, he's like, really, this is real.
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:08.200]  Yeah, and I mean, let's walk it back a few months
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:10.200]  when he had the standing ovation at the RNC
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:14.200]  when he brought up gay people and said, look, it's time for the RNC...
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:15.200]  Let's all love each other.
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:16.200]  The republic is wrong.
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:18.200] ...the gay on the LGBTQ.
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:19.200]  Hillary wouldn't even mention it.
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:20.200]  Standing ovation.
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:22.200]  They did not even cover that in the mainstream media
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:24.200]  because they want to continue pushing this narrative
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:27.200]  that all of our civil rights are now at threat
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:29.200]  that Donald Trump has been put in power.
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:30.200]  It's just total crap.
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:31.200]  And I was triggered this morning.
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:33.200]  I went to the gym
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:35.200]  and I think I'm going to have to switch to the YMCA
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:38.200]  because they have banned CNN from being played at their gym.
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:41.200]  But CNN was on and they had the picture up the side-by-side,
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:44.200]  the fake news photo with a, you know, 8.30 in the morning
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:46.200]  when they took the photo of the crowd and said,
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:48.200]  look, here's the inauguration call.
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:50.200]  Oh, I know, they're celebrating that no one showed up.
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:52.200]  They were beating people up so they couldn't get in.
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:53.200]  It's total fake news.
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:55.200]  I was personally punched repeatedly.
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:57.200]  Yeah, and even CNN, they have a...
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:27:58.200]  I couldn't get in at like nine.
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:00.200]  I had to go like four miles around.
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:02.200]  I got attacked there, couldn't get in.
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:03.200]  Everybody was on video live.
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:05.200]  I had to go like, so I barely got in
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:07.200]  and didn't even get my seats like right up at the front.
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:08.200]  Right.
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:09.200]  Well, they would have 40 people across,
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:12.200]  six rows deep blocking people off
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:14.200]  with like a human chain saying,
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:15.200]  this entry is blocked.
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:16.200]  This entry is blocked.
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:18.200]  And the weird thing is it was Black Lives Matter.
[1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:19.200]  They were almost all white.
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:20.200]  They'd punch me and say,
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:22.200]  you're a white male, F-U.
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:23.200]  Right.
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:24.200]  And it was so racist.
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:25.200]  Right.
[1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:26.200]  Well, and then also too,
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  I was seeing tons of signs at the Women's March,
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:29.200]  you know, posted all over social media
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.200]  about how white women voted for Trump.
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:33.200]  Don't forget, it's white women's fault,
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:34.200]  you know, and then you have these
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:36.200]  conservative pro-life women
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:37.200]  who wanted to be a part of the march
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:38.200]  and they were excluded from it.
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.200]  This isn't about women and equality
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:41.200]  in a women's march.
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:42.200]  This is a total...
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:43.200]  Well, I want to get your view on this
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:44.200]  because I mean, I got to say,
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:46.200]  they were so comically evil, hateful.
[1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:49.200]  And the men were the most beta,
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.200]  like zombies, like reanimated corpses,
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:54.200]  like 85 pounds,
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:56.200]  stumbling around huge black circles, drooling.
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:57.200]  No, I'm serious.
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:28:58.200]  Something sucked your soul.
[1:28:58.200 --> 1:28:59.200]  Hey, everyone.
[1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:01.200]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:02.200]  And as many of you know,
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:04.200]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:05.200]  and stay healthy.
[1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:07.200]  You've all heard the shocking statistics,
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:09.200]  despite spending trillions of dollars
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:11.200]  in health care, nearly $10,000 per man,
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:13.200]  woman, and child in this country.
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:15.200]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:17.200]  and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:19.200]  One out of three or four people
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:20.200]  is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:22.200]  and everyone knows at least one person
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:24.200]  with a degenerative disease.
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:26.200]  If you're dealing with a health challenge,
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:27.200]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:29.200]  your vigor and longevity,
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:31.200]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way

[1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:57.200]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[1:30:24.200 --> 1:30:26.200]  I've got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:28.200]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians,
[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:30.200]  and so much more, and it supports him,
[1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:32.200]  and it supports infowar as our whole operation.
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:34.200]  So it's essential that this book
[1:30:34.200 --> 1:30:36.200]  go to the top of the charts in the political area,
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:38.200]  if not to the very top of the charts.
[1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:40.200]  Joe Biden has come out and said
[1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:42.200]  world government is collapsing.
[1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:44.200]  They're in full crisis mode.
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:46.200]  National's movements are exploding.
[1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:48.200]  Everybody needs to go pre-order, so you get it first.
[1:30:48.200 --> 1:30:50.200]  At infowarsteam.com.
[1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:52.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:54.200]  I'm an inaugural event with Trump.
[1:30:54.200 --> 1:30:56.200]  Pray for us, and please continue to support the operation,
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:58.200]  and get his book mouse.
[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:24.200]  Have a chip to you.
[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:34.200]  Thank you for watching.
[1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:56.200]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:59.200]  We're calling 888-253-3139.
[1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:01.200]  We're selling a product DNA force
[1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:04.200]  that is the very best nutraceutical
[1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:06.200]  that we can produce.
[1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:09.200]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:12.200]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex,
[1:32:12.200 --> 1:32:14.200]  because I think it's very, very important.
[1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:16.200]  What the aging process is,
[1:32:16.200 --> 1:32:18.200]  is when the cell replicates,
[1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:21.200]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[1:32:21.200 --> 1:32:23.200]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:25.200]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[1:32:25.200 --> 1:32:27.200]  We chose the PQQ because it has over
[1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:29.200]  175 different clinical trials.
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:32.200]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:34.200]  It works like an antioxidant.
[1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:37.200]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:40.200]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:42.200]  It's in powder form.
[1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:44.200]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:46.200]  I take this. This is the product that I take.
[1:32:46.200 --> 1:32:48.200]  infowarsteam.com.
[1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:50.200]  In the profit we make, we fight the global.
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:52.200]  We fight the new world order.
[1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:55.200]  For your DNA force today at infowarsteam.com,
[1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:58.200]  or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:06.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:12.200 --> 1:33:14.200]  We are on the march.
[1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:17.200]  The empire is on the run.
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:21.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:23.200]  I'm waiting.
[1:33:32.200 --> 1:33:35.200]  Reflecting on my past life.
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:37.200]  I mean, here I am.
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:39.200]  And let's be honest.
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:41.200]  We at this show have changed the world.
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:45.200]  And I'm more humble than I was 20 years ago.
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:49.200]  At 5 o'clock, they take me to the gallows pole.
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:51.200]  I mean, they're openly saying they want to kill me.
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:53.200]  They're saying, shut us down.
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:56.200]  I still have love for these throngs of people
[1:33:56.200 --> 1:34:00.200]  that they were defeating me not in the way they thought.
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:03.200]  There's thousands of women every few minutes went by me
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:07.200]  screaming, F you, hope you die, fascist, Nazi.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:09.200]  And I'd try to talk to them.
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:11.200]  It was all on Facebook mentions, millions watching.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:14.200]  They wouldn't talk. They just screamed, I was the enemy.
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.200]  And then go, Trump not hate or hate not Trump
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:20.200]  was crazy froth and I was just like trying to talk
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:22.200]  and they wouldn't humanize me.
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:25.200]  They wouldn't speak to me.
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:28.200]  They wouldn't listen to me when the whole corporate
[1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:30.200]  world government is against Trump in America.
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:35.200]  They couldn't see because they thought MSNBC
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:37.200]  and ABC was God.
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:39.200]  And now I see mainstream media and the attacks on
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:42.200]  America and nationalism and a global system
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:45.200]  that's going to destroy national sovereignty
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:47.200]  going into high gear.
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:50.200]  What haven't they learned from their defeats, Leigh Ann?
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:52.200]  Well, it's just surreal watching the media.
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:54.200]  The mainstream media is absolutely still
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:56.200]  trying to delegitimize Trump.
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:59.200]  And every single move there, once he called them
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:01.200]  out on that fake photo they were using to pick
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:04.200]  on his crowd size, that became their whole thing.
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:05.200]  And so there are still-
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:06.200]  They're like, why are you complaining?
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:08.200]  We said no one showed up.
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:10.200]  They're like, oh, he got rid of Martin Luther King.
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:12.200]  You're like, no, I didn't hear it as well.
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:14.200]  Just shut up, quit bitching.
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:16.200]  They hate the fact he calls them.
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:18.200]  They go, he's obsessed with himself.
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:20.200]  Yeah, the truth, every time you lie, he counters you.
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:21.200]  Exactly.
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:22.200]  He's got more energy than all of you.
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:23.200]  They can't stand it.
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:24.200]  Let me say, I'm 43.
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:25.200]  I got more energy.
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:26.200]  I thought it was anybody.
[1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:27.200]  Trump's me.
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:30.200]  It's not a Trump-ass-kissing contest, Leigh Ann.
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:32.200]  It's starting to get spooky.
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:35.200]  Here's the thing is, when I was at the gym and CNN
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:37.200]  was on and I just saw the picture up there.
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:39.200]  I didn't even stop to watch it.
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:41.200]  I just got so angry because I was in my mind
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:44.200]  thinking people only get, there are people out there.
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:46.200]  In fact, I meant to give this to the crew.
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:48.200]  If we don't do it today, I'll show it tomorrow.
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:50.200]  They showed like 8.30 the shot with no one there
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:52.200]  and said, look, no one showed up.
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:54.200]  Meanwhile, it was a record crowd of like 1.8 million.
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:57.200]  I mean, it's just like God, I guess we thought
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:35:58.200]  they'd be discredited.
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:35:59.200]  They go away.
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:01.200]  No, they're now like, we're discredited.
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:03.200]  Let's just say the moon's made of cheese.
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:05.200]  Well, and just to prove that they used a photo
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:06.200]  from earlier in the morning.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:09.200]  The guys just Googled, left runs with fake photo.
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:10.200]  There it is.
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:11.200]  That's what they do.
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:12.200]  You have the meme.
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:16.200]  So I saw this photo that was out at about, you know,
[1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:19.200]  when I got here about nine o'clock the other day
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:22.200]  and I went on at 10.30 and told David Knight, I said,
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:24.200]  watch, they're going to use this photo and say
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:26.200]  that Donald Trump doesn't have a crowd there.
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:27.200]  They're already pushing this.
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:29.200]  And it's right there on the record at 10.30.
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:32.200]  And then a little bit later, they said, look,
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:33.200]  sure enough, there it is.
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:35.200]  They tweeted out the photo when their own
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:38.200]  gigapixel photo that they have shows a huge crowd.
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:41.200]  But yet they're still going to roll out that picture today
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.200]  and say, Donald Trump says we're lying,
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:45.200]  but here's the photo proof.
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:47.200]  And that's what makes me so angry is that there are people
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:50.200]  out there that only get their news from CNN
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:53.200]  and they truly believe this alternate reality.
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:55.200]  Oh, I was telling these women, they're like,
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:57.200]  oh, Trump didn't bring jobs back.
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:01.200]  And I'm like, Chrysler, Ford, Carrier, Foxcom.
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:03.200]  And they were just like, liar.
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.200]  And then they go, F you white male.
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:06.200]  It was all white women.
[1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:08.200]  And I was like, that's so racist.
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:10.200]  Well, then you get back to the real world.
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:12.200]  There's actually a video up on the Drudge Report
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.200]  about this woman who was on the plane and she's flying out
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:18.200]  of DC, talks to the person next to her to come here to protest
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:20.200]  or to celebrate.
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:22.200]  And he's just polite.
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.200]  So once she finds out he was there to support,
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:28.200]  celebrate democracy, she starts going after him saying,
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:31.200]  well, I'm entitled to get drunk and puke on your lap.
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:32.200]  You make me sick.
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:33.200]  Don't talk to me.
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:34.200]  Don't look at me.
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.200]  Don't even use the armrest.
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:36.200]  Don't move.
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:38.200]  I'm going to make, you know, and just totally being,
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:39.200]  you disgust me.
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:40.200]  You're a bigot.
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:41.200]  Get off this plane.
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:44.200]  And he's like, well, ma'am, the very definition of bigotry
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:47.200]  is disparaging someone prior to knowing them simply by their
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:48.200]  beliefs and opinions.
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:51.200]  And she's like, no, you get trying to force him up.
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:54.200]  And the stewardess shuts her down and says, ma'am,
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:57.200]  you don't have the right to kick this guy off the plane
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:37:58.200]  or to force him to move seats.
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:01.200]  And then she ended up kicking this old lady off the plane.
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:02.200]  So I got to be honest with you.
[1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:03.200]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:04.200]  I was there.
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:05.200]  I saw the live feeds.
[1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:06.200]  Yeah.
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:07.200]  They would, I mean, they were just like,
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:10.200]  We run this, we run this world now.
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:11.200]  You get off the plane.
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:13.200]  It was like, I didn't exist.
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:14.200]  Yeah.
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:15.200]  We'll see.
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:16.200]  And that's the thing.
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:18.200]  You know, I'm glad that you brought that up because I feel like
[1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:21.200]  we could all be really tempted to attack them in the same way
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.200]  that they are treated.
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:23.200]  No, they're victims.
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:24.200]  They're, they're,
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:25.200]  It's not, you know,
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:26.200]  People are getting a call.
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:27.200]  They're like getting somebody out of like a major call.
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:28.200]  Exactly.
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:32.200]  I feel like Pence did a great job in the debate when you saw how
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:34.200]  that was a, I forget his name,
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:36.200]  the Grinch, Hillary Clinton's VP, Tim Kaine,
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:40.200]  how he was trying to really just egg him on with all this buzzword
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:41.200]  crap.
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:43.200]  And he just calmly was like, you know, come on, let's just,
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:46.200]  I feel like that's how we need to respond to these people of
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:49.200]  just bringing them the facts and not falling for their,
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:51.200]  for their bait because it's total crap.
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:52.200]  It's delusional.
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:53.200]  It's not in.
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:54.200]  I agree.
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:56.200]  But what do you think happens as we start restoring prosperity,
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:38:57.200]  bringing people together?
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:38:58.200]  What do they do next?
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:38:59.200]  Cause they are just hysterical.
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.200]  How do you resist prosperity?
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:03.200]  How do you resist freedom?
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:06.200]  That's why I feel like I hope Donald Trump just kind of.
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:07.200]  That's a good bumper sticker.
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:08.200]  How do you resist freedom?
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:09.200]  Yeah.
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:10.200]  I don't want to.
[1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.200]  Exactly.
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:12.200]  That's the thing.
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:13.200]  I feel, I really hope Trump.
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:14.200]  How do you, how do you resist your birthright?
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:16.200]  How do you resist something so obviously?
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:17.200]  Cause my guts never wrong.
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:18.200]  Right.
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:20.200]  And I didn't like Trump before cause I thought I liked TV.
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:22.200]  And I was like, eh, Trump, but my gut says Trump, Trump, Trump.
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:23.200]  Exactly.
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:24.200]  Everybody's like, why are you like a Trump?
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:25.200]  I go, my gut says it.
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:27.200]  And thank God the last two years I started falling my gut.
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:30.200]  I just, God, they want to kill him though.
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:33.200]  I just, and I hate, I've never admired somebody like this.
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:36.200]  It's like, I actually feel embarrassed how much I admire him,
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:38.200]  but he just keeps doing everything right.
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:39.200]  I'm curious.
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:41.200]  That was such an inclusive loving speech.
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:44.200]  And we were all wondering, just waiting for them, for the mainstream
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.200]  to get back to their little computers and type up their story.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:50.200]  Like wondering how were they going to tear his speech apart and make it bad.
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:51.200]  And he's,
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:53.200]  They said it was ominous and scary.
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:54.200]  It was the opposite.
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  Yeah.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:56.200]  Someone said it's reminding me of the night.
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.200]  We're going to unlock the diseases and cure people.
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:39:59.200]  Oh, it's so scary.
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:00.200]  Yeah.
[1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:02.200]  He's reminding me of the anti-Semitic speech.
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:07.200]  You know, it's just, what, what speech were you listening to?
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:08.200]  What, that's what I'm saying.
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:09.200]  Oh, I love he's anti-Semitic.
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:10.200]  Right.
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:15.200]  When he wants to move the Israeli US consulate from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:16.200]  Yeah.
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:17.200]  I mean, it's just all made up crap.
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:20.200]  Cause they know the average liberal doesn't know that like Jews were dancing in the streets.
[1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:21.200]  Yeah.
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:23.200]  When Obama was like the most hostile president to Israel.
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:24.200]  I know.
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:25.200]  It's all upside down.
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:27.200]  It's, it's, that's, it's crazy.
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:30.200]  Like we are typically the ones checking the government.
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:33.200]  We would typically be there going, oh, Trump making fun of his every move and like checking
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:35.200]  him and call, but it's Wally Wally.
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:38.200]  Spicer comes out and it was a press conference and it's like all true.
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:41.200]  And he was like all moral authority and hitting them and being honest.
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:43.200]  I was like, what is going on?
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:45.200]  We are living in Lala.
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:46.200]  It's crazy.
[1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:48.200]  I'm curious how you felt though, just being out there.
[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:50.200]  I know you kept kind of breaking down.
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:51.200]  We saw you on the life.
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:53.200]  You just, I just felt really bad.
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:55.200]  20 years, but this was 20 years.
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:57.200]  You know what March 5 say, F you, F you.
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:40:58.200]  You're a racist.
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:40:59.200]  Yeah.
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:01.200]  And you hate women when I don't just flipping me off.
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:02.200]  It was like a cult.
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:05.200]  It was like, it was hundreds and hundreds of women an hour.
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:06.200]  I'm like, F you.
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:07.200]  I mean, we ran into fans too.
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:12.200]  Every other Trump supporter was an info warrior, but I would try to say no, no.
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:14.200]  Edward Bernays, the CIA, it's to hurt them.
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:16.200]  It would just go F you.
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:20.200]  Oh, well, and then one of the big things they were doing was putting on he jobs to show
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:21.200]  there's.
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:22.200]  Oh, I saw that.
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:26.200]  How dare you, you bigot being it's Islam when it totally enslaves women.
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:28.200]  And I wasn't even bringing up Islam at first.
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:29.200]  A symbol of oppression.
[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:32.200]  It's a symbol of that, you know, when you want to practice Sharia law or whatever.
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:34.200]  Leanne, if you want to come to work, we'll put a bag over there.
[1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:35.200]  Yeah.
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:36.200]  It's like you have to be submissive.
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:37.200]  Imagine how to send those.
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:38.200]  I should do that.
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:39.200]  Like I have a bag then.
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:40.200]  We put this over your head.
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:41.200]  No, no.
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:42.200]  You're like, oh, you're trying to rape me.
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:43.200]  Yeah.
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:44.200]  It was, they're in a cult, man.
[1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:45.200]  It's like, no.
[1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:46.200]  I noticed like Muslims.
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:49.200]  I said this yesterday on the video live or like running it.
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:52.200]  There's news now that it's women's march organizers.
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:53.200]  Yeah.
[1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:54.200]  One of the leaders.
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:59.200]  It is one of the top Sharia law cut women's genitals off, put hoods on their heads.
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:00.200]  Yeah.
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:01.200]  Yeah.
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:02.200]  We got video of that.
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:03.200]  There was women hundreds of them holding those signs.
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:04.200]  Right.
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:05.200]  We the people.
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:06.200]  Sharia law.
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:07.200]  Okay.
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:10.200]  So now being a slave as a woman against me who just spoils women.
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:11.200]  Now I'm bad.
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:12.200]  Right.
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:13.200]  I don't want to put a hood on their head.
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:16.200]  The girl, I believe her name, the woman Linda Sarsor, I believe.
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:17.200]  I've got the article right here.
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:23.200]  She was on Rachel Maddow before this March talking about it saying, you know, 22 states
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:25.200]  in this country don't allow Sharia law.
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:27.200]  They don't allow us to practice our religion.
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:32.200]  It's like, no, sure, you could practice Islam, but Sharia law is not going to take a newborn
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:33.200]  girl and cut her genitals off.
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:35.200]  But a tenant of the religion is kind of an aside.
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:36.200]  So it's like here.
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:37.200]  Oh yeah.
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:38.200]  Yeah.
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:39.200]  They're using our freedom to ban it.
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:40.200]  And here's our constitution, you know, version of it.
[1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:45.200]  And it's like, no, it's liberal women saying the West that empowers women has enslaved
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:47.200]  them in my face, hating me.
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:50.200]  The thing that's wrong is it's not 50 states that don't allow Sharia law.
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:51.200]  22.
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:53.200]  Well, it's it's classic stockings.
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:54.200]  So spoiled.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:59.200]  They want to be slaves.
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:01.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the inauguration special.
[1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:05.200]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the new year.
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:10.200]  I'm extending them as the inauguration specials right through this weekend.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  And then it's over.
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:13.200]  We have some new products coming out next week.
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.200]  Some other sales we're going to be doing, but many of these sales are going to have
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:18.200]  to come to an end.
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:24.200]  If you want across the board, massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items like brain

[1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:32.200]  Here's the bottom line.
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:35.200]  These are great products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:36.200]  lives.
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:37.200]  Also, it funds the operation.
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:42.200]  This sale ends this weekend after the inauguration of Donald J.
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:43.200]  The 45th president.
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:44.200]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:45.200]  Infowarslife.com.

[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:47.200]  Triple A 253-3139.
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:54.200]  Get great products, help fund the info war and celebrate the election of a populist,
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:56.200]  a champion against the new world order.
[1:43:56.200 --> 1:43:58.200]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war.
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:00.200]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:02.200]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:05.200]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:11.200]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:16.200]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.200]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze.
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.200]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:28.200]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:33.200]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:36.200]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:38.200]  The general public doesn't.
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:42.200]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:46.200]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:50.200]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.200]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:45:19.200]  That's why this system is so revolutionary today.
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:24.200]  Lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable and stronger than anything else
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:25.200]  on the market.
[1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:28.200]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:31.200]  and people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding, what
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:32.200]  they really say about them.
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:35.200]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:38.200]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:42.200]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:44.200]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick.
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:47.200]  It's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:49.200]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.

[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:33.200]  We are back live.
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:35.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks so much for joining us.
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:41.200]  Final segment, Liam will join me again tomorrow, 11 a.m., the 3 p.m. Central with the rest of
[1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:44.200]  the great crew for the weekday show because I want her to be able to get through all she
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:47.200]  wants to talk about because I was frustrated as a man.
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:48.200]  I can't imagine a woman.
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:51.200]  I'm just saying, if you're a woman, you're for Hillary, you're for George Soros.
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:52.200]  It is so crazy.
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:57.200]  But speaking of Gloria Steinem, I remember hearing Rush Limbaugh when I was a senior
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:47:59.200]  in high school, like 1992.
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:04.200]  See, Gloria Steinem in her new book admits that she was CIA and it was meant to break
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:07.200]  up the family and take control of things for social engineering.
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:11.200]  So I went home because I knew my mother had seen that book on the coffee table like a month
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.200]  before and I picked it up and flipped to where Rush had said and there it was.
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:19.200]  So I'd mentioned that many times over the years and I would get emails and the news would
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:23.200]  say, you can look this up, Jones Plains, the CIA, around the feminist movement.
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:27.200]  Yeah, they did stuff like almost no women smoke cigarettes.
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:29.200]  How do we get them to worldwide?
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.200]  Well, just say it's feminist to smoke cigarettes.
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:33.200]  We got articles on that.
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:37.200]  I'll do more on this, but you guys pulled up some of the articles for me.
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:38.200]  There it is.
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:40.200]  The torches of freedom is what they called it.
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:42.200]  Your husband won't let you smoke cigarettes.
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:43.200]  The point is, smoke one if you want.
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:45.200]  They just said, be a woman, be cool.
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:46.200]  Torches of freedom.
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:48.200]  Because they targeted women.
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:49.200]  Hitler did as well.
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:55.200]  And then the next thing was, you know, ever Bernays and all this other garbage about going
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:57.200]  after the family, breaking it up.
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:02.200]  And then glorious time in this magazine, the CIA and ugly art and break down the family.
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:03.200]  It's all there.
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:09.200]  So today I said, hey, Google her book and Nico Acusta, our head producer goes, no, no,
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:12.200]  look, this is 60 minutes in the 60s.
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:16.200]  And so I was like, whoa, this just went up a little while ago.
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:22.200]  Here's part of it where she talks about the CIA and the foundations wanted to work with
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:23.200]  her.
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:25.200]  It's not about empowering women.
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.200]  It's about making you totally poor, turning men into betas and ending society.
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:30.200]  Here it is.
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:35.200]  Gloria, at the festival you worked for the independent research service.
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:36.200]  That's right.
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:42.200]  Well, exactly when did your own association with the CIA start and in what fashion?
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:45.200]  Did they come to you or did you go to them?
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:52.200]  In 1958, when I came home from India, I'd discussed with student leaders past and present.
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:50:00.200]  Many of them acted with the National Student Association, this kind of small foundation
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:02.200]  to encourage Americans to go.
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:05.200]  They thought it was a good idea too.
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:13.200]  I was then told by foundations and professors and friends that I should not do this, that
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:18.200]  I would get in trouble with the House on American Activities Committee, the American Legion.
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:22.200]  I was still battling this.
[1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:24.200]  50 people.
[1:50:24.200 --> 1:50:26.200]  I became convinced that it was impossible.
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:32.200]  It was at that point that the student leaders said to me that they had in the past received
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:38.200]  funds for international programs from the CIA and that they felt that this was important
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:40.200]  and could also be partly funded by the CIA.
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:42.200]  Let's stop right there.
[1:50:42.200 --> 1:50:44.200]  Miss Magazine, the mainstream media, all of it.
[1:50:44.200 --> 1:50:48.200]  Not to empower women, but to totally enslave women.
[1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:50.200]  Look at the statistics today, illegitimacy.
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:52.200]  It's all collapsing.
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:54.200]  The illiteracy, it's all there.
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:57.200]  Leigh Ann, it's crazy that this is in her book.
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:50:59.200]  I could pull up the articles when they said it didn't exist.
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:01.200]  Now we have her on film.
[1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:02.200]  Right.
[1:51:02.200 --> 1:51:07.200]  Yeah, I remember doing a big report about this and just cultural Marxism and where it really all started.
[1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:10.200]  It wasn't about empowering women to get them in the workforce.
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:15.200]  It was about creating new tax income, new slave workers, breaking up the family.
[1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:20.200]  I mean, this is a whole big plan that, as we can see, Gloria Steinem has been a part of it for decades.
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:26.200]  And women just think that we are ripping away their rights, their freedom.
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:29.200]  And they think making men, it's like we're in competition with men.
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:30.200]  Right.
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:33.200]  Men already are 40% of the college graduates.
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:34.200]  Don't worry.
[1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:35.200]  Men are gone.
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:36.200]  There's no men left.
[1:51:36.200 --> 1:51:37.200]  It's all over.
[1:51:37.200 --> 1:51:38.200]  Everything's wrecked.
[1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:39.200]  It was all literally.
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:41.200]  I have an in-game 2.0.
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:46.200]  All the documents where they admit everything, the chemicals in the water to in men.
[1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:47.200]  It's really bad.
[1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:51.200]  Well, here's the thing that's really infuriating to me is that women are always kind of at
[1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:54.200]  the front lines when there's any kind of movement, civil rights, this and that.
[1:51:54.200 --> 1:51:57.200]  But who's going to speak up for them when they're obsolete?
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:01.200]  Because if you look at the cover of National Geographic Magazine and it's like the gender revolution,
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:03.200]  they have a man.
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:09.200]  They have a transgender man, a bi-gender woman, a transgender woman, a transgender woman,
[1:52:09.200 --> 1:52:11.200]  and then some other thing.
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:12.200]  That's very astute.
[1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:13.200]  Well, you just said.
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.200]  That's what you just said.
[1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:15.200]  It's so astute.
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:19.200]  In Charlotte Isherby's document, she released from as the head of the Department of Education.
[1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:20.200]  She was the number two.
[1:52:20.200 --> 1:52:22.200]  And this is in the 80s.
[1:52:22.200 --> 1:52:25.200]  They say it's brave new world, 1932.
[1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:29.200]  The plan is no gender, all test tubes.
[1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:32.200]  So, of course, they get women to go, oh, men are your enemy.
[1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:34.200]  The main target is women are the species.
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:36.200]  Everybody's a girl when they're first embryonic.
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:37.200]  Right.
[1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:39.200]  And then the genetics chooses to make a male to defend the women.
[1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:45.200]  But you're just your heterosexual, female woman, not represented at all on there.
[1:52:45.200 --> 1:52:50.200]  A woman who is just your typical woman who wants to love a man and start a family.
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:51.200]  And you're unnecessary.
[1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:53.200]  You're not a part of the gender revolution.
[1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:55.200]  I mean, to me, that is insane.
[1:52:55.200 --> 1:52:56.200]  Women fight on Twitter.
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:57.200]  Almost.
[1:52:57.200 --> 1:53:01.200]  They're like, don't talk about your period because not all women have vaginas.
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:02.200]  They're like, I'm sorry, what?
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:03.200]  You're going to just...
[1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:05.200]  It's all about an attack on the species.
[1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:07.200]  It's all about a shutdown of the species, Leigh Ann.
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:08.200]  Right.
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:10.200]  I want to show a clip here because this is...come back tomorrow.
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:11.200]  You promise for an hour?
[1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:12.200]  I promise.
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:13.200]  Because this is so huge.
[1:53:13.200 --> 1:53:15.200]  Again, I'm going to show you...I have them all here.
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:16.200]  We printed them all up.
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:19.200]  This is all declassified.
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:25.200]  And I want to play a clip of one of our reporters there in D.C. yesterday at the Women's March.
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:30.200]  And there's dozens of hours of this with our four or five reporters that were there, including myself.
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:34.200]  And they would say, hey, Saudi Arabia is who really funds Hillary.
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:38.200]  And they would say, oh no, Donald Trump's the one that got that funding.
[1:53:38.200 --> 1:53:39.200]  And then we kind of moved on.
[1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:43.200]  But the point is, he got zero money from Saudi Arabia that literally enslaves women.
[1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:44.200]  And that's what's so crazy.
[1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:49.200]  They're bitching at the West that was about...the whole West is about worshiping the goddess.
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:50.200]  Let's just get down to brass tacks.
[1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:55.200]  The entire Magna Carta, Western government, the whole Renaissance is about empowering women.
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:57.200]  We're the place that empowered them.
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:01.200]  And now they're like there with Islamic jihad wearing hoods on their heads saying,
[1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:04.200]  you're a white male or you're a Westerner, F-U.
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:09.200]  So this is total victims worshiping their abusers.
[1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:10.200]  Here it is.
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:19.200]  What do you think about countries like Saudi Arabia that totally oppress women and will stone them to death
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:25.200]  for having sex outside of marriage or for any little thing that they do?
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:26.200]  What do you think about that?
[1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:28.200]  I think it's absolutely horrible.
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:29.200]  It's outrageous.
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:34.200]  And I think that all women deserve their human rights.
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:38.200]  In every single country, in every single nation, we all deserve the same rights.
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:39.200]  We all deserve respect.
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:44.200]  And we all deserve to be treated exactly like men are treated, maybe even like...
[1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:47.200]  We're not asking for special permission.
[1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:51.200]  We're asking for the same privilege.
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:53.200]  Did you guys support Hillary Clinton?
[1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:54.200]  I did.
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:55:04.200]  Well, did you know that Hillary Clinton took millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia for her campaign?
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:08.200]  She raised millions of dollars for her campaign.
[1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:13.200]  And she was compared to what Donald Trump raised, like being comparable.
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:18.200]  He used the money that he raised to pay for a portrait and so much.
[1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:22.200]  I think what Hillary Clinton did is amazing and just a shame.
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:28.200]  All right, so these same women don't know she raised 50 times the corporate money Trump did, literally.
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.200]  Saudi Arabia gave no money.
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:34.200]  They just say, oh, a portrait, oh, he had no crew, he had no audience.
[1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:36.200]  Saudi Arabia loves me.
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:38.200]  This is upside down world, Liam.
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:41.200]  It's absolutely flipped, inverted reality.
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:44.200]  We are dealing with people who are living in a dual reality, and we have to remember that.
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:46.200]  That's why it feels...
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:48.200]  How do women look under Islam versus with Trump?
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:52.200]  Women are on a pedestal with Trump. How are they with Islam?
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:54.200]  Well, they're oppressed.
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:56.200]  Just by nature, you are the underclass.
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.200]  You can get stoned for being raped.
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:00.200]  You can get phoned if you're the victim of rape.
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:04.200]  Oh, no, they do that. You get raped and you report it because rape is ubiquitous.
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:06.200]  You are killed.
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:09.200]  And then you've shamed your family so they can honor, kill you.
[1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:10.200]  Or acid on your face.
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:11.200]  Right.
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:15.200]  What kind of dad kills their 10-year-old daughter because a bunch of thugs rape her?
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:16.200]  I'll go kill those people.
[1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:17.200]  I'm not going to kill my daughter.
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:19.200]  Yeah, it's your fault.
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:23.200]  You know, because you didn't cover your hair or you let your ankles show in public.
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:27.200]  So, or you went out to the grocery store by yourself without your mail.
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:34.200]  Let's just say it. Modern Islam, particularly, is about covering the sun that it's women.
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:37.200]  It's all about just putting a bag over the most beautiful thing there is.
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:40.200]  Well, women in the West have more rights than anyone.
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:43.200]  We're more free than any other country.
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:46.200]  Men have less rights than us, frankly.
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:47.200]  We have it great here.
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:51.200]  So, the fact that you have all these women out there in just a total wally work.
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:52.200]  I'm not just saying this.
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:53.200]  Look at chivalry.
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:55.200]  It's all about women or on a pedestal.
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:56:56.200]  Let me open the door for you.
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:00.200]  And yeah, someone will say, oh, well, that's because they assume that I'm just weaker.
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:03.200]  And I'm like, no, obviously I can open up a door.
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:06.200]  But I really appreciate it when a guy's like, here you go.
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:07.200]  Woman, like.
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:10.200]  Well, it says it's been a way to die for their families.
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:11.200]  Exactly.
[1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:14.200]  And I mean, that to me is one of the reasons why.
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:18.200]  Instead, in Islamic countries, they use the women and children for bombs because they don't matter.
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:19.200]  Only men matter.
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:20.200]  Exactly.
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:22.200]  And it's just, it's a total inversion.
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:23.200]  It makes me sick.
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:24.200]  Yeah.
[1:57:24.200 --> 1:57:25.200]  No, you're so right with that.
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:30.200]  And that's what happened to the honor with honoring the fact that men would put their
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:32.200]  lives on the line for their family.
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:34.200]  But now it's that, oh, you're so pathetic.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:37.200]  You can't even buy the right cereal at the grocery store.
[1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:38.200]  I'll do it myself.
[1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:40.200]  Every show is about how dumb men are.
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:41.200]  Right.
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:42.200]  And we've been made pathetic.
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:43.200]  The average man just doesn't know what to do.
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:44.200]  They're totally collapsing.
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:45.200]  It's sick.
[1:57:45.200 --> 1:57:46.200]  We end great points.
[1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:47.200]  What an amazing broadcast.
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:52.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on the road with a very important announcement.
