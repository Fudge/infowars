[00:00.000 --> 00:14.840]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.760]  well ladies and gentlemen despite all of their lies all their propaganda all
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.680]  their bullying all of their mob rule all of George Soros's foreign stolen money
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.040]  from countries he's collapsed and the roots that go back to his Nazi collaborating
[01:00.040 --> 01:04.040]  despite everything they've done to this nation trying to destroy due process
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.400]  trying to destroy innocent until proven guilty trying to turn this nation into a
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.920]  total leftist run police state like one giant police state college run by the
[01:14.920 --> 01:19.880]  anti-free speech anti-family anti-gun anti-god anti-free market scum
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.320]  despite them throwing everything they had at the American people in Congress
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.080]  Trump's poll numbers are up Kavanaugh got confirmed by two more votes than they
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.680]  thought and the poll numbers are all coming in that you're seeing people
[01:35.680 --> 01:41.520]  deserting the Democratic plantation in ultra massive levels and you see the
[01:41.520 --> 01:46.240]  economy surging since the best level since the early 1960s you see the entire
[01:46.240 --> 01:53.320]  globalist program in deep trouble but they are going to strike back big time
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.440]  now I've got a lot of amazing clips of the left that our own Millie Weaver and
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.080]  Gavin Wentz shot on the ground in DC inside the Senate buildings inside the
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.320]  Capitol outside the Capitol we have incredible footage of men women and
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.800]  children being assaulted women being roundhouse kicked by men literally
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.880]  wearing feminist pink uniforms purple uniforms old people that are pro-life
[02:18.880 --> 02:23.520]  being attacked just it's all coming up to show you the insanity and then their
[02:23.520 --> 02:28.120]  public threats their public intimidation with their whole Hollywood culture
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.880]  projected onto these people these low-level minions who again literally
[02:33.880 --> 02:36.960]  behave and act like what I would expect central casting for a mental
[02:36.960 --> 02:42.520]  institution to be I was trying to recast you know the folks for the remake of the
[02:42.520 --> 02:47.120]  one who flew over the cuckoo's nest I would I would cast these people and then
[02:47.120 --> 02:54.800]  you've got the weird corrupt aged sketchy like crone like villains from Lord
[02:54.800 --> 03:00.720]  of the Rings or something humor and and been Pelosi and the rest of them just
[03:00.720 --> 03:06.600]  running around foaming at the mouth trying to command their throngs but
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.720]  there's a paradox here the more their people come out and act like hateful
[03:10.720 --> 03:16.880]  spiteful thugs and run around and go crazy and call everyone rapist by
[03:16.880 --> 03:21.800]  extension with no proof to all make themselves victims you're raping me
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.600]  you're raping me and I don't know what it is about these women I mean they all
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.080]  look like they should you know be back with their cats at their house and I'm
[03:31.080 --> 03:34.240]  not saying women shouldn't be out doing political things I'm saying they look
[03:34.240 --> 03:39.160]  like crazy cat ladies there's actually a theory they say about 20% of people that
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.920]  have cats have a brain worm parasite that actually actually programs the
[03:45.920 --> 03:49.480]  brain and controls it it's been proven to make you want to want to have more cats
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.600]  and the smell of cat piss which the which the brain fluke basically
[03:54.600 --> 03:58.000]  programs into you so that you keep more of the cats around and keep spreading the
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.920]  larva and it's been of course there's a similar larva that gets into snails and
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.440]  controls their brain and since then to the top of trees to be eaten by birds to
[04:07.440 --> 04:11.520]  be crapped out yet again and the crap is eaten by snails and the whole cycle
[04:11.520 --> 04:17.120]  continues that's not the movie Alien 1970 whatever that's that's that that's
[04:17.120 --> 04:24.160]  real now there it is toxoplasmosis so and they've done some studies in India and
[04:24.160 --> 04:28.600]  in Russia where they cut open crazy cat ladies like why would they have 50 cats
[04:28.600 --> 04:33.280]  why were they so insane why are they man haters and a lot of them have the
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.880]  brain worm this is not a science fiction movie so many feminists you wonder
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.560]  why they're so insane why they're crazy why they're covered in cat piss they
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.880]  they're their olfactory nerve is taken over they hate the smell of testosterone
[04:47.880 --> 04:52.400]  in men this is in studies and they worship the smell of rotting cat piss so
[04:52.400 --> 04:58.880]  they are the zombie hordes the apocalypse programmed by cat piss worms
[04:58.880 --> 05:03.840]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[05:03.840 --> 05:07.760]  drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.440]  island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[05:12.440 --> 05:17.920]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.920]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[05:22.920 --> 05:28.520]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[05:28.520 --> 05:33.680]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[05:33.680 --> 05:38.000]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.400]  turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[05:49.400 --> 05:53.960]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[05:53.960 --> 06:00.680]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[06:06.120 --> 06:12.240]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[06:12.240 --> 06:27.720]  you live from the front lines of the info
[06:42.240 --> 06:53.840]  you know we've got so many incredible clips we're gonna be playing today if
[06:53.840 --> 06:56.720]  you're a radio listener I'll describe them for you but TV viewers obviously
[06:56.720 --> 07:00.920]  can see it on stations across the country and at info wars dot com for its last
[07:00.920 --> 07:05.880]  show but you've really got to see this to believe it mental illness on parade
[07:05.880 --> 07:10.520]  it's a bunch of people that have liberal arts degrees and that have degrees in
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.880]  theater I'm not saying that's a bad thing but just everything is like a bad
[07:14.880 --> 07:21.760]  junior high play mixed with a good dose of mental illness and everyone follows
[07:21.760 --> 07:26.960]  the same chance and it's just giant bizarre pity parties it's all about
[07:26.960 --> 07:30.840]  being dysfunctional and lying about people and then just banging on the
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.760]  doors and trying to open them and by the way I've tried to go get video of the
[07:34.760 --> 07:39.280]  Supreme Court building and it's the most protected building in DC even over the
[07:39.280 --> 07:42.520]  White House I'm serious and they run over you see the footage of this I've got
[07:42.520 --> 07:46.600]  footage of it and say turn your camera off you can't tape and then I talked to
[07:46.600 --> 07:48.880]  the guy he said well you can take for five minutes but don't walk across the
[07:48.880 --> 07:53.400]  street and get near the building I was like five years ago show but they said
[07:53.400 --> 07:58.440]  oh we're gonna let them do it and so you had over 400 arrest in the last few days
[07:58.440 --> 08:03.880]  last number I saw we've got all the footage coming up today of them
[08:03.880 --> 08:08.040]  attacking pregnant women them attacking old people holding up pro-life
[08:08.040 --> 08:13.760]  signs that tends to trigger the most round housing a man a famous feminist
[08:13.760 --> 08:19.880]  man he's well known and worshiped by the left that round houses and kicks a
[08:19.880 --> 08:24.360]  pregnant woman that shocking video is on infowars.com just round houses are
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.320]  right in the head and she's being very very polite to him but just they can't
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.760]  hear you disagree and most of them have jobs either at university suppressing
[08:35.760 --> 08:39.400]  speech or public school suppressing speech or private school suppressing
[08:39.400 --> 08:42.880]  speech or they work for the government in bureaucracies as you see when
[08:42.880 --> 08:46.880]  project veritas in cameras suppressing speech and doxing people and
[08:46.880 --> 08:49.880]  sticking the IRS on innocent Christians and veterans groups and
[08:49.880 --> 08:53.280]  conservative groups and law enforcement groups just harassing people that they
[08:53.280 --> 08:59.720]  had no honor no nothing and so their entire mission is to dominate control but
[08:59.720 --> 09:07.480]  the the number one thing you find that they're involved in is being professors
[09:07.480 --> 09:14.640]  and that the biggest group of these are these crazy power tripping 35 something
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.800]  professors who are I mean we've got hours of video that our own reporter shot
[09:20.800 --> 09:24.680]  live and we have HD also at infowars.com you gotta go see this for yourself and
[09:24.680 --> 09:31.800]  it is the most incredible footage you'll ever see of these individuals
[09:34.800 --> 09:38.040]  freaking out on anyone else's speech and saying you're not allowed to have
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.440]  speech and attacking people and just hysterically screaming rape rape rape
[09:42.440 --> 09:50.080]  rape rape and so they've so dehumanized people over and over and over again
[09:50.080 --> 09:58.440]  that it's just seen as acceptable to attack women by men as long as they're
[09:58.440 --> 10:03.000]  wearing pink or purple they're like an occult. It's like in the Roshneesh cult or
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.120]  something you know that was out in Oregon and of course he's got a pentagram on
[10:06.120 --> 10:11.640]  around his neck he wants to empower women and of course he's famously been
[10:11.640 --> 10:15.720]  videoed before also attacking a pro-life woman from behind tackling her
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.560]  reportedly that's in Paul Joseph Watson's report on infowars.com so we're
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.760]  gonna be getting to all of this today because they're promising to radically
[10:26.760 --> 10:34.520]  escalate all of this in the next 30 days and we're now 30 days out from this
[10:34.520 --> 10:43.360]  incredibly historic election that is about to take place and everyone
[10:43.360 --> 10:47.560]  seriously needs to understand that I got a whole stack of them doxing more
[10:47.560 --> 10:51.800]  members of Congress threatening to kill people promising to riot sorrows you
[10:51.800 --> 11:00.440]  know giving the orders to move on org they're gonna go absolutely ape. So this
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.440]  is a time to be extremely extremely vigilant now let me get to the big news
[11:05.440 --> 11:18.120]  when we come back from this first break. We're going to we're going to get into
[11:18.120 --> 11:27.320]  why Trump is so incredibly successful why America is so incredibly successful
[11:27.320 --> 11:36.400]  and why America could come back so quickly and this is why George Soros
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.760]  and the Democrats and the big global media want me off the air this is why
[11:40.760 --> 11:48.080]  no one has ever been persecuted in the US like this in modern time no one has
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.720]  been banned and attacked and deplatformed and demonetized my credit is
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.280]  basically perfect the fact that I don't have any debt is a blow against me
[11:57.280 --> 12:05.680]  literally we have the best rating you can get in merchant banking it's like
[12:05.680 --> 12:14.440]  not even one tenth of one percent charge backs that's right and we have the
[12:14.440 --> 12:21.640]  highest ratings on the just anybody can get people cannot believe the rates we
[12:21.640 --> 12:30.360]  have two percent I mean the Pentagon doesn't have that Walmart doesn't have
[12:30.360 --> 12:38.680]  that so we had perfect but almost perfect score just like our app had five
[12:38.680 --> 12:45.720]  stars two million downloads on Apple in just a month and they banned it five
[12:45.720 --> 12:53.760]  stars they said they've never heard of one with a perfect score five stars oh
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.080]  but Tim Cook last week said he curated it against the museum and got rid of it
[12:59.080 --> 13:01.760]  because oh my god we launched it two weeks before everything else got banned
[13:01.760 --> 13:06.400]  it got downloaded two million extra times it went to number one in news was
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.480]  going towards number one total in the world so they banned it so that's what
[13:10.480 --> 13:14.920]  I'm getting at here is folks this is draconian and now they're going after
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.240]  our other payment processors and the payment processors are like no one even
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.120]  knows the payment processors we know how they find out it's is it the CIA and I'm
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.560]  like yes it is it's the Democrats inside the Justice Department that are
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.960]  running it we have confirmed it the Democrats have left people behind in
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.240]  government at the Justice Department CIA and they're operating and ignoring most
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.840]  of what Trump says and doing whatever they want and working with big tech and
[13:39.840 --> 13:43.840]  big banks and this is criminal and it's dangerous and the president needs to
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.960]  move against it and he's trying to and his own people are blocking him on the
[13:47.960 --> 13:51.640]  executive orders and on criminal action against big tech and others and I can
[13:51.640 --> 13:56.080]  tell you before we even started getting demonetized which is a red level
[13:56.080 --> 14:02.160]  emergency folks it's a real serious blow worst yet beyond crippling us of their
[14:02.160 --> 14:14.920]  success if they continue to do this to me they're already doing it to millions
[14:14.920 --> 14:18.760]  of other people around the world it's the end of this country listen to one and
[14:18.760 --> 14:22.400]  when I was talking to folks the White House and people in the campaign high
[14:22.400 --> 14:25.800]  level and others they said recently they said listen this is like three months
[14:25.800 --> 14:29.400]  ago they said Alex it's not getting kicked off big Texas the big issue that's
[14:29.400 --> 14:32.440]  big it's gonna be demonetizing everybody they're already trying to do it to the
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.680]  NRA the NRA could barely stop them folks they do that they've got your second
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.240]  amendment do you understand they're coming for everybody they're criminal

[15:28.880 --> 15:32.480]  that it's coming back is absolutely driving them crazy so when we come back

[18:45.560 --> 18:49.480]  tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[20:01.000 --> 20:24.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:24.480 --> 20:28.320]  so something really important is happening something very very special
[20:28.320 --> 20:33.240]  and that's why you see the ire of the ruling class in this country that have
[20:33.240 --> 20:35.800]  really just sold us out to foreign corporate interest that's why you see
[20:35.800 --> 20:40.240]  them flipping out because they know that their old tried and trusted systems of
[20:40.240 --> 20:45.400]  of intimidation of mob rule of bullying aren't working anymore thanks for joining
[20:45.400 --> 20:50.320]  us I'm Alex Jones your host so people ask why are we under UN control why are
[20:50.320 --> 20:54.360]  we under IMF World Bank control why are we under Interpol control our law
[20:54.360 --> 20:57.600]  enforcement at the federal level basically takes orders in many cases from
[20:57.600 --> 21:03.160]  Interpol that was headed by the former deputy of the entire military he was
[21:03.160 --> 21:09.200]  like number two in the Chinese military civilian head of the Chinese military
[21:09.200 --> 21:13.000]  and he was the head of Interpol and he disappeared last week and I said I bet
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.760]  the Chinese government grabbed him because he wasn't following all the
[21:15.760 --> 21:20.000]  orders they had to spy on Americans and spy on dissidents which he was doing
[21:20.000 --> 21:27.840]  reportedly that's right the Chinese former deputy head of their armed forces and
[21:27.840 --> 21:35.560]  the former deputy head of their Navy the South China Sea their Navy Chinese are
[21:35.560 --> 21:38.680]  famous for shipping drugs around the world oh they'll they'll they'll deal
[21:38.680 --> 21:41.840]  drugs all the world they just don't let you bring drugs into China or they
[21:41.840 --> 21:47.720]  execute you yes this gentleman Interpol's president is reported missing in
[21:47.720 --> 21:52.960]  China prompting inquiry well we find out days later the government grabbed him
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.760]  up people like wow the Chinese were running Interpol yeah when you check
[21:58.760 --> 22:04.040]  into a hotel anywhere in the world that's industrialized Interpol gets a
[22:04.040 --> 22:14.120]  record of it not the FBI but the Chinese communist it's like I told you they
[22:14.120 --> 22:17.480]  own Hollywood they own 98% of the rarest minerals they've got all the
[22:17.480 --> 22:21.880]  major deepwater ports they've got almost all the industrialization all the big
[22:21.880 --> 22:26.160]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan investment because they've got a billion plus
[22:26.160 --> 22:29.400]  slaves and the globalist went over there 60 years ago when they didn't have
[22:29.400 --> 22:36.560]  running water and knew that they had high IQs and set them up to destroy us
[22:37.760 --> 22:44.320]  because they use their people like toilet paper and so President Trump comes
[22:44.320 --> 22:47.480]  out and says China is the big threat they're meddling and they're allied with
[22:47.480 --> 22:53.040]  traders in our government absolutely the Russians don't even show up on the
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.360]  Richter scale who do you think should bed with the chai comms Soros what do you
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.000]  think should bed with them Yunker who's Yunker unelected head of the EU look into
[23:04.000 --> 23:11.240]  it so these are the real power players and the reason they want me off air is
[23:11.240 --> 23:15.760]  the key to the whole puzzle because people always ask well why don't more
[23:15.760 --> 23:20.000]  people in Congress stand up because they docked your house first your dog
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.400]  disappears then one of your kids you think Soros and the chai comms got in
[23:25.400 --> 23:32.840]  power because they play footsie or tiddly winks they're not playing games I'll
[23:32.840 --> 23:36.480]  say it again China's killed five times with Hitler did look it up yeah they
[23:36.480 --> 23:41.960]  got the all-time murder crown the heavyweight champion mass murderers
[23:41.960 --> 23:49.080]  of the world and weighing in from communist China with a total of 115
[23:49.080 --> 23:53.960]  million of their own people killed not to mention over a hundred thousand
[23:53.960 --> 24:00.600]  Tibetans in the last decade alone and climbing the undisputed mass murderer
[24:00.600 --> 24:10.440]  champions of the world the communist bloodthirsty dragon and it's backed up
[24:10.440 --> 24:16.640]  by Yunker and the unelected EU 330 plus million people headed up by the
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.720]  grandson of the richest Nazi his father an SS officer himself the owner by
[24:21.720 --> 24:27.720]  conquest of Luxembourg reportedly one of the richest men in the world so rich is
[24:27.720 --> 24:40.920]  well-secret Lord Yunker now I'm gonna get to Trump's total winning streak when
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.000]  we come back and how they're gonna strike back I'm gonna say this right now
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.240]  I'm gonna get serious with you because here's the deal I've been on there 23
[24:48.240 --> 24:55.200]  years and let's just say I've seen a few things and been through some things and
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.240]  I'm always gonna step up to the next fight I'm not gonna back down it's not in
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.200]  me because these people are bad so I can't roll over to it it's just instinctive
[25:04.200 --> 25:12.840]  and spiritual but let's just say this they are absolutely running my ass in
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.800]  the ground as you can see every day in the newspapers television you name it to
[25:16.800 --> 25:20.760]  start the first domino going over with all their lies and all their propaganda
[25:20.760 --> 25:23.720]  now talk radio and conservative see through it you've been through it forever
[25:23.720 --> 25:26.840]  you saw what they did to Sean Hannity or Limbaugh anybody people get it
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.520]  conservatives and Christians we get it but we're not on the offense most of
[25:30.520 --> 25:37.400]  the time and so I'm just gonna say this right now to everybody publicly they do
[25:37.400 --> 25:40.440]  a lot of bad stuff and I'm not feeling sorry for myself I asked for it but
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.000]  behind the scenes and I have reasons not to get into all of it it's it's next
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  low and it only makes me want to fight harder how evil they are now corrupt and
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.960]  just seeing the true face of evil smelling it touching it knowing it but
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.680]  these people are real like the worst cancer your body can get they are as
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.000]  bad as it gets okay and they go after anybody stands up against them now
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.760]  enough people you read about it in history we see it in movies where one
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.560]  guy stands up at first nobody else helps him but even if he gets killed or
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.960]  succeeds it spurs others to stand up we've reached that point where people are
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.000]  starting to stand up in mass so they're trying to intimidate even more and now
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.440]  it's not working so they're really getting freaked out but the reason you
[26:25.440 --> 26:31.240]  don't see people going public is the international systems really blood
[26:31.240 --> 26:34.160]  thirsty and really criminal and other nations don't have any basic freedoms
[26:34.160 --> 26:38.760]  and at least get away with whatever they want and so they've got a lot of
[26:38.760 --> 26:42.040]  servants and minions worldwide that are willing to carry out this evil and
[26:42.040 --> 26:51.000]  they're trying to destroy me and info wars in front of everyone to scare
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.600]  everybody else they know they're not scaring me I mean it's not saying I'm
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.440]  the toughest guy around but you know I mean I go into a mode of I don't have
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.600]  any fear the fear is not standing up against them but you need to know though
[27:05.600 --> 27:10.440]  that info wars future is in your hands and I'm very happy to have gotten let's
[27:10.440 --> 27:14.000]  not exaggerate since the ban 50 something new stations a lot of them are
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.480]  gigantic they're all precious how about radio stations big ones big cities
[27:19.480 --> 27:22.840]  hate to mention them the leftists will harass them with the owners and station
[27:22.840 --> 27:25.320]  managers they know they're they're seeking us out because they're tired of
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.640]  this they see through it and they get that trumps the only one that's totally
[27:28.640 --> 27:31.840]  broken through despite the fact he's lost over a billion dollars of his own
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.320]  money and everything in this fight he's paid a lot folks he's doing nothing up
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.640]  there for his own interest except for freedom which is his total interest and
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.800]  so I am in your hands Trump has broken through their lies he has broken through
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.200]  and shown their fraud and now they're trying to destroy me and then next they
[27:49.200 --> 27:53.000]  admit is Tucker Carlson and then Sean Hannity and and and people like Matt

[33:04.040 --> 33:23.680]  the Alex Jones show
[33:23.680 --> 33:51.520]  okay so let's get into the really good news and why the globalist are so
[33:51.520 --> 33:53.800]  incredibly desperate because they thought they have this country under
[33:53.800 --> 33:57.360]  their full control but right at the last moment two minutes to midnight the
[33:57.360 --> 34:01.240]  American people the populist movement all of you and I want to say is make you
[34:01.240 --> 34:05.200]  feel good you are the tip of the spear our audience is the tip of the spear you
[34:05.200 --> 34:10.360]  are the Paul Revere's we grabbed it away from them right at the last moment right
[34:10.360 --> 34:15.560]  as the door was closing and so the globalist had the leftist controlled CIA
[34:15.560 --> 34:19.800]  and the analyst department not the whole CIA and the Justice Department and
[34:19.800 --> 34:27.000]  others literally go do an assessment even during the 2016 campaign of info
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.400]  wars and Trump and others they had a plan to shut down our populism even when
[34:31.400 --> 34:35.280]  Hillary won they were gonna try to stamp it out so now that's why they're so
[34:35.280 --> 34:39.880]  panicked so but but but beyond shutting down independent media and censoring
[34:39.880 --> 34:45.280]  everybody their main goal was to suppress the economy and in the Wiki
[34:45.280 --> 34:48.880]  leaks they say we want people poor we don't want the economy growing we want
[34:48.880 --> 34:52.480]  them to want to be on welfare we don't want the market to be so good they want
[34:52.480 --> 34:55.680]  to go out and get good paying jobs I mean it's so cold-blooded we covered it
[34:55.680 --> 35:01.080]  all the time so they don't want us on air to be able to remind people of all
[35:01.080 --> 35:09.680]  this and that's why they're going after info wars because if President Trump and
[35:09.680 --> 35:12.800]  I know all of you know this but we've got to get this out to our friends our
[35:12.800 --> 35:17.720]  family our neighbors everybody if he can continue he's probably only got 25 30%
[35:17.720 --> 35:23.720]  control of the executive right now top analysts just are quoted as saying that
[35:23.720 --> 35:27.960]  Trump's only got partial control of the federal government right now and he's
[35:27.960 --> 35:33.160]  already turned stuff around massively can you imagine what you think the Chai
[35:33.160 --> 35:37.080]  comms are gonna have 10% growth rates for the last 60 years but we haven't had a
[35:37.080 --> 35:42.800]  10% growth rate in over 100 years America had a 10% growth rate for almost
[35:42.800 --> 35:50.680]  all of its first hundred and fifty years did you know that but now oh no three
[35:50.680 --> 35:56.640]  percent it's impossible they're liars they sold us out on purpose and Trump
[35:56.640 --> 36:00.520]  knows that so they call it mentally ill I've got articles here with Colin Powell
[36:00.520 --> 36:05.720]  Trump's insane the world thinks he's nuts Washington Post you name it
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.800]  America's global order can be saved liberal internationalism has long been
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.800]  supported by a three-legged stool fear hope and political leadership yeah fear
[36:16.800 --> 36:19.680]  of nuclear war that's why you don't want peace with North Korea and Iran all
[36:19.680 --> 36:22.680]  these places and Trump's doing it through strength forcing them to the
[36:22.680 --> 36:26.840]  bargaining table instead the leftists and the globalist and the neocons give
[36:26.840 --> 36:30.520]  weapons to Iran and give weapons to North Korea and then let them get out of
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.920]  control and Trump goes I will blow your ass off you keep doing that or we'll
[36:34.920 --> 36:40.120]  build super highways and hotels everywhere how's that sound see how that
[36:40.120 --> 36:51.480]  works real diplomacy real Americana so let's continue here Trump understands
[36:51.480 --> 36:54.840]  this and he understands that you've got the lawlessness and the bullying and the
[36:54.840 --> 36:58.600]  out of control behavior the left and suddenly all those blue blood Republicans
[36:58.600 --> 37:03.000]  that were intimidated by mainstream media and were intimidated by CNN and MSNBC
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.880]  and all the rest of it now they get that actually being attacked by that's a bad
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.400]  courage and getting death-threaded at their houses and their wives getting
[37:13.400 --> 37:17.280]  sent videos of the headings you know what that didn't intimidate them that
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.760]  made them angry so you're seeing now that Lindsey Graham's office leash and
[37:21.760 --> 37:25.200]  John McCain's dead but suddenly he's voting good and acting good and being
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.440]  who he wants to be and being popular and suddenly all these other blue blood
[37:30.440 --> 37:38.120]  Republicans are acting like Donald Trump because of one word leadership what
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.840]  is leadership it's not giving motivational speeches it's not wearing
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.520]  the fanciest suit it's not landing in the nicest helicopter and people see
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.760]  that as leadership that's fine real leadership is being a leader and doing
[37:52.760 --> 37:56.840]  what's not popular or going against the grain because you know it's right and
[37:56.840 --> 38:00.560]  being proven you're right and that you have the instincts and the know-how to
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.240]  turn the society around a leader has the sixth sense and they have the courage
[38:06.240 --> 38:09.520]  and they have the spirit and they have the will and they have the physical
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.040]  prowess and they have the commitment they have everything there are a lot of
[38:14.040 --> 38:17.240]  people acting like their leaders but there aren't really a lot of them a
[38:17.240 --> 38:22.920]  leader has to love life so much they're ready to die for their people and my
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.760]  people are the planet Earth and our great vision and our great opportunities
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.080]  how far we've already come we are like gods with our technology compared to the
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.280]  ancients they would see us as gods but we aren't half as chivalrous or strong all
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.880]  the numbers and statistics and the graves they've dug up show you know
[38:39.880 --> 38:44.760]  people five thousand years ago were twice as strong as we are today the
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.840]  people they've dug up in Britannia and people they've dug up in what South
[38:48.840 --> 38:57.880]  Africa today work twice as strong as the people today think about that now
[38:57.880 --> 39:00.800]  there's a curve people are getting weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker and
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.040]  weaker with industrialization and then drugs and working out getting back into
[39:04.040 --> 39:10.040]  you know exercise it went back up a little bit nothing compared to five six
[39:10.040 --> 39:13.760]  seven thousand years ago people were the average woman was stronger than the
[39:13.760 --> 39:16.280]  average man
[39:18.600 --> 39:22.280]  me reach stuff from like a thousand years ago accounts of Vikings ripping
[39:22.280 --> 39:31.440]  people's arms out of their sockets so they want us weak they want us control
[39:31.440 --> 39:35.480]  they want us dominate instead of us bouncing back from our de-evolutionary
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.280]  plunge that we're in that the globalists have organized in their own
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.840]  admissions and so Trump wants to build a pro-human future he wants to build
[39:44.840 --> 39:48.520]  rugged individualism just like Teddy Roosevelt did he wants to have that
[39:48.520 --> 39:52.840]  American exceptionalism like a like a virus spread across the world and not
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.960]  conquer the world through force but through ideas instead the communist
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.520]  Chinese and mass murder and socialism and Tim Cook saying accept China and
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.040]  bring censorship here he's all over the news saying round up this and it's I'll
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.400]  help you do it they're monsters where is our soul where is our humanity to say
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.640]  no to them and so yes I've shown the leadership and the audience has shown of
[40:16.640 --> 40:19.760]  the leadership because you're not an audience you're in the arena you are
[40:19.760 --> 40:23.840]  leaders of every race color and creed and you're willing to talk about the new
[40:23.840 --> 40:27.160]  world order and now everything we talk about world government George Soros
[40:27.160 --> 40:31.560]  Astro turf the Federal Reserve trying to kill the economy all of this
[40:31.560 --> 40:38.880]  information ladies and gentlemen all of this information is now mainstream and
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.520]  they're going where did it come from who is the guy that keeps starting it who is
[40:43.520 --> 40:48.200]  the guy that continues over and over again to be the one that's first causing
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.120]  the chain reaction and they keep saying it's two people it's Donald John Trump
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.760]  and it's Alex Jones and I keep telling you that because it's not about bragging
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.120]  they want me destroyed because they don't want you to have a focal point in a
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.320]  place to come together they don't want to validate you they want to make you feel
[41:07.320 --> 41:13.200]  alone so in this trifecta there and I'm just telling you because the enemy
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.120]  already knows this there's the president there's Matt Drudge and there's Alex
[41:17.120 --> 41:23.240]  Jones and they want all three of those taken out but the good news is you tune
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.640]  in to Tucker Carlson it sounds like the Alex Jones show but probably a better
[41:27.640 --> 41:35.080]  interviewer and better guess sometimes the point is is that it's not Tucker
[41:35.080 --> 41:40.400]  Carlson imitating me it's the truth and now it's safe to say it same thing with
[41:40.400 --> 41:43.960]  Sean Hannity the same thing with every other major talk show hosts now that's
[41:43.960 --> 41:48.160]  what leadership's about is being the test pilot hitting the bar bar and that's
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.920]  what you're doing every day and that's what Trump's doing every day is making
[41:51.920 --> 41:55.560]  it okay to tell the truth and the control freaks at the universities and big
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.640]  media and the globalists they don't know what to do because they haven't been
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.360]  able to intimidate and shut anybody up the last few years and our example is
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.480]  shining through so they're trying to bring in Chinese Communist style mark of
[42:11.480 --> 42:14.720]  the beast stuff where you can't buy or sell or have bank accounts if you
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.680]  criticize the New World Order hoping that will intimidate you it's not
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.760]  intimidating me I want Congress to act I want you to call the White House it's
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.320]  anti-trust it's racketeering it's cartels they're working in concert it's
[42:27.320 --> 42:32.120]  discriminatory and we're going to defeat this we're going to stand against this
[42:32.120 --> 42:35.960]  in this republic and we're going to turn back the tide of evil because we
[42:35.960 --> 42:39.640]  don't have a choice because we're not going to turn our children over to this
[42:39.640 --> 42:45.320]  evil now I'm asking you are you with me or not and I know you are but we are the
[42:45.320 --> 42:50.080]  center of the fight we are the standard up against the enemy we are the flag and

[45:05.120 --> 45:09.640]  an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[45:09.640 --> 45:14.800]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[45:14.800 --> 45:20.040]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.000]  people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.360]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.480]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable
[45:33.480 --> 45:37.680]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.440]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[45:42.440 --> 45:46.480]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.440]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go

[47:30.120 --> 47:34.680]  a midterm coming up an election historically whoever's president I
[47:34.680 --> 47:38.360]  don't know why this works but whoever's I guess people get complacent you know
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.920]  hey we just won the presidency now two years later we have an election so they
[47:41.920 --> 47:45.880]  complacent and then we always win in the next one which is as you know the
[47:45.880 --> 47:53.360]  presidential election so far I'm dreaming of those candidates I see those
[47:53.360 --> 48:00.760]  candidates before my eyes every night before I go to sleep sometimes while I'm
[48:00.760 --> 48:17.760]  sleeping I love them so much Cory Booker Pocahontas Pocahontas I've got more
[48:17.760 --> 48:31.080]  Indian blood in me then Pocahontas and I have none I mean they said to her why do
[48:31.080 --> 48:34.880]  you say you're of Indian heritage well my mother told me I have high cheekbones
[48:34.880 --> 48:39.720]  that's tears do you have any documentation no we don't oh I see your
[48:39.720 --> 48:43.640]  high cheekbones why I have high cheekbones so hey maybe I'm an Indian and
[48:43.640 --> 48:50.360]  I'm gonna do very well but think of it this is her reason the whole thing's
[48:50.360 --> 48:54.440]  been afford but that's okay you know what I want to be careful I'm taking out so
[48:54.440 --> 48:57.680]  many of these people I'm hitting them so hard that they're disappearing and I
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.400]  don't want to do that because I may get somebody that's actually good to run
[49:02.400 --> 49:09.000]  against me that would not be good I'll take out all the easy ones and maybe I'll
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.440]  get stuck with somebody that's actually good but I don't see any on that side
[49:18.120 --> 49:26.800]  well sleepy Joe Biden who ran for president two or three times you know
[49:26.800 --> 49:32.280]  they say only twice I think I remember a third time in there but he had one
[49:32.280 --> 49:37.400]  percent with an arrow pointing left that means one percent or less and then
[49:37.400 --> 49:43.240]  Obama took him off the trash heap well he's one of the people remember he
[49:43.240 --> 49:47.840]  challenged me to a fight I'd like to take him behind the bar I'd love that
[49:47.840 --> 49:55.960]  that would be like he's a reanimated courts he got one percent that's right
[49:55.960 --> 50:11.120]  he's a total loser go like this he's down and he'll never get up but that was
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.640]  Biden trying to create the view of violence this whole attitude of attack
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.440]  the Republicans go beat up Rand Paul and break six of his ribs shoot
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.080]  congressman's police that's what they're pushing I've got a whole stack of news in
[50:24.080 --> 50:26.960]  that area I'm gonna get into it a bunch of clips the next hour but I wanted to
[50:26.960 --> 50:32.480]  play some of these clips of Trump Saturday yesterday and the a speech he
[50:32.480 --> 50:35.960]  gave and how he's on the campaign trail out there just absolutely knocking it
[50:35.960 --> 50:44.680]  out of the park but the biggest thing he did was give this the name dick name to
[50:44.680 --> 50:51.240]  Richard Blumenthal who was one of the most corrupt slime bag members of the
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.920]  Congress of the Senate he is famous and loved in Connecticut Connecticut was a
[50:56.920 --> 51:01.320]  totally red state super free market like Texas but beautiful you know just
[51:01.320 --> 51:06.480]  gorgeous trees and mountains I love Connecticut gorgeous and just like
[51:06.480 --> 51:11.600]  Austin's beautiful town collapsing California is now colonizing us and
[51:11.600 --> 51:15.920]  they're doing the exact same crap I did in California they're like locust they
[51:15.920 --> 51:19.280]  come to your area they ruin it and they try to kick you out of your own town your
[51:19.280 --> 51:23.000]  own area and so I was talking to Roger Stone today he's like look Connecticut
[51:23.000 --> 51:28.400]  loves the fact that Denang dick lied about his military service was never in
[51:28.400 --> 51:31.520]  Vietnam was in the military reserves Army reserves nothing wrong with that
[51:31.520 --> 51:34.760]  you know Trump supports the military likes the military he doesn't ever say
[51:34.760 --> 51:38.720]  it was in the military and so he made some really really good points I'm gonna
[51:38.720 --> 51:41.720]  get to here in a moment but then I'm gonna get into Trump's remarkable week
[51:41.720 --> 51:47.560]  wow and even CNN had to say President Donald Trump's winning streak and I
[51:47.560 --> 51:51.040]  read this article I couldn't believe it front page CNN your state they admitted
[51:51.040 --> 51:57.120]  on the Nath a deal he did make it better on the second Supreme Court nominee who
[51:57.120 --> 52:01.560]  was a strict constructionist just like he said he would do and of course the
[52:01.560 --> 52:05.680]  economy the best it's been since the early 1960s the last big giant mega boom
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.720]  I mean he's already eclipsed Ronald Reagan that's the fact and he's bringing
[52:09.720 --> 52:14.840]  sovereignty back to the country people go oh my gosh you're supporting an
[52:14.840 --> 52:18.880]  establishment guy he fired all the lobbyist the establishment hates him
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.400]  he'll hire a Goldman Sachs person to bring him in and say I want you to get
[52:22.400 --> 52:26.960]  Goldman Sachs to invest more here than China and I see the Democrat talking
[52:26.960 --> 52:32.440]  points I'm four dot com in the comments I see him constantly it's all Jones you
[52:32.440 --> 52:36.920]  know what it's incredible you're supporting a skull and bones or I've
[52:36.920 --> 52:40.400]  got the article here in my stack I'm gonna get to it next hour you support a
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.040]  skull and bones are like Kavanaugh and I went Kavanaugh didn't go to skull and
[52:45.040 --> 52:52.040]  bones I looked that up Kavanaugh went to the only blue collar secret society on
[52:52.040 --> 52:56.360]  Yale because he came from lower middle class parents they weren't rich and
[52:56.360 --> 52:59.960]  spent all their money on education for him and it was mostly about drinking it
[52:59.960 --> 53:04.040]  was just a normal fraternity and even BuzzFeed said it was the lowest level
[53:04.040 --> 53:09.200]  for people seen as basically poor at Yale it was the it was kind of the outcast
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.000]  group that didn't want to be in secret societies and didn't like skull and bones
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.080]  I'm not kidding but see I saw that talking point all over info wars.com oh
[53:19.080 --> 53:24.520]  Jones is the new elect Trump 2020 headquarters and Jones is really sold
[53:24.520 --> 53:28.800]  out he supports us skull and bones are like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh has a very
[53:28.800 --> 53:33.520]  conservative voting record we barely saved the Second Amendment with DC versus
[53:33.520 --> 53:43.160]  Seller he wants to control the borders he'll back the president is he Barrett
[53:43.160 --> 53:47.120]  who's even more conservative no do I like it that he clerked was the
[53:47.120 --> 53:50.520]  assistant to George the Bush no but we're defeating the blue bloods we're
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.040]  taking power from him what do you think happened in ancient Rome when your
[53:54.040 --> 53:57.760]  family became the most powerful in the petition class you married the daughters
[53:57.760 --> 54:03.400]  of your enemy you defeated you and your brothers and your sons weren't shelling
[54:03.400 --> 54:08.880]  out you know when Julius Caesar was marrying his enemies you know why for
[54:08.880 --> 54:12.960]  having his daughter married off to his enemy
[54:12.960 --> 54:18.160]  Pompey he wasn't doing it because he was selling out he was doing it because he
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.920]  was taking over so you people out there look I'm a thousand percent
[54:22.920 --> 54:28.880]  Americana I want my country back I want an open free society I want capitalism I
[54:28.880 --> 54:33.640]  want America and I'm pushing for it period everything I do is totally
[54:33.640 --> 54:39.080]  transparent and I'm not even getting into this because I see that talking
[54:39.080 --> 54:44.040]  point out there it's not even true I'm sick of the lies I'm sick of the
[54:44.040 --> 54:50.080]  garbage Trump's the opposite of somebody in a secret society he doesn't join any
[54:50.080 --> 54:53.440]  of the clubs he isn't part of the back scratching groups he isn't part of the
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.920]  good old boy operations and that's why they hate his guts he thinks he's smarter
[54:58.920 --> 55:04.480]  and better than all of them and guess what he is you know there's this big
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.520]  talking point out there about Trump and the creation myth of the billionaire
[55:09.520 --> 55:15.120]  businessman Donald Trump just imploded and they released probably because his
[55:15.120 --> 55:19.400]  former CFO has been turned by the government to you know say whatever so
[55:19.400 --> 55:22.720]  he doesn't get prosecuted for God knows what like Trump's you know lawyer who's
[55:22.720 --> 55:25.920]  in trouble for not paying taxes but what's have to do with Trump nothing
[55:25.920 --> 55:32.880]  Trump had no stake in that taxi cab place and so now they're saying oh my god
[55:32.880 --> 55:39.400]  you know Trump's dad began giving all the children thousands and thousands of
[55:39.400 --> 55:45.160]  dollars in company stake from the time they were born well I'm not rich but I
[55:45.160 --> 55:49.280]  mean every time I have one of my children born I got four children when
[55:49.280 --> 55:54.840]  they're born I mean the lion's share of money I've shaved is in investment for
[55:54.840 --> 56:01.600]  them so that they have some type of future if the world doesn't end so they
[56:01.600 --> 56:05.400]  can go to college I mean I'm in a very risky position obviously so my children
[56:05.400 --> 56:10.880]  have most of my savings that is totally normal so I read all these documents I
[56:10.880 --> 56:16.440]  showed my dad on Friday I emailed him to my CPA who's like a lawyer as well one
[56:16.440 --> 56:19.680]  of the top guys in Texas and he said this is all a hundred percent center I
[56:19.680 --> 56:23.800]  said I said I thought so because I'm not a rich guy like Trump or Fred Trump is
[56:23.800 --> 56:28.440]  dead but I said you know this is standard asset protection but also estate
[56:28.440 --> 56:32.240]  planning that if you're rich and you never know how long you're gonna live
[56:32.240 --> 56:37.560]  and you own a whole bunch of stuff if you die you pay fifty percent back then
[56:37.560 --> 56:42.960]  and I think I just changed it in in a state tax and so you've got to start
[56:42.960 --> 56:46.680]  giving your money away people always ask why do rich people have all these
[56:46.680 --> 56:50.040]  spoiled rotten trust fund kids and it is a bad byproduct if you don't make them
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.680]  work it's because that's what they set up like 80 years ago they changed the law
[56:54.680 --> 56:58.480]  after during the Great Depression where you could put money in trust for your
[56:58.480 --> 57:07.080]  kids and so I read this and it was totally standard totally oh my god it's
[57:07.080 --> 57:11.560]  illegal oh gosh it's so bad oh he's in a lot of trouble I didn't just believe it
[57:11.560 --> 57:16.240]  I sent it to my CPA he said oh yeah I've already seen all that back when that
[57:16.240 --> 57:19.280]  was done you know in the last 40 50 years is totally standard it's even more
[57:19.280 --> 57:24.080]  aggressive now and of course Trump's not hypocritical he said the death tax should
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.600]  be abolished all right I haven't even gotten into the winning-winning winning
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.280]  yet but the point is he's been totally winning it proves their frauds it
[57:32.280 --> 57:35.960]  proves they're the ones mismanaging they claim Trump's this total moron he
[57:35.960 --> 57:39.120]  wins out of nowhere the first time he runs for office now they claim it's
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.360]  all because there's a daddy his daddy's been dead a long time did his daddy win
[57:42.360 --> 57:45.640]  the election did his daddy turn the economy around his daddy get all these

[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.160]  getting on that bandwagon fine gang up come on let's go I mean I'm here to tell
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:54.840]  the truth period but we have had so much traffic increased info wars.com and
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:59.000]  news wars.com and prison planet.com but particularly on the video we have that
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.880]  video player that I wanted people to be able to embed that's on the front page
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.120]  of info wars.com on the right hand side halfway down and it turns out thousands
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:15.200]  of sites have embedded it on their site so that's great I wanted it embeddable
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:22.160]  it's you know watch now breaking live and I guess to save bandwidth they did
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:28.560]  this thing where it isn't a video player playing but I countermanded that on
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.600]  Thursday so I'll just it's great no problem no problem it's been about two
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.080]  hours this weekend on this on the phone but the point is is that just having that
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.360]  player and everybody's clicking on it because it's playing but the show in the
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:50.520]  background that's why CNN does that it has cost us $70,000 more in a month on
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.720]  top of all the other bandwidth so we're talking hundreds of thousands of
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.680]  dollars total and that's because we have millions and millions and millions and
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.840]  millions of people a day tuning into the audio streams and the video streams

[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.440]  police and just we're we're in a civil war with criminal globalist folks but
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.560]  here's Trump knocking out of the park on Pocahontas and Danoi ding dong. Somebody
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.960]  actually said you hit these candidates really hard here's a non-candidate you
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:13.040]  know Don Ang Dick he's a Don Ang Dick as Blumenthal he talked about when I was
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.680]  in Don Ang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill and men are going
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.720]  left and right of me they're dying they're being struck by bullets but I
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:30.240]  went back to their rescue I went back and I got them and then I made a second
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.760]  attempt and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they're
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.840]  hitting my man and I used to think wow this guy's a pretty brave guy and then I
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.360]  found out he's a fraud he never was in Vietnam
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:54.480]  and he stopped campaigning because there was no way you could win no way and
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:00.720]  because it's Connecticut where I guess only a Democrat can you believe this
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.600]  that's why Connecticut's such a mess right now only a Democrat where you
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:12.160]  gotta see it's a mess General Electric just moved out that doesn't help but
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.120]  Don Ang Dick and then I see him yesterday talking about a man who's
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:22.040]  number one at Yale has like this perfect record the most incredible record one of
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:32.680]  the reasons I picked him he's like a perfect person and Don Ang Dick who who
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:40.280]  said he was a great war hero and he never saw the country this wasn't like
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.760]  saying hey I was in the army this way this is this a guy that said he was
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.120]  charging up Don Ang Don Ang province right Don Ang right he's up that hill
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.120]  and he's taking bullets left and right and he never saw the place he was in the
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:03.040]  reserve cell remember that and he said I demand honesty this is true exact words
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:11.320]  I demand honesty integrity and I demand that there's no lying going around and
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.560]  I'm saying and where is that that's the guy that lied about in the worst in the
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.920]  history of our country if you look at it he lied and this is one of the people
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.360]  how bad and then you have the fine scene and you have all the others and you
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.480]  look at what's going you don't want those people in office folks you've got to
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:37.280]  have great people now think about how powerful that is the guy is as bad as
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.440]  Brian Williams remember the city got shot down by an RPG in a helicopter then
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:47.600]  oh he was in a helicopter and saw one shot down okay so the first thing I
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.520]  want to go to here now is this piece and if you're a radio listener it's
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:11:00.440]  powerful but if you're a TV viewer it is unbelievable this is Halloween music
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.880]  been put to by one of the crew Greg did this and it's almost makes it weaker
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.600]  with the Halloween music and I'm not mad he did it he's an incredible guy but
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.680]  it's Democrat move on dot org that Soros is group having them chant back like
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:20.600]  zombies what they're gonna say and they look like zombies and they're acting like
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.120]  zombies and then we've got all these other videos of them doing the same
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.320]  stuff outside different groups and it's like is this like invasion of the body
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.120]  snatchers or something so this is real video and real audio of Democrat
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:42.160]  handlers having them repeat back in a trance like they're trained dogs here's
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.160]  the video
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480]  hi
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:25.640]  in 30 minutes meet me to the left if you would like to go to an office
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:45.640]  to spend time with your senator
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.640]  I
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.160]  So and then there's counselor videos. We've already aired the last few days
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.660]  Everybody's probably see on their own info wars calm and news wars calm but share them
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360]  Because this is this is who their people are
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560]  Where they're
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.360]  Orin hatches says, you know, hey, okay, whatever they go. Oh, it's you shake your hand
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.360]  I mean you saw some of that but and then they start yelling you're a rapist to Mitch McConnell
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.800]  People like now. I'm a rapist too. I'm a rapist. You're a rapist. Wouldn't you like to be a rapist too?
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:59.160]  Meanwhile, George Soros is a literal Nazi collaborator that rounded up hundreds and hundreds of Jewish families himself
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.160]  He was the rat they'd send in
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.920]  They say he was gonna help the Jews and round him up and he wants to be shut down off the air because I keep saying that
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.000]  It's true. You went on 60 minutes and said it jerk the next as soon as a new movie. So
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:18.360]  Now here's a woman again attacking an old guy with a pro-life sign for radio listeners
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:24.280]  I'll describe it, but this is the type of stuff that was going on will show part of the guy roundhouse kicking the pro-lifer in the face
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:53.600]  Here it is. We got a glitch with our computer today. It's computers, you know, they are what we put this on in four's letter
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.640]  We'll add her hitting him and grabbing the sign away and I'll just cut the videos at that point
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.640]  But we've got other videos on info wars calm
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.440]  Dead show them attacking other people
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:10.320]  We're gonna go to break here in a moment. I'm gonna come back and get into Soros himself and why he's so incredibly dangerous now
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.440]  He's financing trying to take down info wars and will America buckle of this or will America stand against it

[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:07.280]  Oh, we want more money more money and oh this and that and so I've broken my contract

[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.880]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:26.480]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my and welcome back to this live global Sunday transmission
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.240]  I'm gonna have
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:35.000]  Lee Stranahan who's a syndicate of columnist and talk show host his own right host the last two segments
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.160]  We can really lay all this out for you
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:43.520]  But I think it's important to go back to not just professor Ford and all of her bizarre
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:49.720]  Contradictions in testimony, but some of the other women as well and the fact that
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480]  When people apparently
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:21:00.920]  What it looks like perjure themselves to Congress in sworn statements under penalty of felony perjury that there really should be an
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.200]  Investigation of this and most law enforcement
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:09.560]  Files that are out there not just here but across the Western world show that about half of sex assault claims are fake
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:13.320]  And it's not just something women do in this whole victimology culture
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:18.840]  It's getting worse and worse the false flags with the poop swastikas drawn on dorm doors or little
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320]  foothold burning crosses
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320]  or black churches being attacked
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.560]  90 plus percent of the time it turns out that it's fake
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.520]  Jewish centers being attacked. It's the leftist Jewish guy doing it to blame Trump
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:40.960]  We've seen this over and over and over again because you can then demonize and frame your opposition and the left are a bunch of drama queens
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.160]  As we showed earlier in the last hour
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:51.760]  All the different clips of them telling them how to chant and telling them how to talk and telling them how to speak and
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.040]  Telling them what to say
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.600]  If you go to any leftist event, they are
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:03.840]  Followers and their chance of the same across the nation because they're financed and controlled by the Ford Foundation
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.880]  the Annenberg
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:13.120]  CPB Foundation the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and now the Communist Chinese more and more are involved funding all major 50
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:20.120]  State universities are mainly chai-com funded when it comes to leftist activity. So I want to get into George Soros because remember
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:26.560]  20 years ago I was talking about George Soros and 10 years ago people thought it was crazy now it comes out that almost every major
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:33.840]  Demonstrator we first broke this on September 6th. We put the article up from info wars.com on September 6th
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:39.840]  Of this year, we first pointed out that anti-cabinol protesters were George Soros
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.800]  Funded ladies and gentlemen with the photos the videos his lawyers doing it. You name it
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.320]  So that's where this whole history of this garbage comes from
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:23:00.600]  And that's why we have to be aware of all of this and informed and and and understand that there are outside forces coming in and doing this. Now
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.600]  We've got a boil down that our great and prepped reporter John Bowne just put together
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:14.000]  We're going to roll and then I'm going to show you some of the aftermath of his funding and of his brainwashing and what he's doing
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.720]  And what it's causing as they push us towards an open civil war
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:25.560]  Republican senators Susan Collins took the floor the minions of George Soros's move on org screens
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:33.520]  There are misbegotten demands of Collins and her key vote for the nomination of embattled Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Cabin
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:41.200]  The gallery sergeant
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:50.720]  At the six objectives they invoked in the preamble to the Constitution
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:59.360]  The one that they put first was the formation of a more perfect union
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:05.760]  Their vision of a more perfect union does not exist today
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.360]  And if anything we appear to be moving farther away from it
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:17.360]  It is particularly worrisome that the Supreme Court
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:35.360]  The institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian of our shared constitutional heritage is viewed as part of the problem through a political lens
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:46.360]  Breitbart reported an email sent out from Robert Reich detailed the emergency direct action move on org was feeding its followers
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.360]  It reads, escalate pressure on key senators, especially Susan Collins
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.360]  Hold Republicans accountable. We will not forget their party actions at last week's hearing
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  Their unwavering support for Kavanaugh and their attempt to discredit Dr. Blasey Ford and others when we head to the ballot box in five weeks
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.360]  Ending GOP control of Congress and electing people who believe survivors
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:18.360]  What this direct action ultimately meant was that the protesters were willing to get arrested by protesting in prohibited areas
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:31.360]  Mr. President, it would establish a dangerous precedent and legitimize mob rule including the presumption of guilt and violation of everything our Constitution and fundamental notions of fairness stand for
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:40.360]  And it will suspend until the sergeant and arms will restore order to the galleries
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.360]  And finally the votes came in
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:51.360]  As a reminder to our guests in the galleries, expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate gallery
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:26:03.360]  Are there any senators in the chamber who wish to vote or change a vote?
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:20.360]  If not, on this vote the ayes are 50, the nays are 48, the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is confirmed
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:34.360]  While the hordes of hypocrisy shake their fist at President Donald Trump, Democrats have signed on to a mad billionaire, George Soros, and his obsession with disrupting the political process of the people's government
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:58.360]  And we know that what happened yesterday has emboldened the colonizer, it has emboldened the patriarch, it has emboldened the capitalist, and it has emboldened white supremacy. Yes, this is what we are fighting, this belief and the violence that they perpetrate on all bodies
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:11.360]  And now America spirals through the chaos as the bases of both parties inch closer to a crucial midterms that has the potential to tear this country apart. John Bowne reporting
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:39.360]  But if you're a TV viewer, you saw that that crowd of people talking about the white patriarchy was like 99% white and they all look like mental patients
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  And there's just hours of this, you can get lost watching the video, there's hours of them beating up old people, getting arrested, you name it
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  Here's some footage of people jumping around like whack jobs around a guy who has a pro life sign, an old man, and hitting him and slapping him and knocking the sign out of his hand
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:17.360]  Here it is
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:30.360]  So, ladies and gentlemen, that is the reality of what's going on, that is the reality of what's unfolding in this country and there's just hours and hours and hours of this bizarreness going on
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:37.360]  We're going to be right back on the other side, I'm going to turn the baton over for two segments to investigative journalist, Lee Stranahan
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:50.360]  So he can go over the major contradictions, not just before, but of some of these other people and the fact that they want to kind of ease back into the woodwork now and not have people go back and look at who they were, who funded them, what was shed
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:55.360]  No, we need to focus on this and stop this mob rule and bring back innocence until proven guilty
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:09.360]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support. Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies. Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.

[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:14.360]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:34.360]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:49.360]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:33:08.360]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:33.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:54.360]  Hey there, everybody. How are you doing? This is Lee Stranahan. Thanks so much to Alex Jones and all the crew at InfoWars for having me in here. We're going to be talking about the Kavanaugh nomination, but more importantly, we're going to be talking about the horrible stuff that led up to Kavanaugh being confirmed,
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:07.360]  the life-destroying thing that brought out one thing very clearly, the absolute evil of the left in this country, and particularly the left as represented by the Democratic Party.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:18.360]  Now, I'm going to do this in two parts. In this first section, I'm going to talk about the political ramifications of this. In the second section, as Alex mentioned, I'm an investigative journalist.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:28.360]  So we're going to get deep into the facts. We're going to do a quick deep dive into some of the facts about the people surrounding Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:36.360]  And I think you're going to find some very, very interesting stuff there. But let's talk about the big picture here. Let's talk about the politics of this for a second.
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:49.360]  And a lot of people noticed during, you probably noticed, right? A lot of people noticed that Lindsey Graham, a guy I'm not generally at all a big fan of, are you? Are you a big Lindsey Graham fan?
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:35:06.360]  That Lindsey Graham, this is woke-based, savage Lindsey Graham 2.0, is what we saw. And I think I know why that is, by the way. What the Democrats did here, a guy like Graham, a guy like Orrin Hatch, who also was pretty on fire here.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:19.360]  Look, there's certain rules of the Senate. I moved to Washington, D.C. about 18 months ago to cover this stuff better. And there's rules. But there's also unspoken rules. There's gentlemen's agreements.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:27.360]  And the Democrats violated that. Now, if that were the worst part, that would not be, that would be, okay, fine, that happens.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:39.360]  But they did it in a way that contradicted their own values. And I'm going to be very clear when I say this. If Lindsey Graham got woke, I got woke again, too.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:51.360]  And I want to tell you that story, because it's relevant to what's going on. And it's relevant to why I say the Republicans need to be fighting from every day from now until election day.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:36:00.360]  And if they don't, they're silly. So let me give you my background, because some of this gets personal, by the way. And this is very personal for me.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:10.360]  So I used to be a Democrat. Now, if you wonder why, I can give you two words, George Bush. And if I give you two other words, the Iraq War.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:22.360]  So I was out of politics for a long time. Then I saw what George W. Bush was doing with the Iraq War. And I opposed him, opposed to crazy lies from the government that lead to military intervention.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:30.360]  So I became a Democrat. And I was living, I was actually living in Austin, where it's very easy to be a Democrat.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:44.360]  And so then I moved to California, where it's even easier. So I was a Democrat for a while. I ended up doing comedy. I ended up doing reporting at the Huffington Post after I did comedy there.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:51.360]  And I reported on stuff like the John Edwards story. And again, I was a Democrat, but I thought he was having an affair. I thought it was obvious.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:37:02.360]  And nobody else on the left was writing about it. So I wrote about it. And I got some pushback from the left. Not, you know, not complete pushback, but I got a little bit of pushback.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  I got kicked off daily cause. Then a few months later, about a year later, I met Andrew Breitbart. And I interviewed Andrew Breitbart.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:21.360]  And Andrew and I, at the time, Andrew was like one of the most, he was the, at the time, he was like Alex is right now. The most hated guy on the right.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:32.360]  Okay. You probably remember this era. 2010, 2011, couldn't get on Fox. Couldn't get anywhere. People were upset with him on the Shirley Sherrod story that he was right on, by the way.
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  So I met Andrew Breitbart and I'm still a Democrat. I'm still writing for Huffington Post and Andrew and I start working together on a story. I'll call the Pigford Black Farmers scandal story.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:51.360]  Now, here's where the evil part comes in. Here's where my personal experience comes in. I lost every single friend I had on the left.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:38:00.360]  And when I was on the left, I was working for more organizations like Move On. You see, because when you're on the left, my friend Brandon Darby's talked about this.
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  He's the head of Breitbart, Texas. Now, and he's going to come up and mentioning Brandon for a reason. Did you see that video Alex just showed right before the break?
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:18.360]  If you didn't make sure, you come back to infohorses.com and check it out later. He showed a woman speaking at the end of that video segment talking about white supremacy.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:28.360]  I can't say it for sure, but I'm as sure as I can be that that was a woman named Lisa Fithian. She is a trainer. I've been following her for a few years.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:36.360]  She's a labor organizer trainer who goes around to places like Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and sure enough, I predicted it.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:45.360]  I have a radio show, Monday through Friday, Radio Sputnik, Fall Lines. I predicted that she would be there. It's an easy prediction.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:52.360]  She's a far left activist. And my friend Brandon was also a far left activist at one point until he had a very similar experience.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:59.360]  Andrew Breitbart is the guy who introduced Brandon and I. So, okay, so a little bit of pushback, but I'm still a Democrat.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  Then I start working with Andrew. I lose every friend. Then the Anthony Weiner story breaks.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:18.360]  And I talk about something called Everybody Blog About Brett Kimberlin Day. I created that. And Brett Kimberlin is the guy's serial bomber, convicted felon,
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:28.360]  works closely with Cody Shearer, who is a close Clinton operative. He's called Cody Shearer his like fairy godmother.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:44.360]  That's what Brett Kimberlin's called him. And so, Brett Kimberlin is involved in some of these stories that I'm reporting on, including Occupy Wall Street.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:54.360]  And suddenly, I get deluged with attacks. Now, these attacks got rough after Andrew Breitbart died. After Andrew Breitbart died, of course,
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:40:03.360]  he's my best friend at the time. I'm talking to the guy every day, right? He's literally my best friend at the time. Boom.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:09.360]  Shocking. A month later, the unthinkable happens. My wife's pregnant at the time with twins.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:17.360]  I talked about this in a periscope yesterday, and I don't like talking about it. For reasons you'll see in a second. My wife's pregnant with twins.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:26.360]  Our son Ezra is born, he's fine. You saw him in the video yesterday if you watched that. Our daughter Colette had died the day before.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:35.360]  Now, when I say the Democrats are evil, let me point out something. Anybody who's in politics, you're going to get some hits, okay?
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:44.360]  People like Alex know it. People like Roger Stone know it all too well. But my experience is that Republicans have a moral basement.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  They have a line that they do not cross. And certainly, maybe one person will cross it, or two people.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:59.360]  But if they cross that line, a lot of people on the right push back. Have you noticed that? Okay.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:06.360]  So, my wife's pregnant with twins. Our daughter Colette dies the day before. They had an MRI. My son was in front.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:11.360]  They couldn't see that there was a problem. The cord had wrapped around her neck, and we lost our daughter.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:17.360]  We didn't know it until the next day when my wife was giving birth. Horrible situation.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:24.360]  People say they can't imagine it. I can't imagine it either. And just quickly, here's the thing.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:31.360]  You have this horrible tragedy, but then you've also got a baby. Ezra was there. And so, we didn't even have time to process it.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:39.360]  I got attacked by people on the left. And this is what I want you to understand. This is important to me.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:44.360]  I want you to understand the depth that these people go to.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:55.360]  This morning, I would come down, and my wife was crying because a leftist activist associated with Brett Kimberlin was attacking my wife, demanding our daughter's birth certificate, and so on.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:02.360]  And do you know how many people on the left said, hey, hey, hey, you're attacking somebody whose daughter just died?
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:07.360]  Like three. Almost nobody. And this is when I learned how evil they are.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  Brandon Darby, he reported people who were trying to bomb the RNC. Lisa Fithian is one of the people who led the attack against him, that organizer I mentioned earlier.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:26.360]  They had wanted posters up around Austin. People around Austin will remember this. They had wanted posters for Brandon Darby.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:34.360]  The Democrats are evil. In the next segment, I'm going to talk about why they're not just evil, but they're a criminal organization.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  And if the Republicans don't start talking this way, we might lose the midterms.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:47.360]  We've got more coming up. Thanks again to Alex for having me. You're listening to InfoWars, infowars.com.

[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  I also host a radio show called Fault Lines with Nixon and Stranahan on Radio Sputnik, 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. every Monday through Friday, except tomorrow because it's a federal holiday, so I'm going to sleep in.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:48:05.360]  So in the first segment, I talked about some of the emotional reasons and my personal experience with the left and why I am absolutely energized and think Republicans need to be working.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:12.360]  Forget about voting. I mean, you should vote, but that's in November. This is October.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:20.360]  And if you think you can just sit back and wait and you're going to vote and that's going to help guess again, that's not going to work.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:26.360]  And here's why I say that I talked in the first segment about how I used to work for move on. I've done videos for move on.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:35.360]  I covered on my beat at Breitbart Soros and the stuff Alex was talking about before the show in the last segment.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.360]  I covered them. That's what I covered. I know as much about Soros as anybody.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  And what I know is they are absolutely relentless and they are not stopping his defeat yesterday. They're going to be out there working and doing activism every single day from now into the midterms trying to drum this up.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:49:03.360]  And the Republicans, and I'm talking to you, Chuck Grassley, because Mitch McConnell already showed us. I got to say, Mitch McConnell, did you see the Sunday shows this morning?
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:19.360]  Mitch McConnell is talking about how Christine Blasey Ford was believable. He's still saying that today. I'm already worried, but the people I'm hoping for are Grassley, Graham, Hatch to some extent, right?
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:25.360]  But let's just talk about Grassley and Graham. Grassley heads the Judiciary Committee, forgive me.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:33.360]  Now, one of the things that's important about this is let's go over some of the facts. I'm going to hit you with some stuff quick. Feel free to come to infowars.com later. Go over the segment.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:40.360]  If anything I say you haven't heard of before, Google it. You'll see everything I'm saying. Absolutely factual.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:56.360]  On second thought, don't use Google. Maybe don't use Google. There's a duck duck go. Maybe Google's not the best company. Okay, so let's get into the facts about Christine Blasey Ford's testimony and more importantly about team Blasey that's emerging.
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:16.360]  A lot of material here. So last Tuesday, Chuck Grassley released a letter that included information from an ex-boyfriend of Blasey Ford's saying that she had coached somebody, a woman named Monica McClain, on how to take a polygraph.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  She said I dated her for years. Monica McClain's her best friend. And on Tuesday, nobody had heard of Monica McClain. Now, I will tell you something. I had been hearing for days in Washington D.C. that something was coming related to that polygraph and whether she'd ever coached anybody.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:46.360]  The whispers were already around Washington D.C. I didn't know the boyfriend's name. I didn't know Monica McClain's name, but we're already hearing rumors on Sunday or Monday.
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:51:00.360]  My point here is if I'm hearing it, you can bet Grassley's hearing it. I know the letter is dated October 2nd. I think they had that material beforehand. The reason that I just said that it was whispered around Washington.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:16.360]  Nobody knows who Monica McClain is, but people start looking her up. And pretty quickly, a number of people find that she's a former FBI agency was 24 years at the FBI, including she was just in New York.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:30.360]  And that's significant because he gives her a connection to Preet Bahara, who's the U.S. attorney, a vicious anti-Trump guy. And I'm just going to leave that hanging there. I don't know how much of a connection, but it's a connection.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:37.360]  And as a reporter, for reasons I'll explain, I'm going to put a little bookmark there.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:47.360]  Now, Monica McClain then came up in a Wall Street Journal story that came out on Thursday, and this is major Thursday night.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:56.360]  By the way, when the story came out about maybe she'd coach somebody with a very detailed account, guess what the mainstream media did? Completely ignored it.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:09.360]  Fox broke the story. There was nothing on CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal. They treat it like a Republican smear. It's not. It's a credible accusation with a lot of detail.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  Certainly more detail than Christine Blasey Ford's accusation, where obviously she does not know the date. She doesn't know where it happened. There's a lot of details missing.
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  So I thought it was credible, but most importantly, and I want to point this out, this is coming from Chuck Grassley.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:37.360]  So in other words, the letter initially came from Grassley, and that's important because it's reason I'm not trying to be optimistic here, but I think Grassley will pursue this.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:43.360]  But if he doesn't, it's patriots like you that are going to need to hold him accountable.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:53.360]  And we don't do activism on the right. Certainly not the way the left does. We don't need to scream, but be prepared to politely call. How about that?
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.360]  Be prepared to make polite phone calls, but let's let's let it play out. Let's give it a couple of days.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:03.360]  And let me explain the other big thing that's going on with Grassley's letter before I talk more about this woman, Monica McClain.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:14.360]  The other big thing that's going on is Grassley sent multiple letters to the CATS law firm, the law firm representing Christine Blasey Ford. He sent three letters saying, give me the therapist notes.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:27.360]  Give the Senate the therapist notes from Christine Blasey Ford's therapist. Please give us a number of other documents, including the photos or video from the polygraph, right?
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:32.360]  They have not produced it. Chuck Grassley asked them once. They didn't produce it. Ask him twice. They didn't produce it.
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:39.360]  Third time, he's getting clearly upset. And then after the day of the nomination yesterday, guess what they announced?
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:47.360]  Oh, we're not going to pursue charges against Brett Kavanaugh anymore. Well, guess what, Democrats? Might be too late.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:57.360]  Might be too late for you to decide to pull out of this one. I am hoping that Chuck Grassley continues to push, because here's the thing. It's not their investigation.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:07.360]  It's actually your investigation, right? It's the people's investigation. Grassley is merely our representative. Let's not fool anybody there. He works for us.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:18.360]  But it's his investigation. It's not their investigation to decide, well, we don't want to pursue this anymore. You brought up the therapist. You brought up the claim she made.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:25.360]  Show the notes, because we know they gave them to the Washington Post. The notes, the therapist notes were given to the Washington Post.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:34.360]  Now, the other thing that's interesting that came out yesterday was a guy named Keith Cougley. If you look it up, you'll find him.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:43.360]  He's the first person that Christine Blasey Ford apparently said the name Brett Kavanaugh to that we have a clear record of.
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:56.360]  And that came in a phone call on June 29th. June 27th, Stevens announces his retiring. June 29th, they send him an email and the left is going nuts right now saying this Keith Cougley letter.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:05.360]  Well, this proves that the FBI investigation was bad. Well, first off, Keith Cougley, you'll find he gave an affidavit days ago.
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:20.360]  But the other thing that's significant is once again, this is game playing. He had an email exchange with Christine Blasey Ford and they're saying now, well, she told him in 2016, he testified that she told him in 2016 it was Brett Kavanaugh.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  Well, that'd be pretty significant if somebody knew in 2016 that she'd said it was Brett Kavanaugh. I missed that testimony. She didn't say that.
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:39.360]  But he's saying, okay, well, let's just take his word. But what happened was in the same way they gave the Washington Post, the therapist notes, but they won't give them to the Senate.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:48.360]  This guy Keith Cougley is saying to the Senate, hey, why didn't you ask for the email chain? Hey, Keith, why didn't you give it to him?
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:56:02.360]  Oh, I know why. Because the USA Today got the email exchange. You can see it in the story that they published. They got the email notes. And guess what? Keith Cougley did not remember the name Brett Kavanaugh.
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  In fact, you can see quoted in the USA Today article, they literally in quote marks say, here's the email exchange. And he says, I remember telling you about an incident, but I don't remember his name.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:28.360]  And then she says Brett Kavanaugh. That is not him remembering that she said that. It's him remembering she said something and literally admitting he doesn't know the name.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  And it is this reason that all the other evidence is piling up this woman Monica McClain. The other thing that I want to I want to give you and this gets into a deep dive.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:50.360]  So I'm just going to do it real quick is looking to her attorney or attorney David Laufer. Now he's very important. He was at the DOJ working with Peter Strock on the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:57.360]  Why would Monica McClain, this friend of Blasey Ford's pick him? Oh, and by the way, one other thing about Monica McClain.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:10.360]  Remember Christine Blasey Ford said there were four people at the party. One of them was a girlfriend of hers named Leland. Then there was, you know, Kavanaugh and judge and somebody else according to her story, right?
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:22.360]  Well, Leland said, I don't remember anything about this and I never remember being with Brett Kavanaugh either. And guess who called Leland to say you should change that.
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:33.360]  But Monica McClain, that's according to the Wall Street Journal in an article set Friday. So Democrats are going to keep fighting and Republicans need to fight with facts.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:43.360]  But they need to be relentless between now and the midterms because it is all at stake in 2020 right now. The Democrats have shown why they're incapable of leading.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.360]  Once again, thanks again to Alex and to everyone at InfoWars.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:54.360]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying. And they said, oh, we want more money, more money.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:02.360]  And oh, this and that. And so I've broken my contract. And right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:10.360]  It literally is so pure that if you put in a picker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses. Like I dream of genie and it's purple gas.
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:16.360]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it. We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:22.360]  But I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:29.360]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done. I'm breaking the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:36.360]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2. And we've got a good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple of months.
