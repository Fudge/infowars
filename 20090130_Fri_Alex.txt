[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:31.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.760 --> 00:45.880]  I'm a native Austin that I met Alex about though gosh maybe 10 years ago 11 years ago
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.600]  now and it's kind of funny the thing that woke me up about the New World Order and
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.880]  all that was one of the hot topic issues right now years ago I was just sitting at home watching
[00:57.880 --> 01:02.880]  television what and I was bored and I was started to do the old channel surfing thing
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.360]  and up pops this young punk named Alex Jones and he's talking about the United Nations
[01:08.360 --> 01:14.720]  and the National Park System and I thought he was a raven lunatic however he shifted
[01:14.720 --> 01:19.680]  gears and started talking about the true meaning of the second amendment and so I was laughing
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.760]  at him and then I said okay I gotta hear what he says about this this is gonna be funny
[01:23.760 --> 01:29.680]  so I know I have a I'm in my business which is a local hardware store here in town I actually
[01:29.680 --> 01:35.240]  have a federal firearms license I sell a few guns and so he was gonna talk about the meaning
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.600]  of the second amendment so I was just laughing at the guy saying okay let's see what this
[01:38.600 --> 01:45.160]  netball says about second amendment so then he proceeded I think it was 22 23 years old
[01:45.160 --> 01:51.320]  he proceeded to take it off perfectly everything about the second amendment the facts the history
[01:51.320 --> 01:59.440]  the meaning the context original intent perfectly everything so this got me in a quandary why
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.640]  he could be such an idiot on the UN and completely right about the second amendment so I checked
[02:05.640 --> 02:10.480]  into what he had to say and sure enough he was right about the other thing too so that's
[02:10.480 --> 02:18.160]  what kind of got me started in this field I have a years ago I stumbled into hosting
[02:18.160 --> 02:25.040]  a TV show called a simple truth and that show is in Austin on the channel 10 it's at 6 o'clock
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.560]  on Monday nights if you're in the Austin area on Time Warner cable if you're not in the Austin

[03:05.200 --> 03:12.200]  on forever this gun issue and I know Alex has been talking about it quite a bit and I
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.520]  want to talk about it a little bit give you my take on it I know that it's been a hot
[03:16.520 --> 03:23.320]  topic right now I mean you have you have a bill introduced recently to make FEMA camps
[03:23.320 --> 03:28.080]  all over the United States that's that's great and the thing I like about that bill is you
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.680]  know the one line it always put a it's always for the children you know it's always the
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.720]  so-and-so and such-and-such bill in order to save the children and make everyone's life
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.400]  happy and help the environment comma and for other purposes that that that's the thing
[03:42.400 --> 03:48.240]  you gotta worry about is the and for and for other purposes and so I want to give you kind
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.680]  of a history of some of the things these nutballs have proposed in the past you know I mean one
[03:54.680 --> 04:03.680]  thing you can I guess positively say about Republicans is that most of them are not openly
[04:03.680 --> 04:10.520]  anti-gun you know you most of your bubbles that are Republicans are pro second amendment
[04:10.520 --> 04:18.680]  pro individual right to keeping their arms and your your classic Democrat isn't but
[04:18.680 --> 04:25.640]  he wishes he was you know but back when you know before the Republicans held sway in the
[04:25.640 --> 04:31.800]  House and Senate I mean you should see some of the stuff that these nutcases have introduced
[04:31.800 --> 04:39.280]  into legislation to try to get bills passed in the United States Congress and we get back
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.880]  from the break I'm gonna take you to a trip down memory lane here from one of the most

[08:18.000 --> 08:22.160]  for Alex Jones today and just so you'll know what we're planning on doing today before
[08:22.160 --> 08:28.200]  I get back into my gun thing we're planning on having Max Kaiser on in the next hour
[08:28.200 --> 08:33.840]  he's that economist forecaster dude and then after that Bob Chapman who is the international
[08:33.840 --> 08:39.880]  forecaster another economics guy and from two to three we are supposed to have Kurt
[08:39.880 --> 08:46.320]  Nemo live in studio riding shotgun with yours truly and then actually I think we're going
[08:46.320 --> 08:51.520]  to be playing a video in the last part of the show by a by hip hop artists by the name
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.800]  of KRS one something that they put together so you want to stay tuned for that and that
[08:57.800 --> 09:02.160]  way maybe I'll be able to survive this four hours you know okay now let's get back to
[09:02.160 --> 09:08.520]  this gun thing there's nothing new about the craziness of the legislation that these
[09:08.520 --> 09:17.280]  globalists and control freaks want to get done I have an article written this was back
[09:17.280 --> 09:25.080]  in 2000 March 16th 2000 fellow by the name of Stefan Archer writes this story a senator
[09:25.080 --> 09:31.680]  proposes that the IRS register and tax your guns if Senator Jack Reed Democrat of Rhode
[09:31.680 --> 09:36.960]  Island gets his way the internal revenue service will not only be the nation's tax collector
[09:36.960 --> 09:44.480]  but it's gun registrar reads new build entitled the handgun safety and registration act of
[09:44.480 --> 09:51.760]  2000 would quote amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to require the registration of
[09:51.760 --> 09:59.920]  handguns in quote handgun owners would also be forced to pay a $50 tax on all handguns
[09:59.920 --> 10:08.640]  they own a $50 tax on the transfer of ownership of a handgun would also be implemented Desmond
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.200]  Riley spokesperson for the coalition to stop gun violence you know when these gun grabbing
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.880]  control freaks says this this is a regulation and I think Americans tend to embrace regulation
[10:20.880 --> 10:29.240]  it means people's lives will be saved in quote Riley said you know I mean this is not I don't
[10:29.240 --> 10:34.960]  think this is the current thing but this shows you the mindset of these nutballs I mean registry
[10:34.960 --> 10:37.840]  I mean you sitting there figuring this out you know you're out there and you're thinking
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.800]  well let's see what entity of the federal government scares the bejesus out of everybody
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.920]  more than any other entity I think the answer to that question is the internal revenue service
[10:49.920 --> 10:57.560]  that makes people quake wouldn't it be a good idea to have a law passed to require the American
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.960]  people to register their evil guns with the internal revenue service maybe that would
[11:02.960 --> 11:09.160]  scare them into doing it right I mean if your argument by this guy back then Desmond Riley
[11:09.160 --> 11:14.280]  is that oh it's just a regulation and Americans love to follow regulations you know if that's
[11:14.280 --> 11:20.320]  true then I think they should probably pass the regulations against the possession of
[11:20.320 --> 11:28.240]  knives and buckets and swimming pools and high school football you know why not why
[11:28.240 --> 11:35.640]  you know if you're gonna do that anyway that bill reason I bring it up is because it illustrates
[11:35.640 --> 11:45.200]  the mindset of a bunch of nutballs and that's what anti-gun people are is not balls I have
[11:45.200 --> 11:52.080]  the bill itself here in front of me and just looking at some of this transfer tax imposed
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.200]  on handguns tax on making firearms imposed on handguns you know make them so expensive
[11:58.200 --> 12:04.040]  in the way can afford them transition rule for non-registered handguns you have to you
[12:04.040 --> 12:10.040]  know treatment of registration as a transfer you see can't you just see yourself you know
[12:10.040 --> 12:14.480]  sometime in the future when then if you nutballs ever get something like this passed you have
[12:14.480 --> 12:24.680]  your new 1040 form and it says oh 1040 section D7 new law requires you to pay a tax on all
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.040]  the guns you own here right to make model serial number of every single gun you own on this
[12:29.040 --> 12:37.680]  form add up the number of guns you own multiply by 50 and send in the money bub yeah uh huh
[12:37.680 --> 12:45.120]  I got a life size picture of that the secretary of the treasury shall make available such
[12:45.120 --> 12:50.720]  a registration and fingerprint forms as may be required by the public for compliance for
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.760]  such requirements oh my goodness you know again these people are a bunch of nuts and
[12:56.760 --> 13:03.720]  that's all that's all there is to it okay now let's see what else we got here the other
[13:03.720 --> 13:12.200]  day Alan Corwin who is the author of the gun laws books you know I know I sold one of them
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.600]  in my store the hardware store here in Austin Texas it's the Texas gun owners guide well
[13:16.600 --> 13:24.960]  he publishes gun owners guides for all the various states and he's put out this letter
[13:24.960 --> 13:31.880]  to send everybody you know and let me just read from this I have an outline of the Brady's
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.840]  current plans and targets of opportunity it's horrific they're going after the courts regulatory
[13:37.840 --> 13:44.520]  agencies firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people
[13:44.520 --> 13:50.360]  they've made little mention of criminals now more than ever attention to the entire bill
[13:50.360 --> 13:56.280]  of rights is critical gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure due
[13:56.280 --> 14:02.880]  process confiscated property states rights free speech right to assemble and more in
[14:02.880 --> 14:09.480]  addition to the second amendment the democrats current gun ban list proposal the final list
[14:09.480 --> 14:14.040]  will be worse is as follows now I'm not going to go through every one of these things these
[14:14.040 --> 14:22.000]  guns that they want to ban now that they got the house the senate and this globalist puppet
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.840]  lackey obama as the president let's listen to some of these guns the ruger many fourteen
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.240]  oh come on now they want to ban the ruger many fourteen that's terrible that's been
[14:34.240 --> 14:40.520]  around forever you know it's just like a combination between a you know an m1 grand
[14:40.520 --> 14:44.520]  and an m1 a I mean you know it's old you know what the heck what do they want to ban that
[14:44.520 --> 14:50.080]  for because it's semi automatic yeah that's right when you pull the trigger a bullet comes
[14:50.080 --> 14:55.680]  out and then if you pull the trigger again another bullet comes out huh that is just
[14:55.680 --> 15:02.520]  unacceptable and they want to of course ban the ar fifteen which is a civilian version
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.160]  of the m sixteen they want to ban the bush master x and fifteen which is the same thing
[15:07.160 --> 15:13.680]  as an ar fifteen want to ban anything that says a k on it of the vat kalashnikov any
[15:13.680 --> 15:21.160]  of those ugly guns which are actually most of these ugly guns are like the a k for example
[15:21.160 --> 15:27.480]  the round that they shoot is less powerful than most hunting rifles but the hunting rifles
[15:27.480 --> 15:33.920]  look more civilian looking and the a k's look very very vicious because commies like to
[15:33.920 --> 15:41.080]  carry them so you can't have any a k type guns in the united states a k forty seven a k seventy
[15:41.080 --> 15:46.360]  four you name it let's see what else they got here and they have a catch all category
[15:46.360 --> 15:53.760]  the catch all category any semi automatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept
[15:53.760 --> 16:01.320]  more than ten rounds no wait a minute let me think of one of those a semi automatic rifle
[16:01.320 --> 16:06.360]  with a fixed magazine well i don't know i don't think the trigger ten twenty two is
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.560]  has a fixed magazine but i think they're after that one too because it's because it's semi
[16:10.560 --> 16:15.840]  automatic and also all you people with your remington eleven hundreds you know that ancient
[16:15.840 --> 16:23.640]  old semi automatic shotgun mm-hmm that's not a good thing that's not a good thing now here's
[16:23.640 --> 16:32.520]  some more attorney general gets carte blanche to ban all guns it will let me repeat that
[16:32.520 --> 16:41.880]  attorney general this guy that obama's appointing hates guns you know communists don't like guns
[16:41.880 --> 16:48.480]  in the hands of other people they don't like it so let me let me read this again this is
[16:48.480 --> 16:54.360]  alan corwin's letter under the proposal the u.s. attorney general can add quote any semi
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.800]  automatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military law enforcement use or a firearm
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.780]  based on the design of such a firearm that is not particularly suitable for sporting
[17:04.780 --> 17:11.640]  purposes as determined by the attorney general in quote note that obama's pick for this office
[17:11.640 --> 17:17.600]  eric holder confirmation hearings set for january the fifteenth or whatever wrote a brief in
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.360]  the heller case supporting position that you have no right to have a working firearm in
[17:23.360 --> 17:31.480]  your home okay so it's straight america america people who like the bill of rights the constitution
[17:31.480 --> 17:39.520]  you know freedom liberty all that stuff the attorney general wants to be able to ban whatever
[17:39.520 --> 17:48.480]  the heck he wants at his whim and he hates guns so do the math do the math um and this
[17:48.480 --> 17:55.160]  part's funny in making this determination the bill says quote there shall be a rebuttable
[17:55.160 --> 18:00.900]  presumption that a firearm procured for use in the united states by the military or any
[18:00.900 --> 18:07.800]  federal law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes and a firearm
[18:07.800 --> 18:13.280]  shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because
[18:13.280 --> 18:20.320]  the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event what i think that was double speak and
[18:20.320 --> 18:28.400]  double talk so in other words if a rifle is used in a sporting event or a firearm but
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.520]  the attorney general determines that it's really not suitable for use in that sport then he
[18:33.520 --> 18:40.200]  can ban it too i give you an example about that years ago i used to shoot a um self defense
[18:40.200 --> 18:48.440]  combat pistol sport called international defensive pistol association id pa and they used real
[18:48.440 --> 18:55.480]  world handguns um various you know like for for example what the police use the most common
[18:55.480 --> 19:03.240]  guns in these events were were 1911s the old 45s various versions of them and glocks and
[19:03.240 --> 19:10.640]  of course you know most police in the states carry glocks so according to this um a there
[19:10.640 --> 19:16.800]  shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by law enforcement is not
[19:16.800 --> 19:21.480]  particularly suitable for sporting so what they be telling me is that gun that you shoot
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.000]  your glock that you shoot in your in your pistol competition which is a sport is not
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.920]  suitable for the sport that you shoot it in got it i mean we're talking crazy people
[19:32.920 --> 19:39.280]  here and the bad news is that the crazy people are the ones that are in control of the government
[19:39.280 --> 19:45.040]  now that hasn't changed any the flavor of exchange they they used to go after the second
[19:45.040 --> 19:51.120]  amendment under the under the table and now they're heading at it full bore so when we
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.040]  get back we'll continue with this is bob daisy for alex jones on the alex jones show g c
[19:56.040 --> 20:04.160]  n radio network this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to
[20:04.160 --> 20:10.040]  cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these trouble times
[20:10.040 --> 20:14.320]  one of the most important things your family can have is good health some of the contributors
[20:14.320 --> 20:19.880]  to poor health are parasites viruses toxins and heavy metals it's a documented fact 80
[20:19.880 --> 20:24.880]  percent of all americans and 85 percent of people around the world suffer from internal

[24:11.120 --> 24:19.400]  Bob Desi backs substituting for Alex Jones on this 30th day of January 2009 and I'm rolling
[24:19.400 --> 24:24.520]  on the gun control issue because it's it's it's a hot one right now so let's let's continue
[24:24.520 --> 24:30.720]  on with our thoughts on that a couple of a few quotes from some very famous people that
[24:30.720 --> 24:37.160]  were in the founding era this is William Pitt necessity is the plea for every infringement
[24:37.160 --> 24:44.680]  of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves in quote yeah you
[24:44.680 --> 24:50.080]  know we just got to get rid of the guns because we have to because because they're there and
[24:50.080 --> 24:55.040]  you can't have them and and they're dangerous and and you need to trust the government you
[24:55.040 --> 24:59.440]  know I mean so you know but no that's not the real case that you know they always are
[24:59.440 --> 25:03.920]  saying that every time they always got some great excuse for their stupid laws and of
[25:03.920 --> 25:08.400]  course in the case of guns it's it's because it's always to save the children which is
[25:08.400 --> 25:14.920]  a crock wonder how many Jewish children died in World War two because their parents didn't
[25:14.920 --> 25:21.920]  have any guys oh well forget about that that's ancient history here's another one Patrick
[25:21.920 --> 25:30.120]  Henry you ever heard him guard with jealous attention the public liberty suspect everyone
[25:30.120 --> 25:37.000]  who approaches that jewel unfortunately nothing will preserve it but downright force whenever
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.320]  you give up that force you are inevitably ruined in quote that's Patrick Henry he's
[25:43.320 --> 25:48.520]  the founding father he's a hero of the American experience you have to listen to him because
[25:48.520 --> 25:55.160]  if they take your guns away from you well guess what you will be a slave and anybody
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.480]  that's out there listening that's in the military or law enforcement you know that'll realize
[25:59.480 --> 26:05.080]  that's true you know you're supposed to protect and defend the Constitution not whatever puppets
[26:05.080 --> 26:10.400]  up there in the White House right now who's violating the Constitution your job your sacred
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.400]  duty your sacred honor is to defend the Constitution of the United States of America not the bozo
[26:16.400 --> 26:22.320]  giving you orders to do do the exact opposite I mean that's that is serious your kids are
[26:22.320 --> 26:26.120]  going to have to live in this country too and your grandkids and everybody else all
[26:26.120 --> 26:31.440]  you police and military out there you need to wake up read the Constitution you know
[26:31.440 --> 26:41.120]  it's what's funny the current truck Sheriff of Travis County Greg Hamilton when he was
[26:41.120 --> 26:47.520]  running for Sheriff I got a chance to ask him a question live on TV when he was a candidate
[26:47.520 --> 26:51.920]  and just the basic deal was I asked him if you know if he was going to swear no to protect
[26:51.920 --> 26:57.160]  and defend the Constitution if he became Travis County Sheriff and he said oh absolutely
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.520]  and I said well are you gonna do you realize that the Bill of Rights is part of the Constitution
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.760]  he said oh yeah absolutely and I said well do you do you agree that the Fourth Amendment
[27:06.760 --> 27:11.280]  the one about the unreasonable search and seizure and having to get a warrant going for a judge
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.880]  and doing your homework you know you know you gotta say what's gonna be seized and what's
[27:15.880 --> 27:20.920]  gonna be searched and all that do you agree with oh yeah Fourth Amendment that's great
[27:20.920 --> 27:24.360]  and then I asked him well if if the feds come into town and they want your help to search
[27:24.360 --> 27:31.760]  my house without without a warrant are you gonna help him he said sure yeah yeah so here's
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.680]  the problem every all you cops out there listening all you police out there whatever
[27:36.680 --> 27:44.120]  the problem is these they're sitting there swearing an oath to defend protect and defend
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.000]  a document that they've never read and they don't understand now there's there's the
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.880]  core problem so the core solution there would be for all the police and the military to
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.840]  read the darned Constitution read it you know it was written in English for people who can
[27:59.840 --> 28:05.360]  understand English you know they tell you that it's so mysterious and so obscure that
[28:05.360 --> 28:10.520]  only nine old geezers up on the Supreme Court can fully understand it and that's a total
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.240]  crock too I won't maybe I'll get into that later but anyway let's go back to a couple
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.000]  of quotes here here's a good one right here this is one of my favorite ones because this
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.040]  Thomas Jefferson you know this this this tells you how you should try to interpret the Constitution
[28:26.040 --> 28:34.720]  right here quote on every question of construction of the Constitution let us carry us carry ourselves
[28:34.720 --> 28:40.040]  back to the time when the Constitution was adopted recollect the spirit manifested in
[28:40.040 --> 28:45.960]  the debates instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text or invented
[28:45.960 --> 28:52.560]  against it conform to the probable one in which it was passed in quote yeah just read
[28:52.560 --> 28:58.960]  it it says what it says it means what it means you know a well regulated militia being necessary
[28:58.960 --> 29:04.720]  to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
[29:04.720 --> 29:11.280]  not be infringed if you go back and look at the history the whole nine yards well regulated
[29:11.280 --> 29:17.640]  didn't mean run by the government and militia didn't mean the National Guard well regulated
[29:17.640 --> 29:25.040]  meant well run you know organized and militia well guess what that meant that meant you
[29:25.040 --> 29:51.200]  mean anybody capable of bearing on continue this after the price Bob Daisy for Alex we're

[33:28.800 --> 33:33.120]  sit there and listen to it. I love the easy top. Good ol' Texas name.
[33:33.120 --> 33:41.120]  Yeah, I tell you it's mistaken. It's the anti-gun. That's who's mistaken. I want to
[33:41.120 --> 33:47.120]  talk about, I want to read another quote and then we're going to get into some more of this gun stuff.
[33:47.120 --> 33:53.120]  And here's another quote. I like Patrick Henry a lot. You know, he was a fiery, firebrand orator.
[33:53.120 --> 33:59.120]  And I think that, you know, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to stroke Alex Jones's ego too much
[33:59.120 --> 34:04.120]  because he probably didn't need that. But Alex Jones is a modern day Patrick Henry.
[34:04.120 --> 34:09.120]  And so Patrick Henry was, you know, he was, he was the guy that whipped them all up.
[34:09.120 --> 34:17.120]  And that's what Alex does now. Here's another quote from Patrick Henry in regard to the Second Amendment
[34:17.120 --> 34:23.120]  or the right to keep and bear arms. Quote, Are we at last brought to such humiliating
[34:23.120 --> 34:29.120]  and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense?
[34:29.120 --> 34:35.120]  End quote. Well, apparently not, Mr. Henry. Apparently, you know, we need to be giving them all up
[34:35.120 --> 34:41.120]  to our glorious, imperious, new, imperious leader, Barack Obama, the Second Coming of Christ.
[34:41.120 --> 34:49.120]  And, you know, he'll be able to beat our swords into plowshares and then we can plow for him.
[34:49.120 --> 34:58.120]  You know? Yeah. Now, I have a, I have a, I want to read a quote from a letter that a particular gun
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.120]  distributor sent to me. I'm not going to say who they are because it doesn't really matter.
[35:02.120 --> 35:14.120]  This is a quote from Barack Hussein, the usurper Obama back when he was running for president.
[35:14.120 --> 35:24.120]  This was at a violence policy center fundraiser in 2000. This is your current so-called titular
[35:24.120 --> 35:31.120]  puppet president of the United States. Quote, My first priority will be to reinstate
[35:31.120 --> 35:37.120]  the assault weapons ban as soon as I take office. Within 90 days, we will go back after kitchen
[35:37.120 --> 35:43.120]  table dealers and work to end the gun show and internet sales loopholes.
[35:43.120 --> 35:49.120]  In the first year, I intend to work with Congress on a national no carry law, one gun a month
[35:49.120 --> 35:57.120]  purchase limits, and bans on all semi-automatic guns. End quote.
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.120]  And so then the author of this letter says, Mr. Obama, will you really spend trillions
[36:02.120 --> 36:09.120]  on bailouts to create and protect jobs while destroying millions of American jobs in the
[36:09.120 --> 36:14.120]  firearms hunting, gunsmithing, sporting, reloading services, supplies, distribution, retail,
[36:14.120 --> 36:23.120]  and manufacturing business? Apparently, yes. Wow. So, you know, talking about, here you
[36:23.120 --> 36:30.120]  go, he wants to, he wants to get rid of this gun show loophole. You know, I remember years
[36:30.120 --> 36:37.120]  ago in 2001, I'll tell you a little personal story here. In 2001 in March, here in Texas,
[36:37.120 --> 36:42.120]  they had this deal where they were going to pass a bill to end the gun show loophole.
[36:42.120 --> 36:48.120]  Now, what the gun show loophole is, is where you can buy or sell a gun at a gun show if
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.120]  you're not a dealer to another individual without them having to go through a background
[36:53.120 --> 37:00.120]  check. The bill basically proposed that what you could legally do in the parking lot outside
[37:00.120 --> 37:07.120]  the building, you couldn't legally do inside the building. It's preposterous. But anyway,
[37:07.120 --> 37:11.120]  this, this, there was a big hearing down to State Capitol in here in Austin. I went down
[37:11.120 --> 37:18.120]  there, covered for my TV show, SimpleTree, and I was sitting in there watching this, this,
[37:18.120 --> 37:24.120]  this, this farce of a meeting. The main thing I remember is, I was the very first person
[37:24.120 --> 37:29.120]  there to show up, literally the very first person, and you could sign up to speak. And
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.120]  so I signed up to speak, but there was a problem. You had to indicate whether you were for or
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.120]  against the bill. So I said, do I have to put that down? Yeah, you got to put that down.
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.120]  So I said, I was against the gun show loopable. So what they did was, even though our side
[37:43.120 --> 37:49.120]  outnumbered the gun grabbers by about 20 to one, I'd say they put the gun grabbers on
[37:49.120 --> 37:54.120]  top of the stack and the pro second amendment people on the bottom of the stack to make
[37:54.120 --> 37:59.120]  it look like everybody was for the bill. It was a farce. And the other thing I remember
[37:59.120 --> 38:09.120]  is you had two of these so-called gang members from Houston came up to quote unquote testify.
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.120]  And I'm sitting there a few feet away from it, and they're sitting there just spewing
[38:14.120 --> 38:20.120]  lies to this committee, this, this house committee at the state capitol. One of them got one of
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.120]  the guys says, yeah, man, we go into gun shows, man, we bring cash, we go in there, we bring
[38:26.120 --> 38:32.120]  out sacks of guns at wholesale process. No questions asked. You know, I'm listening to
[38:32.120 --> 38:41.120]  these lies and I just can't believe it. And then shortly thereafter, Alex comes running
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.120]  into the, into the room, tapping me on the shoulder and says, Bob, get your camera out
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.120]  here right now. There's something going on in the hall. And so I got up, went out there
[38:50.120 --> 38:56.120]  and this, the head of this anti gun group in Houston, this old man by the name of Dave
[38:56.120 --> 39:01.120]  Smith was paying off these, these guys that were lying to the committee with cash money
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.120]  right outside the committee room, literally. And somebody else caught some of it on videotape
[39:07.120 --> 39:13.120]  and Alex went over there and talked to the guys, you know, and, and one of them said,
[39:13.120 --> 39:20.120]  oh, this, this cash, oh, this is just a, this is a stipend for volunteering. I mean, what,
[39:20.120 --> 39:27.120]  what, I mean, these people, look, the anti gunners are, they operate a lot like the
[39:27.120 --> 39:35.120]  communists do. Anything goes to get what you want. They lie, they chill, they chill, they
[39:35.120 --> 39:42.120]  stay still, they cheat anything, anything to get their way. They don't care. You know,
[39:42.120 --> 39:47.120]  the end justifies the means. So the main thing you have to learn when you're dealing with
[39:47.120 --> 39:52.120]  the anti gunners is you can't compromise with them. You cannot compromise with them because
[39:52.120 --> 39:57.120]  they're just a bunch of liars. That same year, a really neat thing happened. You talk about
[39:57.120 --> 40:03.120]  the, the ability of just one or two people to make a big difference in, in an issue.
[40:03.120 --> 40:08.120]  The million mom March people were really crazy back then. They were having their little rallies
[40:08.120 --> 40:13.120]  all over the place and they were trying to save the children. Oh, please save the children.
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.120]  If it just saves one child, please, please, you know, these people, these shrill fools.
[40:19.120 --> 40:26.120]  Well, anyway, um, a someone, I don't remember who it was. I mean, there was a man and a woman
[40:26.120 --> 40:33.120]  decided to find the million mom March headquarters back then. And so they noticed it was, um,
[40:33.120 --> 40:36.120]  they saw the address on the website. It was at some place in San Francisco. So they went
[40:36.120 --> 40:41.120]  to the address and they couldn't find it. Turns out the address was a hospital, a city owned
[40:41.120 --> 40:47.120]  hospital. They were trying to find this place and they noticed that the elevator wouldn't
[40:47.120 --> 40:52.120]  stop on one of the floors. So what do they do? They, they hitched a ride with a delivery
[40:52.120 --> 40:56.120]  man who knew how to stop the elevator at this particular floor and lo and behold, there's
[40:56.120 --> 41:02.120]  the million mom March national headquarters occupying, you know, maybe five, 6,000 square
[41:02.120 --> 41:11.120]  feet on a city owned government owned building, a political advocacy group rent free. Well,
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.120]  guess what happened when these people found the million mommy March headquarters? They
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.120]  had to evict them because they were violating the law by being there. You know, that's what
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.120]  I'm talking about. You know, these people, the anti gunners cannot be trusted. They cannot
[41:26.120 --> 41:32.120]  be compromised with and you know, they're all a bunch of totalitarian control freaks,
[41:32.120 --> 41:40.120]  you know, which brings me a little bit to this current thing. HR 45 to provide for the
[41:40.120 --> 41:46.120]  implementation of a system of licensing, per purchasers of certain firearms and for a record
[41:46.120 --> 41:52.120]  of sale system for those firearms and for other purposes. Oh, you got to watch out when they
[41:52.120 --> 41:57.120]  were other purposes to look out. This is a summary. I'm looking from the Thomas government
[41:57.120 --> 42:05.120]  document locator Blair Holtz firearm licensing and record act of 2009 amends the Brady handgun
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.120]  violence prevention act to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm unless that person
[42:11.120 --> 42:17.120]  has been issued a firearm license under this act or a state system certified under this
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.120]  act and such license has not been invalidated or revoked. I'm talking about a federal record
[42:22.120 --> 42:31.120]  of sale system. This thing is horrible. Absolutely horrible. And it all, it's kind of funny. You
[42:31.120 --> 42:38.120]  think that after the so called Heller decision, which took place last year where the Supreme
[42:38.120 --> 42:44.120]  Court finally came out and theoretically told you that there is an individual right to keep
[42:44.120 --> 42:51.120]  firearms, you would think that they'd get the message, but, but they don't. And, you know,
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.120]  when, when the Heller decision came about, I was kind of, I read the whole thing and
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.120]  there's a lot of good stuff in there and there's a lot of bad stuff in there. And of course,
[43:01.120 --> 43:09.120]  the bad stuff always overrides the good. Back then, William Norman Grigg, who was formerly
[43:09.120 --> 43:17.120]  a senior editor of the new American magazine, penned an article called the Heller misdirection.
[43:17.120 --> 43:23.120]  In other words, the decision sounded good for the, for the second amendment. It was,
[43:23.120 --> 43:29.120]  it was advertised as good for the second amendment. The mainstream press begrudgingly said it
[43:29.120 --> 43:34.120]  was good for the second amendment. But if you looked at the fine print, well, wait just
[43:34.120 --> 43:41.120]  a minute. So I'm going to read some of this article by William Norman Grigg. Like the
[43:41.120 --> 43:48.120]  inhabitants of other formerly free societies, Americans are content to define freedom in
[43:48.120 --> 43:55.120]  terms of those liberties we are permitted to exercise. Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling
[43:55.120 --> 44:01.120]  in District of Columbia versus Heller is perfectly in harmony with this self defeating concept
[44:01.120 --> 44:08.120]  of freedom. Scalia, who was the main, the guy who wrote the main opinion, Scalia allows
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.120]  that the second amendment acknowledges and protects an individual right to armed self
[44:13.120 --> 44:20.120]  defense. He then explicitly limits the extent to which that right can be exercised, thereby
[44:20.120 --> 44:27.120]  redefining it as a state conferred privilege. We can't really expect a status creature like
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.120]  Antonine Scalia to embrace the view that the right to keeping their arms includes the right
[44:32.120 --> 44:39.120]  of citizens acting either individually or collectively to kill agents of the state when such action
[44:39.120 --> 44:45.120]  is necessarily and morally justified. In any other view of the second amendment is worse
[44:45.120 --> 44:51.120]  than, any other view of the second amendment is worse than useless. This is certainly true
[44:51.120 --> 44:59.120]  of the view that emerges in Scalia's Heller opinion. He asserts, quote, like most rights,
[44:59.120 --> 45:05.120]  the second amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon
[45:05.120 --> 45:11.120]  whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, for whatever purpose. Miller's holding that the
[45:11.120 --> 45:17.120]  sorts of weapons protected are those in common use of the time and supports the historical
[45:17.120 --> 45:23.120]  tradition of prohibiting and carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. Back to me now, Bob Dacey,
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.120]  we're talking about, okay, so the government's going to say, well, that weapon of yours is
[45:27.120 --> 45:33.120]  too dangerous, or that weapon of yours is very unusual, and you can't carry that one.
[45:33.120 --> 45:41.120]  And back to Mr. Grigg. When a government grants a liberty and then restricts the manner in
[45:41.120 --> 45:49.120]  which it can be used, the result is not a right, but a limited conditional license.
[45:49.120 --> 45:55.120]  Scalia's passage cited above will inevitably seem as a license from the court for legislative
[45:55.120 --> 46:02.120]  bodies to enact or fortify laws against dangerous and unusual weapons, such as the scary-looking
[46:02.120 --> 46:08.120]  guns ritually denounced as assault weapons, for example, and other even more troubling
[46:08.120 --> 46:16.120]  portions of his opinion will abet further restrictions on the purposes for which firearms can be used.
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.120]  Wow, you think Mr. William Norman Grigg must know something about he have a crystal ball
[46:21.120 --> 46:28.120]  or something here, because that's exactly what they're doing now. Here you have the Democrats
[46:28.120 --> 46:35.120]  in control of the House, the Democrats controlled the Senate, New World Order flunky in control
[46:35.120 --> 46:42.120]  of the White House, wasn't it ever thus, and you know, they're openly now attacking the
[46:42.120 --> 46:48.120]  Second Amendment very shortly after the Heller decision supposedly said they need to leave
[46:48.120 --> 46:55.120]  it alone. William Norman Grigg right again. Wow, how about that?
[46:55.120 --> 47:01.120]  Okay, now, I want to go back in history, another history lesson that's very important, you
[47:01.120 --> 47:06.120]  know, you got to understand the history of what's been going on in order to understand
[47:06.120 --> 47:14.120]  what's going on now. I have an article in front of me by Aaron Zelman of Jews for the
[47:14.120 --> 47:21.120]  Preservation of Firearms Ownership, the GCA 68, that stands for Gun Control Act of 68,
[47:21.120 --> 47:30.120]  what your politician never told you. Why would a U.S. Senator in 1968 be vitally interested
[47:30.120 --> 47:37.120]  in the structure and contents of a Nazi law of 1938? We cannot ask the late Senator Thomas
[47:37.120 --> 47:42.120]  J. Dodd personally, but we can look at the facts. Thomas Dodd served as a senior member
[47:42.120 --> 47:48.120]  of the team of U.S. prosecutors at the Nuremberg trials with the Nazi war criminals in 1945
[47:48.120 --> 47:56.120]  to 46. In that position, Dodd had access and doubtless reviewed Nazi laws. Something about
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.120]  the Nazi laws must have intrigued Dodd. As a senator from Connecticut, Dodd chaired the
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.120]  committee hearings on bills, quote, to require the registration of firearms, unquote, and
[48:06.120 --> 48:12.120]  to build the national firearms owner database. Many of the Nazi Germany's social and engineering
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.120]  schemes, including its civilian disarming and murdering programs, rested on a national
[48:17.120 --> 48:24.120]  citizen registration and tracking. Is what Senator Dodd has learned, is this what Senator
[48:24.120 --> 48:30.120]  Dodd had learned from the Nazis? As it happened, Senator Dodd owned personally a copy of the
[48:30.120 --> 48:37.120]  Nazi weapons law of 1938. Before the Gun Control Act of 1968 was enacted, Senator Dodd asked
[48:37.120 --> 48:45.120]  the Library of Congress to translate Dodd's own copy of that law. Do you understand this?
[48:45.120 --> 48:52.120]  Look, Senator Dodd sent the Nazi Gun Control Act of 1938 to the Library of Congress and
[48:52.120 --> 48:59.120]  asked them to translate it into English. This is the basis of our law. It's not radical
[48:59.120 --> 49:05.120]  to think that they would have done that. Actually, it only makes sense if you think about it.
[49:05.120 --> 49:11.120]  You're sitting there trying to enact a gun control law and you think, well, gee, who
[49:11.120 --> 49:17.120]  really knew how to do it? Oh, Adolf, Uncle Adolf knew how to do it. So let's see, translate
[49:17.120 --> 49:23.120]  this thing into English and we'll use that as the basis for the Gun Control Act of 1968
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.120]  and that's exactly what they did. So, you know, all you people out there that have some
[49:28.120 --> 49:34.120]  bizarre notion that if you just take the guns away from all of the innocent people and all
[49:34.120 --> 49:38.120]  the peaceful citizens, then all of a sudden everything's going to be rosy and the government's
[49:38.120 --> 49:42.120]  going to have the guns and everything's going to be wonderful. You people need to, like,
[49:42.120 --> 49:48.120]  you know, get a life or something or maybe check a book out on reality because that's
[49:48.120 --> 49:55.120]  not the reality. The reality is that, you know, it's the golden rule, you know, who has
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.120]  the guns makes the rules and when the people of the United States have the guns, we're
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.120]  in charge. When the, when the government in whatever flavor or entity you want to say
[50:05.120 --> 50:14.120]  when they've got the guns and we don't, we are slobbering slaves. You know, I don't
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.120]  understand how some people can't see this. I know they get in their little, they get
[50:18.120 --> 50:23.120]  in their little box and they see some accident with a gun and they say, well, you know, if
[50:23.120 --> 50:30.120]  it just saves one child, if it just saves one child, we need to get rid of all of them.
[50:30.120 --> 50:38.120]  And again, I'm sorry. That's not the big picture. The big picture is when they get rid of your
[50:38.120 --> 50:46.120]  guns, they get rid of you. All right. We'll be back in a few minutes. We're going to catch
[50:46.120 --> 50:52.120]  up on more of this stuff. This is Bob Desi for Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[50:52.120 --> 51:01.120]  Back in a few.
[51:22.120 --> 51:32.120]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[51:52.120 --> 52:07.120]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[52:07.120 --> 52:35.120]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[52:35.120 --> 53:01.120]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[53:01.120 --> 53:07.120]  The headlines are clear. The worldwide economic collapse is here. The military is being positioned
[53:07.120 --> 53:12.120]  for martial law. The market of beast is at hand. Governments are calling for a new world
[53:12.120 --> 53:18.120]  cashless economic system. Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.

[53:59.120 --> 54:06.120]  Okay, this is Bob Dacey back for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show, GCN Radio Network.
[54:06.120 --> 54:13.120]  Substituting today for about the 13th to 14th time. I really enjoy doing this. I don't get
[54:13.120 --> 54:20.120]  to talk to too many people every day. Okay, before I get back with the gun thing, I want
[54:20.120 --> 54:27.120]  to plug something. You know, one of the products that Alex advertises on this show is the E-Colo
[54:27.580 --> 54:34.420]  Blue Model 28, which is a water mill. It's a water mill. It's a water mill. It's a water
[54:34.420 --> 54:50.820]  cooker. It takes water out of the air, filters it, and hey guess what, you drink it. I just
[54:50.820 --> 55:00.320]  want you to let me know, I have one of those things. And I think that thing is really neat.
[55:00.320 --> 55:01.840]  I'm not going to plug it the way he plugs it.
[55:01.840 --> 55:03.000]  I'll plug it the way I plug it.
[55:03.800 --> 55:08.160]  Uh, the thing, what it is, is a little water treatment plant that you have in
[55:08.160 --> 55:11.760]  your own house and you know, this, it's very smart.
[55:11.800 --> 55:13.840]  It sits there and it makes water.
[55:13.840 --> 55:16.920]  It transfers it from one thing to another.
[55:17.360 --> 55:18.880]  Uh, it stirs the water.
[55:18.880 --> 55:20.640]  Sometimes it recycles it.
[55:20.720 --> 55:21.600]  It, it heats it.
[55:21.600 --> 55:23.360]  If you want it, it cools it down.
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.000]  If you want it tells you what it's doing, it shuts off when it doesn't
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.920]  need to make any more and, uh, the higher the humidity is in the area,
[55:30.920 --> 55:32.000]  the more water it makes.
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.400]  And so, uh, you know, go to ecoloblu.com and check out the website.
[55:37.520 --> 55:41.640]  Uh, I think that thing just needest things since last toast and I'm the
[55:41.640 --> 55:43.240]  first on my block to have one.
[55:43.280 --> 55:44.200]  So there, how about that?
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.720]  Also, uh, while we're talking about, you know, oh, by the way, the reason I
[55:48.720 --> 55:51.360]  like the thing is because when I, I know the water that comes out of it,
[55:51.360 --> 55:52.560]  it doesn't have any chlorine in it.
[55:52.760 --> 55:55.520]  It doesn't have any crud in it and it doesn't have any fluoride in it.
[55:55.560 --> 55:56.120]  There you go.
[55:56.120 --> 55:56.840]  That's why.
[55:56.840 --> 56:00.840]  That's why I've got one, you know, so you control your own water supply.
[56:01.120 --> 56:02.240]  You maintain that thing.
[56:02.240 --> 56:03.160]  It'll maintain you.
[56:03.200 --> 56:03.720]  That's it.
[56:04.200 --> 56:04.560]  Okay.
[56:04.560 --> 56:09.160]  Also other thing you need other than water is food and I want to talk
[56:09.160 --> 56:12.040]  about, uh, efoodsdirect.com.
[56:12.400 --> 56:15.720]  They're one of the advertisers on this show, one of the supporters of this show.
[56:15.720 --> 56:19.320]  You, by supporting them, you support the Alex Jones show.
[56:19.520 --> 56:24.600]  And, uh, you know, it's not a bad idea to have some food, uh, you know, look
[56:24.600 --> 56:28.600]  what happened at the Katrina and all that, you know, you don't want to be standing
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.560]  around and waiting for FEMA to give you something.
[56:31.560 --> 56:32.560]  You don't want that.
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.280]  I'll guarantee you, you know, if things get bad or whatever, I view the whole
[56:36.280 --> 56:41.800]  thing as an insurance policy, you know, if you don't, you can buy it, you can store
[56:41.800 --> 56:44.000]  it, you can eat it, fine, whatever.
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.360]  If you don't want to, you don't have to, but if you need it, you know, why not?
[56:48.640 --> 56:49.160]  Why not?
[56:49.160 --> 56:54.200]  So go to efoodsdirect.com and check out what they have to offer.
[56:54.200 --> 56:55.800]  It makes a lot of sense to me.
[56:56.680 --> 56:57.040]  Okay.
[56:57.800 --> 57:00.760]  I'm not used to doing commercial plugs because my TV show, the simple truth
[57:00.760 --> 57:06.680]  on here in Austin is all non-commercial and you can't do that on, on cable access TV.
[57:06.680 --> 57:08.440]  But hey, this is the big time.
[57:08.440 --> 57:09.560]  So there you go.
[57:10.200 --> 57:10.520]  Okay.
[57:10.520 --> 57:15.800]  Now I was talking about, uh, this, uh, uh, the fact that the gun control act of
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.520]  68 was derived from the Nazi gun laws of 1938.
[57:20.520 --> 57:26.520]  Okay. I'm going to read to you the letter, the cover letter from the library of
[57:26.520 --> 57:32.760]  Congress that was sent to Thomas Dodd when they returned his Nazi gun control
[57:32.760 --> 57:35.320]  act to him translated into English.
[57:36.360 --> 57:40.120]  Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. July 12th, 1968.
[57:40.520 --> 57:45.720]  Honorable Thomas J. Dodd, chairman, special subcommittee to investigate juvenile
[57:45.720 --> 57:48.200]  delinquency, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
[57:48.200 --> 57:55.720]  Dear Senator Dodd, your request of July 2, 1968 addressed to the legislative reference
[57:55.720 --> 58:00.200]  service for the translation of several German gun laws has been referred to the
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.360]  law library for attention in compliance with your request and with reference to
[58:06.360 --> 58:11.320]  several telephone conversations between Ms. Frank of your office and Mr.
[58:11.320 --> 58:13.160]  Fred Karp, European law division.
[58:13.160 --> 58:17.480]  We are enclosing here with a translation of the law on weapons of March 18,
[58:17.480 --> 58:23.160]  1938, prepared by Dr. William Solliam Fakete of that division, as well as a
[58:23.160 --> 58:26.520]  Xerox copy of the original German text which you supplied.
[58:27.160 --> 58:29.160]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:29.720 --> 58:31.160]  Figure it out.

[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:17.240]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:21.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:30.360]  No, live from Austin, Texas. This is Bob Basie substituting for Alex Jones
[1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:40.120]  here on the 30th day of January 2009. For the last hour, I have been harping on the
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:45.720]  second amendment and the assault that's been going on on the second amendment.
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:53.240]  And I guess it's just going to continue to go on. The thing to do, this is it right here,
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:01:00.360]  is what you need to do. Number one, any law that is repugnant to the Constitution is no
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:05.320]  avoid. Therefore, any of these gun control things that tell you to turn in your guns
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:10.120]  or whatever, whatever they're going to concoct, well, just ignore them because, you know, when
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:15.080]  you turn in your guns, you've had it. That's it. It's over. So don't turn in your guns.
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:22.280]  You know, even if half the American people are going to be classified as criminals, well,
[1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:27.400]  the government that attacks the second amendment by definition is criminal.
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:32.760]  So if you're a criminal to a criminal, that's too bad things. That means that's a good thing.
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:37.560]  Too negative makes it positive. Therefore, you're not a criminal. Also to the other thing,
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:42.360]  it's extremely important. And I mean, this is so important. Military and police out there,
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:47.320]  Jack McClam always says that when tyranny comes, it comes wearing a uniform.
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:54.760]  It's up to you guys to do nothing. You know, read the Constitution, read the oath that you
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:02:04.360]  swear, protect and defend it, read second amendment and just refuse. Just sit on your hands. Do
[1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:10.760]  nothing. You know, if some bozo up in some ivory tower tells you to go out and collect firearms
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:16.600]  in the neighborhood, like a trick or treater, just don't do it. Or fake like you're doing it and
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:23.400]  come back empty. I don't care what. Just don't do it. You know, you'll be helping to save your
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:31.480]  country. And you know, isn't that the point? Isn't that the point? So anyway, that's what
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:45.800]  you need to do. Massive, massive, Gandhi-esque civil disobedience. That's the key. And again, both
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:52.600]  officials, police, military and, and regular, regular Joe's, regular Bubba's, regular, whatever,
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:03:00.120]  just don't cooperate. Just don't cooperate with them. You know, I mean, I cannot imagine an American
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:09.000]  who would get an IRS form and start filling out his, the serial number of his guns and they're
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.440]  here. I got this many guns. I mean, I got me a, I got me a Ruger Mini 14. Oh, well, that's illegal.
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:19.320]  I'm gonna put that one down there. Oh, I got an eight. No, can't put down there. Well, I got a
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:24.120]  Ruger 10, 20. No, I can't put that down there. Well, it's, I got a revolver. Wait, I got a
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:30.280]  Flintlock. I'll put that one down there. Flintlock. Yeah. If Barack Hussein Obama, the usurper has
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:36.120]  his way, they're going to rewrite the second amendment. They're going to say, the right of
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:42.920]  the people to keep and bear Flintlocks shall not be infringed. That's what they're going to do.
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:48.040]  That's going to be the, the operative thing. They're going to, they're going to strictly interpret
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:53.240]  and they're going to say, look, the only thing they had back then was Flintlocks. And therefore,
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:04:00.200]  the founding fathers meant that if there was any technological advantage that was included,
[1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:05.000]  you know, like if, if guns get better, well, your guns can't get better. You know, so
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:10.520]  problem is the Supreme court decision, the us versus Miller kind of makes that kind of hard
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:15.080]  to do because Miller decision said that the constitution protected guns are the ones
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:20.760]  that are of the top that the military uses and of the type in common use at the time.
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:27.000]  And there's another little inconvenient fact that comes up and that is that
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:33.880]  back during the time of the Revolutionary War, the, the civilians actually had better guns than
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:38.920]  the military. The military had those brown best muskets, smooth bore and the civilians, a lot
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:45.960]  of them had rifles. So that screws up that argument too. When we get back, we have Max Kaiser coming
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:50.680]  up and we're going to talk financial stuff with him. I'm going to try to do my best. I'm a small
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:55.560]  business man. I hope I can talk with this guy. Back after the break, Bob Daisy for Alex.

[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:06.760]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:13.080]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is
[1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:18.040]  his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:22.920]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside
[1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:28.200]  the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:35.240]  in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:40.040]  connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:44.280]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:50.840]  much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with

[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:17.160]  Okay, once again, this is Bob Desi, substitute for Alex Jones, and I want to read a little
[1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:21.000]  headline here from the local paper. Got out of the paper the other day.
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:28.840]  Recovery plan now at $825 billion. Then later on, they had another article in the local paper that
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:35.080]  said the O.A. passed an $819 billion bailout, and looks like this particular bailout is more
[1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:40.680]  flavored to giving stuff away to not the bankers, you know, some of it. It's like they're going to give
[1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:49.480]  away school district stuff, modernization, infrastructure, bribes to the individual people,
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:55.000]  tuition tax credits and stuff. This is getting a little over my head. So what we're going to do,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:01.800]  we're going to bring on Max Kaiser, who is one of these financial guru guys, and Max, are you there?
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.520]  Hey, Bob, how's it going? I don't know, man. You know, I'm kind of vaguely familiar with
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:13.480]  some of this stuff. I'm a small business man, and, you know, in small business,
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:19.800]  you don't get squat from nobody. So I am trying to, I want to ask you a bunch of questions,
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:24.360]  I guess. But first off, tell the people who you are again, and kind of familiarize them with
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:29.640]  what you do, please. Well, first of all, Bob, I feel through the luck of a draw. I get to be
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:36.280]  on the show with you today, and that outstands character. That guy's crazy. I want to thank goodness.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:42.280]  That guy, Alex, is crazy. I'm Bob Daisy. Thank God. Well, how do you know I'm not crazy?
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:46.600]  I've been listening to the show. I've listened to all 14 times you were on before, Bob.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:53.160]  Oh, really? Well, gosh, I have a fan that makes two. That's good. No, I'm, you know,
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:59.240]  it's funny. The work classified, you know, I'm classified kind of jokingly. I'm a crazy right
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:05.320]  wing extremist, wacko conspiracy theorist, and the problem is I'm not crazy. Right and left wing
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:09.640]  is a bunch of nonsense. Extremist, well, you know, if you believe in the Constitution,
[1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:15.560]  you're an extremist, wacko. I don't really think so. I think I'm pretty logical, pretty cool-headed.
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:19.960]  And conspiracy, yeah, there's definitely conspiracy out there. But theorist, no,
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:26.040]  it's not a theory. It's a fact. But I appreciate the compliment there. But once again, tell people
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.640]  about what you do because, you know, that's what you're supposed to do when you introduce a guest.
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:39.400]  Sure, sure. First of all, my main site is maxkaiser.com. That's k-e-i-s-e-r, maxkaiser.com.
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:47.240]  And myself and Stacey, we track the financial collapse and all the financial shenanigans
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:55.240]  on that site. And before that, we were making films for Al Jazeera English on markets and finance
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:59.720]  covering all that's been going on in the last few years. We predicted, for example, we were in
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:04.680]  Iceland a year before the economy collapsed. We made a film about that collapse, spoke to the
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:09.960]  bankers up there, said your economy is going to collapse. A year later, it collapsed. We talked
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:17.640]  about the real estate collapse, the UK town collapsing, banks in the UK collapsing. We talked
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:23.880]  about all that stuff. We talked about a new Great Depression coming based on the SEC's failure
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:29.560]  and the reemergence of rigged markets that we saw back in the late 20s and 30s.
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:35.320]  Before that, I was in Los Angeles. I created something called the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:42.040]  I basically created the idea of trading box offers futures contracts, which now there's
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:46.760]  a company called Canter Exchange, which is part of Canter Fitzgerald. They bought the Hollywood
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:51.080]  Stock Exchange. They're now launching box offers futures contracts. So I kind of invented that
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:58.680]  whole concept. Before that, I was a stockbroker on Wall Street. And I guess what I'm kind of
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:05.960]  specializing in these days is looking at the technology that runs markets, picking up on
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:12.280]  when markets are manipulated, when markets, you can make predictions on which way prices are going
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:17.880]  if you kind of understand how markets are being manipulated. And I just did an interview with
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:22.440]  Joseph Stiglitz on his way to Davos a couple of days ago. He was talking about the fact that all
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:32.680]  markets are in fact manipulated. And ever since markets got off in the US in 1971, the US tied
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:39.080]  the last tie that they had to the gold standard. And we went on to a purely fiat currency system,
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:44.520]  meaning that none of the currencies had any intrinsic value. They weren't convertible into
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:50.120]  something like gold. The currency was then just a piece of paper that was backed by the full faith
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:57.080]  and credit of the government. Since 1971, the global economy and the US economy has been based on
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:05.560]  these fiat currencies, which are basically, to put it in economic terms, fungible. In other
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:13.080]  words, you can play a lot of games with fiat currencies. And we've seen since that time the
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:20.680]  savings and loan crisis, the 1987 stock market crash, long-term capital management, explosion,
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:27.400]  the dot com bust, and then more recently the real estate bust and now the Wall Street banking bust.
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:32.040]  Well, that brings up a question. I'm trying to think of an intelligent question to ask you,
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:38.680]  because you're in a field that's like way beyond my meager small businessman abilities. But
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:44.840]  now I'm listening to what you say and I'm thinking, well, if the markets are rigged, if they're
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:50.920]  controlled, if they're manipulated all the time, how does the little guy make an honest buck try
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:55.080]  to invest when he's playing against the stacked deck that he's got no control over?
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:01.400]  Well, you know, you have to know, you know, you sit down at a poker table,
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:06.200]  you have to know who you're playing with, you know, and the old saying is, if you don't know
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:13.240]  who the chump is, you're the chump. So there's, you know, there's ways to, there's ways to invest,
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.720]  there's ways to make money, but I think you need to go in there with your head held high and you
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:24.200]  have to go in there understanding that the markets are inherently flawed and that they're grossly
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:30.360]  rigged. And they've gotten to a level just before, let's say, 18 months ago when this current crisis
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:37.560]  started to extremes, historical streams of market rigging. And just to give you an idea,
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:41.960]  I mean, so yeah, the two questions you're asking, you're saying, well, how does a small businessman
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:49.880]  make money or survive in this type of market? I think that currently, you have to be defensive,
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:54.360]  you know, put the defense on the field, take the offense off, put the defense on. And the way you
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:15:01.000]  put the defense on the field is by getting liquid, getting paying down all your debts, no credit card
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.560]  debts, and starting to accumulate some precious metals. And there's different ways to accumulate
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:11.320]  precious metals. You can own the gold bullion outright. I know there's links to different
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:17.000]  things on maxkaiser.com. We try to link to different ways you can, you know, own a gold bullion,
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:22.680]  silver bullion, which is a purely defensive measure. It might not make you necessarily rich,
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:29.800]  but at least your purchasing power for your gold and silver during the period that we're in now
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:37.560]  is maintained. So that's, as I said, that's the idea is to play defense. Don't try to over finesse
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:41.960]  it. You know, this is a, even the smartest guys on Wall Street, Bob, as we've seen, some of the
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:47.480]  smartest people so-called on Wall Street have gotten absolutely hammered in the last couple
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:53.400]  of years because the game has gotten so rigged and so outrageous that even experienced people in
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:59.240]  the markets are getting completely blown up. So that's, that's my first comment.
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:06.840]  In terms of, in terms of gold investing, you know, the markets are so screwed up and they're so,
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:11.640]  and they're so controlled and they're so, there's so much, so many financial shenanigans going on.
[1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:19.880]  Do you trust paper gold? Well, good question. That's a really good question. Yeah, you call
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:24.760]  up your broker and say, well, buy me some of this and, and you've got an entry on a piece of paper
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:30.920]  that says you bought it. I mean, do you trust that? It's a really good question, Bob. And when I
[1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:39.000]  was on Alex's show back in November, okay, just to, to a full disclosure here, I mentioned that
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:43.480]  the paper market in December on the COMEX, that there were, there was a looking like there could
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:49.880]  be a run on the COMEX and we would see a market failure based on what I, at that time, thought
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:57.000]  was going to be physical demand from the big, big players, particularly in Canada, and didn't
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:02.360]  materialize. The price of gold has gone up, mind you. So nobody, if they had followed that idea
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:09.160]  and bought gold, they would be making a very handsome rate of return. So I don't feel as though
[1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:15.240]  there was a, the wrong thing to say in terms of maintaining a good portfolio. But in fact, there
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:24.680]  wasn't. Was your timing just off? Well, um, you know, I think the COMEX is a market that like
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:30.200]  also the NIMACs, which is the sister market, the paper market in New York, where they trade oil,
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:37.400]  oil features, these markets, like all markets, are, are really captured by, they're captured
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:43.720]  markets by the biggest banks and the regulators who are in bed with these guys, because it's a way
[1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:52.360]  for policy, economic policy is being conducted by establishing prices that will in effect make
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:57.160]  the policies happen. So it's a complete reversal of what you'd expect, where the somebody would
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:02.600]  make a policy and then you'd see how the prices react. Instead, what we're seeing is that the
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:07.880]  people who make policies first pick a price that they want to see, they manipulate the markets
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:12.840]  to that price. And then they know that the policies will, and the effects will happen,
[1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:19.560]  um, hit or two. Go ahead. I want to get, I want to get your take on something else that you,
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:24.760]  at one time, along with most other people, it predicted back in the middle of last year.
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:29.720]  But before you get to that, Bob, quickly, you're saying physical gold over paper gold.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:35.480]  Physical gold is obviously preferable. There are sites where you can buy physical gold and
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:42.440]  they'll store it for you in London or Zurich and in a vault. And there's two sites in particular.
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:49.640]  One is called goldmoney.com, who I know James Turk very well. Again, full disclosure, I know,
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:56.120]  I know James Turk and, um, I, uh, on occasion do business with them, but I can vouch for their
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:00.520]  service. Um, in a physical gold, they hold the gold for you. You're getting the gold at the
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:06.760]  paper price, which is at a discount to the physical price. So you're actually kind of playing
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:12.520]  with the big boys, so to speak. And, uh, again, maxkaiser.com, you would find links to this type
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:20.200]  of stuff. Uh, but anyway, so yeah, the paper gold market is obviously to be avoided, but go ahead.
[1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:25.480]  Yeah. Another thing I was kind of doing a little bit of research on you last night,
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:27.800]  because I didn't want to be a complete idiot while I'm talking to you,
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:33.560]  you know, how to do a little bit of homework. I noticed that, um, back, I guess it was in
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:38.040]  middle of last year, uh, you had been talking about the direction of the process of oil.
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.680]  Well, and when we get back from the break, I want to ask my question having to do with, um,
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:48.120]  the manipulation of the oil market. So once again, when we get back from the break, this is, uh,
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:54.200]  Bob Desi, substituting for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show, GCN radio network, back in a few.

[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:03.880]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:08.440]  and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:12.840]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:17.160]  can remove from their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:21.320]  your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket
[1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:26.360]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:31.160]  economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:35.640]  liquidity for depositors. However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:40.680]  productivity can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a
[1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:45.640]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:51.000]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:23:10.920]  6,000 years. For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.

[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:29.080]  All right Bob Desi back on the Alex Jones show talking with Max Kaiser about things financial
[1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:36.040]  and before the break I was getting ready to ask him a question about the price of oil and here
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:43.320]  here's the question back then most people back in say July or whatever of last year were saying
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.600]  okay oil's about $140 a barrel and it's probably going to go to $175 or even $200
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:57.320]  and then something happened interesting to note that Lindsay Williams made an
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:02.920]  announcement that he had been talking to his elitist buddies in the oil business and they
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:11.400]  said they were fixing to manipulate the price of oil down to around $50 within the year and it
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:16.200]  just didn't make any sense that that would happen and yet that's exactly what happened.
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:23.480]  And do you Mr. Kaiser do you agree that just a complete gross manipulation of the price
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:27.560]  was was brought about by the the financial elites to make that happen?
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:36.920]  Well I'm familiar with Lindsay Williams call and he made a good call but I kind of disagree
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:44.040]  with some of his work because Mr. Williams is not a believer at all in this theory of peak
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:51.480]  oil or this idea of peak oil and I've done a lot of work on peak oil. I'm in the camp that supports
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:59.080]  the idea of peak oil but certainly over the past six months Lindsay Williams call has been
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:06.680]  pressured and looks good. Now going forward let's talk about oil price manipulation for a second
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:18.520]  because here we do have common ground. As I said before you've got the MIMEX which is the sister
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:24.760]  futures trading floor to the COMEX in New York. It's probably the biggest exchange where oil
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:29.000]  is traded. There's a huge incentive and you've got to kind of look at you know that old song the
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:34.600]  hip bones connected to the leg bone the leg bone connected to the foot bone remember that old song
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:41.400]  Bob yeah I remember them okay well the oil market is connected to the dollar market and the dollar
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:47.000]  market is connected to the gold market and if you understand that the one thing that the banking
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:52.040]  elite does not want it's a higher gold price than they fight like the dickens to keep the gold
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:57.400]  price as cheap as it possibly can and they do that by employing such things as naked short
[1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:03.560]  selling on these various exchanges which means selling stuff that doesn't even exist so it's
[1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:10.200]  even beyond the the normal short selling which is just selling stuff that you hope to buy back
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:15.720]  later they're selling stuff that doesn't even exist that's called naked short selling are you
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:20.440]  saying they drop the the gold price in order to I mean to drop the oil price in order to suppress
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:26.120]  the gold price and it didn't work I'm saying you drop the gold price basically to give support
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:33.000]  to the dollar and as you get support to the dollar there was this huge outflow out of
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.520]  the the trade the anti-dollar trade there was this huge anti-dollar trade at that time
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:44.440]  which include going long commodities like oil and gold the dollar was trading at historic lows
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:51.080]  gold was flirting at around a thousand oil as you pointed out was in the 140 147 and so this was
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:58.680]  giving a tremendous fright to especially the banking community because people are starting
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:03.560]  to talk about maybe getting rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency and having the
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:11.560]  dollar as a world reserve currency gives the US banks the privilege of printing dollars for the
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:16.600]  world and for every dollar they print they get a commission effectively it's called senior edge
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:21.480]  so they get a commission you know the world runs on dollars at the moment and the US prints dollars
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:25.800]  they get like a commission they get a commission to print all these dollars if gold and commodities
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:30.680]  are running higher then countries start to think well maybe we should do something other than the
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:37.480]  dollar right before shock and awe right before the US invaded iraq uh saddam was saying was saying
[1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:43.480]  you know we're going to start trading our oil in euros uh six months within six months you had
[1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:49.240]  shock and awe in iran you've got the leaders in iran saying maybe we should trade our oil in euros
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:55.720]  uh you've got huge tension in the previous administration with iran so the the dollar
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:28:59.320]  franchise which has been in place since the end of world war two is an incredibly lucrative
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:05.000]  franchise for US banks so when gold and oil and these commodities started to challenge that
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:12.360]  they come in in a very coordinated way the banks um are working very closely with people in the
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:18.120]  treasury and the federal reserve to do what they have to do to drive the price of these commodities
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:23.720]  down including oil and gold and this gives support to the dollar you've had this dollar rally
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:31.240]  since that time uh which has been not as robust recently as it was maybe a few months ago but
[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:37.960]  the answer to your question is is the price of oil manipulated yes is it because peak oil is a myth
[1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:45.400]  no i don't agree with that but i do agree with lindsay that uh mr william that uh you do have
[1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:50.120]  manipulation in the future market if that's the answer hold that thought will be back after
[1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:57.480]  the break this bob daisy we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[1:33:54.280 --> 1:34:00.200]  people you know but he's anyway we're we're back uh on the alex join show this is bob daisy i'm
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:04.440]  talking with max keiser about things financial and i'm probably you know where my head on this
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:11.480]  but um we're talking about manipulation the oil i was the oil market uh and the gold market and all
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:18.280]  that i just want you know this driving down the price mr keiser was so radical i mean in order
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:22.840]  to accomplish what they wanted they really have to plunge a stake in the heart of the price of
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:31.160]  oil why did it drop so far well think about the benefit uh it completely has uh nearly
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:38.280]  bankrupted russia and member russia was very active in the region uh america had a uh relationship
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:45.880]  with the ukraine uh and then russia started to uh get very militaristic and that also was a benefit
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:51.400]  if you drive price price oil down the russian economy is now basically on its back side but
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:55.800]  how do they get out of the middle of the middle of that didn't didn't they get militaristic you
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:35:02.040]  talking about the uh the georgia thing well yeah the pipeline there's an oil pipeline in the region
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:08.040]  and uh it goes through the ukraine and russia wants to wants uh you know total control and
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:13.080]  they're being their coffers are being filled as the price of oil is going higher as was venezuela
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:18.520]  as was the mid-east yeah but the thing with the with the georgia thing was these you mean the georgian
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:23.960]  army was trained by the americans and the israelis and and you know they they provoked them i mean
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:31.000]  what the what you know being i think the from the worldview the russian response was predictable
[1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:35.880]  you know okay fine you're gonna cross into some stuff and beat up on a bunch of russians and kill
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:40.040]  a bunch of civilians we're gonna come cross the border and kick your time in i mean that that wasn't
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.000]  that seemed like they were manipulated into being materialistic don't you think uh well i think the
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:51.240]  european view you know i'm calling you from power and uh the european view is uh slightly different
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:59.560]  that uh in fact the um the the paganism went the other way initially but the the bottom line is that
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:05.960]  there's a huge incentive to drop the price of oil to defang uh those ambitions because that rushes on
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:13.240]  its back foot trying to uh take you know deal with the collapse in the energy prices uh obviously
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:19.480]  in venezuela venezuela is now uh pulling back from its initiatives to flood uh cheap oil into the
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:24.600]  us remember they're trying to get some good will doing uh some oil exportation that way to into new
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:33.400]  york uh the mid east um the uh you know it's uh they they're they're now um obviously have having
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:38.280]  to uh suffer along with this collapse in the price of oil so according to lindy according to
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:43.080]  lindy williams uh that was the principal one of the principal reasons to to collapse the
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:47.000]  process well the elites are gonna do it to punish the Arab world because that's the only thing they
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:53.080]  got to sell you know well i mean that that's that's that's that's that's that's a benefit for sure
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:57.800]  i mean that that's certainly i think that during during the bush administration you know you had
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:03.320]  this incredible run-up in the price of oil and the oil companies made huge profits and but at the
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:10.040]  same time you can't do that without empowering mid east venezuela russia and it came to a point
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:13.880]  where they're like look we can't keep burning the price of oil on the upside because remember it was
[1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:20.440]  uh manipulate on the upside as well you can't keep doing that and although exxon and chevron
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:25.240]  these companies are making huge profits uh at some point you know we there's a there's a cost
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:29.960]  benefit analysis that needs to be done we're giving too much money to these guys in these other
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:34.920]  regions so we got to throttle things back some share of conversation was had with the major
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:39.160]  oil companies in the u.s and said and who said okay you know thank you very much for our multi
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:44.440]  billion dollar quarters of highest recorded profits in the history of commerce in the history of the
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:52.760]  world will take our money and okay new administration will go from there so is the prices should be
[1:37:52.760 --> 1:37:57.560]  floating based on supply and demand uh but they're not you know they're not the prices don't
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:04.120]  bet are not based on supply and demand in the oil market um although that should change as you
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:10.600]  start to run into um what's called supply collapse which i'm not in in agreement with uh
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:18.120]  with mr uh mr uh linsey on um and you don't see price discovery in a in a fair way either in the
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  financial markets because interest rates in the u.s it's not determined by the market it's not
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:29.720]  determined by supply and demand it's determined by the federal reserve open market committee
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:34.200]  and they get together there's a question that i that brings up to me and i'm going to sit here
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:40.200]  and openly disagree with you on on this peak oil thing because it'll be fun you know okay okay let's
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:45.800]  get into the peak oil thing okay here we go bob get into the peak oil all right here we go here
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:52.440]  we go let me let me just throw out a few plebeian opinions on this on this issue you know i know
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:59.480]  lindsay williams and uh i i trust the guy and you know i read his i read his book uh the energy
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:04.040]  noncrosses which he wrote many years ago and you know the bottom line what he's what he's saying in
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:09.240]  the energy noncrosses is that he was physically up there at gull island in alaska when the
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:15.000]  atlantic richfield proved this monstrous find up there it was they said that they you know
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.560]  due to due to whatever techniques they use they're proving they're well capping pressure testing
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:25.160]  or whatever i'm not into that that they had just decided that what's underneath them is so huge
[1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:30.200]  that it it it's probably as big as anything in saudi arabia and they were all having a good
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:35.080]  old time celebrating up there and then the federal government came in and told them a few days later
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:41.080]  capitalist wells pull up the stuff and get the heck out of here and shut your mouth and uh
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:45.640]  basically his book is about the fact that the it kind of agrees with what you're saying everything's
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:54.040]  manipulated you know uh and i wonder in the peak oil thing if these people manipulate the prize they
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:40:01.240]  manipulate everything and there's no free market out there anymore it's all just playing games uh
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:06.440]  isn't it the same people that are providing you with the information that that that that peak
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:11.960]  oil is real isn't it the same people that are feeding you what you believe well i made a film on
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:20.200]  this i traveled to the mid east and uh talked to people and um the fact is that the biggest fields
[1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:28.360]  in the world uh whether it's in mexico or saudi arabia are in decline they are putting out less
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:36.760]  oil uh less and less every year the global output of oil year on year uh for the year we just reported
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:42.600]  is dropped something like seven to nine percent and this is because they want to apply destruction
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:47.720]  don't they manipulate that too you know can they make well i think in the case of finance
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:55.800]  in the case of financial markets the case for manipulation is one that is easier to make because
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:41:02.760]  you've got this fiat currency world you've got um no notational values being exchanged between banks
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:07.640]  where they just create a they say here's a credit default swap and it's priced at x y and z and it's
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:12.120]  just pulled out of a hat really in the case of oil because it is a physical commodity
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:17.880]  you can look at actual physical evidence and the geological evidence and you can actually make a
[1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:25.480]  fairly strong empirical case that looking at what's going on in these fields the amount of oil
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:30.760]  coming out at the end of the day is dropping the amount of water being pushed in there to push the
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:38.280]  oil out there's been no major discoveries really well there's there's that's the rub right there
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:43.480]  i mean you're talking about plunging your soda straw and into a uh indium and some soda and all
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:48.920]  of a sudden you're hearing that noise you know instead of getting good coca-cola out of there
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:54.760]  i'm talking about other coca-colas i'm talking about if if it is true that that there are
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:42:01.960]  discoveries which they have suppressed and are refusing to allow us to to gut after then you're
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:08.360]  going to create an artificial uh peak oil shortage aren't you and that way you can keep the price up
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:12.840]  and you can tell the people that we need to they need to drive electric cars and and stop driving
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:19.640]  their their their muscle cars and all that other stuff it seems like you can create the the illusion
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:27.480]  of peak oil if you suppress uh oil fines they won't let people develop them you could and um
[1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:33.960]  ultimately you know this this this we're going to find out uh because at the rate of the depletion
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:40.520]  of oil is is now hitting really a very steep downward curve and and the peak oil theory
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:45.720]  uh in the peak oil camp of which i'm involved with we'll know in the next 12 to 18 to 24 months
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:53.080]  definitively whether or not uh our camp is really in the right camp but i mean what you're saying is
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:43:00.120]  true how do you know that there's an incentive to manipulate the way in the way that you're
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:04.840]  suggesting for sure there's an incentive to do that as there's an incentive to manipulate any
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:11.320]  market at any time by profiteers looking to manipulate intelligence looking to manipulate
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:17.560]  prices looking to manipulate data politics propaganda this is a this is a scourge of modern
[1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:26.040]  society is propaganda and manipulation and sense in the modern era it's become uh quite a problem
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:31.160]  because as the manipulators gain political influence they've been able to buy their way
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:36.760]  into the major media outlets of the world and squeeze out or push out any alternative voices
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:42.680]  now in the case of let's say alex jones and bob daisy on the alex jones show you know you guys
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:47.880]  are putting out information that in my opinion is extremely valuable even though just like your
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:55.000]  categorized unfairly as extreme right max keiser is unfairly characterized as extreme left you know
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:59.720]  that's my handle people characterize me as being part of the extreme left and yet that's absurd
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:06.520]  just like i believe that alex jones is not part of any extreme right alex jones is just a guy
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:11.960]  who's trying bob daisy who's interested in uncovering uh information that's not being
[1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:17.960]  covered by this this captured mainstream media that seems to be captured by the by the regulators
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:22.920]  by the corporations what i call the corporate occupation and the information's not getting
[1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:27.880]  out there but you know what i'm saying max is this look i would if i could have my way you
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:32.200]  know if i was like president bob obama you know and i was really really born in united states
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:36.920]  and everything and i and i could and i could actually just wave my magic wand and there's
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:41.800]  no and there's no manipulation and there's no corruption going on i'd be sending my guys up
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:46.920]  to gull island and finding out whether lindsay williams is right you know is there an oil field
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:52.920]  is there an oil area up there on the northern alaska border which is so vast and so huge
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:58.600]  as to make the peak oil thing a crock you know and is that a representative sample of other things
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:04.280]  going on manipulated around the world where they're hiding the stuff from us to keep the price up
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:10.360]  and to con us out of our our standard of living because of this peak oil boogie man that they
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:14.280]  keep throwing at us see i'd like to i'd like to be able to prove that you know i'd like to be able
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:19.240]  to go up to gull island and say okay is that sucker really there you know and are there other
[1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:23.560]  suckers all over the place that are there that they just won't let us touch i mean lindsay williams
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:27.480]  said they went up there the federal government went up there and said get the heck out of here
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:33.480]  and i know that even just as a layman you go look at a geological map of alaska and you find out
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:38.680]  that 80 percent of the whole thing up there is off limits you know if and if they're making
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:43.720]  things off limits how can you have peak oil if you if you have a stacked deck like that i don't
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:48.200]  that's why you know i don't agree with you okay now you you're you're talking about uh
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:54.840]  lindsay yeah williams and um first of all the fact that the price collapsed the way it did
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:46:00.280]  have to you know tip i took my hat to lindsay williams because when the price was at 147
[1:46:00.280 --> 1:46:05.320]  as you point out a lot of pundits were saying hey it's going to 175 220 lindsay williams was
[1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:10.840]  like a lone voice out there saying no it's going to drop down to 50 and you know he's right
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:16.520]  and and and that's that's that was a great call but i disagree kind of in you know looking at
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:21.080]  what he looks at in his research you can you talk about lindsay williams you believe in his stuff
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:29.000]  i you know i look at a guy like matt simon who is got 30 years you know poking straws on the ground
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:37.960]  who's a scientist a geologist who's got no no reason to um uh no agenda to to go out there
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:44.760]  and and smudge or fudge the figures and that's the guy who i look at now ultimately we live
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:51.320]  still in a somewhat capitalist environment in you know i mean there's a question as to how much
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:55.400]  longer we will be in a capitalism capitalist environment but we do live in an environment
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:01.080]  where the price will out you know we'll see you know in the in the next couple of years whether
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:08.600]  or not uh this this depletion or supply destruction is really uh going to cut into the global
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:15.480]  supply of oil out there as i think will be the case um the demand keeps going up the demand in
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:21.320]  the last year was higher than it was a year before by a million barrels a day even in this
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:28.200]  economic duress you still had demand increasing from places like china india etc supply is decreasing
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:34.120]  and we put those two things together it translates into a higher price i agree with lindsay that the
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:39.240]  price of the future is in front and the paper market is manipulated as all markets are manipulated
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:44.680]  um and i i think he looks great in the last six months i think six months from now it's
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:48.760]  going to be a different story but i have to concede to you the point that in the last six months
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:53.400]  you know he's definitely got the winning hand in the last six months how you know if you had
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:48:00.280]  bought oil at 140 you'd be you know crushed in your account today and that's a tragedy for
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:05.880]  those people who bought oil at that price and and uh he's looking good but i just i have not
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:11.560]  seen i've weighed all the inputs and the outputs to me i'm not a i'm i'm a believer in the peak
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:16.520]  oil but i'm i'm not a i'm not a fanatic i mean i'm always looking for new information if i
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:21.960]  i'll reread uh lindsay willing stuff again i'll look at it again maybe i'm overlooking
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:26.440]  something i'm perfectly going to do that i mean maybe i'm wrong but when i when i look at this
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:32.360]  i see i see a blizzard of bs you know out there and and everyone seems to have a
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:39.080]  uh a reason for spread or putting out information or disinformation and when you don't have a
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:44.760]  clean playing field and you don't have you don't have independent uh confirmation where you where
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:48.360]  you people aren't playing with stuff i don't see how you can come up with any conclusions i
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.640]  mean on my conclusion is you know i'm with alex and that the and that the uh the global elites
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:57.160]  the new world order crowd if you want to call them whatever you want to call them the international
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:49:01.160]  bankers or whatever they're out they're out to screw the rest of us and make a bunch of bucks
[1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:06.280]  and convince us that it's for our own good and of course you know uh convincing us that uh we
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:11.560]  can't drive our truck anymore or if that if that's good for them great you know they're they're gonna
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:17.560]  they're gonna lie to us that's all they ever do is lie to us so in this atmosphere this forest of
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:23.960]  lies which is you know a the mainstream media and be the be the globally i don't see how anybody can
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:29.400]  come up with any real honest facts that's all it's it's just kind of a it's a it's it's uh
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:37.080]  confusing i guess and i think it's meant to be well um i think i mean you yourself you yourself
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:42.760]  in one of your and i saw in an interview uh i believe you said that they are urinating on us
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:50.200]  didn't you say that who was urinating on who that sounds interesting what did i say i think i saw
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:55.720]  that on one of the on the video clips that you know that that they were you know basically
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:00.600]  peeing on us you know it's like i think i think that was you if i'm wrong i'll i'll take that back
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:09.560]  but i don't okay i i i think i'm familiar with the clip and it refers to okay my my main um
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:19.480]  um group that i am deeply um uh disappointed with are the bankers in america uh the people on

[1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:35.160]  and under bush his whole cotere of advisors all those people um have done a a horrible job
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:43.000]  job and and have done committed um transgressions if you will uh to the point of you could classify
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.880]  them if you want to look historically uh over the course of american history they would class
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:52.840]  be classified as tyrants in a lot of ways because they will tell you what hold that thought max will

[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:21.640]  okay bob daisy back on the alex jones show with our guest max keiser
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:29.000]  okay we've got one more segment max so we're talking about somebody trying to urinate on us
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:33.720]  and you're talking about the the financial elites that are running you know the treasury department
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:39.720]  and the federal reserve i suppose and i noticed that you also on one of your things i was watching
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:42.840]  the other day you're talking about basically you want to talk about the new world order you're
[1:54:42.840 --> 1:54:48.760]  talking about goldman sacks is that is that accurate this financial coup d'etat that you mentioned
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:56.280]  that took place as a large largely orchestrated by goldman sacks yeah well first of all again
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:04.760]  the headlines that we cover are found on ex kaiser.com k-e-i-s-e-r um that's where we kind of
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:11.240]  aggregate all the all the information and the headlines so um if if if if listeners are interested
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:15.960]  in following these types of stories that's a good place to go plus we just did a show the oracle
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:21.240]  which i think alex is going to be on the show in the next two or three weeks it's a it goes on an
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:27.080]  international broadcaster and we try to make a sense of all this stuff and that's also on the
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:34.600]  web but okay the question of goldman sacks goldman sacks it inherited in a lot of ways the dynasty
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:41.080]  from uh jp morgan and of course jp morgan is still alive and kicking and these two banks
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:48.840]  uh are really at the heart of the u.s banking establishment banking cartel and as you know a
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:53.080]  lot of people there's a revolving door between goldman sacks and the federal government so
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.560]  hank paulson came from goldman sacks he went into the government he was a treasury secretary
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:56:03.800]  he'll probably end up going back and working on in the finance sector tim garner's cash carry
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:11.480]  very cash carry also goldman alumni robert rubin rubin golden alumni um i believe tim
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:17.960]  geithner also goldman alumni so the golden is really training you know for this these these
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:23.960]  guys and that's where they're concentrated they have huge profit machine they are doing really
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:31.720]  uh questionable things for example last year they were selling bonds uh on behalf of a customer
[1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:36.840]  at the same time they were selling them uh short in the open market and driving the price down so
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:42.680]  there was clear case of double dealing you know in this type of thing if you or i did it um it's a
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:49.320]  clear case of uh double dealing and yet at that level it seems to be completely overlooked and as a
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:53.960]  financial police when you need them huh well the financial police is supposed to be the securities
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:59.480]  and exchange commission the sec but it's overworked understaffed it seems to be a captured regulator
[1:56:59.480 --> 1:57:04.440]  just like these rating agencies like moody's s and p fish they seem to be in the pocket of the
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:09.160]  industry they're supposed to be supervising and they're not they're not actually in independent
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:14.920]  agencies and doing independent research and independent regulation and as a result you've
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:20.200]  got the growth of huge concentration of wealth and power it makes its way into washington
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:27.640]  and then they pass laws that make it much easier for banks and brokers to continue these huge schemes
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:35.320]  you know that bernie maddoff uh ponzi scheme is um really a model if you will for almost everything
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:42.840]  that's going on in the u.s financial sector over the past uh 15 20 20 years really you know and
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:46.520]  layman's terms you're just saying that the foxes garden henhouse and that's the way it is
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:53.880]  yeah well that's true you know it was that's the way it was back in calvin coolidge's day in the 1920s
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:58:00.600]  which led to the crash and the depression and things that were established as a result of the
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:07.480]  depression like the securities act of 1933 and 34 the fdic insurance the fcc all these things that
[1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:15.080]  were came as a result of government re-regulating these guys over the over the time since then
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:21.480]  they were washed out of existence you know clinton and the both democrats and republicans did their
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:28.200]  job in and de fanging the regulatory bodies to the point where we're right back to the calvin
[1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:34.680]  coolidge's day and the in the roaring 90s and the roaring double zero run by hobe now that was a
[1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:39.960]  huge crash and that's where i'm gonna have to catch up we're just about out of time max kaiser

[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:43.000]  seat of my pants um interview with max keiser was quite interesting um you know he's like way
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:49.640]  above my level in financial things but i think i handled myself relatively well i think and speaking
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:57.400]  of financial advisors we have bob Chapman of the international forecaster on the line bob are you
[2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:05.080]  there no i'm not here you're not here well then is this is this a ghost i'm talking to them
[2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:12.040]  it certainly is the apparition of the day were you following the previous part of the show
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:19.560]  no no i did not i just came on yeah you know the financial you you've got a like a newsletter right
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:23.480]  and you and you advise people on what to do in this crazy financial world in order to try to
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:29.720]  survive is that the idea tell tell us about what you do just to set the stage well the newsletter
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:37.400]  does that we recommend stocks both long and short in the market and commodities and uh we try to
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:44.360]  project uh events that are going to happen in the future uh like uh two years ago we said we were in
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:51.160]  a recession about a year ago some other experts discovered it and then last month uh our government
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:56.280]  discovered it um is the government gonna discover that we're in a depression a year after we're in
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:04.600]  it or what has i gonna work out uh no i think probably about two years after uh but uh i i
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:14.120]  have come out and said that the depression started this week and the depression is an acute very
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:21.400]  serious recession based on the way the government will probably term it but this this depression
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:30.120]  is going to be far more difficult and longer to uh to get out of than the previous one well
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:36.360]  i based on what yardstick did you determine that the we are now in a depression i'm kind of curious
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:47.480]  um what what's the difference the the um gdp in the last quarter and in this quarter will be both
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:56.120]  negative and when you have two negative gdp months in a row you're on your way especially
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:06.040]  in a recession already and i suspect that the a second quarter of uh this year will be negative
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:16.440]  and uh if they get their uh money out into the system uh on this uh stimulus package
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:22.680]  it'll probably moderate for a couple of quarters maybe three and then it'll head down again
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:31.000]  and all the stimulus package is doing is prolonging the agony and it's not creating
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:38.040]  any permanent jobs very little money is going out to the people uh the reason that politicians
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:46.440]  don't want people to have money like they had uh this past year in the 168 billion dollar stimulus
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:53.080]  package uh is that they said they'll pay their bills down and uh and that in part is probably
[2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:59.720]  true i mean they might get out of debt yeah oh we can't be having yeah they might even save it
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:07.160]  well they can't believe that so uh the politicians uh have decided that very little will go into the
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:13.320]  hands of the public and uh well it looks like the obama they look like the obama stimulus package
[2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:17.720]  though is going to be more like more you know like okay we had the thing for the republicans
[2:04:17.720 --> 2:04:22.360]  where they give all the money to wall street right and now the new stimulus package which
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:27.160]  they voted in apparently is going to pass more money out to to joe schmoe right i mean didn't
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:32.360]  that going to be better yeah but that's not what that that's not what that package is going to do
[2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:41.240]  uh there'll be some tax breaks and a few other things but it's by grocery it's it's
[2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:46.120]  indirect right all right bob hang on right there we're going to be back after the break
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:51.400]  with bob Chapman of the international forecaster this is bob daisy on the alex johnson on the gc

[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:24.280]  and uh we've got bob japman of the international forecast are on and we've been discussing the
[2:08:24.280 --> 2:08:34.840]  bailout bob um why won't the economic stimulus package work why is that you know you need
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:44.600]  consumerism is what you need 72 percent of the uh of the economy has been over the last several
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:54.360]  years uh made up the gdp's been made up of consumer buying things and my guess is it's
[2:08:54.360 --> 2:09:01.640]  probably dropped back to uh something on the order of 70 percent maybe 71 and i think this
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:10.120]  is going to continue and and we read need the stimulus is with the public uh the uh package
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:20.840]  is talking about the only thing that directly affects people uh is uh tax credits and they
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:27.880]  are going to create government jobs as well as government contract jobs but they're all temporary
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:35.880]  and uh uh one of the good things about what they're doing is in the educational field
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:46.040]  um the previous administration had virtually shut off any increases for education uh and that would
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:55.640]  keep teachers teaching and in their classrooms but the the the the stimulus among the people
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:10:02.360]  is where it has to be and it's it's not going to be there and you know the argument in congress about
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:08.440]  people saving the money those dollars that are saved go to the bank and the bank uses them
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:16.760]  that's good it's very good as a matter of fact and uh maybe that'll get americans to mend their
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:24.280]  ways uh up until about six months ago there was a negative one half or one percent in savings
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:30.120]  in other words people were saving more than they were making and now it's plus 2.8 percent which
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:37.080]  is a start and we would like to see it 10 or 15 percent if possible there are some nations that
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:46.200]  save 35 and 40 percent of income i'm not saying that america should do that but uh paying money
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:51.960]  into savings is good paying off bills is good because the money goes back to whomever you
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:58.200]  borrowed it from and they can use it to strengthen their balance sheet and maybe do something
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:04.920]  constructive constructive with it and so the stimulus package is not bad it's just not good
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:16.280]  and lasting and congress and the president they continue to try to fix the problem and they're
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:21.800]  not doing anything to fix it nobody wants any pain the money is coming out of thin air is it
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:25.720]  not i mean you know this they the word that's right it's money just they just printed out of
[2:11:25.720 --> 2:11:34.360]  nothing and eventually they'll try to they'll try to sell bonds and they will uh be uh successful
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:40.840]  up to a certain point and then the treasury is going to have to sell bonds to the federal reserve
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:47.320]  who creates money out of thin air to do that and then they give the the money to the treasury
[2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:54.680]  department which in turn spends it and immediately monetizes it which means it's immediately
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:12:00.040]  inflationary and i suspect that's been going on already they just they lie about everything
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:05.480]  and you can't really find out what they're doing so what you have to do is guess what they're doing
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:11.000]  you know on a qualitative basis you know that's exactly your very scheme that's the point i was
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.160]  trying to make with with uh max keiser who's a previous guess is i don't see how you can come
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:19.400]  up with any finance accurate data because they lie and they cheat and they manipulate everything
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:25.000]  and how do you know what's really going on you know i do have a rudimentary understanding of
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.440]  what causes inflation and basically you know tell me that tell me where i'm wrong you know you keep
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:35.000]  making more and more money without a commensurate rise in the level of goods and services about
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:39.640]  that money it drives down the value of the money and and therefore you have what looks to be
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:44.280]  increasing prices which is nothing more than the devaluation of the dollar is that correct or am i all
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:57.240]  with you're absolutely correct and inflation can only be created by the monetary unit uh in america
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:05.240]  known as the fed reserve it can not be created any other way by creating more money in credit
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:11.080]  than what there are revenues coming into the treasury and so that's the end of it you're
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:17.400]  absolutely right so do you agree with me we are facing hyperinflation and it's going to begin
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:24.120]  around march or april could be a little later but it's coming okay and yet i know let's define that
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:29.000]  because uh you know there's hyper what is hyperinflation we're not talking about sim bob way yet
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  we're talking about what what percent you say what range you're talking about well i think that that
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:46.520]  i i've seen a number of um uh explanations to that and uh the old a classical example was
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:57.400]  50 percent or higher um i think that anything over 15 percent is hyperinflationary and we
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:04.840]  were just recently up to 13 and 5 8 percent we're now back dabbling around 10 and that's because of
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:13.560]  the drop in commodity prices and and that has fed into the the ppi the producer price index
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:22.920]  which is enabled people who use commodities to make things create things uh it allows them to
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:30.760]  to have lower prices but you know it's interesting that food prices have not abated they're going
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:39.880]  higher and so the savings have been elsewhere but once this money and credit monetization
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:46.360]  clicks in a little bit later this year then inflation is going to start back up again but
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:52.520]  you're never going to get the true figures from government because in 1980 they decided with
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:15:00.200]  the cpi the consumer price index that they were going to change it and it was a political and
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:09.720]  societal change uh and uh the change was to not let anybody know that we were having an
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:14.360]  inflationary problem yeah it's basically this is going on since then thinking that everything's
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:19.240]  found i want i want to ask this question because this this brings up this debate between financial
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:25.560]  advisors uh some of them um are talking about well what's going to happen here ladies and
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:29.160]  gentlemen is we're going to have a deflation and the other one said no we're going to have an
[2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:34.360]  inflation and uh i'm trying to figure out where this is going to go out in my own in my own business
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:39.080]  a retail hardware business and it's i'm the local true value hardware guy in austin texas that's
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:45.400]  what i do for a living you know i see these i have seen for the last uh year or so these constant
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:50.920]  price increases coming from our suppliers will get a print out and it'll show you when a whatever
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:55.080]  item you used to buy for x amount of money is now y amount of money and they'll you can look down the
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:15:59.720]  column and see what's going up and what's going down and what i've seen in the last year and a
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:06.680]  half is just you know up up up up up uh mostly 10 11 12 percent that's just in like you know regular
[2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:11.880]  stuff that people buy in a hardware store i have this little window of that i see into in terms of
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:20.120]  the whole big picture because i sell a broad variety of what consumer goods are and uh so i i i wonder
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:25.880]  what is driving this uh deflation argument that a lot of financial advisors are talking about
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:32.920]  well i think it's an excellent question and it's not easy to answer but i'm going to try to make
[2:16:32.920 --> 2:16:37.640]  it as simple as possible you got you good because you know that's neat that's important because
[2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:42.600]  you know financial people can talk everybody over everybody's head except for you know that's that
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:53.960]  that doesn't help anybody uh in in june of 2005 housing began to peak and it's been downhill since
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:17:04.440]  then and as that happened construction abated and we had a general constricting within the
[2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:13.320]  building industry and the real estate industry and then the price of homes went down or began
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:19.480]  their descent and home depot started laying off employees hey yes that's true that's why we put
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:26.200]  a shot on short on that one in other words we recommended that people sell the stock even
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:33.320]  though they didn't own it betting it would go down and of course it did anyway we were ahead of the
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:45.800]  curve on that and when that happened the value of homes went down and you had a diminution of assets
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:57.640]  a deflationary flare began when that happened the federal reserve started to increase money and credit
[2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:05.160]  in a big way in fact they went as high on the m3 which they don't publish anymore and haven't
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:16.760]  for a couple of years they increased m3 the highest i saw was 17 and a half percent and usually that
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:26.120]  will relegate into about 13 and a half percent now the reason i did that was that they had to offset
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:35.160]  that the effect of the deflation of assets the deflationary bent in the economy and they've been
[2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:47.400]  fighting that for over four years now the result of that is that the deflationary drag is getting
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:55.480]  larger and stronger because more and more assets are losing their value now it's not only real
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:19:04.680]  estate it's real estate bonds those are bonds with mortgages inside of them and we all know
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:10.840]  who have been following things that these cdo's and si v's have gone down precipitously in value
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:16.120]  and then we look at bank balance sheets and the balance sheets of corporations that thing has
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:23.560]  happened well that's going on which is deflationary we get the Fed is pumping away and we've got this
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:29.560]  program and that program and those banks got to be saved and those brokerage houses and those
[2:19:29.560 --> 2:19:35.240]  insurance companies even general electric and general modus in christland may be even forward
[2:19:36.600 --> 2:19:41.480]  so that's how they're offsetting it so we get the same thing go two things going on at the same
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:46.280]  time a little bit of both okay bob Chapman with the international forecaster will be back with

[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:23.480]  of january 2009 we're talking with bob chatman international forecaster and i gotta admit bob i'm
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:29.560]  confused we got in we got inflationary pressures all over the place we got some some temporary
[2:24:29.560 --> 2:24:36.120]  deflation and you've got the the chinese don't want to buy our debt anymore and we got we got
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:42.200]  people getting thrown out of work like nobody's business and and what what does the average guy
[2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:48.120]  do in the in this in this environment that we're we're going into in this depression that we're
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:54.120]  uh descending into what do you what do you tell a guy some you know average joe blow on the street
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:59.400]  what do you tell him well we've been doing this and telling people what to do for a long time on
[2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:08.040]  the radio i've been on genesis 11 or 12 years and i knew this was coming and uh we got people out of
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:13.800]  the stock market in 2000 got into gold and silver related assets and they've been there for the last
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:23.160]  eight or so years profitably so but uh i want to finish answering that and and i hope that people
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:33.320]  understand that we simultaneously have deflation and inflation going on enough inflation to smother
[2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:41.880]  deflation to keep it down to keep it from raising its ugly irretrievable head
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:48.440]  because once it takes over it's dreadful i mean everything just shrivels other shrivels up and
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:57.960]  dies ultimately historically we find that in inflationary binges like the one we're seeing
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:04.840]  now it goes on and all of a sudden for some reason it stops and usually that reason is
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:14.280]  is borrow is stop borrowing and lenders can't really find anybody to borrow lend to and so when
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:19.880]  that happens the whole thing goes down into deflation and that will happen it's a ways away
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:26.680]  i don't know how far but what you have is a problem that's being surmounted in the short term
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:35.240]  and it's for the last four or five years now and that is a short term in economic history you have
[2:26:35.240 --> 2:26:42.600]  the suppressionary process so the deflation is an inflation is the both right probably for
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:48.440]  different reasons but the point is that's the way it is and it will go on that way until
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:56.520]  the system breaks and then it will go totally into deflation now to answer what people should do
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:03.400]  first of all hopefully people have cleared their credit card and revolving debt and they've done
[2:27:03.400 --> 2:27:11.960]  that they have to get food dehydrated freeze-dried food in a water filter they should have a method
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:19.160]  of defending their family and then after that they should be buying gold and silver coins silver
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:26.760]  because it's the known value things like the american eagle or 90 percent junk junk silver
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:35.320]  as it's called and the gold coins because the only true money is gold and all the currencies
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:40.840]  in the world are fiat with the exception of the euro which is about now about seven percent backing
[2:27:40.840 --> 2:27:45.960]  in gold otherwise as far as i know that they're not there are no others so the whole world
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:51.960]  essentially had three percent not the euro is 93 percent fiat seven percent real is that what
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:59.560]  you're saying yes yes okay and so anyway all currencies are going to be devalued and it's
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:06.840]  going to be massive default i don't know when but it is going to happen and we're well on our way to
[2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:13.960]  that and if you look at charts to make it simple you'll see where over a period of time the last
[2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:22.120]  five years that all currencies have steadily in different degrees gone down against gold
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:27.320]  and that is the proof of the pudding right there and that is going to continue
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:34.760]  and that's why it's so important to be in gold and silver and so beyond keeping your job
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:41.320]  and trying to get rid of debt getting prepared for the day that you might lose your job and i
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:46.760]  expect 30 percent or more of americans will be out of work and 15 percent are out already
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:51.320]  again you can't use the government statistics because i don't believe you don't believe the
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:56.040]  government the government doesn't say that no i think that isn't in the rule of thumb if they
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:29:01.800]  want to if they want to downplay something you multiply by a factor of three and you're probably
[2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:07.560]  about right you know so what is the official in unemployment statistic from the u.s government
[2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:14.040]  well i have three of them three and uh one of them is the short term that you read about the 7.2
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:20.920]  percent okay then i have another one called u3 which is long term and their long their long term
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:27.880]  figure is 15 percent and then you have the intermediate term which is u6 which they're calling
[2:29:27.880 --> 2:29:33.240]  a 12 and three quarters percent and even they're lying about that hang on we're back in a bit
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:54.360]  we're on the march the empire's on the run

[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:18.920]  all right bob daisy back on the alex jones show uh talking with uh bob chatman the international
[2:33:18.920 --> 2:33:25.240]  forecaster uh we were discussing the uh true unemployment right bob you want to finish up
[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:31.720]  with that thought what is the true unemployment right now well i i think the the fairest figure to
[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:38.040]  the use is the use six figure which comes in uh and gubba government numbers at 12 and 3 quarter
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:44.280]  percent and it includes short term employment as well as people who in the recent past have stopped
[2:33:44.280 --> 2:33:51.720]  receiving uh state unemployment checks and that figure is of course mickey most uh i have that
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:58.360]  figure 15 percent not 12 and 3 quarter percent and that's where i come up with the 15 percent uh if
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:03.880]  you go to the long term numbers they're calling them 15 percent when in fact they're about 17
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:09.160]  and 3 quarter percent and then every day i see more and more people getting laid off by by the
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:16.760]  droves right i mean every day the paper there's a several thousand more and uh you know it continues
[2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:23.160]  to get worse and worse and worse i just got i i you're talking about a depression here right
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:28.680]  that's what you're talking about that's what i'm talking about uh i think the only one i've seen
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:38.920]  alluded to that is the chief economist from marylench david rozenberg and uh he is he hasn't
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:47.480]  said it that for sure we are but all the telltale signs are there so uh this time around i have
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:56.200]  somebody uh who has economic stature uh with a large firm saying almost the same thing that i am
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:02.040]  he's not sure we're there yet but we're very close i know we're in it well we're you know
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:06.680]  you're talking about one of the things you need to do in order to protect yourself from this type
[2:35:06.680 --> 2:35:13.400]  of a financial environment or actually a world environment is to um you know collect gold and
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:19.800]  silver and physical possession just so happens that we have um ted anderson on the line ted are you
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:25.080]  there yeah i guess if you want to call it the line i i'm in studio up here in genesis communications
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:30.200]  network and uh and i can just been listening to the show and watching the economic things
[2:35:30.200 --> 2:35:39.800]  passed by here uh bob i mean the gold today has been as high as 929 80 it's 929 60 it's almost
[2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:46.920]  seeing 930 today and uh and that's up currently right now it's 16 dollars and 70 cents silver's
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:53.000]  up to it's a hot trading day i can tell you we've got a lot of people that are buying and they should
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:59.080]  be too i mean though the uh if i'm just i mean with the fed threatening to buy a lot more us
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:05.480]  treasuries to take printed money and to buy us treasuries the the the way if you define that by
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:11.240]  what's going on the that means that the united states citizens are printing all this money
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:15.640]  we're giving it to the federal reserve system hypothetically and they're gonna come in and
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:19.560]  buy treasuries which means they're gonna lend it back to us and they're gonna do enough of that to
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:24.520]  try to stimulate the economy oh my god i've been just like looking at it going okay so now we're
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:29.400]  going to be on the hook for how much in taxes to service the interest on this debt i mean i know i
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:35.640]  know bob you know you look at this stuff and it baffles me to even think that the public is stupid
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:40.680]  enough to buy into this thing it just drives me crazy well i understand that i'm going to get me
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.320]  a big old block of government cheese and a big big old flagging of government wine and i'll just be
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:48.520]  able to sit around all day long eating my government cheese and drinking my wine i don't
[2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:53.080]  have anything to worry about because they're gonna bail me out right that's that's the way
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:57.560]  i said bob boy and i'm sorry for interrupting and now i was going to say if you if you do that
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:37:03.960]  and you drink to my trying you might have some liver problems but i had a pretty good
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:09.960]  pre-government health care then well i don't know about that and whether you get it or not remains
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:18.120]  to be seen um oh you did it you know well uh you might have to wait in line for a long time
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:22.280]  like they do in canada or in other places you'll get it maybe not where you want it but you'll get
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:31.720]  it yeah well um this is an extraordinary day in golden silver and it has been extraordinary
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:39.560]  for the past week or so and in the forecaster uh we told everybody uh about two weeks ago
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:46.280]  to go all in uh everything you've got go into golden silver uh related assets and uh
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:51.480]  uh that was when gold was around 830 so it's been it's up about a hundred dollars since then
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:57.880]  and we're going to go up and test the high up here shortly and i don't think it's going to hold
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:02.920]  uh i think there's uh too many people throughout the world and tell the tech can tell you more
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:11.560]  about this who are buying coins and and bars and uh the uh the dealers of the world are having a
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:16.840]  hard time fulfilling those orders from time to time right then oh there's no question about that
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:21.560]  as a matter of fact i'm getting calls from all over the world largely in part because of this
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:27.160]  very show and how many listen how many people listen overseas but uh yeah indeed i've got people
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:34.600]  that are buying from england people that are buying from australia germany uh japan um i mean just
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:39.480]  all over the world and main reason is is they're having a harder time buying it locally they'd
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:44.680]  prefer to have me uh ship it to them overseas because there's nobody that has the stuff uh
[2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:50.280]  you know and and i'm in there buying you know i told alex i'm carrying this deal at about the
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:55.080]  the cost on the stuff was right around once when gold is at 830 is when i locked in on these
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:01.320]  franks and uh and uh and british sovereigns and uh and i still have just a few of those left i've
[2:39:01.320 --> 2:39:08.360]  repriced what i have now uh looking at frank's i have my 214 on this on this deal but if i'm in
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:13.640]  the marketplace trying to get them there 232 what i really feel good about is the people that took
[2:39:13.640 --> 2:39:18.760]  advantage of my deal just before that when i bought them at 700 now those people are able to sell
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:24.120]  them back to me at a nice profit they were buying them at 202 and the market's much higher than that
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:29.640]  on the buy side of the market which is just uh you know unheard of that within one week's time
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:34.760]  of buying something you can actually sell them back and take a nice little profit but
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:39.000]  i don't think you should because what's going on in the marketplace here you better you better hold
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:45.320]  on to this stuff but then what i do have right now is i do have the sovereign it's at 263 and i
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:51.080]  have the frank at 214 i challenge anybody to look anywhere in the united states or across the globe
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:56.120]  and find those coins for less you won't because the market price is up much higher and the other
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:01.720]  thing bob mentioned junk silver we have a fairly good supply of junk silver i really recommend
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:07.640]  that stuff we also have the mercury dimes i'm out of the walking liberty halves i've completely sold
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:13.240]  out last time i was on air we're talking about the buffalo coin i am 100 sold out on those i
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:19.320]  can't get enough to even fill an order for one right now and that's how that's how the market is
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:24.760]  the gold prices are rising there's no no question about it that every time that happens not only
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:31.320]  just to mitis resources but to every gold dealer across the world they've got a lot of customers
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:36.760]  coming the door trying to buy and that happens every time the market goes up so i would suggest
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:43.320]  if yet if you're at all interested in gold now's the time to be getting in yeah if you can get a
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:47.480]  hold of it right i mean ted you seem to be able to get a hold of it when other people can't uh i
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:52.440]  noticed that you you i've seen all these statistics about well you know you order some stuff and maybe
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:55.480]  five or six weeks or now maybe you'll get it because they really don't have it yet and they
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:41:00.120]  got to go scrambling around finding it is that you know this is you know you know you uh dealers
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:04.520]  can afford to do that in a in a soft market and they always know they can get the material right
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:11.080]  now i don't trust that i'm i'm out buying right now and uh and when gold dropped down there at at
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:16.920]  that eight seventy level i said it right on here i said elix i'm buying right now i'm i'm accumulating
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:23.400]  and this stuff is going to be in my my warehouse in my safe so it's available for uh for delivery
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:28.120]  when people want to uh when people want to take advantage of it i'm and i'm and i'm counting on
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:33.320]  the fact i mean the the downside to that is is that what if gold goes down and i'm sitting on a big
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:38.920]  position uh but the you know the the flip side to that is how how many problems do we actually
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:44.600]  have a going on in the united states and across the world right now the central banks are doing
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:49.000]  everything in their power to try to suppress the prices of gold and silver because they want people
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:55.320]  to stay in their fiat currency they're they're printing and uh but the but the but the the the
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:42:01.480]  laws of physics will have it here that the uh that the uh demand for gold is much stronger than the
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:06.680]  central banks are you know able to suppress it and and so even though they're one of the largest
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:12.760]  holders of of physical gold in in the world uh they don't even want to sell it themselves they
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:18.600]  know their currencies are are are are doomed they're right at the end of the rope on this stuff and
[2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:27.080]  so anyways yeah i if you're interested uh might as resources you can reach us at 1-800-686-2237
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:31.880]  probably one of the best deals that i have that i'm offering right now
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:38.680]  is that creature from jackal island book and you get a silver dollar in it it's 26 dollars and 45
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:44.120]  cents and that'll at least get you one silver dollar for you to keep i'm suggesting and you
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:49.160]  can do what you want is that you pick up the book from us keep the silver dollar read the book and
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:54.200]  then find at least one other person that needs to read that book and give it to them what that
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:43:00.680]  that's about central banking how money comes into existence if the entire united states knew how this
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:06.040]  system worked right now that system be thrown out on its year and would be back to constitutional
[2:43:06.040 --> 2:43:11.240]  money everybody's you know they want answers and they're not getting it from the uh mainstream
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:16.680]  media and this is one of the ways to do that the other thing too i gotta say uh starting monday
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:22.680]  bob's newsletter that international forecaster which explains this very well and also that
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:27.400]  creature from jackal island spot that you're hearing on genesis communications network
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:34.360]  will be playing on rush limbaugh shon hannity glenn back george norrie i'm already playing it on
[2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:42.280]  the premier radio networks are the uh the uh talk radio network shows like uh laura ingram and uh
[2:43:42.280 --> 2:43:49.480]  and uh um uh humphreys and and and their lineup and and i've got it going in several other locations
[2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:54.520]  and the main thing is i think really more than anything else the country's hungry for answers
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:43:59.240]  now they need to get them there and uh and they're not going to get them from the mainstream media
[2:43:59.240 --> 2:44:03.560]  they really know they really need to know what this federal reserve thing is about in central
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:08.520]  banking and actually how it affects our economy and uh and our liberties that's that's the main
[2:44:08.520 --> 2:44:13.240]  thing our liberties are just being slipped away i don't know why they think the answer is more
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:19.000]  government and less liberty that's not what needs to occur we need more liberty and less government
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:23.480]  let the market take care of itself all these bailouts i mean i'm hearing the republicans
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:27.480]  democrats from both sides talking about how we need more bailout and you know it needs to be
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:32.040]  done this way they're arguing over the details of how the money should be doled out i mean
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:36.200]  they should be doing it in the first place i mean that's just my opinion i know that i'm
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:40.680]  i'm in the minority right now about 80 people 80 percent of the people want a bailout right now
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:45.960]  no less than i think it was less than 20 percent wanted it before but the george bush was saying
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:51.240]  it as soon as as soon as barack obama came up with a bailout plan now 80 percent wanted i mean
[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:56.200]  go figure it's the same thing i think they have something to do with sheeple i think they're dead
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:45:03.000]  you know they're following a little man and give me two you know i want some bailout you know i'm
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:08.920]  a small businessman and i'm not gonna get any kind of bailout i'm gonna get nothing you know and uh
[2:45:08.920 --> 2:45:16.920]  so um i just laugh about it i just the whole ethic of our whole society is that well gee just
[2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:20.840]  print up some money and paper over the problems and don't attack the cause of the problem just
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:25.000]  paper it over with more money and everything will be just fine that you just keep shoving their
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:29.480]  shoving the consequences further on down the line and the more they the more they pile them up the
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:34.760]  worst they're going to be when the thing finally goes to fluey yeah well at least i at least i know
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:40.360]  that that you're you're smart enough to get away from this paper fiat currency that we have and
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:45.400]  obab is and i certainly am and i know that a lot of the people out there have i just have to say
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:49.880]  at this particular time the warning bells are ringing and it's more like a siren blasting the
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:55.080]  horn now is the time to move and if you're interested in finding out more if you really don't
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:45:59.000]  understand the system and i know there's a lot of people that are out there listening to bob
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:03.880]  Chapman and scratching their head going what the world is he talking about how i don't quite understand
[2:46:03.880 --> 2:46:08.360]  what he's talking about here and why uh that creature from jackall island book lays it out
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:13.480]  pretty much in black and white and for twenty six dollars and forty five cents the retail price on
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:18.840]  this thing is 24 bucks now with silver where it is silver dollars up over 20 bucks a piece
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:24.920]  you add it up it's like about it's like about 40 dollars 45 dollars worth a worth of product
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:28.680]  and you put the postage on there it gets up to 50 bucks and i'm selling it for
[2:46:28.680 --> 2:46:34.040]  for 26 dollars and 45 cents i just i don't know how i can make a better deal for you
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:38.920]  that's it's ted would you say that the reason why i'm either it's this big decoupling between the
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:43.320]  price of physical metal and the and the paper price you know you're reading the paper that silver
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:48.680]  is whatever it is 11 or 12 bucks and you're selling that the coins are 20 this huge discrepancy
[2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:53.400]  between what used to be a billion coin which was supposed to kind of closely follow the value of
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:59.320]  of say silver that this huge discrepancy would you say would you agree that that the reason for that
[2:46:59.880 --> 2:47:06.040]  is that uh the powers that be can suppress the the paper price of the metal all they want but
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:10.680]  they can't suppress the real value yeah it's because of it's like fractional reserve banking
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:16.040]  they're what they're doing is they're manipulating the spot price of silver or gold by by getting
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:21.240]  into the futures market will do that and i know bob would agree with this too it's it's the futures
[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:26.920]  market that's uh that's causing the uh causing the spot price to dip when it does and that just
[2:47:26.920 --> 2:47:32.040]  means that you know somebody's in there selling a lot of the times short meaning selling something
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:37.480]  that they don't even have i don't know bob why don't you touch on that one well mostly it's the
[2:47:37.480 --> 2:47:42.680]  united states government uh on the comics they have what i call commercials and these are the
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:49.720]  pro's pros and the commercials run the market they're supposed to know everything and not too
[2:47:49.720 --> 2:47:55.960]  long ago they were short they were betting gold was going to go down and they were wrong and they
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:01.960]  obviously you know took some losses uh what their relationship is with the united states government
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:07.080]  we don't know uh because the united states government nor the commercials will tell us
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:14.680]  us but again now they're short big and they get in their heads handed to them again gold is trading
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:22.760]  close to uh 928 right now up 23 or so dollars silver's up 41 cents so they've got a problem
[2:48:22.760 --> 2:48:32.520]  but what happens is that on the futures trading market that historically less than one percent
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:38.840]  of those who took a contract on the long side of the market betting that the price would go up
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:46.840]  took delivery now that figure we guess is somewhere between 16 and 20 percent which
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:55.320]  means that the comics probably has to go someplace else and borrow either gold or silver but we're
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:49:02.920]  primarily talking about gold here in order to fulfill the demand for the forward long contracts
[2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:11.720]  and if people continue to do that it's going to put a squeeze on the comics exchange and we expect
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:16.280]  that that is going to happen over the coming months and it has already begun
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:24.600]  on january uh december was a big month uh for contract deliveries and of course you have
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:33.960]  comics on their screaming to the client the customer we don't want you to take delivery
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:39.560]  and they're making it as difficult as possible but that is not a real market if you can't get
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:49:45.160]  delivery and this is what's going on and sooner or later if enough delivery is taken over the
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:51.160]  next several months they're going to have to either borrow gold and silver or they're going to have to
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:56.600]  shut down and i think that's what we're headed for but it's a make believe market you just a
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:50:02.520]  market where people trade things in this case gold and silver with no intention of ever taking
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:08.520]  delivery physical to market and markets totally different i mean you buy it or you don't it's
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:15.400]  pretty simple and right now people all over the world are scrambling to get out of their currencies
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:21.400]  to buy gold and silver in one form or another and uh that's going to continue and it's going to
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:28.280]  heighten and this is going to go on for two or three years until the inflationary aspect of what
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:37.560]  central banks are doing and just not the fed the g20 is doing it i hear the music and yeah that music
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:42.520]  means you're going to have another break uh uh this is bob daisy where i'm substituting on the

[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:57.240]  bob to you know i the only thing that i can think of is that educating the people um i know i know
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:02.360]  that bob might have some other answers to but uh you know it we're not ready we're not ready for
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:07.080]  real solutions yet for some reason there that are our political mass the people that are in
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:13.320]  washington dc by the large part don't understand what's going on nor do there's constituents that
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:20.040]  basically get them elected uh i think you're being kind you know kind about the politicians
[2:55:20.040 --> 2:55:23.800]  not knowing what's going on i think they're a bunch of crooks well they they they are very
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:27.880]  well crooks but i don't think they understand economics i don't i mean i understand how to
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:33.720]  line their own pockets well that's true and then and they'll sell us out for for a dime you know
[2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:40.280]  but but the fact of the matter is is if you asked you know i was i was listening to ron paul on the
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:44.600]  banking committee when he's talking about all these different things and most of these people
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:48.920]  didn't even know that the federal reserve was a private agency you know i mean that it wasn't a
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:54.600]  branch of government and and and the fiat system the whole thing is whole this whole concept of
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:56:01.480]  what we've been sold into in 1913 which put us into the position where we now have a fiat currency
[2:56:01.480 --> 2:56:06.920]  system and we have a federal income tax we didn't have that before the system was in place and now
[2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:11.720]  they're you know when the federal reserve system buys us government securities they're basically
[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:16.600]  saying that we're going to lend the government the money we owe the taxes as the as the citizens
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:21.000]  to pay back the interest on that debt they've created this from nothing they they they have

[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:45.960]  facility how did you uh end up getting involved with alex to begin with i listened to his radio
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:53.320]  show uh about four years ago and i did a political blog at the time and uh one thing led to another
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:56.600]  and the next thing i know i was working for the guy how many articles you think you've written
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:03.000]  for info wars dot com oh gosh hundreds hundreds hundreds i don't really keep track so i don't
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:07.560]  know exactly you have any particular things that you're most interested in right now things
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:12.360]  that you're working on that you're you want to want to talk about well lately we've been we've
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:17.720]  been covering obama and the obama administration obama yeah and it kind of dovetails with alex's
[3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:24.440]  latest film obama wait wait i got i got an article right here i am thrilled to death you said that
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:30.120]  i got an obama section right here in front of me this is from the american statesman the other day
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:38.600]  obama vows to achieve energy independence here's a quote from him it will be the policy of my
[3:02:38.600 --> 3:02:46.040]  administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil wait a minute don't hurt uh didn't
[3:02:46.040 --> 3:02:51.480]  he want to make sure we don't do any domestic exploration and drilling and stuff yeah it's
[3:02:51.480 --> 3:02:58.600]  kind of a contradiction so how tell me sir how how do you reduce our dependence on foreign oil
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:04.600]  if you don't let us produce domestic oil well possibly we'll be using less oil in general
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:09.560]  oh you mean possibly our standard of living is going to have to crater is that what you
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:13.960]  do you think this might be what he's saying absolutely i think that's exactly what he's
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:18.680]  saying look ladies and gentlemen y'all aren't stupid the fact that you listen to the alex
[3:03:18.680 --> 3:03:26.200]  joneshow means you're not stupid figure it out if they won't allow the alaska stuff to come online
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:30.840]  if they won't go up to gull island where lindsay william says there's more oil than under all of
[3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:36.280]  saudi arabia if they want and natural gas just pouring out of the ground they got to drive it
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:41.320]  back in with pumps all the time if they won't let us do that and obama's going to keep all that stuff
[3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:47.320]  away from us then how in the world is this clown going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:51.400]  there's only one other way ladies and gentlemen and that is to take our standard of living and
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:56.520]  flush it down the toilet right when that's part of the banker agenda i mean that's what the climate
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:04:01.160]  change things all about is uh reducing our standard of living that's right but you know another way
[3:04:01.160 --> 3:04:07.880]  another way to reduce things is to kill people i have an article here that obama is planning a
[3:04:07.880 --> 3:04:13.240]  billion dollar bailout for the abortion industry right uh let me see this last week let me read
[3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:21.960]  this this is um from uh one news now dot com uh about a couple of weeks ago last week the obama
[3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:26.440]  biden transition project posted a report on its website that calls for the dramatic
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:31.720]  policy reversals on abortion including a one billion dollar and taxpayer money for
[3:04:31.720 --> 3:04:36.680]  international abortion groups like planned parenthood all right so there you have it
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:41.240]  you know another go another just kill more people and they won't be using resources right well we've
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:46.120]  got a bunch of e-genesis from in the country so there you go hey that's change isn't it all right

[3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:17.640]  on the gcn radio network all right we are back on the alex jones show this is bob daisy substituting
[3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:25.320]  for alex jones and in studio we have kurt nemo and we were talking we were discussing uh his uh
[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:32.040]  kurt nemo's interest in our our new president obama and i was making a comment that uh one of
[3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:37.080]  the first things he's done actually i'm looking at an article from another writer for info wars
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:42.520]  dot com and for prison planet dot com on paul joseph watson uh he wrote this a few days ago
[3:08:42.520 --> 3:08:47.720]  obama's first act is taxpayer money to fund abortions of black babies how do you like that
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:54.120]  change y'all first sentence the sickest irony amidst the euphoria of the inauguration of america's
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:59.800]  first black president is that one of obama's very first actions in office will be to ensure
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:05.080]  that millions more black babies are aborted in third world countries with american taxpayers
[3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:14.200]  picking up the tab what do you think about that well i mean this is just a trade off on
[3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:18.760]  on you know it's like a tag team thing between the bush administration and the obama administration
[3:09:18.760 --> 3:09:24.520]  the clinton obama is just basically a regurgitation on the clinton administration uh they have their
[3:09:24.520 --> 3:09:32.440]  social policies you know their their social uh you know and and part of that is for the so-called
[3:09:32.440 --> 3:09:38.760]  liberals if you want to use their false right left paradigm is is abortion or a choice as they call
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:44.120]  it's choice it's not abortion it's choice you know i always thought you know in my opinion in my
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:51.480]  humble opinion when you when you look at abortion look you have a choice to kill something of your
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:59.240]  own flesh and blood or not kill something of your own flesh and blood it's my belief that if your
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:06.520]  conscience was was ruling your your your decision making process you'd probably feel better about
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:11.960]  not killing something of your own flesh and blood well to them it's it's tissue until it's born
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:17.240]  yeah right right yeah well you know the viability argument i'm going to make lots of people mad
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:22.760]  now the viability argument well it's not valuable it's not viable so you can kill it well guess what
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:28.600]  it's not viable after it comes out either that's right so give me a break that and and the other
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:33.400]  argument i love you it's the women's body she should be able to do with it whatever she wants
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:38.840]  well guess what it's no longer just her body anymore that argument is ridiculous well the whole
[3:10:38.840 --> 3:10:44.200]  the whole the whole agenda is pushed by margaret sanger in the you know planned parenthood and all
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:50.680]  of that for decades it's part of the genesis uh you know agenda yeah that that's it that's exactly
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:56.120]  right i i you know people that i know abortion is the thing you really you never bring up abortion
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:01.480]  you know you mix everybody mad somebody everybody's got some skeleton in its closet somewhere they
[3:11:01.480 --> 3:11:06.200]  didn't want to be reminded of a lot of people are that way and they just they just want to be
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:11.640]  reminded of and they take it personal but the you know i abortion look the the constitution
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:17.960]  says i think what is it the preamble says that we're supposed to establish this constitution
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:26.120]  of you know to protect the life and liberty of ourselves and our posterity but what is our
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:33.320]  posterity i think our posterity is those who who are coming after us well i think the founding
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:39.240]  fathers didn't mean there was a nine month window where you could kill our posterity right i don't
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:45.080]  think that they meant that but you know what the heck it's it's a woman's body and she can do whatever
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:49.960]  she wants it and government should butt out you know that's funny government should butt out of a
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:59.240]  lot of things but uh you know this thing about you know killing killing us a little guy that's
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:04.680]  going to be maybe president united states one day who knows if you just let things take their natural
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:09.720]  course there's something wrong with that that's all right that's all this is going to be pushed
[3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:16.120]  under the obama administration it's part of the you know the liberal agenda so to speak
[3:12:16.120 --> 3:12:21.960]  yes it'll be changed it'll be changed when you pay the abortionist for however much he's paid
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:26.680]  to kill your baby he'll give you some change i guess i don't know well you want to take some phone
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:34.040]  calls sure all right we've got uh leo in massachusetts our first caller on the alex jon show today leo
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:39.720]  are you there all right thanks for taking the call um yeah would you say that abortion is a
[3:12:39.720 --> 3:12:47.320]  uh eugenicist a wet dream so to say well you know it's a good way to get rid of those useless
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:52.200]  useless feeders before they ever start feeding i guess that's right i i i take a kind of a
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:58.440]  midway position and i get hammered by both sides i think that after the second trimester
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:04.360]  the fetus is viable outside of the womb and therefore should have full constitutional rights i think
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:10.840]  before that you're still a tag along you're a you're a you're an aspect of rather than a separate
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:16.680]  individual that's why you know it's a controversial position to take oh it is it is it i i disagree
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:21.800]  with you uh in a friendly manner you know i i have the unique ability to disagree with people
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:25.960]  in a friendly manner i don't i don't sit there and yell and scream at him but because i'm partially
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:30.840]  in your camp is what i'm saying my my deal there is where do you draw the line if you take this
[3:13:30.840 --> 3:13:37.720]  nine month gestation period you know and you say okay let's draw a graph here okay we're we're viable
[3:13:37.720 --> 3:13:43.240]  right here we're not viable right here let's it's okay to kill them at this point but but 24 hours
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:48.440]  later it's not okay to kill yeah i i i know the complexities you're adding in my deal is my deal
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:54.360]  is that you is the benefit of the doubt argument right you know and also i would like to interview
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:14:00.280]  the fetus oh right right you know anyway i can i get back to mr nimo sure go right ahead i understand
[3:14:00.280 --> 3:14:06.200]  you were a graphics person before is this true yes i was and where did you live before you moved out
[3:14:06.200 --> 3:14:14.040]  west i live in chicago oh and the end design has chased you out of there uh no they didn't chase me
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:19.720]  out of there what makes you think that i heard you were getting certain threats by certain peoples
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:25.720]  yes i was i when i criticized israel i did get some pretty pernicious threats but that's water
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:31.160]  under the bridge at this point well i mean would you have stayed there if that hadn't happened no
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:34.920]  that that didn't have anything to do with it i decided to move out of chicago because quite
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:40.760]  frankly i was a web designer and the job market pretty much vanished in chicago when the so-called
[3:14:40.760 --> 3:14:49.400]  internet bubble burst in the early 2000 late 90s but hasn't the web design been shipped out to
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:55.080]  india and china now pretty much for larger corporations i started working for local firms in
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:15:03.320]  southern new mexico so i got a job there and i'm working for alex jones great i knew welcome to the
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:12.680]  club and i'm glad you're hitched up with a good guy i just think that i want alex to do more of a
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:20.280]  uh npr voice on a regular basis just to cool himself out and make fun of npr i think you could
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:24.840]  do both but i worry about him getting a heart attack from just jumping around like that and
[3:15:24.840 --> 3:15:28.600]  freaking out well leo i'll tell you what i want i want to thank you for the call i'm gonna let you
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:36.600]  go i'm gonna comment on that i have known alex since uh i guess november of 98 when he first came
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:45.400]  into my store and uh that ain't gonna happen alex is alex and what you see there is what you get
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:52.200]  you know and the guy you know he he what what he projects is what he feels and he's like a
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:56.840]  bull in a china closet and it's not going to change now he can do really good invitations
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:02.040]  and other voices and whatnot for fun but uh what you see is what you give the alex people
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:10.120]  always always love to criticize alex because he's so in your face but look where it's got him
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:15.080]  and the guy is the tip of the spear or the whole dad gum freedom movement in the united states and
[3:16:15.080 --> 3:16:20.920]  people criticizing for it right exactly and and okay great wonderful criticizing for it but you
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:27.560]  can't argue with success you know i'm sitting here in the studio this state-of-the-art fantastic
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:33.800]  fantastic combination radio tv studio it's going all over the world the millions of people he's
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:38.840]  going to be rebroadcasting it four more times i guess or five more times or whatever before
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:43.640]  the next one pops up that you know he's got all these websites with millions and millions and
[3:16:43.640 --> 3:16:48.040]  millions of hits he's got all these documentaries and by the way you need to buy alex jonah's
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:53.320]  documentaries i got a i got a plug alex jonah's documentaries and and the other ones that are
[3:16:53.320 --> 3:17:00.120]  on there too uh for example i think one of the best documentaries produced is uh loose change
[3:17:00.120 --> 3:17:05.800]  final cut that's the one that uh jason bermus and uh dylan abry did and quarry row and that she can
[3:17:05.800 --> 3:17:10.680]  get on alex jonah's website loose change final cut and one of the reasons why it's one of the
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:17.400]  best ones out there is because i'm in it how about that shameless plug you know so that was a great
[3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:25.080]  one in games fantastic i remember when uh one of the older films uh uh 911 road to tyranny came out
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:31.720]  absolutely that was like a quantum leap in alex's uh uh production ability and just fantastic film
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:38.840]  about september 11th you know just in game whatever you you name it you go to info wars.com and
[3:17:38.840 --> 3:17:44.520]  click on the the shop button and buy some alex's stuff because they need the money to keep on doing
[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:49.960]  this and by the way a few weeks ago i was on i was uh riding shotgun with jason bermus and some
[3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:57.160]  caller called in and was griping about alex jonah's hijacking the the freedom movement and the money
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:03.080]  aspect of it and i just thought it was funny you think all this stuff is cheap you know i'm i'm
[3:18:03.080 --> 3:18:10.920]  lucky my tv show is just pure volunteer it's kind of like you know alex is like a like a professional
[3:18:10.920 --> 3:18:16.440]  soldier in this battle and i'm the militia you know i show up when i can't i gotta go
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:22.120]  pin the store but man i tell you what i you can't say enough good about alex jones i hear so many
[3:18:22.120 --> 3:18:26.600]  people saying bad things about him i guess you know when you're what's the old expression when
[3:18:26.600 --> 3:18:31.000]  you're over the target target you get the flag you get the flag that's right well i wanted to
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  correct something that caller said um i didn't get threats when i was living in chicago was
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:41.400]  after i was already in new mexico that those threats for um criticizing israel started
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:46.200]  well you know you're not supposed to criticize israel that's not it's in the it's in the
[3:18:46.200 --> 3:18:52.520]  constitution it's it's the 11th commandment that's right he says thou shalt not criticize israel
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:59.480]  because they can do no wrong you know now you know i uh i went after him pretty bad on my show well
[3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:06.040]  um last few weeks about what they've been doing in gaza you know i mean gee was it it's like it's
[3:19:06.040 --> 3:19:10.680]  like am i gonna get in trouble can i say this can i say this on the air uh you know the the
[3:19:10.680 --> 3:19:15.400]  holocaust thing was like you know never never never again we've heard that over and over and over again
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:21.400]  but i the the little asterisk was you know except we can do it to other people you know just nobody
[3:19:21.400 --> 3:19:25.960]  can do it to us and that and that goes back to obama as well i mean as part of his change which
[3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:31.400]  is not changes the policy in regard to israel and what it's doing to the palestinians has not
[3:19:31.400 --> 3:19:35.800]  changed under obama it's exactly the same yeah not one and there is no peace process and there
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:41.400]  never has been one that's right okay uh we're gonna go to break now and after a break we'll be back

[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:09.080]  federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:13.240]  it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[3:22:13.240 --> 3:22:17.720]  depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:22.360]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket
[3:22:22.360 --> 3:22:27.480]  through fdic if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:32.760]  economy a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[3:22:32.760 --> 3:22:37.720]  for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can
[3:22:37.720 --> 3:22:43.320]  cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all

[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:47.480]  happening i'll shoot nothing much man i'm a i just want to i know alex is probably listening to the
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:52.120]  show i'm a i am a subscriber and uh appreciate everything he's doing leading the movement
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:57.960]  now uh one thing i wanted to call and ask about is i don't know if you would have any knowledge
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:25:02.520]  or anything like that but uh i'd recently got a letter sent from my son's school he's in the
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:08.600]  government reeducation camps unfortunately came to afford to send him to a private school but uh
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:14.600]  he'd got a letter saying that uh they had tested him and he showed pretty high and wanted to give
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:20.840]  him a formal IQ test and fill him in some kind of gifted program now my question about that was uh
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:27.080]  is that more of uh have y'all run across anything saying that that's more of like a
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:33.720]  um a fast track toward the uh you know how they're reeducating our children and uh you know what
[3:25:33.720 --> 3:25:38.280]  i'm trying to get at well i don't i don't know specifically i do know i guess it's school district
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:42.280]  to school district really and the more the more local control you have over school district the
[3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:46.360]  the better off you're going to be there i don't say i don't have any problem myself with uh you
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:52.920]  know smarter kids being able to um you know explore their intellect in in better environment
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:57.720]  than your average your average government control center the question is is your local school
[3:25:57.720 --> 3:26:03.880]  district um you know having their strings pulled by by the federal government or are they really
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:08.040]  independent is it really an independent school district i don't think anything bad about that
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:12.200]  the kids smart you know plus if he's really smart he might be able to figure out if they're trying
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:19.640]  to con him uh thank you for the call i appreciate that i got uh gauge in florida up next gauge are
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:28.600]  you there yes there um i was looking on the north com dot mill and at the bottom of it it has
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:38.120]  avon flu now i was wondering why in the world would avon flu be on north com site if it has
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:44.680]  something to do with the cdc you know card card you have really well it's not just the cdc the
[3:26:44.680 --> 3:26:50.200]  military is involved in avian flu as well i mean they're they have contingency plans supposedly to
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:57.720]  north com has contingency plans for you know uh national emergencies related to natural disaster
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:04.200]  and outbreaks of contagious diseases so that's probably why it's there because what i'm wondering
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:09.480]  is i mean it may sound conspiracy theory but you know with all this weird stuff that's going on now
[3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:17.000]  with you know camps arising up you know from fema you know i'm wondering if this whole emergency
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:23.640]  camp thing is you know going to be something like avon flu where they're going to say oh everyone's
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:29.720]  got avon flu they need to go to the camps you know you know i'm saying well it could be a
[3:27:29.720 --> 3:27:33.800]  there could be some sort of a contrived thing but you know i don't deal in in what i don't know
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:37.480]  and and i don't i don't know i mean that you put in the category i wouldn't put it past them
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:42.280]  kurt no i wouldn't put it past to me there they have any number of contingency plans i think
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:46.200]  okay gage and florida thank you very much for the call we're trying to move quickly through here i
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:54.120]  don't want to i got ron in arizona up next ron good afternoon gentlemen um according to the bible
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:02.360]  just before the lord jesus christ returns it says there's going to be a world government a world
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:10.280]  church and a world economy and if we're living in the last days we should be seeing signs of
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:18.920]  that just as alex jones yourself and others are talking about the problem i have is if this is all
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:27.240]  true why aren't the pastors talking about the move to create a new world order i've been in church
[3:28:27.240 --> 3:28:33.720]  for over 50 years and i've only heard one pastor from the pulpit ever talk about it and i've only
[3:28:33.720 --> 3:28:41.800]  heard uh view on the radio and tv talking about it well i'll i'll try to answer that question ron
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:46.120]  thanks for the call i i'm guessing it's just because we hadn't reached enough of them yet and they've
[3:28:46.120 --> 3:28:50.600]  been propagandized too much we just need to work on the pastors that's the deal because the other
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:55.160]  side is definitely working on them tell you what uh we're not gonna take more phone calls i'm gonna
[3:28:55.160 --> 3:29:02.280]  introduce something in the next segment we've got a um a video of alex jones with a hip hop

[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:52.440]  is why the radio station don't toss me me but i'm on the microphone i stand with people like alex jones that's the crew i'm down with i've never been a
[3:33:52.440 --> 3:34:05.800]  guy no cover me i think for myself sleep for myself teach myself reach for myself hit hot you gotta do the same thing
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:13.480]  listen to me now while i wrap it safe for the new world order just put on a black face
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:25.000]  you are in the process of globalization you are in the process of a new world war
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:35.960]  just because it has a black face on your face real politics is about the people the people
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:43.240]  the people study the declaration of independence that's poetry
[3:34:44.760 --> 3:34:52.360]  like the united states constitution that's law it's law it's to me listen to the truth kicking
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:35:00.600]  into the dj group before i leave tonight i'm going to shine a light nine eleven was an inside job
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:16.120]  yeah this is this is in in in in my own words the only words i got uh first of all the conversation we
[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:21.720]  was having the other day was brilliant um i think it was very respectful of the fact
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:29.720]  of what america's feeling right now what is most important is that we don't get caught up
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:37.720]  in emotional politics as a black man in the united states i can feel the emotion
[3:35:39.800 --> 3:35:49.640]  i can feel the emotion of having a black first family in office like for instance
[3:35:51.400 --> 3:35:57.800]  barack obama when we say a black person in office we got to ease back because for the
[3:35:57.800 --> 3:36:05.720]  first time we really have an african american actually in the office to call him black is
[3:36:05.720 --> 3:36:11.720]  a disrespect to his mother and i don't think that's fair he comes from a biracial family and that
[3:36:11.720 --> 3:36:19.480]  should be respected i'm more than anybody i'm ecstatic over the fact that at least the racial
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:29.000]  barrier in the white house has been broken but now let's get down with the truth the truth after
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:35.960]  we leave the emotionalism alone for a minute what are we as americans should be looking out for how
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:44.200]  should we be getting prepared for what what's about to come just because we have an african american
[3:36:44.200 --> 3:36:53.640]  president doesn't mean that he's not going to continue the bush agenda i'm not dissing anybody
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:37:01.240]  but a politician is a politician and if i can say one thing to all people in the united states
[3:37:01.800 --> 3:37:10.040]  it's this america has broken its own rules has broken its own laws it's time for the
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:19.960]  citizenry of the united states to actually follow its own laws if we stay steadfast to the constitution
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:29.480]  at least we won't be hit so hard with that global agenda here's what we were talking about the other
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:40.120]  day if you really want to see what black governance is like take a look at the mayors of major cities
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:47.560]  when the cities were in power we couldn't be the mayors it's when the cities lost power
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:54.760]  they put in black mayors when the states had power we couldn't be governors but then when the
[3:37:54.760 --> 3:38:02.600]  states lose power we got senators governors african american senators and governors now the nation
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:12.440]  has lost power the dollar has lost power the world is global now you can get a black president
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:21.640]  because it doesn't matter it's global now so the real issue is this are you gonna allow this system
[3:38:21.640 --> 3:38:31.800]  to tempt you into their prisons into their job into their psyche follow your purpose this is what
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:40.680]  will defeat it all if you're on your purpose even death respects purpose that's why i'm here
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:47.400]  because i'm on my purpose you don't think they hear me every day you don't think they hear
[3:38:47.400 --> 3:38:52.840]  alex shones every day you don't think they just heard you don't think the fbi was out there right
[3:38:52.840 --> 3:39:02.440]  now but you know what they can't do nothing to a person who stands with the truth because i forgot
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:15.240]  who said it but i'll quote it there's a saying that says what a disadvantage it is to only be able
[3:39:15.240 --> 3:39:26.920]  to die for your country one time the concept is this don't get caught up i said it on stage
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:34.680]  they put a black face on the new world order and now we all happy k rs ain't buying it i've never
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:41.640]  been a voter this year i voted yeah why did i vote because i want to be able to critique
[3:39:41.640 --> 3:39:47.320]  that's why i voted i didn't vote for bush i didn't vote for my repudiate
[3:39:47.320 --> 3:39:53.400]  bush that's why no even if i voted for bush he still was gonna be if i didn't vote i did
[3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:58.920]  but he still was gonna be the president and this is the point this is the point if they
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:05.960]  controlled it before what are you why don't what makes you think they're not controlling it now
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:13.320]  the country was on a verge of revolution they do a black man up now we like this
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:25.080]  don't get caught up now i say this respectfully because barack obama i don't know the man
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:34.600]  i don't know his agenda but i know mine let's see if our agendas match i stand with dr king
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:40.600]  i stand with malcolm x i stand with the black panther party i don't know if my president can
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:49.240]  stand with that but if my president frees mumia avu jamal maybe he'll get my eye up if my president
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:57.240]  could release political prisoners maybe my eye will go up if my president can stop ignoring
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:04.600]  police misconduct maybe my eye will go up but i'm not hopeful and let me say this
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:11.640]  nature has a way of of perfecting itself
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:23.240]  this time if they try to assassinate the president i don't think it'll work in fact
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:29.960]  it may happen but the ones who do it will finally be exposed the concept is this
[3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:39.320]  if barack is true to the people there will be some opposition if there is opposition
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:49.320]  we the people are the ones who gonna have to fight not him the real issue is we used to say
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:59.000]  wait which side are you on which side are you on i'm not on the emotional side i'm not on
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:06.120]  this black side white so i don't know what that is i got black police officers shooting at me every
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:13.240]  day i got black senators that want to keep me in poverty i don't know what that is but i know what
[3:42:13.240 --> 3:42:19.960]  the truth is the truth come out of anybody mouth the truth don't have no color the truth is that
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:27.320]  people are hurting the truth is that they trying to turn us into china the truth is we're in so
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:37.720]  much debt that the only way out is revolution or war so now the question is what side are you on
[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:43.880]  everyone is pointing to barack right now president obama is saying you got to get the economy together
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:50.200]  you got to get the economy together when in fact the president has very little to do with the economy
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:59.880]  is the federal reserve chairman that at least sets the policy the president can appoint the president
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:05.160]  does appoint the federal reserve chairman but after that that's a privately owned company
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:14.600]  the federal reserve bank they set the agenda what you said earlier about if their plans fail
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:23.880]  they get to blame it on barack barack is like the manager of burger king all presidents are
[3:43:23.880 --> 3:43:33.000]  including bush it's like this when your fries are cold if your burger is not done right you go back
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:42.760]  to burger king america or your government and you say my burger's cold i want new fries the manager
[3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:52.680]  comes out or first you go to the cashier that's the courts you argue to the courts the courts if
[3:43:52.680 --> 3:43:59.000]  you can't get no justice with the cashier you say let me see the manager i want to go to the supreme
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:08.120]  court i want to see the president the manager comes out hi what can i do for you now the manager can
[3:44:08.120 --> 3:44:16.760]  override the decisions of the cashier but you never get to see the franchise owner of burger king
[3:44:16.760 --> 3:44:23.480]  if you really have a problem with your burger you need to go see the franchise owner and tell them
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:30.760]  the actual make of the burger coming out the factory is wrong what you're sending to all these
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:42.200]  little operations is wrong we need to go to the top or to the bottom we need to go to where the real
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:52.440]  architecture of government is and it's not in a president it's in a global scheme to make the 99
[3:44:52.440 --> 3:44:59.880]  percent work for the one percent and the 99 percent are going along with it because they're
[3:44:59.880 --> 3:45:09.800]  tempting you with everything you want in rap a rapper named ti put a record i said you can have
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:21.240]  whatever you like americans love that you can have whatever you like that's the trick learn to live
[3:45:21.240 --> 3:45:32.200]  simple they hate it learn to say i'm good you can keep it they hate it walk with god walk with law
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:41.000]  and never give up your gun don't be tempted and leave the emotion the emotionalism out of politics
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:46.360]  you know when you should get emotional when injustice happens that's when your emotions
[3:45:46.360 --> 3:45:52.360]  should rise up you saw what happened the other day at that barth station in oakland injustice
[3:45:52.360 --> 3:46:00.360]  anywhere is injustice everywhere dr martin luther king for me i feel the pain of suffering people
[3:46:00.360 --> 3:46:10.200]  i don't know it's just in me i don't want to be like the german in in nazi germany watching
[3:46:10.200 --> 3:46:17.960]  people go off in in in droves and because you have a comfortable house because you got a Mercedes
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:25.480]  Benz and you're eating every day it don't matter oh just go on when i was very little i couldn't
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:34.280]  take it my mother used to tell me about slavery and for a long time i thought i had a slave history
[3:46:34.280 --> 3:46:45.000]  i used to think i came from slavery until i realized that all of america is an immigrant
[3:46:45.000 --> 3:46:53.800]  country we are constantly being refreshed with new people constantly slavery i put it this way
[3:46:54.920 --> 3:47:00.040]  the only way slavery could have existed in this country for so long over 300 years
[3:47:00.040 --> 3:47:10.840]  is it is because people went along with it the law cannot work unless the citizens go along with
[3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:23.000]  the good or bad if the citizens stop stop adhering to their own good laws they're unprotected if the
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:32.520]  citizens stomp out or stop aligning themselves with bad laws the laws go away liberty is not granted
[3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:42.360]  it's taking freedom it can never be given to you it's in here even if somebody got you in change
[3:47:42.360 --> 3:47:48.520]  got you picking cotton in your heart in your mind if you know you're free you're looking for a way
[3:47:48.520 --> 3:47:55.000]  out even as you pick you call me whatever you like i know i'm free you can't give me freedom
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:48:02.520]  now the government can give you liberty because liberty is about walking about a society freely
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:09.080]  whoa can we shout out jordan maxwell real quick
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:19.240]  we need to become free people again not freed people i'll say it again
[3:48:20.920 --> 3:48:30.040]  we need to be free people not freed people just because we have an emancipation procrastination
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:38.200]  does not mean that we are actually free what makes you free is your declaration within that you are
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:47.240]  free if somebody else can give you freedom they can also take it away when a lot of people were
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:56.520]  not free in the united states harriet helman was free friendrick douglas was free naterna was free
[3:48:57.240 --> 3:49:04.120]  so the point of the matter is this are you free or have you been freed power looks for weakness
[3:49:04.120 --> 3:49:15.960]  power looks for weakness if you stand in firm and you say i know the law not just this law
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:26.760]  of the land or sea but i know the law i know that justice i know that nature is just and if
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:36.680]  you're unnatural out of nature imbalance yourself the real war is not me against you it's endurance
[3:49:37.720 --> 3:49:46.200]  i'm going to out endure you the evil people trip themselves up trying to chase the righteous
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:53.880]  it's when the righteous come out of a square and into their world and try to fight say no just
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:50:01.080]  resist matter of fact don't even recognize the authority when you recognize their authority
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:09.000]  got you they've been doing it to us for ages you say whatever you like about black people being
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:19.160]  over represented in prison you know i ain't with that at all but the truth is my own people are
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:27.720]  lost i said the other day dr martin luther king boulevard i just came in as a dr martin luther
[3:50:27.720 --> 3:50:36.040]  king boulevard in Harlem there's a doc where every city has a dr king boulevard if you go to the
[3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:42.040]  edges of those cities or even along the whole of the boulevard what are black people doing on
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:51.080]  dr martin luther king boulevard we're selling with selling drugs in league with killing ourselves
[3:50:51.080 --> 3:51:07.000]  on dr king boulevard lead a superior life by drinking superior life brand ionized water
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:11.960]  a couple of soft drinks each day a few slices of pizza last night's cheeseburgers these acidic

[3:56:35.640 --> 3:56:53.880]  violence the barred story i was going to say that violence in society is not caused by the people
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:57:02.600]  is caused by the neglect of leadership and the police are the number one cause of violence
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:11.320]  in society they make the people jittery they make the people insecure plus if you look up
[3:57:11.320 --> 3:57:18.040]  what a police officer is in the black's law dictionary the only thing the police are supposed
[3:57:18.040 --> 3:57:26.840]  to be doing is keeping the peace and they do not so who who's fault is it when you have violence
[3:57:26.840 --> 3:57:37.560]  in society if you're paying taxes to have peace in society and moral justice the police are supposed
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:45.400]  to be the epitome of morality our children are supposed to look at a police officer and see an
[3:57:45.400 --> 3:57:54.760]  example of what a citizen is not a theorem so if our children don't even respect the police
