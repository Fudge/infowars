[00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.739]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.519]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.280]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.860]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.401]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:17.602]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:21.663]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:30.639]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:39.542]  It is Friday the 18th of June 2010 and we're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:42.442]  Bob Chapman is out of town and will not be joining us today.
[00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.963]  That gives us more time to cover the news and take your calls.
[00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.803]  He'll be back with us next week.
[00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:52.445]  Dr. John Coleman, former member of British MI6 secret intelligence,
[00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:54.888]  Will be joining us.
[00:00:54.888 --> 00:01:15.101]  He's also an author and researcher discussing the architecture of the New World Order and where he sees them going in the next few months and years to come in their stratagem from his research and his years in British intelligence, British foreign intelligence.
[00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:21.365]  007, of course, the fictional character based on OSS spymaster Ian Fleming.
[00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:32.664]  is a MI6 officer, so he'll be able to give us a big perspective into so many facets of the New World Order.
[00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:35.326]  Part 2 of the interview we started a few weeks ago.
[00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:43.051]  He'll be joining us again live coming up in the last hour today.
[00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.312]  Where to start?
[00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.213]  I'm going to cover
[00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.645]  More than 50 news articles by the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:58.346]  I'm going to do it.
[00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:12.890]  And then we're going to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast until the last hour when John Coleman joins us.
[00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.011]  Let me just give you some of the headlines.
[00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:18.472]  We'll be detailing more when we come back in the next segment.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.801]  Daily Presidential Tracking Poll.
[00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.122]  Daily Presidential Tracking Poll.
[00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:33.004]  Rasmussen has Obama at an all-time low of 41%.
[00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.905]  Now, that is kind of a mainstream, mainline poll.
[00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.526]  Some polls have him in the low 30s.
[00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:47.549]  So, he's continuing to break his previous records of having the lowest approval rating of any president six months into their administration, one year into their administration,
[00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.221]  A year and a half into his administration.
[00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:58.983]  Showing you that the people see through this manifest fraud.
[00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:01.784]  But do they see through the fraud of the entire system?
[00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:05.125]  And how the Republicans are bought and paid for by the very same interest.
[00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:08.286]  And are playing the part of the anti-establishment well.
[00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:12.888]  Just like Obama, Barry Sitaro, did to get into power.
[00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:15.189]  Yes, they're starting to wake up to that final illusion.
[00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.159]  $7 a gallon gas.
[00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.880]  That's what a Harvard study shows.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.521]  That's what happened in Europe with the carbon tax.
[00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:29.762]  That's what's going to happen if Obama is able to implement his carbon tax.
[00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:33.522]  Meanwhile, Obama plans to sneak through carbon tax by stealth.
[00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:35.743]  That's the PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:40.144]  And the only way he's doing it by stealth is the mainstream media won't really report what's in the
[00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:43.889]  Lieberman Kerry bill.
[00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.693]  It is a version of the House bill that passed last year.
[00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:52.375]  And it does give a blank check power
[00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.594]  to the EPA to carry out their carbon taxes.
[00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:13.718]  In the middle of this emergency, the answer is, tax the American people, but don't worry the gallant little Nobel Prize winning genius that 50 days ago, Obama, 50 plus days ago, early in the oil spill, dispatched down there.
[00:04:13.718 --> 00:04:16.239]  Did the gallant little genius fix everything?
[00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.740]  Remember, Henry Kissinger's a Nobel.
[00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:23.366]  Prize winner for peace.
[00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:25.008]  What a sick joke.
[00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:26.669]  How about Israel give Hitler an award?
[00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.832]  It's about the same thing.
[00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:32.395]  Or let's give an anti-communist award to Joe Stalin posthumously.
[00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:34.985]  I mean, it's that stupid.
[00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:40.388]  Remember, Al Gore, Mr. Fraud, was given one.
[00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:43.250]  I mean, it's a disgrace to be given a Nobel Prize.
[00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:52.836]  But don't worry, all the Nobel Prize winners and all Barry Sotaro's men couldn't put their global warming, stinking fraud back together again.
[00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:53.796]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:54.517]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:56.278]  Jam-packed, key transmission.
[00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:58.820]  We're winning and losing on every front.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.522]  You may be arrested at your subject.
[00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:05.754]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:09.636]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:12.097]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.097 --> 00:05:17.799]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:24.041]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:30.403]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.403 --> 00:05:34.604]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:38.885]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:44.846]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:48.387]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.387 --> 00:05:50.368]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.368 --> 00:05:50.808]  It's here.

[00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:03.832]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:03.832 --> 00:06:09.153]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:11.194]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:16.195]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:17.376]  How much do you want?
[00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.116]  When do you want it?
[00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:20.376]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:21.457]  When will you need it?
[00:06:21.457 --> 00:06:23.657]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:23.657 --> 00:06:24.998]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:26.518]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:31.799]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:35.380]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.841]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.422]  How much will you need?
[00:06:40.422 --> 00:06:41.322]  We don't know.
[00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:42.422]  How much do you want?
[00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:43.363]  All you can get.
[00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:44.443]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:47.504]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:06.270]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.531]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:41.053]  All right, a former member, high-level member of MI6, who really trailblazed right up there with Jim Tucker and others, documenting the true power structure of the New World Order system, the Anglo-American Committee of 300, that goes back to the black nobility of Italy and the
[00:08:44.016 --> 00:08:49.960]  city-states that have really developed the modern imperial system that we live under.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.622]  He will be joining us coming up in the last hour today.
[00:08:54.622 --> 00:09:00.426]  When I open the phones up at the bottom of the hour, you're welcome to call in about any issue you want.
[00:09:00.426 --> 00:09:10.452]  The fact that the UN has already passed sanctions and is set to pass more draconian sanctions to begin boarding all naval vessels
[00:09:12.216 --> 00:09:29.840]  Bound for Iran or leaving Iran and not allowing refined gasoline to come in, not allowing metal to come in, not allowing a list of literally thousands of things to come into Iran, which is an act of war under national law, international law.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:38.942]  Congressman Ron Paul, of course, has pointed that out in several House floor speeches that we've posted at InfoWars.com and PresidentBlata.com that we've also played here on air.
[00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:39.662]  This is serious.
[00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:46.476]  Israel is openly saying they may nuke, preemptively, Iran at any time.
[00:09:46.476 --> 00:09:49.118]  Israel is also saying that they want the U.S.
[00:09:49.118 --> 00:09:51.599]  to support them in a bombardment.
[00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:56.522]  And the word from Bilderberg Group is that they are now green-lighting an attack on Iran.
[00:09:56.522 --> 00:09:59.903]  That is, Bilderberg has given the nod, the majority of them.
[00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:02.125]  And so that is moving into play right now.
[00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:08.909]  And other analysts we have on, like Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan, and George Bush Sr.
[00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.571]  agree it's becoming more and more green-lighted.
[00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:14.953]  Webster Tarpley, Dr. Tarpley agrees.
[00:10:14.953 --> 00:10:30.023]  Just every expert we talk to, and of course my own historical breakdown and analysis, can clearly see that war with Iran has moved from the back burner to the front burner big time.
[00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:30.483]  Big time.
[00:10:33.388 --> 00:10:36.055]  And now you have this provocation.
[00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:40.648]  While we're busy looking at the Gulf oil spill, which is very important.
[00:10:43.424 --> 00:11:04.501]  But compared to a attack on the nation of Iran, almost 70 million people, with high-tech weapon systems that haven't been under a decade plus of crippling sanctions, an attack on Iran will lead, bare minimum, to a major regional escalation and conflict in massive casualties by Shiite-backed forces attacking U.S.
[00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:07.103]  forces inside Iraq,
[00:11:08.825 --> 00:11:09.125]  U.S.
[00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:16.612]  ships being attacked in the Gulf, black ops squads being activated in the West to carry out real terror attacks.
[00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:18.173]  This is not going to be pretty.
[00:11:18.173 --> 00:11:30.325]  Russia and China saying they may weigh in, China even more so on record than Russia, weigh in with some type of counterattack or sanctions on the United States.
[00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.991]  The Iranians have said they will sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:37.812]  They will block it.
[00:11:37.812 --> 00:11:42.193]  It would take weeks to remove them if the engineer ships that the U.S.
[00:11:42.193 --> 00:11:59.738]  will send in and NATO will send in and Israel will try to send in, even if you didn't have Iranian special forces from the cliffs above firing missiles, firing artillery at them, it would take bare minimum weeks to dredge out and remove sunken barges and ships.
[00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:03.940]  Now, when they're being attacked, you can forget it being removed.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.883]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what's going to happen to oil prices if they block the Strait of Hormuz?
[00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:29.254]  Well, the conservative analysts say 6 to 7 dollar a gallon gas in the United States, an equivalent of 12 to 14 euros a gallon, as they do it in liters, over in the European Union and Britannia.
[00:12:30.976 --> 00:12:48.642]  So, Albion, UK, whatever you want to call it, the point is that this is not good, but it's good for the globalists who've stolen tens of trillions and are setting up a police state and are openly establishing a new bank of the world that we will all pay our carbon taxes to.
[00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.903]  The only way they're going to get all this rammed through is a war.
[00:12:51.903 --> 00:12:55.845]  That's what the Rand Corporation called for almost three years ago.
[00:12:57.185 --> 00:12:59.527]  I read Paul Watson's articles about it.
[00:12:59.527 --> 00:13:05.873]  It's all over the foreign, European and Chinese and Russian news, not in the news here in the United States.
[00:13:05.873 --> 00:13:09.155]  Game on, ladies and gentlemen, for an attack.
[00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:13.759]  So what else is going on that is a distraction?
[00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:17.281]  What is the oil spill really serving for?
[00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:25.267]  Well, it's serving as a crisis to get the government takeover of our existing energy systems.
[00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:27.389]  The globalists have already shut off our industry.
[00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.590]  They've already raised our taxes.
[00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.632]  They've already bankrupt the states.
[00:13:30.632 --> 00:13:35.516]  All part of the stated Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, private Federal Reserve plan.
[00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:38.498]  We're going into indentured servitude.
[00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:40.220]  We're going into economic bondage.
[00:13:41.727 --> 00:13:45.588]  They've already destroyed us economically with NAFTA and GATT and globalism.
[00:13:45.588 --> 00:13:48.569]  And so now they've already seized the automakers.
[00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:59.151]  They've already are moving in with federal zoning, federal land grabs, federal takeover of communications, and the internet is all over the news being announced as if it's no big deal.
[00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:00.792]  So all of this is happening.
[00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:04.032]  You've got Obama set and telling the U.S.
[00:14:04.032 --> 00:14:05.913]  Ambassador to accept the U.N.
[00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:17.487]  Ratification, and he's saying he'll implement it through the bureaucracy, through the Justice Department, even if the Senate won't ratify it officially, for a total small arms ban worldwide, including the U.S.
[00:14:17.487 --> 00:14:18.728]  That is openly going on.
[00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:23.164]  We have the Bogoyevich trial with a gag order.
[00:14:23.164 --> 00:14:31.708]  They're moving for a gag order to block him because he came out two days ago and said, look, these payoffs lead back to Obama and Rahm Emanuel and Axelrod.
[00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:32.709]  I'm being set up.
[00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:35.990]  This is standard operating procedure in Chicago.
[00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.592]  And we know Obama gets his houses paid for.
[00:14:38.592 --> 00:14:42.273]  Rahm Emanuel gets them paid for by Goldman Sachs BP on record.
[00:14:42.273 --> 00:14:43.854]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:14:43.854 --> 00:14:45.835]  So this oil thing's a distraction from that.
[00:14:49.383 --> 00:14:52.906]  It's a distraction from the economic meltdown, the joblessness.
[00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:55.709]  It's a distraction from Obama's falling approval ratings.
[00:14:55.709 --> 00:15:02.715]  It's a distraction for all the other legislation happening, or how the big banks have gotten legislation through to actually shut down their competition.
[00:15:02.715 --> 00:15:05.617]  Now they're gobbling up banks everywhere, or how the U.S.
[00:15:05.617 --> 00:15:08.140]  is on the verge of losing its credit rating.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:15.746]  So I've got Steve Watson and Paul Watson in consultation with myself, writing a big article coming out in the next hour and a half at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:30.493]  And the headline hasn't been written yet, but it'll be something like... The 10 things, the 10 big things the BP oil spill is distracting the people from.
[00:15:30.493 --> 00:15:34.276]  Or the 10 things the BP oil spill is being used to distract the public from.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.206]  Remember how right after 9-11 all sorts of tyrannical things got put in place while we weren't watching?
[00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:44.109]  Well, I was watching, many of you were watching, but the general public wasn't.
[00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.430]  This is a big deal!
[00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:51.277]  Now, separately, I want to take your calls, not just on the 10 or 15 or 20.
[00:15:51.277 --> 00:15:53.500]  What do you see this serving as a distraction from?
[00:15:56.547 --> 00:16:02.068]  The fact that they're on the verge of passing legislation that expands on the Enemy Combatant Act, that already allows them to grab U.S.
[00:16:02.068 --> 00:16:05.269]  citizens and say, take them away secretly into a torture dungeon.
[00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:15.172]  They've actually got legislation that's passed the House and the Senate to allow open torture of citizens, open secret arrests, and only an act of Congress can find out even where you are.
[00:16:15.172 --> 00:16:18.653]  I mean, this is bona fide hardcore tyranny.
[00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:25.713]  But not only are there all these distractions, I mean, I say ten, there's a lot more than ten.
[00:16:25.713 --> 00:16:31.257]  Their whole agenda is being crammed, rammed down right now.
[00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:35.761]  Oh yeah, the Gulf Oil Spill's bad, but what about trillions in taxes they want you to pay?
[00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.684]  What about all the new taxes the feds are levying?
[00:16:38.684 --> 00:16:42.367]  What about the fact that healthcare was political suicide for the elite?
[00:16:43.424 --> 00:16:47.926]  But they don't care, because they know they've got a war they're brewing, and oil spill distractions.
[00:16:47.926 --> 00:16:57.509]  What about the fact that the TARP was really a swindle to all of the criminal insiders that put Barry Sitaro, aka Barack Obama, into power?
[00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:59.830]  Everything is moving right now!
[00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.931]  They're going for broke!
[00:17:03.931 --> 00:17:10.354]  Ahead of this election coming up, they know in every election, incumbents,
[00:17:11.923 --> 00:17:19.986]  Whether they're Republican or Democrat, in all the off-year elections we've had this year and last year, every incumbent's been thrown out.
[00:17:19.986 --> 00:17:24.068]  This is a total political realignment and the system knows it.
[00:17:25.987 --> 00:17:28.009]  So yes, the oil spill is dangerous.
[00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:29.250]  The oil spill is serious.
[00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.811]  It's economically destructive.
[00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:44.402]  And it's more destructive, you know, there's a big ABC News headline last night, and it's all over the news, that the Coast Guard pulled up to private fishermen in their own boats, scooping up the oil under the direction of the local counties, and taking it to oil tanks.
[00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:53.205]  And the government pulled up, the Coast Guard pulled up and said, you've got to have special permits for your, you've got to be Coast Guard registered to be out here.
[00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:56.526]  Doesn't matter if you've got life preservers.
[00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:57.986]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:57.986 --> 00:18:00.307]  We've got to have the history of these ships.
[00:18:00.307 --> 00:18:01.987]  They've got to be certified by us.
[00:18:01.987 --> 00:18:08.269]  This is big city machine union politics, union tyranny, mafia tyranny.
[00:18:08.269 --> 00:18:11.530]  You know, the feds are the big union bosses.
[00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.670]  For the big banks.
[00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.431]  You don't wipe your nose.
[00:18:15.431 --> 00:18:17.272]  You don't wipe your hind end.
[00:18:17.272 --> 00:18:18.772]  You don't sneeze.
[00:18:18.772 --> 00:18:20.233]  You don't plant a tree.
[00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.793]  You don't build a barn.
[00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:23.814]  You don't have a school.
[00:18:23.814 --> 00:18:25.774]  You don't have a gas station.
[00:18:25.774 --> 00:18:29.356]  You don't have a store without jumping through a hundred hoops.
[00:18:29.356 --> 00:18:32.737]  We're here to shut things down and everything goes through us.
[00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.217]  We're here to shake your grocery store down.
[00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:38.398]  Anything you see the mafia doing the last hundred years, that's government.
[00:18:38.398 --> 00:18:39.919]  It is a mafia government.
[00:18:42.182 --> 00:18:54.686]  I was reading this morning, I mean, I already knew it, but George Soros owns a large portion of the big state run, because it's got all these private kingpins that are part of it, but it's state run in Brazil.
[00:18:54.686 --> 00:18:56.067]  Brazil's drilling all over the Gulf.
[00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:59.488]  They had a big spill three years ago off the coast of Mexico, much bigger than what you see now.
[00:18:59.488 --> 00:19:01.048]  Not in the news.
[00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:10.952]  See, George Soros, who controls the Obama White House, whose minions were the head of the transition team, this is all over the news today.
[00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:14.153]  Thank God it's actually being pointed out.
[00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.194]  They control America.
[00:19:15.194 --> 00:19:23.579]  So see, if they can shut off America drilling, well then, Al Gore owns Occidental Petroleum, based in South America.
[00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.100]  He's able to drill.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.223]  George Soros, owning big oil companies, he's able to drill.
[00:19:30.223 --> 00:19:32.604]  You understand that the Dutch are able to drill.
[00:19:34.232 --> 00:19:36.974]  It's only America that can't have those jobs.
[00:19:36.974 --> 00:19:38.616]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:19:38.616 --> 00:19:42.039]  It's about the religion of worshipping government and licking boots.
[00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:46.483]  And before you can do anything, you've got to have a home inspection or a CPS inspection.
[00:19:46.483 --> 00:19:51.307]  So the Coast Guard pulls up and says, look, you're not going to clean any stinking oil up.
[00:19:51.307 --> 00:19:52.548]  We got orders from Obama.
[00:19:52.548 --> 00:19:54.069]  We got a carbon tax to pass.
[00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:56.011]  We got some taxes for you.
[00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:59.314]  They're going to be paid to BP that owns one of the big carbon trading companies.
[00:20:01.354 --> 00:20:01.695]  Fact.
[00:20:01.695 --> 00:20:03.277]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:03.277 --> 00:20:05.400]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.920]  Fact.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.625]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:10.246]  Fact.
[00:20:10.246 --> 00:20:15.753]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.753 --> 00:20:16.034]  Fact.
[00:20:16.354 --> 00:20:20.558]  One in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.558 --> 00:20:25.122]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:13.016]  And now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:13.016 --> 00:21:14.076]  Viruses.
[00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:19.797]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.797 --> 00:21:21.998]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.998 --> 00:21:22.758]  Surrender.
[00:21:22.758 --> 00:21:26.559]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.

[00:22:00.663 --> 00:22:03.485]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:08.989]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:12.051]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:22:12.051 --> 00:22:15.273]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[00:22:15.273 --> 00:22:18.775]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[00:22:18.775 --> 00:22:27.001]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:29.803]  And it will protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[00:22:30.023 --> 00:22:34.385]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:22:34.385 --> 00:22:39.928]  Call me today, Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237 at extension 108.

[00:22:50.794 --> 00:22:53.815]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:55.296]  Call Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237 extension 108.

[00:23:10.183 --> 00:23:11.523]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:14.444]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:14.444 --> 00:23:18.405]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:22.547]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:22.547 --> 00:23:23.387]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:23.387 --> 00:23:25.848]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:33.736]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:33.736 --> 00:23:37.580]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.123]  Learn more at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5355.
[00:23:42.125 --> 00:23:42.305]  Thank you.
[00:24:05.365 --> 00:24:17.845]  So, we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the broadcast on this Open Line Friday, but I would ask listeners, you can go into whatever topic you want, but first give me your take on what is this oil spill distracting us from?
[00:24:17.845 --> 00:24:19.568]  I mean, the media is hyping it.
[00:24:20.472 --> 00:24:24.916]  They've ignored all these other oil spills, many of which have been bigger than this one.
[00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:30.660]  Yes, if you go and look at the biggest oil spills in history, this is only in the top five now.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.322]  It's got a long way to go.
[00:24:32.322 --> 00:24:33.343]  It is horrible.
[00:24:33.343 --> 00:24:36.525]  But there's another level of deception.
[00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:49.076]  It is true that for more than 50 days, I have seen local news articles with BP thugs, the Coast Guard, the local police under their orders, completely outside their jurisdiction,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.983]  I mean, you know, the feds can't come on the beaches over a three-state area and say, you can't be here.
[00:24:54.983 --> 00:24:57.244]  And private security guards can't do it.
[00:24:57.244 --> 00:24:59.826]  And say, no videotaping!
[00:24:59.826 --> 00:25:16.696]  And I'm getting calls, I'm getting hundreds of emails, I'm hearing it all over talk radio, that in Louisiana, in Mississippi, in areas of Florida, that people walk outside even five miles from the beach and all they smell is kerosene, oil slick smell, that people are getting sick!
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.321]  And so I would like to hear your eyewitness testimony specifically.
[00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:27.682]  Have you been told by the military and police and BP goons to get off the beach?
[00:25:27.682 --> 00:25:28.722]  Are you getting sick?
[00:25:28.722 --> 00:25:30.463]  Are people you know getting sick?
[00:25:30.463 --> 00:25:31.483]  Toll free number 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:31.483 --> 00:25:33.904]  And I will intersperse news throughout the broadcast today.
[00:25:33.904 --> 00:25:33.984]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:33.984 --> 00:25:36.304]  Because yes, this is a tragedy and a disaster.
[00:25:44.286 --> 00:25:45.647]  It's like 9-11 was.
[00:25:45.647 --> 00:25:50.330]  But separately, we have to look at what's happening while we're diverted.
[00:25:50.330 --> 00:26:03.358]  While we're watching the magician's lovely assistant, you know, who's wearing a bikini, he's doing the sleight of hand and getting his next trick ready.
[00:26:03.358 --> 00:26:09.081]  So, daily presidential tracking poll, Rasmussen, he's now down to 41%.
[00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:11.523]  Under the carbon tax, Harvard study says $7 a gallon gas.
[00:26:13.775 --> 00:26:17.898]  Oh yeah, Kerry Lieberman's new bill is unbelievable, folks.
[00:26:17.898 --> 00:26:21.602]  Obama plans to sneak through carbon tax by stealth.
[00:26:21.602 --> 00:26:25.945]  Kerry Lieberman not worried cap-and-trade bill will hurt Democrats.
[00:26:25.945 --> 00:26:28.567]  This out of Cyber News Service.
[00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:30.149]  And they gave a press conference yesterday.
[00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:41.416]  Hayward, the CEO of BP, estimates, get ready for this, that the reservoir that they've tapped has two billion gallons of oil in it.
[00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:53.342]  That could be conservative, by the way, or it could be less, but normally a gusher this size, they're saying two billion gallons.
[00:26:53.342 --> 00:27:00.005]  Two billion gallons that could be drained into the Gulf of Magico to then be sucked out into the Atlantic
[00:27:01.693 --> 00:27:02.653]  Amazing.
[00:27:02.653 --> 00:27:03.574]  Continuing.
[00:27:03.574 --> 00:27:07.455]  BP oil spill against Governor Jindal's wishes.
[00:27:07.455 --> 00:27:14.678]  Well, I mean, the Feds claim they control the seashores.
[00:27:14.678 --> 00:27:27.302]  Well, yeah, international commerce coming in, that is a federal prerogative, but what business does the Coast Guard have following Barry Sitaro, the Indonesian citizen's orders to
[00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:35.613]  To block people just a few hundred yards offshore, or even in estuaries.
[00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:36.913]  They're coming into estuaries.
[00:27:36.913 --> 00:27:40.495]  This is not new news, this is just happening again.
[00:27:40.495 --> 00:27:44.857]  This Coast Guard is besmirching its history, its record, everything.
[00:27:44.857 --> 00:27:46.057]  This is disgusting.
[00:27:46.057 --> 00:27:48.819]  Those men should not follow those orders!
[00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:49.839]  This is treason!
[00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:54.301]  Just like Germans shouldn't have followed Hitler's orders!
[00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:57.442]  If something's an unlawful or immoral order, it's illegal.
[00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:58.263]  Do you understand that?
[00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:04.021]  At one time that was taught to the military.
[00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:08.344]  BP oil spill, but that was before the dark time, before the end of the republic.
[00:28:08.344 --> 00:28:13.909]  BP oil spill against Governor Jindal's wishes, crude sucking barges stopped by Coast Guard.
[00:28:14.983 --> 00:28:16.344]  And it happens over and over again.
[00:28:16.344 --> 00:28:26.788]  There have been state vessels out there under state command trying just 50 yards offshore, right there where the rivers come in, trying to protect those estuaries where a lot of the fishing gets done.
[00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:31.270]  And they came in day one and said, oh, we want you to count the booms now.
[00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:37.373]  And now the White House says, don't worry, Obama's dispatching some more Harvard lawyers.
[00:28:37.373 --> 00:28:41.575]  Oh, and a Nobel Prize winner's been down there for 50 plus days.
[00:28:41.575 --> 00:28:42.876]  A Nobel Prize winner!
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.623]  What does that mean, that they're a communist who hates America?
[00:28:47.623 --> 00:28:53.747]  I mean, literally, a Nobel Prize is like being caught involved in child molestation now.
[00:28:53.747 --> 00:29:07.776]  Having a Nobel Prize, giving it to all these globalists, all these anti-American New World Order people, Henry Kissinger, Al Gore, it's like getting syphilis or something.
[00:29:07.776 --> 00:29:11.698]  It's like, oh my gosh, someone with syphilis is down at the Gulf!
[00:29:11.698 --> 00:29:12.179]  Oh, yay!
[00:29:14.744 --> 00:29:18.225]  Someone with syphilis is being dispatched to the Gulf!
[00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:20.806]  Hey, did you hear they're sending a child molester to the Gulf?
[00:29:20.806 --> 00:29:21.446]  Wow!
[00:29:21.446 --> 00:29:22.707]  Man, great!
[00:29:22.707 --> 00:29:23.987]  All our problems are solved.
[00:29:23.987 --> 00:29:31.170]  I'm sorry, I'm gonna... Let's crank through some more news, headlines when we come back and then go to your calls.
[00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:31.670]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:36.912]  But it's all about how the government... Don't worry, we've got some more Harvard scam artists.
[00:29:37.472 --> 00:29:39.193]  We've got some more Princeton people.
[00:29:39.193 --> 00:29:42.974]  Yeah, they're the smart guys that set up the derivatives and are scamming everyone.
[00:29:42.974 --> 00:29:43.834]  Don't worry.
[00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:46.095]  They're like gods up on Mount Olympus.
[00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:47.575]  They've been sent down there.
[00:29:47.575 --> 00:29:50.976]  Everything's gonna be solved right away, huh?
[00:29:50.976 --> 00:29:52.376]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.376 --> 00:29:54.897]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:02.266]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:32:02.266 --> 00:32:04.589]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:07.812]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:07.812 --> 00:32:12.917]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:12.917 --> 00:32:17.101]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:19.765]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:19.765 --> 00:32:22.649]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.573]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:25.573 --> 00:32:33.165]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:33.502 --> 00:32:38.765]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:38.765 --> 00:32:41.207]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:41.207 --> 00:32:45.429]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:46.510]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.851]  You're everyone else.

[00:33:04.924 --> 00:33:19.429]  You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, but I got wise.
[00:33:19.429 --> 00:33:25.311]  You're the devil in disguise, oh yes you are, devil in disguise.
[00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:29.547]  This New World Order isn't in disguise.
[00:33:29.547 --> 00:33:30.968]  They're right out in the open.
[00:33:30.968 --> 00:33:33.188]  I got an email this morning.
[00:33:33.188 --> 00:33:47.571]  We had a petroleum engineer call in and say that, and many other people have pointed this out, that the webcam of the supposed Gulf oil leak, that it looks like the oil is slowly coming out.
[00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:55.632]  It's not really blasting out of that bloody hole in the Gulf that's causing so much death and destruction and economic turmoil.
[00:33:57.196 --> 00:33:57.396]  Thank you.
[00:34:16.457 --> 00:34:27.405]  But he asked me, he said in an email, Dear Alex, yesterday I was on your radio program and we talked about the oil pressure that is not present in the oil well that is shown on British Petroleum's website.
[00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:29.166]  It appears that you cut me out of the program.
[00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:30.447]  Did you censor it?
[00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:35.931]  I would sure like you to explain why the repeat programs do not have me on it.
[00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:39.654]  And I am referring to the part of the program that Lindsey Williams was on.
[00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:43.182]  And that's from Dave.
[00:34:43.182 --> 00:34:44.783]  Won't give his last name.
[00:34:44.783 --> 00:34:53.429]  Dave, we only have four hours programmed in with radio ads that are on the satellite that AM and FM stations can pick up.
[00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.090]  Okay?
[00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.352]  When I go into overdrive, it is internet only.
[00:34:58.352 --> 00:35:09.500]  And so, when you're listening to the InfoWars.com audio streams that are live from 11am to 3pm Central, 12 noon to 4pm Eastern, you are
[00:35:10.799 --> 00:35:13.741]  You are listening to what's sent out on the satellite.
[00:35:13.741 --> 00:35:20.405]  And Ted Anderson at Genesis Communications has a Starguide satellite leased.
[00:35:20.405 --> 00:35:24.467]  He has one for the rest of his network, and then he has one just for this broadcast.
[00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:34.996]  Because so many stations want it, and some stations can tape it and then re-air it, but sometimes they're taping another program while they're taping this program, and it causes a problem.
[00:35:34.996 --> 00:35:38.580]  So Ted, about two years ago, did a station request.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:44.565]  He puts my show up 24 hours a day on Starguide for stations to grab it at their leisure.
[00:35:44.565 --> 00:35:47.708]  We have our own channel, okay?
[00:35:47.708 --> 00:35:52.112]  And so the internet feed you hear is the feed that we're sending to that satellite.
[00:35:53.197 --> 00:36:03.641]  Okay, so that's why when the show ends every day, you hear four hours of it concurrently played back-to-back until I'm live 20 hours later.
[00:36:03.641 --> 00:36:04.922]  Okay?
[00:36:04.922 --> 00:36:10.244]  And so when I do do overdrive, normally about once a month, I've been doing it a lot more lately because so much is happening.
[00:36:10.244 --> 00:36:12.285]  I did over an hour of overdrive last week.
[00:36:12.285 --> 00:36:15.566]  I did 50 plus minutes of overdrive yesterday.
[00:36:15.566 --> 00:36:21.148]  You will not hear that when the show starts replaying, when we end the overdrive.
[00:36:21.148 --> 00:36:21.849]  You will hear
[00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:28.451]  The concurrent four hours, because that's already still playing in the background for stations that want it.
[00:36:28.451 --> 00:36:30.273]  That's what's going on over the satellite.
[00:36:30.273 --> 00:36:32.114]  So it's not a conspiracy.
[00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:39.380]  Overdrive is only heard by the InternetInfoWars.com stream listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.543]  It is then archived to the podcast.
[00:36:42.543 --> 00:36:46.846]  We got another complaint this morning saying, my podcast is usually this size.
[00:36:46.846 --> 00:36:48.248]  Today it's bigger.
[00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:49.288]  Why are you doing this?
[00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:52.771]  Well, because it was 50-something minutes longer.
[00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:55.253]  It's larger.
[00:36:55.253 --> 00:36:58.916]  And I'm burning time on something that really doesn't matter.
[00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:02.059]  Not with Dave, I'm sure he's a smart guy, but this will now be a new conspiracy.
[00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:17.932]  In fact, I've already seen the conspiracy that Overdrive is censored or that Overdrive is secret and that people will take things from Overdrive broadcast and say, this was secretly behind the scenes with George Humphrey or Tex Mars or someone, or this is secret behind the scenes with Ron Paul.
[00:37:17.932 --> 00:37:19.053]  No, it's not secret.
[00:37:19.813 --> 00:37:25.495]  Stations and the satellites are not programmed to be able, it's all automated, to be able to pick it up.
[00:37:25.495 --> 00:37:28.396]  You notice there's no ads during overdrive.
[00:37:28.396 --> 00:37:33.138]  Maybe I'll just stop overdrive, it's too confusing for people.
[00:37:33.138 --> 00:37:34.038]  Okay, I admit it, I'm evil.
[00:37:34.038 --> 00:37:35.678]  I censored it all.
[00:37:35.678 --> 00:37:36.639]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:39.900]  Folks, it's all up on the podcast.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:48.923]  You can go to InfoWars.com, up at the top, it says Home, Alex Jones Radio Show, News, Sections, Multimedia, Prison Planet Forum, Shop,
[00:37:50.178 --> 00:37:51.718]  Admin.
[00:37:51.718 --> 00:37:53.319]  It's got a bunch of links there.

[00:38:14.983 --> 00:38:18.704]  We have a link up there to a Android free app.
[00:38:20.376 --> 00:38:22.478]  Or at least somebody sent us a free one we just found on the web.
[00:38:22.478 --> 00:38:23.299]  I don't know if that's up there.
[00:38:23.299 --> 00:38:24.000]  Let's double-check that.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.341]  I forgot that from two weeks ago.
[00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:29.626]  It's all up there on the Alex Jones Radio Show tab.
[00:38:29.626 --> 00:38:33.150]  Now, again, people don't really tune in to hear a five-minute rant about this.
[00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:38.095]  It's just... Everything is not a conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:38.095 --> 00:38:40.118]  Everything is not a conspiracy, okay?
[00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:53.836]  But if you go to the Alex Jones Radio Show there, you can subscribe to the free podcast to your computer, your MP3, your iPad, your iPhone, to whatever MP3 player you've got, however you want.

[00:39:02.779 --> 00:39:04.799]  It's not the best audio, but it's decent.
[00:39:04.799 --> 00:39:07.800]  We've got a 64 for presentplanet.tv members.
[00:39:09.372 --> 00:39:16.117]  Just serving out 250,000 people a day on the free podcast cost me now about $7,000 a month.
[00:39:16.117 --> 00:39:21.020]  That's with cheap bandwidth, because we're serving it out to millions and millions and millions and millions.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:29.206]  I don't know, what's roughly, we do shows six days a week, so let's say 25 shows a month, served out to 250,000 people conservatively.
[00:39:29.206 --> 00:39:32.629]  You know, it's costing me a lot of money to give that out free, so it's 32-bit.
[00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:34.650]  I can't pay $12,000, $14,000 for the free podcast.
[00:39:37.945 --> 00:39:57.646]  uh... to serve it on a higher audio quality uh... but for prison planet dot tv members because you do financially support us you get a sixty two bit commercial free you get the video archive and you get the video archive overdrive uh... you get all my films my book paul watson's book they're both out of print paul watson starting next week to be doing uh...

[00:40:03.351 --> 00:40:06.113]  I'm going to get Kurt Nemo to start doing his own reports every week.
[00:40:06.113 --> 00:40:07.254]  Steve Watson's going to start.
[00:40:07.254 --> 00:40:11.537]  We're sending him cameras this week and the setups and the code to get in.
[00:40:11.537 --> 00:40:13.459]  I'm going to get Burmess on there doing a weekly report.
[00:40:13.459 --> 00:40:17.662]  I haven't called him yet to tell him I want him to do that, but I know he wants to do some more work with us.
[00:40:17.662 --> 00:40:19.804]  He was homesick, though, when we went back to New York.
[00:40:19.804 --> 00:40:20.484]  He always does that.
[00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:22.186]  He made another film with us two years ago.
[00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:23.767]  Invisible Empire was his latest.
[00:40:23.767 --> 00:40:24.588]  He made Fabled Enemies.
[00:40:25.388 --> 00:40:28.331]  And, uh, went back, uh, he was there for six months making that.
[00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:30.072]  Visible Empire took a year and a half.
[00:40:30.072 --> 00:40:33.255]  But the point is that we're trying to give you more.
[00:40:33.255 --> 00:40:46.908]  And yes, I'm going to start very soon a TV show at least once a week just for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that we're going to then develop for mainline television, uh, that's going to be more highly produced than the radio show with guests and other things just for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:40:46.908 --> 00:40:49.510]  So I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.471]  It's 15 cents a day.
[00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:59.999]  $5.95 a month, and your membership makes so much of what we do here possible, plus you get everything in higher quality.
[00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:02.160]  The films, you name it.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.801]  And you can also share your passcode with six people.
[00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:11.162]  Six people can be logged in simultaneously with the same username passcode.
[00:41:11.162 --> 00:41:13.723]  Now, tell them not to share it with anybody else.
[00:41:13.723 --> 00:41:17.524]  I wish I could give it to everybody free, but I can't afford it.
[00:41:17.524 --> 00:41:18.624]  I've got over a $400,000 a year IT bill.
[00:41:23.528 --> 00:41:38.551]  Believe me, I wish we had some rich benefactor that said, you know, here's two million dollars to run your operation a year, that's what it cost, or more, and then I would literally, we could be commercial free for you, but just have the network commercials, because that's how radio is formatted.
[00:41:38.551 --> 00:41:41.552]  But that's not the way the cookie crumbles.
[00:41:41.552 --> 00:41:43.472]  Alright, I'm going to blitz through news.
[00:41:43.472 --> 00:41:46.213]  I get so wound up, I start ranting off into rabbit trails.
[00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:52.863]  I am 100% committed to at least read these headlines and I'm going to your calls, okay?
[00:41:52.863 --> 00:41:55.263]  I'm 100% committed to read these headlines.
[00:41:55.263 --> 00:41:58.404]  Look at this, Greenspan says US may soon reach borrowing limit.
[00:41:58.404 --> 00:42:02.064]  Bloomberg, we'll be bankrupt like Nigeria and Argentina.
[00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:03.125]  Mission complete.
[00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:06.205]  They've almost bankrupted us completely to them.
[00:42:06.205 --> 00:42:11.506]  And of course they get the whole world on a fiat Ponzi scheme, Ken Lay fraud.
[00:42:11.506 --> 00:42:16.047]  Remember it was Ken Lay who came up with BP 15 years ago in 1995 on record.
[00:42:18.933 --> 00:42:21.335]  This is Wall Street Journal AP.
[00:42:21.335 --> 00:42:32.125]  It was BP and Goldman Sachs, but under the leadership of Ken Lay and Enron with Albert Gore.
[00:42:33.852 --> 00:42:39.557]  Albert Gore, meetings with him over and over again, and Eric Clinton, who are giving you the carbon tax.
[00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:45.401]  You will pay money to BP, to Al Gore, to Goldman Sachs, who, of course, owns BP.
[00:42:45.401 --> 00:42:46.742]  That now has come out.
[00:42:46.742 --> 00:42:48.964]  It's always Goldman Sachs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:48.964 --> 00:42:50.666]  It doesn't matter what third world country it is.
[00:42:50.666 --> 00:42:51.286]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:51.286 --> 00:42:59.372]  You'll see some African country where they just had an election stolen, and you'll look it up, it's the former head of the World Bank as the new African president of the country.
[00:42:59.372 --> 00:43:00.934]  I mean, it just never ends.
[00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:09.873]  Goldman Sachs, BP, Al Gore, the UN, oil for food scams.
[00:43:09.873 --> 00:43:18.538]  It's always the same group of criminal bank robbing, money laundering, narcotics trafficking trash.
[00:43:18.538 --> 00:43:23.420]  All these groups have been caught tied to narcotics trafficking and big banks that launder narcotics money.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.883]  They run the international snuff film operations, the big megacorps do.
[00:43:27.883 --> 00:43:29.443]  They run the snuff films.
[00:43:29.443 --> 00:43:31.044]  They run the child kidnapping.
[00:43:31.044 --> 00:43:32.585]  They run the slave labor operations.
[00:43:32.785 --> 00:43:35.107]  That's in Senate hearings, congressional hearings.
[00:43:35.107 --> 00:43:36.709]  They run everything!
[00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:48.380]  And they're gonna take your farm and your ranch, and they're gonna take your property, and they've turned the public schools into prisons, and they're turning your kids against you right now, and the sky's the limit, and they got all the psych warfare chiefs, and of course they blew that oil.
[00:43:49.361 --> 00:44:01.564]  Well, then of course they're blocking the recovery and the emergency mitigation programs, and of course they're blocking people from sucking up the oil, and they're not going to stop because the sky's the limit.
[00:44:01.564 --> 00:44:11.946]  As Thomas Jefferson said, the limit of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you put up with.
[00:44:11.946 --> 00:44:18.508]  But before I go any further, we do... Look, I want to... I've got to have a money bomb in the next few months to finish the studio.
[00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:26.980]  I've got to go shoot a tour of the studio and show you what we built.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:31.086]  City held us up six months just getting permits, but all that happened.
[00:44:31.086 --> 00:44:33.329]  A lot of other things went on, but we got it done.
[00:44:33.329 --> 00:44:38.936]  Now we're trying to buy the equipment, build the studio, decide the set, the green screen room, all of it.
[00:44:40.394 --> 00:44:51.282]  But if you want to financially support us, plus get materials that will wake people up, people are ready to be awakened, the books, the videos, the DVDs, the films, the materials, InfoWars.com, the online video bookstore, shopping carts.
[00:44:51.282 --> 00:44:53.764]  We've got two different shopping carts to choose from.
[00:44:53.764 --> 00:45:09.177]  You can go check out the same specials and combos on both sites, InfoWars.com, or you can call toll-free to get books and videos like Fall of the Republic, The Presidency of Barack H. Obama,
[00:45:10.421 --> 00:45:16.385]  Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the United States economy.
[00:45:16.385 --> 00:45:22.930]  By design, leaders are now declaring that the world government has arrived and the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:26.293]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:45:26.293 --> 00:45:31.016]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:45:31.016 --> 00:45:33.178]  President to chair the world body.
[00:45:33.178 --> 00:45:35.599]  A scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.401]  And laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[00:45:39.401 --> 00:45:43.902]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[00:45:43.902 --> 00:45:45.602]  And it goes on from there.
[00:45:45.602 --> 00:45:47.263]  Such an essential film.
[00:45:47.263 --> 00:45:50.003]  Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, our newest film.
[00:45:50.003 --> 00:45:53.124]  Such an essential film for everyone to see.
[00:45:53.124 --> 00:45:54.565]  A New World Order on trial.
[00:45:54.565 --> 00:45:57.225]  Worldwide tyranny isn't coming, it's here.
[00:45:57.225 --> 00:45:59.766]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:46:01.189 --> 00:46:04.550]  They want you dead for the new world order and world government is just the beginning.
[00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.011]  Camp FEMA.
[00:46:06.011 --> 00:46:07.011]  Don't tread on me.
[00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:08.291]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:10.172]  A way to take the states back.
[00:46:10.172 --> 00:46:12.433]  A positive, solution-filled film.
[00:46:12.433 --> 00:46:17.815]  To take back our counties with the county sheriff.
[00:46:17.815 --> 00:46:21.296]  Are we men or are we mice?
[00:46:21.296 --> 00:46:26.918]  Do we have the spirit of liberty and victory in our hearts and in our minds and burning in our eyes?
[00:46:26.918 --> 00:46:29.119]  It's up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:29.679]  It's up to you.
[00:46:30.848 --> 00:46:40.556]  Get the films, make copies of my films, get them out to everyone you know, air them on AXS TV, hand them out to people at work, give them to people at church, whatever!
[00:46:40.556 --> 00:46:42.157]  Will you save the world by yourself?
[00:46:42.157 --> 00:46:42.457]  No.
[00:46:42.457 --> 00:46:46.140]  But the spirit of liberty, the spirit of resistance is victory.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:54.206]  In that spirit, that commitment that we will win, we will defeat the globalists, we will never stop, we will bring down the New World Order.
[00:46:54.206 --> 00:46:54.967]  We don't have a choice.
[00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.952]  Alright, let me start at the beginning again, just headlines.
[00:46:58.952 --> 00:47:04.875]  Daily presidential tracking poll, Obama falls to his lowest yet, 41 points.
[00:47:04.875 --> 00:47:19.805]  $7 a gallon gas, President Obama's solution for the Gulf oil spill, $7 a gallon gas, that's Harvard University study, estimates the price per gallon of the president's global warming agenda, cap and trade.
[00:47:19.805 --> 00:47:23.087]  Continuing, Obama plans to sneak through carbon tax by stealth.
[00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:29.773]  Kerry Lieberman not worried cap-and-trade bill will hurt Democrats.
[00:47:29.773 --> 00:47:32.994]  Yeah, because the voting machines are in place.
[00:47:32.994 --> 00:47:38.677]  Hayward estimates size of Gulf oil spill at oil field at 2 billion gallons.
[00:47:38.677 --> 00:47:44.400]  That's how much oil they think is down in that hole, down in that reservoir that's been tapped now.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.981]  BP oil spill against Governor Jindal's wishes.
[00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:48.522]  Crude oil
[00:47:50.233 --> 00:47:52.393]  Barges stopped by Coast Guard.
[00:47:52.393 --> 00:47:54.014]  You've got to follow federal regulations.
[00:47:54.014 --> 00:47:56.214]  They've got to get approval for everything.
[00:47:56.214 --> 00:48:00.575]  You don't do anything in America without the Mafia Fed telling you you're allowed to.
[00:48:00.575 --> 00:48:01.935]  You understand states?
[00:48:01.935 --> 00:48:03.576]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:48:03.576 --> 00:48:12.558]  They've got all these TV programs in the Southern Poverty Law Center saying that, oh, if you're against the federal takeover, you're a terrorist racist.
[00:48:12.558 --> 00:48:14.058]  Yeah, we know who the terrorists are, buddy.
[00:48:17.438 --> 00:48:21.103]  Who died and made BP the king of the Gulf of Mexico?
[00:48:21.103 --> 00:48:24.407]  That's a question myself and many others want to know.
[00:48:24.407 --> 00:48:24.848]  Here's another one.
[00:48:24.848 --> 00:48:28.252]  BP tells cleanup workers they'll be fired if they wear respirators.
[00:48:28.252 --> 00:48:31.096]  You can't even wear a basic cotton surgical mask.
[00:48:32.318 --> 00:48:34.600]  Because that's not good for PR.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:51.457]  Because then, the cover-up that all these toxic fumes are hitting the Gulf will come out, then there'll be all those liability claims, just like all the police and firemen and medical workers and emergency crew people and construction people, demolition crews, that breathed all that asbestos and concrete and mercury and other things.
[00:48:52.017 --> 00:48:59.160]  And then they went into all the major university medical centers and their lungs were just filled with plaques of deadly chemicals.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.821]  And over 5,000 have now died.
[00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:03.482]  Just a year and a half ago, it was 3,000.
[00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:10.826]  And all the police dogs died within four years from cancer of their nasal passages, of their sinus.
[00:49:10.826 --> 00:49:12.166]  And what'd the government say?
[00:49:12.166 --> 00:49:12.787]  There's nothing wrong.
[00:49:12.787 --> 00:49:14.067]  There's no toxic waste.
[00:49:14.067 --> 00:49:14.928]  Go home and die.
[00:49:14.928 --> 00:49:17.629]  You're not getting any treatment.
[00:49:17.629 --> 00:49:19.029]  We're the government.
[00:49:19.029 --> 00:49:19.790]  You're scum!
[00:49:21.681 --> 00:49:23.142]  It was a little gift by the U.S.
[00:49:23.142 --> 00:49:25.183]  government, by Harry Truman to the Russians.
[00:49:25.183 --> 00:49:26.664]  Oh, you want 21,000 U.S.
[00:49:26.664 --> 00:49:28.646]  troops found in German camps?
[00:49:28.646 --> 00:49:28.906]  U.S.
[00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:30.207]  prisoners of war?
[00:49:30.207 --> 00:49:34.270]  You want 21,000 to interrogate and figure slave camps?
[00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.851]  Stalin, we love you.
[00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:37.272]  Have a French kiss.
[00:49:37.272 --> 00:49:38.793]  You want our troops for slaves?
[00:49:38.793 --> 00:49:40.594]  We hate them as much as you do.
[00:49:40.594 --> 00:49:43.316]  We'll show you how evil we are to freak you out, Stalin.
[00:49:43.316 --> 00:49:50.781]  We just dropped A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to show everybody how tough we are, even though the Japanese had unconditionally already surrendered by radio.
[00:49:52.958 --> 00:49:54.439]  Have our troops kill him.
[00:49:54.439 --> 00:49:59.163]  We're the government of 1945, pure evil.
[00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:03.467]  And now, 60 plus years later, how evil do you think they are?
[00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.289]  But you're naive, America.
[00:50:05.289 --> 00:50:06.550]  You'll never wake up to it.
[00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.731]  That's your blind spot.
[00:50:07.731 --> 00:50:09.152]  There's no way you can stop us.
[00:50:13.223 --> 00:50:21.749]  BP tells cleanup workers they'll be fired if they wear respirators, and they'll be called conspiracy theorists and un-American scum by the news.
[00:50:21.749 --> 00:50:23.470]  Remember the New York Post?
[00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:26.392]  And Fox calling the police just a few months ago?
[00:50:26.392 --> 00:50:30.515]  Conspiracy theorist, ambulance-chasing trash.
[00:50:30.515 --> 00:50:40.362]  Oh, Fox tells you how much they love cops all day and pats you on the head, but when you actually need help, I'm afraid you're worse than toilet paper.
[00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:42.664]  BP tells cleanup workers they'll be fired.
[00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:45.939]  You don't get any stinking respirators.
[00:50:45.939 --> 00:50:53.347]  I'll continue to hit headlines, and then your calls, I promise, when we start the next hour, directly your calls, but I've got to cover this news.
[00:50:53.347 --> 00:50:59.234]  You have a total group of criminals running everything who compete with each other on how evil they can be, and you've been naive!
[00:50:59.234 --> 00:51:00.175]  Wake up before it's too late!
[00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:06.171]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.974 --> 00:52:03.297]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.297 --> 00:52:05.680]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.884]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.884 --> 00:52:14.011]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.011 --> 00:52:18.196]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.496 --> 00:52:20.860]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.384]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.384 --> 00:52:26.648]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.648 --> 00:52:34.260]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.985]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.985 --> 00:52:42.827]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:46.510]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:47.591]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.591 --> 00:52:48.932]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:50.434]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:01.654]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.654 --> 00:53:07.239]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.239 --> 00:53:12.263]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.263 --> 00:53:17.828]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:23.072]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:23.072 --> 00:53:24.934]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:30.161]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:30.161 --> 00:53:31.282]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.282 --> 00:53:34.343]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:34.343 --> 00:53:37.965]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:41.166]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:41.166 --> 00:53:43.387]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:44.328]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.328 --> 00:53:44.728]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.728 --> 00:53:45.628]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:53:54.454 --> 00:53:57.016]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:57.016 --> 00:54:01.318]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:01.318 --> 00:54:18.909]  You know, I know I'm ranting because we're watching the entire World Government Takeover plan take place.
[00:54:20.393 --> 00:54:21.354]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:54:21.354 --> 00:54:22.254]  Bankrupt by design.
[00:54:22.254 --> 00:54:24.196]  My children have no future.
[00:54:24.196 --> 00:54:24.916]  I have no future.
[00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:25.637]  You have no future.
[00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:28.819]  I mean, these people really are as evil as I'm saying.
[00:54:28.819 --> 00:54:29.600]  They're so evil.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.340]  They're so corrupt.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:35.524]  They're so down and dirty and nasty and treacherous that I don't even have words.
[00:54:35.524 --> 00:54:36.665]  But you know what Stalin did.
[00:54:36.665 --> 00:54:40.327]  You know what Hitler and Mao and Pol Pot and Fidel Castro did.
[00:54:40.327 --> 00:54:42.569]  I mean, this is what normally happens.
[00:54:44.878 --> 00:54:55.645]  And these guys write all these textbooks about how other elites have failed to kill everyone and cement their total global domination because they weren't ruthless enough and didn't exterminate all their enemies.
[00:54:55.645 --> 00:54:58.247]  They weren't scientific about their tyranny.
[00:54:58.247 --> 00:54:59.348]  But we're going to do it.
[00:54:59.348 --> 00:55:02.350]  We're going to put fluoride in their water and dumb them down and sterilize them.
[00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:02.850]  This is from the 20s.
[00:55:04.403 --> 00:55:06.665]  I've literally got hundreds of textbooks and documents.
[00:55:06.665 --> 00:55:09.467]  I'm waiting in it for the new film I'm making.
[00:55:09.467 --> 00:55:10.328]  It's so shocking.
[00:55:10.328 --> 00:55:13.210]  The more I research, we'll just sit around the table doing research.
[00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.513]  I was up here at 9 o'clock at night with Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson last night.
[00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:17.674]  We were just speechless.
[00:55:17.674 --> 00:55:19.956]  It becomes a point you can't even talk about it anymore.
[00:55:19.956 --> 00:55:21.377]  You just want to warn everybody.
[00:55:21.377 --> 00:55:29.664]  And the public's too busy whining and crying about the World Cup and, oh, isn't it great the United States just won, but the referees stole one of their goals from them.
[00:55:29.664 --> 00:55:30.525]  Oh, we're outraged.
[00:55:30.525 --> 00:55:31.766]  This is so sickening.
[00:55:31.766 --> 00:55:32.327]  Hey, folks.
[00:55:32.907 --> 00:55:37.508]  That doesn't matter a hill of beans.
[00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:40.869]  But again, if I yelled and screamed about the U.S.
[00:55:40.869 --> 00:55:51.773]  having one of their goals stolen in South Africa, it would be, that's a good American right there, boy, he's mad about them damn people stealing one of our goals!
[00:55:51.773 --> 00:55:58.315]  But I get up here and start yelling and screaming about total criminals taking over everything, and it's like, shut up!
[00:55:58.315 --> 00:55:59.015]  Alright, I'm gonna settle down.
[00:56:03.536 --> 00:56:08.199]  BP tells cleanup workers they'll be fired if they wear respirators.
[00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:13.043]  And, uh, this is just all over.
[00:56:13.043 --> 00:56:23.290]  The mainstream media, Washington Post, Huffington Post, Wired, Yahoo, those are the sources of that article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:25.092]  I mean, you can't even make this stuff up anymore.
[00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:29.343]  It's just, it's just, it's just, you can't even imagine.
[00:56:29.343 --> 00:56:47.857]  Whatever I found, whatever you can imagine they're doing, if you go randomly search engine it, like it was about a month ago and I said, I'll guarantee you they're mixing it with jet fuel because I've seen other patents about mixing aerosolized chemicals in with jet fuel at the source so it's compartmentalized for weather modification.
[00:56:47.857 --> 00:56:52.641]  I'll bet there's a Pentagon patent and program because that'd be the group they'd pick to carry it out.
[00:56:52.641 --> 00:56:53.922]  I already knew they
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.222]  Had done some studies 20 years ago, or more, about adding it to jet fuel to manipulate weather.
[00:57:00.222 --> 00:57:04.123]  And Aaron comes running in and goes, oh my god, it's army.mil, it's State Department, it's all here.
[00:57:04.123 --> 00:57:05.444]  They admit they're doing it, here it is.
[00:57:05.444 --> 00:57:08.045]  I mean, this is what we're putting in my new chemtrail film.
[00:57:08.045 --> 00:57:09.705]  You notice I'm not hiding that.
[00:57:09.705 --> 00:57:11.086]  I know other people are making chemtrail films.
[00:57:11.086 --> 00:57:12.546]  Good, stick it in your chemtrail film.
[00:57:12.546 --> 00:57:14.567]  All I want to do is get the word out, folks.
[00:57:14.567 --> 00:57:23.090]  I mean, the... Anything I can imagine that's based on understanding this enemy, I can then go search it, and there it is.
[00:57:25.012 --> 00:57:27.757]  Any evil you can imagine, they've already done it.
[00:57:27.757 --> 00:57:28.579]  What does the Bible say?
[00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:32.165]  They ran around continually inventing new evil?
[00:57:33.968 --> 00:57:35.949]  Inventing sins.
[00:57:35.949 --> 00:57:38.289]  Inventing blasphemies.
[00:57:38.289 --> 00:57:40.150]  Blasphemies against the creation.
[00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:42.110]  Blasphemies against the beauty of the world.
[00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.130]  Blasphemy... I mean, I look at my children.
[00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:46.731]  Innocent, loving, good, full of life.
[00:57:46.731 --> 00:57:50.052]  And I think about how innocent and decent and wholesome they are.
[00:57:50.052 --> 00:58:02.895]  And I think about how ravenous and corrupt this world is and how they're selling corruption to us because they know once you're corrupt and once you're not virtuous that your mind becomes shuttered to other realities and your heart becomes
[00:58:04.997 --> 00:58:09.822]  It's one thing to read that in the Bible.
[00:58:09.822 --> 00:58:17.829]  It's another thing to physically experience it and to see how those that have chosen evil make jokes about everything.
[00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:19.851]  They giggle about evil.
[00:58:19.851 --> 00:58:21.392]  They giggle about corruption.
[00:58:21.392 --> 00:58:23.093]  They giggle when you warn them.
[00:58:23.093 --> 00:58:24.754]  They giggle when you have heart.
[00:58:24.754 --> 00:58:26.555]  They giggle when you have fight.
[00:58:26.555 --> 00:58:30.758]  They giggle at everything strong, everything good, everything real.
[00:58:30.758 --> 00:58:35.901]  Well don't worry all you giggling, unhappy, soft scum.
[00:58:35.901 --> 00:58:38.763]  You want to be enslaved and smashed into guts?
[00:58:38.763 --> 00:58:40.044]  You will be by your owners.
[00:58:41.121 --> 00:58:44.083]  On air, online, and on demand.
[00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:46.706]  They say we offer simple answers to complex problems.
[00:58:46.706 --> 00:58:50.609]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.609 --> 00:58:52.250]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:55.613]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:59:11.906 --> 00:59:14.568]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:59:14.568 --> 00:59:21.094]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:59:48.877 --> 00:59:53.720]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.101]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.101 --> 00:59:58.883]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:10.617]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.617 --> 01:00:12.198]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.198 --> 01:00:13.739]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:17.941]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.941 --> 01:00:22.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.407 --> 01:00:38.554]  All right, I tried my best to cover a bunch of the news, and as usual, I scratched the mere surface.
[01:00:38.554 --> 01:00:52.530]  And I'll be interspersing news throughout this hour, the next hour, and then we have John Coleman, former MI6, probably in the top two or three leading experts on the Black Nobility, on the Bilderberg Group, on the New World Order, global corporate state.
[01:00:53.948 --> 01:01:00.354]  So much of the research that you see out there about the Bilderberg Group, the New World Order, is basically Dr. John Coleman's information.
[01:01:00.354 --> 01:01:07.482]  He'll be joining us, and he's been in bad health off and on, so it's a very great honor to have him with us in the last hour.
[01:01:07.482 --> 01:01:08.723]  So we look forward to that.
[01:01:08.723 --> 01:01:12.246]  We'll be going over some of his books, the Tavistock Institute, you name it.
[01:01:12.246 --> 01:01:15.109]  I want to reschedule him when he's on today again for a month or so from now.
[01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:19.073]  It must have been 10 years ago I last interviewed him.
[01:01:19.073 --> 01:01:22.475]  And then I... He was in the hospital and sick and I couldn't interview him.
[01:01:22.475 --> 01:01:24.637]  And then I called back and he was in bad health again.
[01:01:24.637 --> 01:01:28.681]  This was like 9 years ago and I kind of forgot about him.
[01:01:28.681 --> 01:01:35.326]  It's kind of like you'll have a cousin who you grew up with and went hunting with and on fishing trips with and was a great friend and you blink and 20 years pass.
[01:01:35.326 --> 01:01:39.570]  Well, same thing happened with... Same thing happened with John Coleman.
[01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:44.327]  Of course, he's not a cousin I went fishing with, but yeah, you know the point.
[01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:48.509]  I interviewed him many times, 15 years ago, 14 years ago, 13, 12, 11, and then 10.
[01:01:48.509 --> 01:01:55.613]  I haven't interviewed him in 10 years until two weeks ago, and an hour wasn't enough, so he's back today.
[01:01:55.613 --> 01:02:03.877]  That's coming up, but in the next two hours, wide open phones, and I appreciate you holding, but please have your point ready and move forward.
[01:02:03.877 --> 01:02:07.419]  I'll recap some of the main questions I'm throwing out there.
[01:02:07.419 --> 01:02:10.341]  What are the things you think this oil spill's distracting us from?
[01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:16.183]  Not taking from the severity of the oil spill, it is being used as a media distraction.
[01:02:16.183 --> 01:02:24.908]  And what do you think about the clear cover-up of these deadly chemicals and the off-gassing and reports all over the Gulf?
[01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:32.451]  From Louisiana to the panhandle of Florida, people getting really sick and the kerosene smell everywhere and the media trying to cover that up.
[01:02:32.451 --> 01:02:35.192]  Let's talk to Michael in California.
[01:02:35.192 --> 01:02:36.253]  You're on the air, welcome.
[01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.434]  Welcome.
[01:02:38.434 --> 01:02:39.255]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:42.979]  It's nice to talk to you since we haven't talked since February.
[01:02:42.979 --> 01:02:44.340]  Three quick points.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.883]  Yes, please have Ted, the engineer, on.
[01:02:46.883 --> 01:02:51.788]  I would love to get his take on what's happening down there.
[01:02:51.788 --> 01:02:55.071]  Number two, I seem to agree with Lindsey Williams.
[01:02:55.071 --> 01:03:01.017]  I think this was an accident, but as Ron Emanuel has said, don't ever let a disaster go to waste.
[01:03:02.014 --> 01:03:18.980]  Um, and the distraction on this is that most people are forgetting that come the middle of July, Hart is going to begin creating plasma shields, which is Ronald Reagan's defense mechanism that they're putting into effect.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:25.584]  And by the way, that's admitted that they could ignite the atmosphere with HAARP.
[01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:30.527]  I've had the director of HAARP on four years ago, and he admitted that.
[01:03:30.527 --> 01:03:34.609]  So they have a lot of things beyond just what you're talking about.
[01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:40.113]  But how do you say they're igniting the plasma shield in July?
[01:03:40.113 --> 01:03:40.873]  I mean, how do you know that?
[01:03:43.177 --> 01:03:50.182]  Because of people that I know that are up in that area and that are associated with HAARP.
[01:03:50.182 --> 01:03:54.506]  That's all highly classified, but I don't know how you'd know that, but go ahead.
[01:03:54.506 --> 01:03:58.229]  The problem is that they're scientists themselves.
[01:03:58.229 --> 01:04:01.291]  When they were asked, have you ever done this before?
[01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:03.112]  They say, no, we haven't.
[01:04:03.112 --> 01:04:08.977]  And when asked, what would happen if a rogue plasma reaction begins?
[01:04:08.977 --> 01:04:11.219]  They could ignite the atmosphere.
[01:04:11.219 --> 01:04:11.819]  Exactly.
[01:04:11.819 --> 01:04:12.680]  Can you stop it?
[01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:15.893]  And they go, we don't know how to.
[01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:36.770]  Oppenheimer and others were playing God, and the majority of Manhattan Project scientists making the A-bomb thought that it would probably ignite the atmosphere and burn off the atmosphere of the Earth, but they still did it.
[01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.310]  They loved playing God.
[01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:48.736]  Many scientists at CERN believe that there is a chance it could cause a strangelet, a black hole, a singularity, and destroy much of the planet or the entire planet, but they're still going ahead with it.
[01:04:50.379 --> 01:04:56.683]  They're genetic engineering, cross species, all of this, and they still continue to play God.
[01:04:56.683 --> 01:04:58.704]  They're now playing around with antimatter weapons.
[01:05:00.612 --> 01:05:05.576]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:05:05.576 --> 01:05:06.576]  What have we got?
[01:05:06.576 --> 01:05:09.038]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.039]  A republic.
[01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.681]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:05:12.681 --> 01:05:14.943]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:16.964]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:05:16.964 --> 01:05:18.645]  So they think they own our land?
[01:05:18.645 --> 01:05:19.966]  They think they own our water?
[01:05:19.966 --> 01:05:20.587]  Children?
[01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:21.708]  Our education?
[01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:22.528]  Our money?
[01:05:22.528 --> 01:05:26.171]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:31.516]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:05:31.516 --> 01:05:32.537]  We have the facts.
[01:05:32.537 --> 01:05:33.698]  We have the Constitution.
[01:05:33.698 --> 01:05:34.599]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:35.500]  We have common law.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.022]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:40.965]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[01:05:40.965 --> 01:05:41.786]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:46.848]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:05:46.848 --> 01:05:48.348]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:49.429]  Don't tread on me.
[01:05:49.429 --> 01:05:55.511]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:06:00.413 --> 01:06:04.958]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:05.879]  Number one.
[01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:09.303]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:10.164]  Number two.
[01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:15.069]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.810]  It's true.
[01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:20.355]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.655 --> 01:06:21.476]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.476 --> 01:06:25.078]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.078 --> 01:06:28.981]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.981 --> 01:06:29.781]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.781 --> 01:06:32.543]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.543 --> 01:06:35.906]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.206 --> 01:06:41.148]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.148 --> 01:06:46.209]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:50.391]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.391 --> 01:06:52.171]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.400]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:09.603]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.603 --> 01:08:12.344]  Okay, wide open phones on this Friday edition.
[01:08:12.344 --> 01:08:20.909]  Anything you want to talk about, at the bottom of the hour, I will engage in about a five minute news blitz and I'll do that at the bottom of the next hour because there's so much to cover.
[01:08:21.909 --> 01:08:25.093]  But most of the listeners want to discuss the oil spill.
[01:08:25.093 --> 01:08:27.075]  I'm throwing out just this point.
[01:08:27.075 --> 01:08:29.679]  The oil spill is decimating the coast.
[01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:36.147]  There is a cover-up about people having trouble breathing and all the chemicals and gases that are coming out of the oil.
[01:08:37.921 --> 01:09:02.421]  It is confirmed by Reuters, AP, Wired Magazine, PrisonPlanet.com, you name it, that BP is running around telling their poor employees, their contractors, many of them getting minimum wage, we're talking $6 an hour, that they can't wear gas masks or even a paper mask because then they have to admit that there's liability and that people are getting sick.
[01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:09.312]  It's just like 9-11, where thousands of emergency workers got deadly ill.
[01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.113]  Many of them have died.
[01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:14.355]  The universities and medical centers have done the scans of the lungs.
[01:09:14.355 --> 01:09:19.918]  They're filled with concrete, mercury, asbestos, and they do not get the treatment.
[01:09:19.918 --> 01:09:24.540]  And the media, you've seen the headlines, says they're ambulance-chasing scum.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:30.604]  So if you go out there and work for the next six months cleaning up this toxic oil, and you get sick, you will be thrown in the ditch.
[01:09:31.972 --> 01:09:40.778]  And of the 20 billion they're getting from BP, remember, it'll all go to Martha's Vineyard, it'll all go to George Soros, you're not going to get a stinking red nickel.
[01:09:40.778 --> 01:09:45.461]  You're going to pay for it, and Obama has announced they are going to ram through the carbon tax.
[01:09:45.461 --> 01:09:46.102]  Isn't it funny?
[01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:47.863]  He was going to allow Gulf oil drilling.
[01:09:48.865 --> 01:09:57.067]  Then the top globalist oil company caught, being the ones bullying Exxon Mobil and others into going along with carbon taxes two years ago.
[01:09:57.067 --> 01:10:14.653]  The top globalist company, they just so happened to have this big spill, and it now turns out, not for two weeks, but for over a month, it's confirmed that they were telling their drillers on the deep water horizon to carry out the drilling in a way that never before been done.
[01:10:15.802 --> 01:10:24.168]  And it's on record that all the three contractor groups, including Halliburton, and I hate to defend them, but it's the truth is the truth, that this is going to effing blow up.
[01:10:24.168 --> 01:10:26.990]  That's one of the quotes in the Atlantic Monthly.
[01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.411]  And there's a bunch of other publications.
[01:10:28.411 --> 01:10:29.391]  You've seen it on the news.
[01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.514]  It's coming out, but it's the background.
[01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:33.867]  I think?
[01:10:54.036 --> 01:10:56.797]  And hope that its pressure holds the oil and gas in.
[01:10:56.797 --> 01:10:59.059]  But of course they hit oil and gas at many levels.
[01:10:59.059 --> 01:11:01.840]  They're going for the big payday down there deep.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.581]  At 30,000 feet.
[01:11:03.581 --> 01:11:05.642]  Alright, I'm already ranting about this.
[01:11:05.642 --> 01:11:08.143]  So, there's no doubt it's an inside job.
[01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:14.226]  There is no doubt, 100%, that they knew it was going to blow up.
[01:11:14.226 --> 01:11:16.047]  And so many false flags are like that.
[01:11:16.047 --> 01:11:18.789]  They give orders, governments, the military,
[01:11:19.977 --> 01:11:25.167]  Corporations, they give orders that they know are going to have an outcome, then they have plausible deniability.
[01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:28.333]  Well, we, you know, okay, all the engineers said it was going to blow up. 100%!
[01:11:32.557 --> 01:11:41.864]  That they, bare minimum, knew this was going to happen, and then they blocked the recovery effort so the estuaries got ruined for at least the next four or five years with oil.
[01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:48.228]  And so they could have lots of dead turtles and a dead sperm whale floating around.
[01:11:48.228 --> 01:11:49.849]  Yes, there are whales in the Gulf.
[01:11:49.849 --> 01:11:53.052]  Every time I say there are sperm whales out there, I get calls saying they're not.
[01:11:54.032 --> 01:12:00.554]  I guess because you watch Moby Dick and that was in the Atlantic with the old movie Moby Dick with Gregory Peck.
[01:12:00.554 --> 01:12:02.394]  Folks, I've seen sperm whales in the Gulf, okay?
[01:12:02.394 --> 01:12:02.555]  Okay?
[01:12:02.555 --> 01:12:08.796]  Alright, I'm going to stop ranting about that.
[01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:10.137]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:12:10.137 --> 01:12:16.458]  Let's talk to, hmm, who's up next here, John?
[01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:17.959]  Danny in New York, you're on the air.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.741]  Hey Alex, thanks a lot.
[01:12:20.741 --> 01:12:22.362]  I really appreciate you taking my call.
[01:12:22.362 --> 01:12:25.024]  This is Danny from We Are Change New York City.
[01:12:25.024 --> 01:12:36.534]  As far as the oil distraction, I think that it's distracting from a host of issues, including Iran and Israel, that situation with Iran sending an armed flotilla over there.
[01:12:37.154 --> 01:12:37.555]  I don't know.
[01:12:56.130 --> 01:13:00.112]  And I just wanted to really thank you for everything that you do.
[01:13:00.112 --> 01:13:02.693]  You're an inspiration to me, and you've inspired me to take action.
[01:13:02.693 --> 01:13:12.298]  I'm running for New York State Assembly here in Staten Island in the 63rd District, and I would appreciate any of your listeners in the New York area or Staten Island to go to my website.
[01:13:12.298 --> 01:13:13.679]  It's Danny4Assembly.com.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.261]  Hey Alex, I have three key videos for you.
[01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:18.762]  One is about
[01:13:43.676 --> 01:13:46.237]  Police corruption in New Orleans.
[01:13:46.237 --> 01:14:02.760]  And before I go into that, if people don't believe Alex Jones when he says there's this segment of police that are on steroids, well look up world-class bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:09.541]  He was a police officer for several years and he won, I believe,
[01:14:10.066 --> 01:14:23.202]  I don't know what's the title of it, Mr. Olympia, and he was a police officer and he admitted to using, um, what do you call it, uh, performance enhancing drugs and he was never tested for it.
[01:14:24.699 --> 01:14:40.488]  Okay, but... Well, I mean, sir, I mean, a month ago, the police chief in one of the biggest cities in Texas, Fort Worth, came out and gave a speech and said injecting testosterone is good, and they've done national studies.
[01:14:40.488 --> 01:14:45.411]  On average, more than a third, some police forces, more than half, I've seen policewomen
[01:14:46.809 --> 01:14:55.525]  Who have male features, giant biceps, clearly on roids, you know, they have the fatty, uh, what do they call it, buffalo hump on their back.
[01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:56.527]  I mean, I played football.
[01:14:57.751 --> 01:15:05.376]  In high school, and I knew the guys who were 14, 15 years old who could bench press 400 pounds and had hair all over their chest.
[01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:09.119]  And no matter how hard I worked out, I couldn't get as strong as they were until I got older.
[01:15:09.119 --> 01:15:11.361]  You're meant to get, you know, grow slower.
[01:15:11.361 --> 01:15:19.166]  And, you know, by the time I was 20 and I could still bench press a lot, they couldn't and they were all shriveled up and, you know, couldn't even, you know, have kids.
[01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:22.389]  Because I know some of the guys that did steroids and their lives are ruined.
[01:15:22.389 --> 01:15:24.910]  I know one guy who took roids in college.
[01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:26.311]  He's already had a heart attack at 35 years old.
[01:15:28.405 --> 01:15:41.690]  And yes, a large portion of the cops are on anabolic steroids, whacked completely out of their brains, and now the police openly are giving them amphetamine pills and steroids, just like the troops.
[01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:43.031]  And so it's just terrible.
[01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:54.515]  And you've got police on total roid rages, and they'll beat your wife to death, they'll beat your son or daughter to death, they'll do whatever they want, or beat them half to death, and then they'll charge you with assaulting them and laugh about it.
[01:15:54.515 --> 01:15:55.616]  They have been turned into
[01:15:56.656 --> 01:15:57.076]  Yeah, okay.
[01:15:57.076 --> 01:15:57.836]  I have three videos for you.
[01:16:24.876 --> 01:16:27.137]  Um, you might need a pen and paper.
[01:16:27.137 --> 01:16:30.219]  One is about police corruption in New Orleans.
[01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:36.101]  If you type in, um, let's see, culture of police corruption.
[01:16:36.101 --> 01:16:40.543]  The first video, and it talks about how New Orleans is so tainted.
[01:16:40.543 --> 01:16:42.204]  It's like Tulia, Texas.
[01:16:42.204 --> 01:16:43.265]  All right.
[01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.445]  That's one.
[01:16:44.445 --> 01:16:49.647]  Another video is whistleblower fired for reporting 200.
[01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:52.889]  That's all you have to put in whistleblower.
[01:16:53.582 --> 01:16:57.485]  Well what they're doing is they're selling the body parts and I appreciate your call.
[01:17:17.774 --> 01:17:22.018]  I remember over a decade ago getting reports that U.S.
[01:17:22.018 --> 01:17:36.452]  forces in Colombia were capturing people and then taking them to contractors that sanguinated their blood, stripped their skin, sold their kidneys, their lungs, their livers.
[01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:37.653]  And on average, we're getting about $400,000 for it.
[01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:59.083]  And then the rumors came out about Israel running some of the torture camps in Iraq, Abu Ghraib among them, and families would then be given their family member's body, and they'd have an incision from the neck all the way down to their genitals, and all their organs were scooped out.
[01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:06.146]  In some cases, the blood was even removed, because they like to deliver the same blood type with the organ, and it was a rumor.
[01:18:06.146 --> 01:18:09.347]  But now Israel had to admit, what, late last year, that okay,
[01:18:10.558 --> 01:18:12.681]  We are selling Palestinians' organs.
[01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:16.085]  We get them, we kill them, we take the goods.
[01:18:16.085 --> 01:18:18.408]  I mean, that's like China 15 years ago would deny it.
[01:18:18.408 --> 01:18:25.557]  Now China does full-page brochures, the government does, advertising that they, quote, have fresh organs.
[01:18:26.638 --> 01:18:35.247]  And Americans, Europeans, you name it, they fly into China, they fly into Japan because it's just a short plane flight from China to there.
[01:18:35.247 --> 01:18:39.251]  They have 24 mobile execution vans per major city.
[01:18:39.251 --> 01:18:40.573]  This is Times of London.
[01:18:40.573 --> 01:18:45.238]  The Chinese show it and it shows them taking a young woman out who they say was caught stealing.
[01:18:45.238 --> 01:18:46.059]  They're choking her.
[01:18:47.574 --> 01:18:48.855]  Her face is purple.
[01:18:48.855 --> 01:18:58.680]  They lead her to the van, and they cut her organs out on the way to the airport, put them on ice, and fly them into Japan, where Americans line up for the goods.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:04.843]  And so, again, our government, murder operations, they're taking our troops' organs.
[01:19:04.843 --> 01:19:10.967]  Again, my father is a dentist, but he also does oral surgery.
[01:19:10.967 --> 01:19:14.889]  And when I was a kid, he was always having to get up at 2, 3 in the morning.
[01:19:14.889 --> 01:19:16.510]  He'd get called into Dallas or Mesquite.
[01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:20.567]  To do rewiring of jaws.
[01:19:20.567 --> 01:19:22.088]  People whose jaws were shattered.
[01:19:22.088 --> 01:19:28.232]  Because they couldn't wait until the next day for some reason that he'd have to do an emergency wiring, I guess, for further surgery.
[01:19:28.232 --> 01:19:31.114]  So he worked in hospitals.
[01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:35.236]  And I was 15.
[01:19:35.236 --> 01:19:38.638]  And I was going to my driver's ed, and he said, son, don't sign the organ donor card.
[01:19:38.638 --> 01:19:39.059]  And I said, why?
[01:19:39.059 --> 01:19:42.301]  And he said, well, the word in Dallas is, if you come in hurt,
[01:19:43.206 --> 01:19:45.827]  They'll go ahead and won't give you aid and let you die to get your organs.
[01:19:45.827 --> 01:19:50.208]  And then I thought my dad was crazy, but I said, no, you know, don't put me on the organ donor card.
[01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:57.930]  And then it came out on 60 Minutes that Chicago, Dallas, and other places take your eyes, your retinas, your levers, and they do cap you, of course, for the goods.
[01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:59.091]  It's murder squads running everything.
[01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:02.015]  You worry.
[01:20:02.015 --> 01:20:04.376]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:20:04.376 --> 01:20:04.916]  Hi.
[01:20:04.916 --> 01:20:07.698]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:20:07.698 --> 01:20:12.241]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.723]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:20:14.723 --> 01:20:18.065]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:20:18.065 --> 01:20:20.007]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:20:20.007 --> 01:20:22.789]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:20:22.789 --> 01:20:26.511]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:20:26.511 --> 01:20:30.554]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:20:30.914 --> 01:20:34.997]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:41.341]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:20:41.341 --> 01:20:43.683]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:20:43.683 --> 01:20:45.805]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:20:45.805 --> 01:20:50.468]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.

[01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:55.051]  I think a storm's coming.

[01:23:01.465 --> 01:23:02.225]  The problem.
[01:23:02.225 --> 01:23:04.807]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:04.807 --> 01:23:07.528]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:07.528 --> 01:23:10.190]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:12.691]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:12.691 --> 01:23:21.696]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.

[01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:24.904]  By the way, Israel two years ago demonized European press.
[01:24:24.904 --> 01:24:29.067]  And so they were liars about kidnapping people and selling their organs.
[01:24:29.067 --> 01:24:32.930]  And then it came out in AP and Reuters, Israel said, OK, we do do this.
[01:24:34.847 --> 01:24:35.688]  And the U.S.
[01:24:35.688 --> 01:24:43.473]  does it, and the Chinese do it, and you are seen as an animal by the New World Order.
[01:24:43.473 --> 01:24:48.076]  They don't just see human life as cheap, as say the Romans did 2,000 years ago.
[01:24:48.076 --> 01:24:49.577]  You are seen as expendable.
[01:24:49.577 --> 01:24:51.218]  You are seen as garbage.
[01:24:51.218 --> 01:24:53.119]  You are seen as having negative value.
[01:24:55.339 --> 01:24:58.622]  And once you understand that, you understand everything.
[01:24:58.622 --> 01:25:01.185]  Alright, let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:07.351]  But if you think I'm joking, just go do an internet search on Israel admits to harvesting organs of detainees.
[01:25:07.351 --> 01:25:09.934]  Or China has mobile execution vans.
[01:25:09.934 --> 01:25:15.200]  Or 60 minutes, hospitals caught killing for organs.
[01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:17.185]  And here's another issue.
[01:25:17.185 --> 01:25:26.047]  You know that those private organ companies that lobby, they pay off the hospitals, they make $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 off those organs.
[01:25:26.047 --> 01:25:27.487]  And then the family gets nothing.
[01:25:27.487 --> 01:25:28.808]  It's like, well, the family shouldn't.
[01:25:28.808 --> 01:25:30.708]  Well, why do these companies get all that money?
[01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:34.529]  You know, why did Steve Jobs get organs and get around the waiting list?
[01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:37.109]  It's all a big scam, folks!
[01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.770]  Okay?
[01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:38.910]  Crooks run things!
[01:25:39.963 --> 01:25:41.806]  And we've become a bunch of schmucks!
[01:25:41.806 --> 01:25:43.489]  It's time to be more wily!
[01:25:43.489 --> 01:25:45.974]  It's time to realize how much trouble we're in!
[01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:48.598]  Brian and Montreal, you're on the air.
[01:25:48.598 --> 01:25:52.986]  Hi Alex, I'm calling to disagree with things that Lindsey Williams has told you.
[01:25:53.857 --> 01:26:01.641]  The first thing I wanted to disagree with him is most importantly that this is just an error and this is just a mistake and that nobody knew it was going to go on.
[01:26:01.641 --> 01:26:03.583]  Well, I've told him I disagree with him on that.
[01:26:03.583 --> 01:26:05.844]  I mean, he doesn't have evidence of that.
[01:26:05.844 --> 01:26:08.145]  He's just giving us his opinion.
[01:26:08.145 --> 01:26:09.706]  But I agree with you.
[01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:14.188]  My gut told me day one, I didn't say it for two weeks, that this was an inside job.
[01:26:14.188 --> 01:26:15.869]  And I said they're going to use it for carbon tax.
[01:26:15.869 --> 01:26:19.692]  And now we know they gave orders that they knew would cause it to blow up.
[01:26:19.692 --> 01:26:20.332]  Period!
[01:26:20.332 --> 01:26:21.172]  They're guilty!
[01:26:21.172 --> 01:26:21.733]  Arrest them!
[01:26:22.634 --> 01:26:25.015]  Yes, well, I have a PDF from 2005.
[01:26:25.015 --> 01:26:34.798]  It's called the Outer Continental Shelf Estimate Oil and Gas Reserve, Gulf of Mexico, from December 31st, 2005.
[01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:38.119]  And just in that one... No, I've got the report.
[01:26:38.119 --> 01:26:41.540]  It's a 600 square mile area right off Louisiana, where they drilled right in the middle.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:45.962]  It's got more than Saudi Arabia and Alaska combined, and they know it, so they want to shut that off.
[01:26:45.962 --> 01:26:46.202]  Go ahead.
[01:26:46.690 --> 01:26:48.811]  Exactly, there's that fact too.
[01:26:48.811 --> 01:26:56.495]  And then the other aspect that I'd like to address is that Lindsay says that these people are the elitists, the supposed New World Order.
[01:26:56.495 --> 01:26:59.356]  We all know that their god is Lucifer.
[01:26:59.356 --> 01:27:04.918]  They go to worshippers of Lucifer, they go to psychics, clairvoyants.
[01:27:04.918 --> 01:27:06.679]  This is who they are asking.
[01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:08.520]  They ask demons for their advice.
[01:27:08.993 --> 01:27:11.276]  And this was the advice that they were given.
[01:27:11.276 --> 01:27:15.461]  So it's a complete fallacy and a lie to say that these people don't know what they're doing.
[01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:17.003]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:27:17.003 --> 01:27:22.710]  In one supposedly foul accident, they have covered carbon tax, Codex Alimentarius,
[01:27:23.126 --> 01:27:27.710]  Depopulation, martial law implementation, the list goes on and on.
[01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.391]  This is no accident.
[01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:32.213]  And it's a nice distraction from the nuke subs and U.S.
[01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:35.155]  forces and bunker busters and Diego Garcia.
[01:27:35.155 --> 01:27:39.258]  An open talk of our government with Israel striking Iran.
[01:27:39.258 --> 01:27:41.440]  Israel saying they're going to run the Israeli blockade.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.121]  The U.N.
[01:27:43.121 --> 01:27:48.125]  set to vote as well as the Congress on a blockade of Iran, which is an act of war.
[01:27:48.125 --> 01:27:48.706]  Meanwhile,
[01:27:49.466 --> 01:27:54.110]  Meanwhile, you've got the Masons of the United States, when they're asked who they pray to, this is what they say.
[01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:56.872]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:58.274]  Just that, sir.
[01:27:58.274 --> 01:27:58.954]  Okay.
[01:27:58.954 --> 01:28:00.415]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[01:28:00.415 --> 01:28:03.298]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[01:28:03.298 --> 01:28:05.740]  How can you say anything about it about me?
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.961]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[01:28:06.961 --> 01:28:08.542]  I am born again!
[01:28:08.542 --> 01:28:10.744]  Now, did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:11.545]  I am Lucifer.
[01:28:11.545 --> 01:28:13.226]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[01:28:13.226 --> 01:28:17.690]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.890]  Lucifer is?
[01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:19.791]  Yeah.
[01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:20.451]  Say that again.
[01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:23.772]  Lucifer is a pure, holy... Virtuous!
[01:28:23.772 --> 01:28:24.712]  Virtuous.
[01:28:24.712 --> 01:28:26.813]  Now, see the Lucifer that God created?
[01:28:26.813 --> 01:28:27.693]  That's the same one.
[01:28:27.693 --> 01:28:28.593]  Oh, man, this is great.
[01:28:28.593 --> 01:28:30.114]  I'm gonna put this on the internet.
[01:28:30.114 --> 01:28:30.374]  Amen.
[01:28:30.374 --> 01:28:32.255]  Oh, God bless you, brother.
[01:28:32.255 --> 01:28:37.376]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teach, is that Lucifer... Lucifer is light.
[01:28:37.376 --> 01:28:37.996]  No.
[01:28:37.996 --> 01:28:39.477]  And you're... What about those hospitals?
[01:28:40.197 --> 01:28:41.759]  You know what, sir?
[01:28:41.759 --> 01:28:46.744]  Jesus said, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, we did not do these good deeds in your name.
[01:28:46.744 --> 01:28:49.066]  And you'll say, away from me, you workers of iniquity.
[01:28:49.066 --> 01:28:51.348]  I never knew you.
[01:28:51.348 --> 01:28:52.449]  Jesus said it?
[01:28:52.449 --> 01:28:53.150]  In Matthew chapter 5.
[01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:56.376]  Mercy.
[01:28:56.376 --> 01:28:56.837]  No.
[01:28:56.837 --> 01:28:57.977]  That's hard to believe.
[01:28:57.977 --> 01:29:00.698]  So, you're a Christian and you don't know that.
[01:29:00.698 --> 01:29:02.959]  No, I really am.
[01:29:02.959 --> 01:29:03.179]  You are.
[01:29:03.179 --> 01:29:04.759]  Because I'm pure and virtuous.
[01:29:04.759 --> 01:29:06.760]  You're pure and virtuous, okay.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.361]  In other words, you're perfect without Jesus, right?
[01:29:09.361 --> 01:29:10.121]  No, no, no.
[01:29:10.121 --> 01:29:10.661]  No.
[01:29:10.661 --> 01:29:11.862]  Okay, tell me about Jesus.
[01:29:11.862 --> 01:29:13.562]  Who is Jesus?
[01:29:13.562 --> 01:29:15.183]  He's my leader.
[01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.443]  Is He the Son of God?
[01:29:16.443 --> 01:29:16.903]  Yes, He is.
[01:29:16.903 --> 01:29:18.584]  Is He the only worshipful Master?
[01:29:19.502 --> 01:29:20.003]  Yes.
[01:29:20.003 --> 01:29:22.185]  Have you ever been called Worshipful Master?
[01:29:22.185 --> 01:29:24.427]  No, because I've just been too busy.
[01:29:24.427 --> 01:29:25.448]  I've been working.
[01:29:25.448 --> 01:29:25.848]  Working.
[01:29:25.848 --> 01:29:27.210]  Working to help people.
[01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:28.091]  What kind of work?
[01:29:28.091 --> 01:29:32.635]  And folks, I'm not demonizing the Founding Fathers or Masons in total.
[01:29:32.635 --> 01:29:39.222]  The point is, the modern Masons, if you really get them to talk to you, they'll say, yeah, Lucifer is one with Jesus.
[01:29:39.222 --> 01:29:41.224]  So yeah, when the caller says they worship Lucifer,
[01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:46.069]  You better believe the people running things are on their knees to Lucifer.
[01:29:46.069 --> 01:29:47.351]  Oh, sweet Lucifer.
[01:29:47.351 --> 01:29:49.073]  We'll be right back with more Your Calls.
[01:29:49.073 --> 01:29:51.336]  Oh, Lucifer.
[01:29:51.336 --> 01:29:52.737]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.737 --> 01:29:55.260]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.311 --> 01:30:04.314]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.314 --> 01:30:09.659]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.659 --> 01:30:11.701]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:16.706]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.706 --> 01:30:17.888]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.888 --> 01:30:19.009]  When do you want it?
[01:30:19.009 --> 01:30:20.890]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:21.972]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.972 --> 01:30:24.174]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.174 --> 01:30:25.175]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.495 --> 01:30:27.017]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.017 --> 01:30:32.283]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.283 --> 01:30:35.887]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.887 --> 01:30:39.691]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:40.452]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.912 --> 01:30:41.813]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.813 --> 01:30:42.914]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.914 --> 01:30:43.855]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:44.956]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.956 --> 01:30:47.999]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.999 --> 01:30:49.781]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:50.702]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:02.233 --> 01:31:06.196]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.196 --> 01:31:15.063]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.063 --> 01:31:19.686]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.686 --> 01:31:30.515]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.135 --> 01:31:40.638]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.638 --> 01:31:46.080]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:53.563]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.563 --> 01:31:56.324]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.623]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.623 --> 01:32:05.543]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.543 --> 01:32:08.966]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.966 --> 01:32:09.826]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.826 --> 01:32:14.729]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:15.470]  It's true.
[01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:20.333]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.333 --> 01:32:21.153]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.153 --> 01:32:24.756]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.756 --> 01:32:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.638 --> 01:32:29.438]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.438 --> 01:32:32.199]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.199 --> 01:32:35.881]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.881 --> 01:32:36.681]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.681 --> 01:32:40.823]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.823 --> 01:32:45.865]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.865 --> 01:32:50.046]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.046 --> 01:32:51.827]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.827 --> 01:32:56.449]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:56.749 --> 01:32:56.789]  877-327-0365
[01:33:12.256 --> 01:33:17.077]  We are continuing with your phone calls after I cover some more important news.

[01:33:35.846 --> 01:33:39.531]  They're auxiliary attack frigates in the InfoWars.
[01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:46.340]  Our InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, and of course WhatIsTheEndGame.com and others.
[01:33:53.823 --> 01:34:06.685]  Before I go back to the news and then your calls, though, I do want to encourage all of the listeners of this radio broadcast to support our local AM and FM sponsors.
[01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:09.091]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[01:34:09.091 --> 01:34:09.872]  They're courageous.
[01:34:09.872 --> 01:34:11.312]  We appreciate them.
[01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:17.433]  If you're a local listener and you happen to have a business, you should also sponsor that local station.
[01:34:17.433 --> 01:34:21.794]  Also support the network sponsors and the sponsors of this radio broadcast.
[01:34:21.794 --> 01:34:25.916]  And all the sponsors that I have are sponsors that I really believe in.
[01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:27.276]  Like Ecola Blue.
[01:34:27.276 --> 01:34:30.757]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the air you breathe?
[01:34:30.757 --> 01:34:32.737]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[01:34:32.737 --> 01:34:35.218]  Our sponsor, Ecola Blue, with the Ecola Blue 28,
[01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:40.101]  The brand new Ecola Blue 30 machines will allow you to do just that.
[01:34:40.101 --> 01:34:44.026]  It's easy to use and will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[01:34:44.026 --> 01:34:48.673]  The water, once generated, passes through a 7 or 12 stage filter process.
[01:34:50.222 --> 01:34:53.564]  Including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques.
[01:34:53.564 --> 01:34:55.305]  Ensuring that you know exactly what you're drinking.
[01:34:55.305 --> 01:34:59.408]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride we spend so much time talking about on this show.

[01:35:19.838 --> 01:35:24.139]  And finally, I want to tell you about Diamond Gusset Jeans and Clothing.
[01:35:24.139 --> 01:35:26.720]  They've got shirts, shorts, you name it.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.980]  They've also got a big line of motorcycle jeans.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.781]  They're thicker.
[01:35:30.781 --> 01:35:35.022]  They've got... Well, just check it out for yourself.
[01:35:35.022 --> 01:35:36.362]  It's amazing, and it's all...

[01:35:57.974 --> 01:35:59.655]  Gusset clothing dot com.
[01:35:59.655 --> 01:36:05.738]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and none of us are perfect about buying American, because you can't find most stuff made in America.
[01:36:05.738 --> 01:36:09.861]  These are high quality, great looking jeans and other clothes made right here in America.
[01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:15.884]  Gusset clothing dot com, or 888-8-GUSSET.
[01:36:15.884 --> 01:36:16.985]  Amazing jeans, folks.
[01:36:16.985 --> 01:36:17.445]  Check them out.
[01:36:17.445 --> 01:36:19.026]  All sizes for men and women.
[01:36:19.026 --> 01:36:20.007]  Gusset clothing dot com.
[01:36:22.347 --> 01:36:23.868]  Okay, continuing.
[01:36:23.868 --> 01:36:26.509]  Spill may have taken its largest victim yet.
[01:36:26.509 --> 01:36:27.710]  This is the New York Times.
[01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:34.012]  It says a sperm whale floating off the coast.
[01:36:34.012 --> 01:36:40.055]  Believed to have died via marine biologist analysis by oil.
[01:36:40.055 --> 01:36:42.937]  They're concerned that oil caused its death.
[01:36:42.937 --> 01:36:45.798]  Too bad for the toothed whale.
[01:36:48.018 --> 01:36:50.799]  Continuing with the economy, Greenspan says U.S.
[01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:55.121]  may soon reach borrowing limit.
[01:36:55.121 --> 01:36:56.621]  Greenspan says U.S.
[01:36:56.621 --> 01:37:01.143]  may soon reach borrowing limit.
[01:37:01.143 --> 01:37:02.864]  Which is the goal.
[01:37:02.864 --> 01:37:05.685]  Imagine your private banks that make money up out of that nothing.
[01:37:05.685 --> 01:37:10.086]  You've created hundreds and hundreds of trillions of fake fiat derivatives.
[01:37:10.086 --> 01:37:13.668]  They've now leveraged it to 1.5 thousand quadrillion.
[01:37:15.242 --> 01:37:16.963]  1,500 trillion.
[01:37:16.963 --> 01:37:19.906]  You heard me right, that's a conservative year old estimate by Tarpley.
[01:37:19.906 --> 01:37:22.028]  Some economists we have on say 500 trillion.
[01:37:22.028 --> 01:37:26.893]  Once you're talking, it's like, you know, did the cops shoot the guy 50 times or 5,000?
[01:37:26.893 --> 01:37:28.215]  At a certain point it doesn't matter.
[01:37:29.947 --> 01:37:31.948]  And again, it's like the U.N.
[01:37:31.948 --> 01:37:39.331]  saying, oh my gosh, there's going to be 40% increase in food prices and tens of millions more will starve to death each year.
[01:37:39.331 --> 01:37:40.592]  Yeah, 15 million conservatively.
[01:37:40.592 --> 01:37:42.673]  Some numbers say 25 million starve to death a year.
[01:37:42.673 --> 01:37:43.153]  And the U.N.
[01:37:43.153 --> 01:37:44.353]  thought, oh, this is terrible.
[01:37:44.353 --> 01:37:46.514]  We've got to have a global tax to fix this.
[01:37:46.514 --> 01:37:47.234]  Meanwhile, the U.N.
[01:37:47.234 --> 01:37:49.836]  in its own memorandums via the State Department, 200,
[01:37:51.096 --> 01:38:08.466]  Department of Random 200 states on record that their job is to create war, famine, death, and destruction, and to put GMO in to take control of these people in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and that their job is to cause people to starve to death and to have wars and to kill each other, and to sterilize them through vaccines.
[01:38:08.466 --> 01:38:12.248]  That's all stated, but meanwhile, oh, they're so concerned!
[01:38:12.248 --> 01:38:15.210]  We've got a carbon tax that'll help the Africans!
[01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:16.431]  You're not a racist, are you?
[01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:31.350]  I'm a liberal like Margaret Sanger who wrote private letters about killing subhuman blacks and how much she hated them, but how she had to pose as their friend and how much she hated it, but that she would do it because she got to kill them there and it's so good, oh yes.
[01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:34.033]  But see, but see, that's how it works, the nice little...
[01:38:35.146 --> 01:38:39.490]  Liberals who support all the wars owned by General Electric, the bomb makers.
[01:38:39.490 --> 01:38:49.458]  Chris Matthews teaches you about race all day and how he's gonna take good care of you and how you gotta have open borders and North American Union to bankrupt everything or you're a racist.
[01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:55.243]  Meanwhile, he never talks about the UN caught all over the world adding hormones to tetanus to sterilize people.
[01:38:55.243 --> 01:39:00.168]  And he knows all about it, guaranteed, because it's their stinking religion of these rats.
[01:39:01.161 --> 01:39:05.734]  Reality is so much horrific that when people can admit, there's all the beauty in the world as well.
[01:39:05.734 --> 01:39:09.164]  That's why we're exposing the evil, because it's attempting to overthrow the beauty.
[01:39:10.421 --> 01:39:24.450]  But Greenspan, who was there in 99 when they changed the Glass-Steagall Act, who helped engineer all this, and then he told us about irrational exuberance five years ago, getting us ready for this, so he could now explain to us how he's going to take good care of us.
[01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:25.931]  You know, he's a sellout.
[01:39:25.931 --> 01:39:30.594]  He's literally a Darth Vader, if you want to use the Star Wars universe analogy.
[01:39:30.594 --> 01:39:40.141]  He was Anakin Skywalker of finance, writing books, exposing the bankers, the Federal Reserve, the New World Order, Fractional Reserve Banking, Proto,
[01:39:41.201 --> 01:39:42.102]  We're good to go.
[01:40:03.516 --> 01:40:05.877]  To Sauron, and the rest is history.
[01:40:05.877 --> 01:40:11.220]  So he knows full well, full well, this is somebody who was on the same path as him.
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.321]  He wrote multiple books.
[01:40:12.321 --> 01:40:12.901]  You can go get them.
[01:40:12.901 --> 01:40:15.303]  You can go read them.
[01:40:15.303 --> 01:40:19.605]  They republished his essay in Capitalism, The Unrealized Dream.
[01:40:19.605 --> 01:40:22.907]  I remember reading that in high school.
[01:40:22.907 --> 01:40:26.249]  Alan Greenspan.
[01:40:26.249 --> 01:40:27.550]  Oh, he knelt to the Emperor.
[01:40:31.403 --> 01:40:34.065]  Rise, Lord Greenspan.
[01:40:34.065 --> 01:40:37.508]  You have done well, Lord Greenspan.
[01:40:37.508 --> 01:40:38.909]  Now you must butcher the U.S.
[01:40:38.909 --> 01:40:39.790]  economy.
[01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:43.113]  Only by destroying it will you be powerful in the dark side.
[01:40:47.349 --> 01:40:48.349]  Former U.S.
[01:40:48.349 --> 01:40:56.292]  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified at a hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in Washington.
[01:40:56.292 --> 01:41:03.294]  Yes, the center of the cancer that's been testicized out and is sending tentacles down into the smallest hamlets now.
[01:41:03.294 --> 01:41:06.615]  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S.
[01:41:06.615 --> 01:41:16.178]  may soon face higher borrowing costs on its swelling debt and called for a tectonic shift in fiscal policy to contain borrowing.
[01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:24.087]  Yeah, we don't need all that chicken feed to get you in on the government trough, or the government mammary system.
[01:41:24.087 --> 01:41:25.627]  No, no, that's not needed now.
[01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:43.137]  Now we must raise your taxes, as all the heads of the central banks, EU central bank, Federal Reserve, we've seen Bernanke calling for carbon taxes, VAT, financial VAT, Volcker calling for it, Obama, Republicans calling for it, John McCain calling for it, all these new taxes,
[01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:48.702]  As they announce, oh, the states are all going bankrupt, I'm afraid.
[01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:51.405]  I'm afraid your states won't survive.
[01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:57.852]  And when I federalize your police, they'll be following our orders now.
[01:41:57.852 --> 01:42:01.836]  I'm afraid that the police will follow any orders for their paychecks.
[01:42:03.254 --> 01:42:11.839]  And by cutting essential services, we scare the government minions into believing their jobs are in danger, and then they'll go out and rob you at gunpoint.
[01:42:11.839 --> 01:42:20.165]  We'll be sitting offshore while our forces reduce you down to vassal serfs.
[01:42:20.165 --> 01:42:21.786]  This is going very well!
[01:42:23.058 --> 01:42:26.560]  Look at the slaves cleaning up the oil where we allow them to.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.721]  They're not allowed to wear breathing apparatus.
[01:42:28.721 --> 01:42:33.724]  That would scare the other slaves and we might have to actually give them gas masks.
[01:42:33.724 --> 01:42:38.027]  When it's so useful, we're even causing some of the slaves to become ill.
[01:42:38.027 --> 01:42:40.989]  That will further bankrupt the local emergency centers.
[01:42:40.989 --> 01:42:47.392]  And more federalization, the more we wreck, the more we destroy, the better everything gets.
[01:42:49.314 --> 01:42:53.916]  Oh, it's so easy destroying and creating order out of the chaos.
[01:42:53.916 --> 01:42:58.279]  Have you ever watched a CFR meeting?
[01:42:58.279 --> 01:42:59.340]  That's basically how they talk.
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:02.201]  Even though they're from America, they have this affected Atlantic accent.
[01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:04.663]  Of course, at the turn of the 20th century, even.
[01:43:06.991 --> 01:43:09.752]  Turn of the 19th century, end of the 20th.
[01:43:09.752 --> 01:43:18.356]  It was very trendy in New York and Connecticut to affect a British accent.
[01:43:18.356 --> 01:43:23.099]  Continuing here, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S.
[01:43:23.099 --> 01:43:32.703]  may soon face higher borrowing costs on its swelling debt and called for a tectonic shift in fiscal policy to contain borrowing.
[01:43:32.703 --> 01:43:33.664]  Everything must go to them.
[01:43:34.304 --> 01:43:35.625]  Preparations of a large U.S.
[01:43:35.625 --> 01:43:38.968]  borrowing capacity are misleading perceptions, he said.
[01:43:38.968 --> 01:43:46.093]  And current long-term bond yields are masking America's debt challenge, Greenspan wrote in an opinion piece posted on the Wall Street Journal website.
[01:43:46.093 --> 01:43:55.300]  Long-term rate increases can emerge with unexpected suddenness, such as the 4% point surge over four months in 79-1980, he said.
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:03.306]  He went on to talk about how we've got to cut spending on local chicken feed, increase taxes to engorge the bankers.
[01:44:04.707 --> 01:44:10.608]  Continuing, gold ETFs rise to new all-time highs.
[01:44:10.608 --> 01:44:13.488]  Yes, and gold is now broken in Europe.
[01:44:13.488 --> 01:44:16.569]  It's all-time high of just a week ago, and it's all-time high of a few months ago.
[01:44:16.569 --> 01:44:20.090]  It's now broken here in the United States, breaking $1,260.
[01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:24.910]  In fact, it may have changed in the last hour since I looked.
[01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:29.811]  Let's go look up spot gold.
[01:44:29.811 --> 01:44:33.992]  Of course, gold's trading for way, way, way, way.
[01:44:34.984 --> 01:44:38.849]  Over.
[01:44:38.849 --> 01:44:40.672]  What they say it's trading for.
[01:44:43.658 --> 01:44:52.143]  It says that it's at $1,257 up $12.40 today, so it's dropped a bit as the bankers try to drive it down.
[01:44:52.143 --> 01:45:02.548]  Continuing here, FCC moves to regulate internet even though the law calls for internet to be unfettered by federal or state regulation.
[01:45:02.548 --> 01:45:09.892]  Well, that's like they've renamed the carbon tax a new energy plan jobs plan.
[01:45:09.892 --> 01:45:12.194]  I'll walk over and hit you in the head with a ball-peen hammer and call it a
[01:45:13.863 --> 01:45:15.284]  A head massage plan.
[01:45:15.284 --> 01:45:16.585]  You know, they just re-labeled.
[01:45:16.585 --> 01:45:22.491]  Here, I'll shoot you in the foot and call it a pedicure.
[01:45:22.491 --> 01:45:27.275]  I'm gonna shoot you in the foot with a 12 gauge shotgun and blow the front of your foot off and I'm gonna call it a pedicure.
[01:45:27.275 --> 01:45:28.396]  How's that sound?
[01:45:28.396 --> 01:45:31.419]  And of course, you'll buy into that because you love being a slave, isn't that right?
[01:45:31.419 --> 01:45:34.041]  That's kind of their... I mean, if you could hear what they're thinking.
[01:45:34.041 --> 01:45:40.567]  I ought to make some YouTube videos showing globalist at press conferences just standing around not talking and put thought bubbles above their heads.
[01:45:41.584 --> 01:45:42.865]  Oh, look at these stupid slaves.
[01:45:42.865 --> 01:45:44.346]  They just repeat whatever I say.
[01:45:44.346 --> 01:45:46.548]  Is there no end to the scams they won't wake up to?
[01:45:46.548 --> 01:45:49.610]  You know, let's just continue raping them.
[01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:50.871]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:50.871 --> 01:45:53.093]  Show them what the other ones are thinking about.
[01:45:53.093 --> 01:45:56.555]  Oh, I got that Dine Corps payment for child kidnapping support.
[01:45:56.555 --> 01:45:57.516]  I gave them in the Congress.
[01:45:57.516 --> 01:45:58.517]  I was a great five million.
[01:45:58.517 --> 01:46:00.418]  They just put my bank account in Luxembourg.
[01:46:00.418 --> 01:46:03.080]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:03.821]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:46:03.821 --> 01:46:07.803]  I can't wait to go to that slave facility this evening.
[01:46:07.803 --> 01:46:08.104]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:10.555 --> 01:46:12.916]  Oh, there's nothing these gullible scum won't buy into.
[01:46:12.916 --> 01:46:15.696]  Ah, it's so much fun.
[01:46:15.696 --> 01:46:18.197]  Oh, I'm financing four or five mistresses right now.
[01:46:18.197 --> 01:46:20.758]  I don't know how I can pay for it all.
[01:46:20.758 --> 01:46:21.318]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:21.318 --> 01:46:28.580]  I'll just demand some more kickbacks from my... That would be a meeting with the members of Congress up there.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:32.801]  Barney Frank would be up there thinking, how many underage brothels am I running?
[01:46:32.801 --> 01:46:34.581]  Or as it came out, he was running underage brothels in the 80s.
[01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:34.861]  Oh, man.
[01:46:37.527 --> 01:46:40.089]  Oh, I'm getting so old.
[01:46:40.089 --> 01:46:42.430]  I've got to get another shipment of Viagra in.
[01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:45.432]  Oh, so many children to rape, so little time.
[01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:49.514]  Oh.
[01:46:49.514 --> 01:46:54.857]  You could have a pop-up with John P. Holdren up there going, I'm such a vicious control freak.
[01:46:54.857 --> 01:46:56.117]  I hate everyone.
[01:46:56.117 --> 01:46:56.978]  I hate myself.
[01:46:56.978 --> 01:46:58.479]  I'm frustrated at life.
[01:46:58.479 --> 01:47:03.722]  At least the general scum don't know we're poisoning the water and the GMO food to sterilize them and give them cancer.
[01:47:04.542 --> 01:47:07.284]  My neighbor the other day gave me a weird look.
[01:47:07.284 --> 01:47:09.386]  He's a big football type guy.
[01:47:09.386 --> 01:47:10.106]  Big jock.
[01:47:10.106 --> 01:47:11.287]  He's six foot four.
[01:47:11.287 --> 01:47:12.288]  I hate him.
[01:47:12.288 --> 01:47:15.571]  I'm a little nerd with a little dome head.
[01:47:15.571 --> 01:47:18.092]  I sure show him though.
[01:47:18.092 --> 01:47:19.454]  He doesn't know my treatise.
[01:47:20.154 --> 01:47:35.437]  Was adopted by the British model in the late 1970s for the current global extermination model, then adopted by the Earth Challenge in 79, and then by the Earth Charter in 92, and then we're terraforming and poisoning all of them.
[01:47:35.437 --> 01:47:39.118]  He's not given the antidote treatments that I and others are.
[01:47:39.118 --> 01:47:41.218]  Look at that stupid jock.
[01:47:41.218 --> 01:47:42.918]  Look at his stupid wife and kids.
[01:47:42.918 --> 01:47:44.919]  Oh, he thinks his wife's better looking than mine.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.789]  I'm killing him right now.
[01:47:49.789 --> 01:47:52.636]  Look at these ugly hunchback people at the shopping mall.
[01:47:52.636 --> 01:47:54.942]  I can't believe I'm forced to go over here to get a...
[01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:57.050]  We're good.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:25.243]  When I go to my confirmation hearing, Jay Rockefeller said I walk on water and worship me.
[01:48:25.243 --> 01:48:26.363]  He loves me.
[01:48:26.363 --> 01:48:29.885]  They love my scientific plan that they adopted.
[01:48:29.885 --> 01:48:32.386]  It was because it was on the current model.
[01:48:32.386 --> 01:48:35.748]  I'm a rock star.
[01:48:35.748 --> 01:48:38.350]  My plan is killing people everywhere.
[01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:43.011]  Their cants are good, they're ugly and stupid, and I've got to get rid of them.
[01:48:43.011 --> 01:48:44.891]  It's my right.
[01:48:44.891 --> 01:48:48.192]  I just love pressing on the subconscious nerve of power.
[01:48:48.192 --> 01:49:00.855]  Just every moment I drive around or I sleep or I'm at my desk or I'm giving little whispering orders to my staff that I all hate, that are too stupid to understand the compartmentalized system or even read all the textbooks I've written.
[01:49:00.855 --> 01:49:06.716]  I wish they'd give us a green light for the mega-death-kill weapons we've developed to race pacifics.
[01:49:07.116 --> 01:49:08.737]  Imagine how great it would be.
[01:49:08.737 --> 01:49:10.459]  I'll be meeting with Bill today at lunch.
[01:49:10.459 --> 01:49:14.342]  We'll be able to talk about how beautiful the world would be if we wipe everyone out.
[01:49:14.342 --> 01:49:21.289]  Oh, there's all those great TV shows on Discovery Channel and that best-selling book we're promoting right now about the world after humans and how great it's gonna be.
[01:49:21.289 --> 01:49:29.416]  Oh, there's another professor in the Herald Sun I saw yesterday saying our extinction is forecast for the next hundred years and how great it'll be when all humans are dead.
[01:49:29.916 --> 01:49:32.537]  Oh God, we're teaching the kids at least right now.
[01:49:32.537 --> 01:49:32.958]  It's great.
[01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:35.139]  I like that Dr. Eric Pionk at UT.
[01:49:35.139 --> 01:49:39.561]  He said every one of us will have to bury nine people when the weaponized super Ebola is released.
[01:49:39.561 --> 01:49:41.062]  And how great it's gonna be.
[01:49:41.062 --> 01:49:43.023]  I like him too.
[01:49:43.023 --> 01:49:45.064]  But he admits he's not as smart as me.
[01:49:45.064 --> 01:49:47.645]  And he's gonna have to be one of the ones that dies.
[01:49:47.645 --> 01:49:50.786]  The ones I really like are the ones that bow to my intellect.
[01:49:50.786 --> 01:49:53.608]  And the ones that really understand what I'm gonna be doing to everybody.
[01:49:54.408 --> 01:49:57.891]  Look at these stupid people watching sports and football all day.
[01:49:57.891 --> 01:49:59.792]  They have no idea what we're doing.
[01:49:59.792 --> 01:50:01.593]  They have no hope or no prayer.
[01:50:01.593 --> 01:50:05.276]  Yeah, there's people like Alex Jones out there exposing me.
[01:50:05.276 --> 01:50:06.917]  But they'll never get away with it.
[01:50:06.917 --> 01:50:09.458]  Last night I was at my parents' house.
[01:50:09.458 --> 01:50:11.480]  I dropped by, uh, and, um...
[01:50:13.444 --> 01:50:23.349]  Just to say hi for about 10 minutes, and MSNBC was on, and they were going, yes, there's very dangerous people on the new right, with all these wild conspiracy theories about world government, and they're gaining prominence.
[01:50:23.349 --> 01:50:26.751]  And right before the guy said that, I said, you know, they're talking about me, mom.
[01:50:26.751 --> 01:50:28.452]  And then next, they actually went into me.
[01:50:28.452 --> 01:50:32.534]  I don't even watch TV.
[01:50:32.534 --> 01:50:35.355]  I walk in, she's cooking dinner, because the parents live right off the road.
[01:50:35.355 --> 01:50:37.857]  I drive down to go home.
[01:50:37.857 --> 01:50:38.317]  I grab a
[01:50:41.874 --> 01:50:46.099]  French spring water out of the refrigerator, start guzzling it.
[01:50:46.099 --> 01:50:48.542]  But hey, do you like looking into the mind of John P. Holdren?
[01:50:48.542 --> 01:50:53.108]  You like that?
[01:50:53.108 --> 01:50:54.770]  Oh, look at that young lady on her bike.
[01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:56.432]  She thinks she's young and beautiful.
[01:50:56.432 --> 01:50:59.516]  She doesn't know we've injected her with cancer viruses that'll rock those breasts!
[01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:04.833]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:51:04.833 --> 01:51:08.736]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:51:08.736 --> 01:51:12.459]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:51:12.459 --> 01:51:19.684]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[01:51:19.684 --> 01:51:20.044]  I think so.
[01:51:34.735 --> 01:51:35.015]  I think so.
[01:52:01.328 --> 01:52:02.629]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:08.212]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.212 --> 01:52:13.236]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.236 --> 01:52:18.799]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.799 --> 01:52:24.023]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.023 --> 01:52:25.904]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:26.291 --> 01:52:26.691]  We're good to go!
[01:52:54.079 --> 01:52:57.994]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.994 --> 01:53:00.383]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.351 --> 01:53:04.352]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:04.352 --> 01:53:06.413]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:06.413 --> 01:53:09.175]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:09.175 --> 01:53:11.396]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:11.396 --> 01:53:12.816]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:12.816 --> 01:53:14.717]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:14.717 --> 01:53:16.638]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:16.638 --> 01:53:18.619]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:18.619 --> 01:53:22.321]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:22.321 --> 01:53:30.065]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:30.065 --> 01:53:30.665]  Sinofresh.

[01:54:07.156 --> 01:54:08.997]  Watch me!
[01:54:08.997 --> 01:54:10.979]  Watch me!
[01:54:10.979 --> 01:54:12.820]  I got it!
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:14.782]  Watch me!
[01:54:14.782 --> 01:54:15.623]  I got it!
[01:54:15.623 --> 01:54:18.265]  Now, when you read H.G.
[01:54:18.265 --> 01:54:23.669]  Wells books, you read Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, Shaw,
[01:54:29.773 --> 01:54:30.753]  Bertrand Russell.
[01:54:30.753 --> 01:54:33.894]  That's all they talk about is how it's so hard to look at you.
[01:54:33.894 --> 01:54:34.554]  You're pathetic.
[01:54:34.554 --> 01:54:35.154]  You're stupid.
[01:54:35.154 --> 01:54:37.435]  They wish they could get rid of you.
[01:54:37.435 --> 01:54:38.675]  And that's what they're into.
[01:54:38.675 --> 01:54:48.617]  And imagine the power trip they have just driving around knowing that they're force medicating us with steroids and toxins and knowing what they're doing.
[01:54:48.617 --> 01:54:49.757]  And it's just sick.
[01:54:49.757 --> 01:54:52.578]  They're a bunch of mad scientist control freaks.
[01:54:53.843 --> 01:54:58.405]  Their parents and their parents funded Hitler on record!
[01:54:58.405 --> 01:55:00.866]  Planned Parenthood was loved by Hitler.
[01:55:00.866 --> 01:55:04.008]  They financed him.
[01:55:04.008 --> 01:55:05.188]  And I was talking to Texas Monthly.
[01:55:05.188 --> 01:55:07.369]  They go, well, they're not financing him now.
[01:55:07.369 --> 01:55:10.171]  I mean, they're not doing that now.
[01:55:10.171 --> 01:55:13.172]  Just grow up and wake up.
[01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:16.254]  Liberals, conservatives, you're all part of a controlled paradigm, folks.
[01:55:17.424 --> 01:55:28.477]  And just watching Bill Gates and John P. Holdren and Robert Ehrlich and all of these people, they are your enemies, okay?
[01:55:28.477 --> 01:55:32.242]  They are attacking you and your family and they're getting away with it.
[01:55:32.242 --> 01:55:33.063]  And I've had enough of it.
[01:55:35.831 --> 01:55:37.011]  I mean, look at this article.
[01:55:37.011 --> 01:55:40.133]  UN warns of gangs' global muscle.
[01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:41.553]  That's like Greenspan warning.
[01:55:41.553 --> 01:55:43.474]  Oh, we're a little too much debt.
[01:55:43.474 --> 01:55:45.735]  We're going to go into a depression.
[01:55:45.735 --> 01:55:49.096]  UN warns of gangs' global muscle.
[01:55:49.096 --> 01:55:57.860]  International crime networks now enjoy such an extreme and extensive reach that the gangs behind them must be regarded as a significant economic power, says the United Nations report.
[01:55:59.226 --> 01:56:01.948]  Well, that is really a big gang telling the truth.
[01:56:01.948 --> 01:56:05.071]  The UN is caught everywhere they are running child kidnapping rings.
[01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:07.373]  Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Middle East.
[01:56:07.373 --> 01:56:09.074]  I mean, just search the term.
[01:56:09.074 --> 01:56:10.355]  UN child kidnapping.
[01:56:10.355 --> 01:56:12.257]  UN sex trade.
[01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:14.579]  They're caught money laundering, drug dealing.
[01:56:14.579 --> 01:56:18.121]  They run UN bases to run whores and drugs, okay?
[01:56:18.121 --> 01:56:19.382]  Period.
[01:56:19.382 --> 01:56:21.384]  How many CIA aircraft crash?
[01:56:21.384 --> 01:56:23.246]  Happens every few years full of cocaine and heroin.
[01:56:23.246 --> 01:56:23.486]  Pure.
[01:56:27.168 --> 01:56:31.491]  National security, diplomatic immunity, is about narcotics trafficking.
[01:56:31.491 --> 01:56:38.955]  How many UN diplomats and even low-level employees have been caught with women and children in chains in their houses?
[01:56:38.955 --> 01:56:40.416]  Filming porn?
[01:56:40.416 --> 01:56:41.816]  Filming snuff films?
[01:56:41.816 --> 01:56:43.858]  And it always comes out as just a little blurb.
[01:56:43.858 --> 01:56:46.399]  Oh, UN official caught with three women chained.
[01:56:46.399 --> 01:56:48.820]  The women were dilapidated, living in feces.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:49.461]  New York City.
[01:56:52.972 --> 01:57:01.078]  A local police officer was relieved of duty because he saw something suspicious and went into the apartment hearing the cries.
[01:57:01.078 --> 01:57:06.922]  The officer has now been relieved of command and may be fired for violating diplomatic protocol.
[01:57:06.922 --> 01:57:10.665]  I mean, the New World Order is a diplomatic immunity.
[01:57:10.665 --> 01:57:16.229]  Global corporations and the UN just running around, stealing organs, robbing, killing.
[01:57:17.375 --> 01:57:18.415]  And so when you hear the U.N.
[01:57:18.415 --> 01:57:21.296]  saying, I mean as soon as I saw this headline last night about U.N.
[01:57:21.296 --> 01:57:27.118]  warrants of ganged global muscle, I immediately knew what I was going to read.
[01:57:27.118 --> 01:57:28.659]  And I read the article and there it was.
[01:57:28.659 --> 01:57:30.919]  We need more funding for Interpol.
[01:57:30.919 --> 01:57:32.080]  We need more tracking.
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.400]  We need more taxes.
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:34.080]  We need the U.N.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.361]  to run all air travel and have a tax on it.
[01:57:36.361 --> 01:57:40.102]  We need to have total, you know, oh we've got to fight the gangs.
[01:57:40.102 --> 01:57:44.404]  Satan, you must hire Satan to defeat one of the lower demons.
[01:57:46.701 --> 01:57:52.323]  This just in, Satan has been hired to fight Beelzebub.
[01:57:52.323 --> 01:57:57.505]  This just in, the Federal Reserve's got new reforms that'll stop the big banks from robbing us.
[01:57:57.505 --> 01:57:58.625]  Oh, really?
[01:57:58.625 --> 01:57:59.586]  What's the Federal Reserve?
[01:57:59.586 --> 01:58:03.227]  A private holding company, consortium of the top six mega banks.
[01:58:07.745 --> 01:58:12.408]  I mean, you've really got to have it hit you between the eyes, just how criminal this is.
[01:58:12.408 --> 01:58:19.232]  We have Chicago mafia crew running the White House right now, openly getting their houses paid for by BP.
[01:58:19.232 --> 01:58:21.574]  By the way, the BP chairman's been forced to step down.
[01:58:21.574 --> 01:58:23.515]  They'll give us a new puppet.
[01:58:23.515 --> 01:58:24.656]  I guess it's like General Motors.
[01:58:24.656 --> 01:58:26.497]  Maybe he wasn't licking boots well enough.
[01:58:28.817 --> 01:58:30.497]  But this isn't a shakedown of BP.
[01:58:30.497 --> 01:58:33.598]  BP is at the top of the pyramid in the new oil or carbon scam.
[01:58:33.598 --> 01:58:35.759]  BP's name is being sacrificed.
[01:58:35.759 --> 01:58:38.039]  They'll just change their name to get the carbon tax.
[01:58:38.039 --> 01:58:39.099]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:58:39.099 --> 01:58:41.200]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.781]  Tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:58:43.781 --> 01:58:44.841]  Search no more.
[01:58:44.841 --> 01:58:46.161]  I'm told that it has everything.
[01:58:46.161 --> 01:58:49.142]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.891 --> 01:58:55.075]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:55.075 --> 01:59:01.480]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:08.867]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:08.867 --> 01:59:13.751]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:13.751 --> 01:59:15.873]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:59:18.675 --> 01:59:22.401]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:59:22.401 --> 01:59:26.128]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:26.658 --> 01:59:33.422]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:33.422 --> 01:59:37.305]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:37.305 --> 01:59:43.669]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:44.469]  Thank you.
[01:59:53.962 --> 01:59:56.368]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.368 --> 01:59:59.135]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.027 --> 02:00:07.348]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.348 --> 02:00:09.109]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:10.870]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:12.471]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:14.012]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.012 --> 02:00:18.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.214 --> 02:00:22.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.728 --> 02:00:33.831]  We're live, second half of the transmission now beginning.
[02:00:33.831 --> 02:00:36.073]  We've reached the waypoint, the point of no return.
[02:00:36.073 --> 02:00:37.594]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:37.594 --> 02:00:41.917]  We're simulcasting the second half of the radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:41.917 --> 02:00:44.019]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[02:00:44.019 --> 02:00:51.505]  We're taking your phone calls in the rest of this hour and interspersing it with important news.
[02:00:51.505 --> 02:00:54.188]  For those who just joined us, I've thrown the question out to listeners.
[02:00:56.496 --> 02:00:57.676]  The oil spill is serious.
[02:00:57.676 --> 02:01:00.277]  They're covering up the respiratory problems all over the Gulf.
[02:01:00.277 --> 02:01:01.837]  People are getting sick.
[02:01:01.837 --> 02:01:08.019]  They're not letting BP hired contractors wear respirators because that would alert the public to something happening.
[02:01:08.019 --> 02:01:12.100]  Just like I told firefighters and police the first few days of 9-11, don't wear a mask.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:15.421]  They later said there was no problem, you don't get any money.
[02:01:15.421 --> 02:01:16.641]  This is damage control.
[02:01:16.641 --> 02:01:21.122]  The BP CEO, Hayward, has been relieved of management duties.
[02:01:21.122 --> 02:01:22.862]  We're going to be covering that.
[02:01:22.862 --> 02:01:25.043]  But also, what is this distracting us from?
[02:01:25.783 --> 02:01:28.386]  Iran says they're going to try to run the Israeli blockade into Gaza.
[02:01:28.386 --> 02:01:29.587]  That's confirmed.
[02:01:29.587 --> 02:01:32.569]  Israel says they've got nuke subs off the coast of Iran.
[02:01:32.569 --> 02:01:33.330]  The U.S.
[02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:33.931]  and the U.N.
[02:01:33.931 --> 02:01:44.901]  are on the verge of passing sanctions to stop all ships in the different waterways, Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf and other areas, going in and out of Iran.
[02:01:44.901 --> 02:01:46.262]  An act of war.
[02:01:46.262 --> 02:01:48.964]  They say, the Iranians say, they're going to start seizing U.S.
[02:01:48.964 --> 02:01:49.245]  ships.
[02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:53.292]  They're going to start grabbing other ships.
[02:01:53.292 --> 02:01:54.913]  This is going to escalate quickly.
[02:01:54.913 --> 02:02:00.817]  So while the media is openly admitting that war could be imminent with Iran, that's back burner.
[02:02:00.817 --> 02:02:04.520]  That's back of the newspaper, even though the war is going to the front burner.
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:08.943]  So what else is this oil spill distracting us from?
[02:02:08.943 --> 02:02:12.765]  And of course, now it's coming out to the Coast Guard for five weeks straight.
[02:02:12.765 --> 02:02:20.171]  Won't let anybody go in and even drain oil out of estuaries because the federal government is God.
[02:02:21.107 --> 02:02:27.893]  It's like Katrina, for five plus days, no food, no water, stacked up in front of the sports dome.
[02:02:27.893 --> 02:02:30.775]  On the news for three days, people saying, can I have food and water?
[02:02:30.775 --> 02:02:32.176]  And troops saying no.
[02:02:32.176 --> 02:02:35.319]  It was a laboratory experiment to see what would happen.
[02:02:35.319 --> 02:02:40.023]  They wouldn't let people walk out on the highway that was high and dry.
[02:02:40.023 --> 02:02:41.824]  Police were ordered to shoot people.
[02:02:41.824 --> 02:02:42.304]  They were.
[02:02:42.304 --> 02:02:43.485]  Those cops were thrown in prison.
[02:02:44.934 --> 02:02:58.286]  That's like the White House ordering torture, and then a whole bunch of people going to prison who did torture, and then Bush comes out two weeks ago and says, I did order torture, I'd order it again, and he doesn't get in trouble, but then they send people that followed his orders to prison.
[02:02:58.286 --> 02:03:05.612]  Like, the cops were ordered, use lethal force, threat continuum, do not let people walk out on these highways, the feds say.
[02:03:05.612 --> 02:03:10.276]  The cops mow a bunch of people down, and were finally sent to prison last year for it.
[02:03:11.072 --> 02:03:12.353]  And they deserve to go to prison.
[02:03:12.353 --> 02:03:14.654]  You don't follow any legal order.
[02:03:14.654 --> 02:03:19.817]  I mean, if the government told you to run around and kill, you know, little kids, would you do it?
[02:03:19.817 --> 02:03:37.507]  I mean, if the government... Joseph Mengele had a German military attachment to his medical facility, and sometimes he wrote in his diary he would give little kids chocolate, ride out in his Mercedes with them, and have troops then shoot them in the head just for enjoyment in the morning.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:44.324]  I think with my coffee I'll kill some children, that's what I'm into.
[02:03:44.324 --> 02:03:47.345]  Should those German shoulders get in trouble for shooting the kids in the head?
[02:03:47.345 --> 02:03:48.166]  Yes.
[02:03:48.166 --> 02:03:49.127]  It's the same thing here.
[02:03:50.051 --> 02:03:53.653]  I don't want to hear Bobby Jindal complaining that the feds won't let him clean it up.
[02:03:53.653 --> 02:04:00.395]  Go out there and say, as the governor, we're going to clean this up on our seashore.
[02:04:00.395 --> 02:04:02.376]  This is state property right here.
[02:04:02.376 --> 02:04:03.857]  Coast Guard, get out of here!
[02:04:03.857 --> 02:04:06.578]  Or have the states have a convention.
[02:04:06.578 --> 02:04:08.599]  Or have the states speak up and say no.
[02:04:11.656 --> 02:04:13.998]  I mean, look, that's what the 10th Amendment's all about.
[02:04:13.998 --> 02:04:15.920]  The federal government's out of control.
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:28.571]  It's telling us who we can hire, who we can fire, what we can do, how big our house can be, how small it can be, when we can build a barn, when we can tear a barn down, when we can plant crops, when we can't, how many chickens we can have, everything!
[02:04:28.571 --> 02:04:37.199]  It is not the government's job, much less a remote federal government, bought and paid for by foreign interests, stealing money as fast as they can on every front.
[02:04:37.679 --> 02:04:43.763]  Alright, when I come back, Randy, Rita, Robert, Sam, Ronnie, your calls directly straight ahead on the other side of this break.

[02:04:55.271 --> 02:04:55.712]  Stay with us.
[02:05:05.015 --> 02:05:06.276]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.276 --> 02:05:09.920]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:12.443]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.443 --> 02:05:18.309]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.

[02:05:24.975 --> 02:05:30.919]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.919 --> 02:05:35.122]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.122 --> 02:05:39.424]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.424 --> 02:05:45.368]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.368 --> 02:05:48.930]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.930 --> 02:05:50.891]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.891 --> 02:05:51.332]  It's here.

[02:08:14.014 --> 02:08:18.218]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.218 --> 02:08:23.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.523 --> 02:08:29.208]  Well, the mayor of Memphis admits the NAFTA superhighway is real and will run through Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:08:29.208 --> 02:08:29.989]  That's coming up.
[02:08:31.448 --> 02:08:39.916]  The Icelandic parliament has passed a law to make Iceland a internet freedom zone against the encroaching tyranny against the internet worldwide.
[02:08:39.916 --> 02:08:42.219]  That's certainly exciting.
[02:08:42.219 --> 02:08:44.361]  That is all coming up.
[02:08:44.361 --> 02:08:48.344]  The CEO of BP has stepped down.
[02:08:49.568 --> 02:08:51.089]  Tony Hayward is being demoted.
[02:08:51.089 --> 02:09:09.438]  According to Britain's Sky News, BP Managing Director Bob Dudley will take over the day-to-day oversight of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, while BP's Chairman Carl Henrich Sovenberg, the small people comment fellow, will assume major PR duties.
[02:09:09.438 --> 02:09:10.399]  Yes, that's a good idea.
[02:09:11.857 --> 02:09:15.620]  You little scum, little people.
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:18.643]  No respirators for you cleaning up oil.
[02:09:18.643 --> 02:09:20.684]  Then we have to admit it killing you.
[02:09:20.684 --> 02:09:21.585]  No!
[02:09:21.585 --> 02:09:24.187]  You'll be just like firefighters in New York.
[02:09:24.187 --> 02:09:28.150]  We will call you ambulance chasers when you die of lung cancer.
[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:30.733]  When you die of asthma in one week.
[02:09:30.733 --> 02:09:31.773]  Little people.
[02:09:31.773 --> 02:09:34.316]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls as promised.
[02:09:34.316 --> 02:09:36.357]  Randy in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[02:09:36.357 --> 02:09:37.018]  Thanks for holding.
[02:09:37.782 --> 02:09:39.022]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[02:09:39.022 --> 02:09:41.523]  It's a pleasure to be on your show and talk to you.
[02:09:41.523 --> 02:09:44.383]  It's a pleasure to be part of the little people!
[02:09:44.383 --> 02:09:49.944]  Yeah, we're down here in catastrophic all-spill land, but I had a couple of things to say.
[02:09:49.944 --> 02:09:59.066]  I totally agree that it looks like they're setting up some kind of scenario like they had on 9-11 with the breathing issues around Ground Zero.
[02:09:59.066 --> 02:10:03.127]  You know, everybody should be wearing a respirator down here on these beaches, cleaning this up.
[02:10:05.399 --> 02:10:14.221]  I wouldn't worry about the PR aspect of it in the media, because I want to ask these people, what's more important, your life, or playing the PR game for BP?
[02:10:14.221 --> 02:10:21.463]  No, but BP's saying you will be fired if you do it, because for five weeks they've had people cleaning stuff up.
[02:10:21.463 --> 02:10:25.323]  Without them, people are getting sick, so they can't go back and say they were wrong.
[02:10:25.323 --> 02:10:31.745]  They have to say, no, you are fired if you wear a breathing apparatus, which makes them more liable, doesn't it?
[02:10:32.781 --> 02:10:38.222]  Yeah, well I mean, but the thing of it is, when you're offshore, I'm a little offshore hand, okay?
[02:10:38.222 --> 02:10:45.223]  I worked drilling rigs, I was a, you know, roughneck, I worked derricks, I drilled, and also into the production of it.
[02:10:45.223 --> 02:11:00.466]  What these people should be asking, whenever you gotta clean out a separator offshore, and you have to enter this vessel, you gotta dress up in biohazard gear, you gotta sniff it out, get all the gas out of it to clean the sand and everything out, and you have to wear respirators for that, and you don't even have active oil in there.
[02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:08.072]  But my brothers and my cousins are out working this still right now, and they're telling me it's as thick as peanut butter on top of the water.
[02:11:08.072 --> 02:11:15.994]  And so you have, you know, like you said, the chemicals, benzene, it could be H2S, could be a number of things, and you do not want to breathe this stuff.
[02:11:15.994 --> 02:11:29.137]  Because, I mean, yeah, they could be threatening to fire people, but I tell you what, if I'd be down there on that beach and they threatened to fire me because I want to wear a respirator, believe me, I'd be contacting a lawyer and there'd be some lawsuits coming.
[02:11:29.997 --> 02:11:41.765]  Well, Wired Magazine, AP, Reuters, and others are reporting BP is ordering mainly the minimum-wage poor people that are out there on the beach scooping up the oil-soaked seaweed, because it is the Sargasso season.
[02:11:41.765 --> 02:11:45.807]  And I look at them on the news, they're not wearing respirators.
[02:11:45.807 --> 02:11:50.270]  In most of the videos I see, they're not even wearing a mask, you know, to stop
[02:11:52.052 --> 02:11:57.056]  No, you're right, and from my experience in the oil field, I really believe this was a staged event.
[02:11:57.056 --> 02:12:00.499]  I mean, for the simple fact, they was on top of one of the biggest fines
[02:12:16.331 --> 02:12:24.618]  In the Gulf of Mexico in years, and then they're going to use substandard casing, substandard equipment to produce this well?
[02:12:24.618 --> 02:12:25.798]  I mean, it just don't make sense.
[02:12:25.798 --> 02:12:27.620]  They would have made all this money back.
[02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:33.925]  Why save money on the well when they'd have made all this money back once the well would have started flowing, say a month in or a month and a half.
[02:12:33.925 --> 02:12:39.049]  They would have made all their rig costs back, all the manpower labor back.
[02:12:41.934 --> 02:12:48.201]  Well, you know, I've been intending to do a special video report.
[02:12:48.201 --> 02:12:51.484]  I've done the research for it in the last week, but haven't produced it yet.
[02:12:51.484 --> 02:12:56.850]  A 15-20 minute special report where I just go over all the evidence in one spot, but
[02:12:57.751 --> 02:13:11.507]  It's the quotes of Halliburton, of the other two companies running the rig in concert, going back a month before, and then two weeks before, arguments beginning and saying, this is on record before it happened.
[02:13:11.507 --> 02:13:13.369]  And this has now been in the Coast Guard hearings.
[02:13:13.849 --> 02:13:17.633]  That we told them it was going to blow up, that this had never been done before.
[02:13:17.633 --> 02:13:23.478]  I don't understand the fracking and cement and the mud, but they're supposed to pump this down to secure the shaft.
[02:13:23.478 --> 02:13:25.820]  In fact, maybe you should explain it to me.
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:32.707]  And that they said, no, we're going to dump seawater in to hold the pressure down before we complete the well.
[02:13:32.707 --> 02:13:33.067]  And that
[02:13:35.469 --> 02:13:54.015]  Again, major newspapers, Reuters, Atlantic Monthly, have the quotes from the Coast Guard hearings, and I can't read this on air because of family reasons, but the quotes, I read some of it last week, minus the F-bombs and S-bombs, but the oil rig
[02:13:55.695 --> 02:14:00.717]  Uh, head and the ships that were there.
[02:14:00.717 --> 02:14:10.660]  So the head of the ships and that contingent, the supply ships and the head of the rig were on the phone to BP in front of all these witnesses saying, you fools!
[02:14:12.026 --> 02:14:14.208]  I told you this would blow up.
[02:14:14.208 --> 02:14:14.528]  It was 100%.
[02:14:14.528 --> 02:14:17.030]  There was no way to stop this.
[02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:18.191]  We told you.
[02:14:18.191 --> 02:14:23.836]  And so clearly, BP just told their employees it'd be like if the government wanted to ban fireworks.
[02:14:23.836 --> 02:14:25.937]  And so they went to the biggest fireworks factory in the U.S.
[02:14:25.937 --> 02:14:32.322]  and said to one of their employees, I want you to go in there with a flamethrower and start shooting it at all the fireworks.
[02:14:32.322 --> 02:14:36.225]  And the guys followed the orders and walked in with a flamethrower and did it.
[02:14:36.225 --> 02:14:39.048]  And then now Obama says ban fireworks factories.
[02:14:39.488 --> 02:14:41.310]  I mean, that's basically what they've done.
[02:14:41.310 --> 02:14:45.234]  Any way you cut it, they did this on purpose.
[02:14:45.234 --> 02:14:59.168]  And as I said 50 plus days ago, they're on record, Randy, saying that they want a carbon tax and that they want to bring in all their new green taxes and federalize and nationalize the oil companies.
[02:14:59.168 --> 02:15:03.011]  It's now happening and BP has teamed up with them to do this.
[02:15:03.712 --> 02:15:06.194]  So they'll get preferential monopoly treatment.
[02:15:06.194 --> 02:15:10.037]  They've always been... Again, I identified BP as key globalist years ago.
[02:15:10.037 --> 02:15:11.518]  I'm not just saying this now.
[02:15:11.518 --> 02:15:16.041]  They are the key globalist company financing this global green takeover.
[02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:18.042]  And notice it's them doing it.
[02:15:18.042 --> 02:15:23.046]  And now Obama, at the end of this, is going to end up basically nationalizing the oil companies.
[02:15:23.046 --> 02:15:23.386]  Go ahead.
[02:15:23.857 --> 02:15:26.638]  Yeah, wasn't that convenient how all that worked out for him?
[02:15:26.638 --> 02:15:28.859]  Well, a couple of points I want to make.
[02:15:28.859 --> 02:15:37.262]  My Allfield sources, and I got people in the Allfield family, I'm talking about company men, I'm talking about tool pushes, I'm talking about managers of Allfield companies.
[02:15:37.262 --> 02:15:43.084]  They're telling me the deepwater rigs, I'm talking about your drill ships, your semi-submersibles, they're heading out to golf.
[02:15:43.084 --> 02:15:46.965]  They're going to Brazil, they're going to Africa, they're seeking other jobs.
[02:15:46.965 --> 02:15:49.966]  But one of the other things I'm hearing is they're going to open up drilling to
[02:15:50.373 --> 02:16:00.996]  They're going to open up drilling off the California coast now, so some of these rigs are going to go to California because the California economy is such in the toilet.
[02:16:00.996 --> 02:16:02.677]  That's all been separately confirmed.
[02:16:02.677 --> 02:16:07.118]  I just had a breakup.
[02:16:07.118 --> 02:16:09.319]  Are we still on the air, John?
[02:16:09.319 --> 02:16:09.739]  Okay, good.
[02:16:09.739 --> 02:16:11.060]  Caller, are you still there?
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:11.400]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.920]  I'm still here.
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:14.181]  Okay, good.
[02:16:14.181 --> 02:16:16.941]  They are confirming drilling off the coast of California.
[02:16:16.941 --> 02:16:18.562]  They are confirming that the Russians
[02:16:29.801 --> 02:16:32.946]  Yeah, Ed, we broke up there a minute ago.
[02:16:32.946 --> 02:16:36.292]  Can you hear me?
[02:16:36.292 --> 02:16:36.533]  Hello?
[02:16:58.197 --> 02:17:07.524]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[02:17:07.524 --> 02:17:16.990]  No I'll stand my ground, won't be turned around.
[02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:21.233]  And I'll keep this world from dragging me down.
[02:17:27.106 --> 02:17:38.731]  Okay, again, the miracle of technology, the main networks in Minnesota, we're in Austin, we're going out on AM, FM, TV, shortwave, satellite, everything else, we're having a few glitches there.
[02:17:38.731 --> 02:17:40.812]  Randy, finish up your point.
[02:17:40.812 --> 02:17:42.413]  Yeah, I'm still with you, Alex.
[02:17:42.413 --> 02:17:46.675]  Yeah, the point is, it looks like they're going to be reversing the Louisiana economy now.
[02:17:46.675 --> 02:17:53.998]  They're going to be taking a lot of our deep-sea drilling now, and they're going to be putting it off the coast of California, so that's going to put Louisiana people out of work.
[02:17:54.597 --> 02:18:01.180]  But again, we were talking about the well coming in and everything and how everything was real weird how it came in.
[02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:02.400]  And that's true.
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:11.144]  And I'm sure the drilling contractor, you said the guys on the rig was just raising cane about, are you happy the well came in?
[02:18:11.144 --> 02:18:13.105]  All these guys are trained in well control.
[02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:19.275]  When, you know, these drilling contractors, they take their personnel, they train them in well control, they show them how to control a well.
[02:18:19.275 --> 02:18:21.577]  You know, every aspect of drilling a well.
[02:18:21.577 --> 02:18:29.865]  And these guys use it to... Yeah, but I've seen little oil wells being drilled in East Texas, and there's engineers and trucks and hundreds of people running around.
[02:18:29.865 --> 02:18:33.409]  And so, I mean, there's engineers on site for small gas wells.
[02:18:34.366 --> 02:18:41.450]  Well, and the thing of it is, Alex, they knew this well was taking a kick, because some of the tests they did, they had indications that it was getting gas back.
[02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:50.576]  Well, if they had pipe in the hole, what you want to do is, you want to circulate some heavier mud down that hole, vent that gas off, but you contain, you keep control of the well.
[02:18:51.409 --> 02:19:04.000]  And from what it looks like to me, they was trying to cement this well, whether they was doing a squeeze job, they was either squeezing some casein, but anyway, they was trying to put cement into a contaminated situation.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.964]  Cement don't harden, and it don't do it's job whenever it's contaminated with gas and oil.
[02:19:09.682 --> 02:19:20.907]  So evidently, and whatever idiot decided to displace the drilling mud out the riser and just go ahead and try to get off the well or whatever they was trying to do, he let the well come in.
[02:19:20.907 --> 02:19:23.008]  I mean, he was probably replacing
[02:19:23.696 --> 02:19:25.958]  Uh, 16 or 20 pound drill mud.
[02:19:25.958 --> 02:19:31.262]  Now what I'm talking about is a gallon of drill mud weighing about 16 to 20 pounds.
[02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:34.845]  Replacement with seawater that probably weighs about nine.
[02:19:34.845 --> 02:19:35.265]  Well guess what?
[02:19:35.265 --> 02:19:36.166]  No, that's what I was going to say.
[02:19:36.166 --> 02:19:41.991]  No, this is in the Coast Guard testimony that they said if you dump water in it is going to
[02:19:43.852 --> 02:19:45.473]  Explode and cause a fire.
[02:19:45.473 --> 02:19:46.854]  The well is going to come in.
[02:19:46.854 --> 02:19:52.279]  And BP from Houston, they won't say who it was, said you will dump water in now.
[02:19:52.279 --> 02:19:53.359]  Stay there briefly, Randy.
[02:19:53.359 --> 02:19:55.301]  Then we're going to go to Rita, Robert, Sam, Ronnie.
[02:19:55.301 --> 02:19:56.141]  But this is important.
[02:19:56.141 --> 02:19:58.023]  No, I have the Coast Guard testimony.
[02:19:58.023 --> 02:19:59.124]  Anybody can go read it.
[02:19:59.124 --> 02:20:00.305]  This is what the court found.
[02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:10.754]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:10.754 --> 02:20:14.316]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:20:14.316 --> 02:20:23.900]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.

[02:22:02.307 --> 02:22:03.329]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:03.329 --> 02:22:08.857]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.857 --> 02:22:09.417]  I get it.
[02:22:09.417 --> 02:22:18.771]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:20.432]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:20.432 --> 02:22:28.896]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.896 --> 02:22:32.298]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:32.298 --> 02:22:36.560]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:38.161]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:38.161 --> 02:22:41.563]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:41.563 --> 02:22:45.725]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.925 --> 02:22:46.827]  You should, too.
[02:22:46.827 --> 02:22:47.968]  Find out what they know.

[02:24:13.533 --> 02:24:16.935]  We do have a special guest joining us in the next hour.
[02:24:16.935 --> 02:24:19.556]  Randy, finishing up the points you were making.
[02:24:19.556 --> 02:24:22.218]  Yes, the Coast Guard hearing with the witnesses.
[02:24:22.938 --> 02:24:23.218]  Fine.
[02:24:38.595 --> 02:24:39.255]  I don't get it, Alex.
[02:24:39.255 --> 02:24:40.696]  This is a plea to my governor.
[02:24:40.696 --> 02:24:41.377]  You know, Governor Jindal.
[02:24:41.377 --> 02:24:42.237]  Please step up to the plate.
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:11.482]  And get involved with this and don't let the Feds control this.
[02:25:11.482 --> 02:25:12.963]  Don't let BP control this.
[02:25:12.963 --> 02:25:16.466]  I mean, you're talking about our livelihood, you know, our coasts.
[02:25:16.466 --> 02:25:18.507]  I mean, this devastates us in every way.
[02:25:18.507 --> 02:25:22.790]  I mean, you got so many people across Louisiana that love to go red fishing, speckled trout fishing.
[02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:26.612]  You got shrimpers out here that their livelihood, you know, depends on it.
[02:25:26.612 --> 02:25:32.036]  I mean, that BP exec, I heard one of them said that there's other parts of the world that he can get shrimp.
[02:25:32.594 --> 02:25:33.878]  Well, you know that D.P.
[02:25:33.878 --> 02:25:35.041]  exec that said that?
[02:25:35.041 --> 02:25:38.893]  Yeah, he still has a paycheck and everything, but our Louisiana Shrimpers...
[02:25:39.455 --> 02:25:42.998]  Or just trying to get by from week to week, month to month?
[02:25:42.998 --> 02:25:47.642]  Well, my question is, what is Jindal doing in Louisiana other than complaining?
[02:25:47.642 --> 02:25:50.605]  What is Haley Barber doing in Mississippi?
[02:25:50.605 --> 02:25:52.186]  Yeah, they complain.
[02:25:52.186 --> 02:25:58.832]  They've got the authority under the 9th and 10th Amendment to protect themselves, just like Arizona does, from open borders and crime.
[02:25:58.832 --> 02:26:02.075]  They've got a right to go out there and stop that oil.
[02:26:02.075 --> 02:26:05.718]  What business does the federal government have having armed Coast Guard
[02:26:08.580 --> 02:26:13.445]  That's exactly right.
[02:26:13.445 --> 02:26:18.049]  And Governor Jindal, gotta remember, that's the whole reason he was elected in this last election.
[02:26:18.049 --> 02:26:21.132]  Because he wasn't supposed to follow the status quo.
[02:26:21.132 --> 02:26:24.295]  That he was gonna do things different for Louisiana.
[02:26:24.295 --> 02:26:24.876]  You know?
[02:26:24.876 --> 02:26:26.677]  Cut the corruption, different things like that.
[02:26:26.677 --> 02:26:28.219]  He ran on that type of platform.
[02:26:28.832 --> 02:26:34.417]  And they need to step up to the plate and just start taking charge because they could have contained this thing from the beginning.
[02:26:34.417 --> 02:26:42.743]  I'll guarantee you if the governor went out there with ships and told the Coast Guard to back off, Obama would back off.
[02:26:42.743 --> 02:26:44.744]  There's no way he could win that PR fight.
[02:26:44.744 --> 02:26:47.387]  But they won't do it because it's all inside baseball.
[02:26:47.387 --> 02:26:49.908]  But going back to this Coast Guard report, it's been out for two weeks now.
[02:26:50.909 --> 02:26:53.070]  Where they talk about dumping water in.
[02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:55.711]  Briefly, because I need to get to other calls and I appreciate your time.
[02:26:55.711 --> 02:27:02.433]  Briefly, what is concrete used for versus mud versus seawater?
[02:27:02.433 --> 02:27:06.554]  And why were they so mad on the rig when they said we're going to use seawater?
[02:27:06.554 --> 02:27:10.555]  I mean, the court hearing says that that wouldn't hold the pressure down and then it would explode.
[02:27:10.555 --> 02:27:11.896]  But, I mean, elaborate on that.
[02:27:12.489 --> 02:27:23.492]  Well, it sounds like the BP or whatever, the engineers, wanted to put seawater into the well, into the well bore, before they had total control of the well.
[02:27:23.492 --> 02:27:39.217]  Evidently, I don't know if they had drill pipe in the well, because, I mean, I don't know anybody that was on the rig, and I could have found this out, but evidently they was doing maybe a cement job, and cement in a string of casing or something, or they was trying to plug the top of the well so they could move
[02:27:39.725 --> 02:27:40.526]  We're good to go.
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:05.821]  No, that's admitted.
[02:28:05.821 --> 02:28:13.027]  They were doing a cement job and then, quote, stopped using mud and they ordered water be injected, but it wasn't engineers.
[02:28:13.027 --> 02:28:15.809]  In the record, it's engineers saying, I don't want to do this.
[02:28:15.809 --> 02:28:19.332]  It was BP in Houston telling them what to do.
[02:28:19.332 --> 02:28:29.601]  Well, that, it was insane because if they was getting a kick with gas and they knew they was getting gas, they knew dang good and well that that cement job wasn't going to hold because it was getting contaminated.
[02:28:29.983 --> 02:28:31.585]  With gas and oil.
[02:28:31.585 --> 02:28:33.066]  So it wasn't going to set in place.
[02:28:33.066 --> 02:28:44.316]  So what they do is, when they're ready to move off a location, you put a plug inside the casing, you plug the well to where it holds the pressure back, underneath the plug, then you put a layer of cement on top of these.
[02:28:44.316 --> 02:28:46.198]  Sometimes you may put a couple of plugs.
[02:28:46.198 --> 02:28:51.303]  You may put a couple of plugs, depending on what your downhole pressures were, to be able to contain this well.
[02:28:51.303 --> 02:28:54.886]  And once this well is contained, and is shut in and is cemented,
[02:28:55.327 --> 02:28:59.230]  Then you can get off the riser pipe that's going all the way to the seafloor.
[02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:02.573]  You can even take, you can even take the BOPs off.
[02:29:02.573 --> 02:29:05.616]  And what I'm understanding, they had defective BOPs.
[02:29:05.616 --> 02:29:15.805]  They should have did this a long time ago, was put a cement plug down there and get those defective BOPs off of there and put a good set of BOPs that didn't have leaks.
[02:29:15.805 --> 02:29:20.288]  Because what I understand, at some point in time, they were circulating rubber bits up.
[02:29:20.288 --> 02:29:22.010]  Like, you know, little bits of rubber.
[02:29:22.577 --> 02:29:24.759]  What that tells them, that's the seals.
[02:29:24.759 --> 02:29:26.260]  That's the seals inside the BOPs.
[02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:28.082]  They were circulating back up over the coast.
[02:29:28.082 --> 02:29:42.513]  Well, no, that's the word in the Coast Guard hearings is that there were engineers, helicopters, repair ships just buzzing around that rig when it blew up because the orders they'd been given had already screwed it up and it was leaking.
[02:29:42.513 --> 02:29:43.694]  We'll come back with more calls.
[02:29:43.694 --> 02:29:44.195]  Stay with us.
[02:29:44.195 --> 02:29:44.995]  This is Key Info.
[02:29:44.995 --> 02:29:45.476]  Straight ahead.
[02:29:51.713 --> 02:29:55.616]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.616 --> 02:30:01.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:04.682]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.682 --> 02:30:10.006]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:10.006 --> 02:30:12.047]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:12.047 --> 02:30:17.051]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:17.051 --> 02:30:18.231]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.231 --> 02:30:18.972]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.352 --> 02:30:21.234]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.234 --> 02:30:22.295]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.295 --> 02:30:24.517]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.517 --> 02:30:25.838]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.838 --> 02:30:27.379]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.379 --> 02:30:32.644]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.644 --> 02:30:35.787]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:40.048]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:40.048 --> 02:30:41.268]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.268 --> 02:30:42.169]  We don't know.
[02:30:42.169 --> 02:30:43.269]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.269 --> 02:30:44.189]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.189 --> 02:30:45.289]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.289 --> 02:30:48.350]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:48.350 --> 02:30:50.531]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:50.531 --> 02:30:51.551]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:05.203]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.203 --> 02:31:06.123]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:09.546]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.546 --> 02:31:10.406]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.406 --> 02:31:15.309]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.309 --> 02:31:16.050]  It's true.
[02:31:16.050 --> 02:31:20.913]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.913 --> 02:31:21.733]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.733 --> 02:31:25.336]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.336 --> 02:31:29.018]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.218 --> 02:31:30.019]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.019 --> 02:31:32.782]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.782 --> 02:31:36.466]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.466 --> 02:31:37.267]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.267 --> 02:31:41.412]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.412 --> 02:31:46.177]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:55.358 --> 02:32:55.818]  Thank you.
[02:33:26.471 --> 02:33:31.736]  Okay, I just spent two segments with that caller because they had a lot of key info, but let's try to hurry through your calls right now.
[02:33:31.736 --> 02:33:33.298]  Rita in Illinois.
[02:33:33.298 --> 02:33:35.400]  Thank you for joining us, Rita.
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:36.201]  What's on your mind today?
[02:33:37.142 --> 02:33:59.831]  Hi Alex, well you mentioned a little bit of what I was calling about and then first of all before I say what I want to say is that you know 1941 there's a video out there on YouTube it's called Rudolph Diesel and Henry Ford against petroleum he made a hemp car that ran on hemp in 1941 was almost indestructible the videos out there but you know the Coast Guard turns back these barges
[02:34:00.606 --> 02:34:01.707]  Or else what?
[02:34:01.707 --> 02:34:02.348]  And you know what?
[02:34:02.348 --> 02:34:05.311]  Let's see if they got the stones to open up on those barges.
[02:34:05.311 --> 02:34:07.113]  It's time to either be mice or men.
[02:34:07.113 --> 02:34:08.014]  Clean the oil up.
[02:34:08.014 --> 02:34:09.875]  They're gonna die one way or the other.
[02:34:09.875 --> 02:34:13.319]  They're gonna die from the carcinogens and the poisons and all the animals are dead.
[02:34:13.812 --> 02:34:17.014]  Let's see if the Coast Guard can open fire on those people.
[02:34:17.014 --> 02:34:31.662]  But notice these lawyers with 9-11 in the deadly dust, or with the deadly carcinogens that the EPA admits everybody's breathing, even inland, and BP and the Feds say, no, there's no problem, you're not allowed to wear respirators.
[02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:33.243]  They love killing you slow.
[02:34:33.243 --> 02:34:39.846]  They love something they can lawyer and deny later and abscond and twist.
[02:34:41.107 --> 02:34:43.309]  Confused.
[02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:50.294]  And I just hate to see the Coast Guard put in this position, but the Coast Guard shouldn't follow those orders.
[02:34:50.294 --> 02:34:58.239]  I mean, if they're told by the Obama people and the BP people, hey, we want this to be as bad as it can be, obviously they're not telling them that, but that's the main reason.
[02:34:58.239 --> 02:35:00.260]  We want to get our carbon tax through.
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:02.102]  It's a diversion from the economy.
[02:35:02.102 --> 02:35:05.464]  It's a diversion from our preparations with war, with Iran.
[02:35:05.464 --> 02:35:09.207]  You know, they just shouldn't follow those orders to go up and stop
[02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:12.794]  Local communities out there cleaning up the oil themselves.
[02:35:12.794 --> 02:35:16.482]  This just shows how we have no freedom in this country.
[02:35:16.482 --> 02:35:17.244]  Anything else, Rita?
[02:35:17.892 --> 02:35:20.353]  Well, didn't you say, he who fires first, loses?
[02:35:20.353 --> 02:35:22.014]  Make them fire first, because you know what?
[02:35:22.014 --> 02:35:23.955]  These people are just going to clean up the oil.
[02:35:23.955 --> 02:35:26.297]  Enough dead animals already.
[02:35:26.297 --> 02:35:27.217]  Enough dead animals.
[02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:28.618]  Well, I know what the feds will do.
[02:35:28.618 --> 02:35:29.518]  They won't fire.
[02:35:29.518 --> 02:35:36.622]  They'll wait until the boats land and then they'll arrest the people and tell them you're going to go to jail for 20 years if you don't plead guilty.
[02:35:36.622 --> 02:35:39.864]  But it just, look, the government wants us as prisoners.
[02:35:39.864 --> 02:35:40.585]  Everything
[02:35:41.505 --> 02:35:43.367]  Everything has to be okayed by them.
[02:35:43.367 --> 02:35:46.970]  We are the opposite of what America was founded to be.
[02:35:46.970 --> 02:35:48.451]  This is cancer.
[02:35:48.451 --> 02:35:51.914]  We have to get rid of this out-of-control federal government.
[02:35:51.914 --> 02:35:53.756]  It is not run by the federal government.
[02:35:53.756 --> 02:36:03.264]  It is run by offshore interests that have gotten away with murder, who've committed millions of different types of crimes over and over again, and so they've said, hey, let's just go for broke.
[02:36:03.264 --> 02:36:05.406]  We have to realize the stakes here.
[02:36:05.406 --> 02:36:07.988]  We have an enemy that knows no limit.
[02:36:08.812 --> 02:36:09.973]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:36:09.973 --> 02:36:15.138]  Real quick, before I get into what I was going to tell you, it was breaking news on Drudge that
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:33.884]  There was a bomb threat called into your Austin Capitol building.
[02:36:49.016 --> 02:37:00.622]  They even tried to set us up for that, evidence showed, and then it turned out a federal informant set up people to firebomb from Austin at the RNC in Minnesota, and that came out was a federal operation.
[02:37:00.622 --> 02:37:04.184]  So this is just probably some mental patient or some Fed.
[02:37:04.184 --> 02:37:10.147]  The Feds do these bomb threats all the time just to, you know, scare their minions, but anything else?
[02:37:10.147 --> 02:37:11.508]  Yes.
[02:37:11.508 --> 02:37:14.930]  I'll tell you, I've been feeling like I've been living in the twilight zone up here.
[02:37:14.930 --> 02:37:18.412]  There's so much weird stuff going on, let's say.
[02:37:19.071 --> 02:37:24.693]  I've seen foreign troops up here as far as their transports.
[02:37:24.693 --> 02:37:45.520]  They've got to be Eastern European, more of a German or Czechoslovakian or Romanian camouflage pattern with the international license plate in the front, the flat-fronted Mercedes troop transports.
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:48.501]  I live out in the middle of nowhere and I'm nowhere near any airport.
[02:37:48.973 --> 02:37:50.434]  You're talking about a B-52 or a B-2?
[02:37:50.434 --> 02:37:50.674]  Yeah!
[02:37:50.674 --> 02:37:53.355]  They're practicing bombing runs in the Ohio Valley!
[02:38:20.037 --> 02:38:22.800]  I mean, I've seen three practices so far.
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:28.046]  It was so close to ground I could see the rivets on the plane.
[02:38:28.046 --> 02:38:31.410]  Well, let me comment on that, Robert, and I appreciate your call.
[02:38:33.135 --> 02:38:38.478]  I sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas, and I was going to have them on today, but at the end of the show, Rob Dew said, can we do it next week?
[02:38:38.478 --> 02:38:44.542]  That way I'll have time to get some of the video of the 20 plus hours they shot over four or five days.
[02:38:44.542 --> 02:38:46.343]  And he'll have time to get all the documents together.
[02:38:46.343 --> 02:38:50.726]  But he was showing me what the National Guard and regular army gave them.
[02:38:50.726 --> 02:38:57.691]  He went to a federally sponsored Homeland Security five day drill Sunday through Thursday in Chicago.
[02:38:58.892 --> 02:39:06.658]  And in the literature online from the Army, it said the Army will be working with local police in drug and gun interdiction.
[02:39:06.658 --> 02:39:15.664]  Remember about a year ago, Blagojevich, right before that scandal started, he was on CBS TV saying, I'm going to use troops door-to-door to confiscate guns.
[02:39:15.664 --> 02:39:20.648]  And then now, about a month ago, another state senator came out and called for that.
[02:39:20.648 --> 02:39:22.590]  So my guys go to these drills.
[02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:24.091]  The troops don't even hide it.
[02:39:25.128 --> 02:39:35.534]  Because back when I caught stuff like this on tape in the late 90s, they would find out I was there and threaten me, have police throw me off mainline streets, California.
[02:39:35.534 --> 02:39:46.199]  We had camera guys up in Hebron, Maryland, with the police walk up, in Maryland, with Marines that point machine guns at them and say, stop filming us.
[02:39:46.199 --> 02:39:50.802]  They had local kids looking for the, quote, militia people in the mock drill.
[02:39:51.809 --> 02:40:03.477]  Then last year I had a National Guard colonel on from Iowa who they admitted they were doing gun confiscation takeover drills about a lockdown Arcadia and that's in my film Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[02:40:03.477 --> 02:40:08.160]  It's so important to have this film to know the tactics the program the brainwashing.
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:11.902]  You've got the governor last year of Tennessee.
[02:40:11.902 --> 02:40:13.944]  They had army checkpoints Marine Corps.
[02:40:13.944 --> 02:40:21.549]  I mean it was it was all the services Air Force MPs Homeland Security shutting down whole highways.
[02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:25.111]  And then the governor said, don't do that.
[02:40:25.111 --> 02:40:27.513]  And the feds said, we're going to do it anyways.
[02:40:27.513 --> 02:40:29.335]  I haven't had state reps on.
[02:40:29.335 --> 02:40:32.057]  And then we got photos and videos off the news.
[02:40:32.057 --> 02:40:33.978]  It's in my film.
[02:40:33.978 --> 02:40:37.501]  And they want to, and it's whole highway shut down, US troops searching them.
[02:40:38.658 --> 02:40:40.579]  Training the troops, it's okay.
[02:40:40.579 --> 02:40:42.459]  Training the people in the cars, it's okay.
[02:40:42.459 --> 02:40:44.140]  Training the media, it's okay.
[02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:48.781]  And telling the governor, hey boy, we don't care what you say.
[02:40:48.781 --> 02:40:51.962]  We don't care if this is scaring people in small towns and big cities.
[02:40:51.962 --> 02:40:56.783]  And it turned out it was a four-state martial law lockdown drill.
[02:40:56.783 --> 02:40:58.284]  And they're having these everywhere.
[02:40:58.284 --> 02:41:08.147]  So continuing and expanding on that, for everybody that's out there listening, Rob Dew and Jason Douglas go to Illinois.
[02:41:10.106 --> 02:41:10.250]  And...
[02:41:12.941 --> 02:41:16.323]  It was troops and police training to take on Americans.
[02:41:16.323 --> 02:41:25.369]  It was... Well, you've seen the New York Times, where it shows the Explorer Scouts, and it shows a whole bunch of photos in the New York Times article.
[02:41:25.369 --> 02:41:32.594]  They have a photo gallery, and it says, they're training to take on American terrorists and disgruntled vets.
[02:41:32.594 --> 02:41:39.819]  And then Homeland Security plays the part of disgruntled vets, and the kids come in with laser tag and kill the mock
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:43.861]  Vets who won't turn their guns in.
[02:41:43.861 --> 02:41:46.741]  And the New York Times is saying, isn't this great?
[02:41:46.741 --> 02:41:51.243]  Our 14-year-olds are training to take on disgruntled gun owners.
[02:41:51.243 --> 02:41:52.703]  That's what this was.
[02:41:52.703 --> 02:41:54.524]  And they let my guys in.
[02:41:54.524 --> 02:41:57.684]  They let them videotape the entire thing.
[02:41:57.684 --> 02:41:59.585]  And we're going to be covering it next week.
[02:41:59.585 --> 02:42:02.826]  Again, people are like, well, we want to see this now.
[02:42:02.826 --> 02:42:07.647]  My guys show up with 20 hours of video or more.
[02:42:07.647 --> 02:42:09.327]  I saw like six boxes of tapes.
[02:42:09.327 --> 02:42:10.648]  There's five tapes per box.
[02:42:12.944 --> 02:42:13.886]  Probably 30 hours.
[02:42:13.886 --> 02:42:14.788]  I don't know how many hours.
[02:42:14.788 --> 02:42:16.211]  We've got a lot of video.
[02:42:22.628 --> 02:42:23.489]  I mean, what do you say?
[02:42:23.489 --> 02:42:28.034]  I have been to the drills where they're training to take on the American people.
[02:42:28.034 --> 02:42:34.741]  And of course, over a year ago we got the Secret Homeland Security and MIAC reports that law enforcement sent us who were concerned.
[02:42:34.741 --> 02:42:37.824]  And in those reports the media confirmed were real.
[02:42:37.824 --> 02:42:45.192]  The number one threat to America is veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, landowners, libertarians, and anti-war activists for that matter.
[02:42:45.732 --> 02:42:48.895]  Anybody who is not for the New World Order is an enemy.
[02:42:48.895 --> 02:42:50.577]  Ron Paul, you name it.
[02:42:50.577 --> 02:42:51.838]  Aaron Russo.
[02:42:51.838 --> 02:42:53.399]  The list goes on and on.
[02:42:53.399 --> 02:42:55.041]  This is what they teach.
[02:42:55.041 --> 02:42:57.884]  This whole police state is for you.
[02:42:57.884 --> 02:42:59.665]  You are the slaves.
[02:42:59.665 --> 02:43:03.369]  We're gonna go to Sam, Ronnie, Mike, and Anthony before our guest comes on.
[02:43:03.369 --> 02:43:06.252]  I got a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:43:08.072 --> 02:43:12.075]  But yes, they've got foreign troops crawling all over the U.S.
[02:43:12.075 --> 02:43:14.977]  and they've been incrementally increasing their numbers for decades.
[02:43:14.977 --> 02:43:18.780]  And last year they had NLE09.
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:27.206]  And it said in the FEMA press release, troops from all these foreign countries, mainly Eastern Europe, are training to fight American terrorists.
[02:43:27.206 --> 02:43:35.172]  I've seen articles in the Washington Post eight years ago, it's in my film Road to Tyranny, where it said Mexican and Canadian troops will be used to fight American terrorists.
[02:43:36.676 --> 02:43:42.959]  And then you noticed at the Olympics, it was in the news that the Army was running checkpoints and now they're going to stay and U.S.
[02:43:42.959 --> 02:43:44.699]  troops were used in Canada.
[02:43:44.699 --> 02:43:46.900]  See, this is the world government.
[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:48.461]  This is the mercenaries.
[02:43:48.461 --> 02:43:55.904]  This is BP all over the Gulf Coast telling camera people they can't videotape.
[02:43:55.904 --> 02:43:57.044]  People say, well, what's your right?
[02:43:57.044 --> 02:43:58.365]  Well, what's your authority?
[02:43:58.365 --> 02:44:01.746]  My authority is I am God.
[02:44:01.746 --> 02:44:03.127]  And the media follows their orders.
[02:44:03.127 --> 02:44:05.468]  Just some guy in a baseball cap walks up and says, get out of here.
[02:44:07.574 --> 02:44:13.783]  And if that guy in a baseball cap calls the cops and postures right like he's the boss, the cops will get down and lick his boots.
[02:44:13.783 --> 02:44:14.684]  But citizens that...
[02:44:15.563 --> 02:44:16.704]  Grovel to police.
[02:44:16.704 --> 02:44:22.308]  A lot of cops now on steroids will just break your nose for fun and then charge you with assaulting them.
[02:44:22.308 --> 02:44:32.736]  Because you, like a dog that rolls over, you ever seen a dog that's cowed, you walk over to it, and it rolls over on its belly and, you know, grovels and then, you know, maybe even squirts a little bit?
[02:44:32.736 --> 02:44:36.919]  You know, that's a sign of I totally submit, I'm scared, I'm peeing on myself.
[02:44:36.919 --> 02:44:38.040]  That's what the American people do.
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:39.021]  We just see government
[02:44:39.701 --> 02:44:41.583]  And we just, oh, you want more taxes?
[02:44:41.583 --> 02:44:42.744]  You want to tell me what I can do?
[02:44:42.744 --> 02:44:43.725]  You want to run my life?
[02:44:43.725 --> 02:44:44.846]  You want to be my god?
[02:44:44.846 --> 02:44:46.067]  Here, let me roll over.
[02:44:46.067 --> 02:44:48.089]  I don't want Chris Matthews to call me a terrorist.
[02:44:48.089 --> 02:44:51.492]  And you just roll over and submit.
[02:44:51.492 --> 02:44:59.059]  And maybe that should be the new national symbol, not the bald eagle, but a man on his back in a fetal position with a little puddle of urine.
[02:44:59.946 --> 02:45:05.470]  Maybe we should make an American flag like that, and then the stripes can be yellow for urine.
[02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:08.712]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's what this, you know, of us urinating on ourselves.
[02:45:08.712 --> 02:45:13.535]  And the new American symbol will be a man in a fetal position peeing on himself.
[02:45:13.535 --> 02:45:16.497]  I mean, I'm sorry to get graphic, but that is what we are.
[02:45:17.037 --> 02:45:20.598]  We just, government says something, we ask, how high do we jump?
[02:45:20.598 --> 02:45:38.021]  Master, you are king, you are god, you are lord, you are master, nothing but government's good, put fluoride in my water, give me vaccines full of poisons, tell me they're good, lie to me, give me GMO food, take my property, run my life, brainwash my kids.
[02:45:38.021 --> 02:45:44.122]  I'm sorry, I mean, are we land of the free, home of the brave, or are we the land of rolling over on our back and urinating on ourselves, like a dog?
[02:45:47.648 --> 02:45:52.531]  And so, some guy in a baseball cap walks up to cops and says, kick these people out of here, they're not allowed to be here.
[02:45:52.531 --> 02:45:56.833]  And they go, yes sir, you look authoritative!
[02:45:56.833 --> 02:46:03.096]  And then, I mean, it's just to watch my fellow, and I'm not bashing police here, but police know the position you've been put in.
[02:46:03.096 --> 02:46:04.457]  You know how you've been brainwashed.
[02:46:04.457 --> 02:46:06.558]  You know how you've been encouraged to be thugs.
[02:46:06.558 --> 02:46:08.139]  You know how the thugs get promoted.
[02:46:08.139 --> 02:46:10.140]  You know the truth.
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:13.042]  How it's macho to slap us, the milk cows, around.
[02:46:14.963 --> 02:46:18.247]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, Alan Greenspan is saying we're going to max out our debt.
[02:46:18.247 --> 02:46:19.830]  We're going to lose our AAA rating.
[02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:26.138]  California, Connecticut, and other states are losing their AAA rating, which means we owe even more interest to bankers for the right to have currency.
[02:46:26.138 --> 02:46:27.580]  It's all made up out of nothing.
[02:46:27.580 --> 02:46:29.262]  Gold is an all-time record today.
[02:46:29.983 --> 02:46:43.396]  And I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but if you want to protect yourselves, if you want to not be completely castrated and completely under government control, I suggest you move into gold and silver at bullion prices that are extreme high quality.
[02:46:43.396 --> 02:46:47.100]  Ted is running out of the gold he has at the lower price.
[02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:48.020]  It's going to go up again.
[02:46:48.581 --> 02:46:53.764]  But then as gold goes up, he'll be able to sell you gold he bought at a lower price even as it goes up.
[02:46:53.764 --> 02:46:56.326]  But you need to take advantage of this now.
[02:46:56.326 --> 02:46:57.227]  Ted, good to have you on.
[02:46:57.227 --> 02:47:04.992]  You've got some news articles for us today on what's happening with gold and why this is happening and today's coin offer before we go to break and come back with calls.
[02:47:04.992 --> 02:47:07.854]  Yeah, just real quick on the news here.
[02:47:07.854 --> 02:47:09.655]  Kitco published with Debbie Carlson.
[02:47:10.385 --> 02:47:17.832]  I just wrote that gold sales to record highs as investors fear winds of debt crises and future inflation.
[02:47:17.832 --> 02:47:22.576]  And they're just talking about what's going on in Europe, and that's why people are getting into that.
[02:47:22.576 --> 02:47:24.778]  Then I was also looking at MarketWatch.
[02:47:24.778 --> 02:47:29.662]  MarketWatch has gold pushes past record $1,260 an ounce.
[02:47:29.662 --> 02:47:34.307]  Bloomberg has a title right up here, China should raise its gold and oil holdings.
[02:47:35.287 --> 02:47:36.748]  They're going to do that.
[02:47:36.748 --> 02:47:41.270]  We also have the support level of gold pushed up now from that $1,210 range.
[02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:41.550]  Now it's $1,216.20.
[02:47:41.550 --> 02:47:42.451]  And the resistance level is at $1,270.
[02:47:42.451 --> 02:47:45.352]  We're going to see $1,350 an ounce with this trend going the way that it is real shortly.
[02:47:45.352 --> 02:47:49.434]  And I need to say it, Alex, I don't know if I'll ever be able to buy gold again at $1,220 an ounce.
[02:48:03.772 --> 02:48:07.175]  I was hoping to get that $1,180 to buy a bunch of it again.
[02:48:07.175 --> 02:48:07.936]  I didn't get there.
[02:48:07.936 --> 02:48:13.281]  I had to settle for just touching $1,200 an ounce here about a week ago.
[02:48:13.281 --> 02:48:15.904]  And the world right now is turning to gold.
[02:48:15.904 --> 02:48:18.026]  The weird part about it is we're in July.
[02:48:18.026 --> 02:48:23.511]  It's acting more like it's October and, you know, because gold has been so strong.
[02:48:23.511 --> 02:48:26.154]  There's a lot of things that are going up in the marketplace right now.
[02:48:27.674 --> 02:48:31.075]  Just across the board, I mean, gold hit a market peak today.
[02:48:31.075 --> 02:48:44.060]  It right now is at $1,258 and some change, which is higher than it's ever seen before, so if it closes at that number, we'll hit a market peak, even though it went into the $1,260 range today, you know, already.
[02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:51.483]  So, yeah, we're going to see some positive increases in the gold coins that people have been buying from us all these years.
[02:48:52.103 --> 02:48:55.572]  And I gotta say, you know, they deserve it.
[02:48:55.572 --> 02:49:01.447]  They're the mavericks that got into gold before all the yuppies jumped in, and it's nice to see that they're able to take some profits.
[02:49:01.812 --> 02:49:03.553]  And the yuppies are just now getting in.
[02:49:03.553 --> 02:49:09.514]  Now tell folks the special deals you've got today that are going to run through the weekend but probably won't be available next week.
[02:49:09.514 --> 02:49:10.734]  Well, I've got a few things.
[02:49:10.734 --> 02:49:17.936]  Again, I am offering the same deal on francs with the forecaster as I did yesterday, even after gold jumping up $15 today.
[02:49:17.936 --> 02:49:18.597]  I have the franc at $265.
[02:49:23.698 --> 02:49:32.462]  That price will go up into the $270 range after this weekend if gold holds its price, and I don't know why it wouldn't.
[02:49:32.462 --> 02:49:43.326]  I do have for sure, and my brokers don't even know this yet, but I have a small group of $20 liberties for those of you who like 100-year-old coins that are more of a collector type.
[02:49:43.326 --> 02:49:43.646]  They're at $1,518.
[02:49:46.327 --> 02:49:47.668]  I need to tell you that the U.S.
[02:49:47.668 --> 02:49:50.710]  Eagle has jumped up over that $1,300.
[02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:54.712]  It's like $1,340 now to buy those.
[02:49:54.712 --> 02:49:57.094]  This is less than $200 over the U.S.
[02:49:57.094 --> 02:49:58.114]  Eagle price.
[02:49:58.114 --> 02:50:00.516]  And for a $20 Liberty, that's unheard of.
[02:50:00.516 --> 02:50:03.978]  But on Monday, they'll be at $1,570 apiece.
[02:50:03.978 --> 02:50:06.859]  So if you want to take advantage of that, there's a good buy for you.
[02:50:06.859 --> 02:50:07.800]  What about buffaloes?
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:09.821]  You got any of those luscious buffaloes left?
[02:50:09.841 --> 02:50:11.623]  That is where I'm going next, Alex.
[02:50:11.623 --> 02:50:13.506]  I'm going to tell people to buy the Buffalos.
[02:50:13.506 --> 02:50:16.971]  Because right now, I have Buffalos and I can sell them.
[02:50:16.971 --> 02:50:18.633]  I'm one of the few dealers that do.
[02:50:18.633 --> 02:50:21.076]  And I can just tell you, over the U.S.
[02:50:21.076 --> 02:50:23.519]  Eagle, I think the Buffalos are much better buy.
[02:50:23.519 --> 02:50:25.883]  Just mainly... What about the 5th of an ounce Franks?
[02:50:26.323 --> 02:50:29.745]  Fifth of an ounce, Frank, at $265.
[02:50:29.745 --> 02:50:34.207]  Alex, it's again that you can't beat that, especially considering that you're getting a full year's subscription.
[02:50:34.207 --> 02:50:37.089]  Yeah, most coin dealers are out of stock and have huge premiums.
[02:50:37.089 --> 02:50:37.869]  This is a great deal.
[02:50:37.869 --> 02:50:41.091]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:41.091 --> 02:50:44.633]  The brokers will be there tonight and throughout the weekend.
[02:50:44.633 --> 02:50:45.993]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:45.993 --> 02:50:50.516]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to make sure you get the lower price because gold has gone up.
[02:50:50.896 --> 02:50:54.158]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:50:54.158 --> 02:50:54.558]  Think again.
[02:51:07.558 --> 02:51:15.202]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:51:15.202 --> 02:51:22.446]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:51:22.446 --> 02:51:30.691]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[02:52:01.792 --> 02:52:06.775]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.775 --> 02:52:07.556]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.556 --> 02:52:10.198]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:10.198 --> 02:52:11.219]  A republic.
[02:52:11.219 --> 02:52:13.861]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.861 --> 02:52:16.122]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:16.122 --> 02:52:18.144]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:18.144 --> 02:52:23.728]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:52:23.728 --> 02:52:27.371]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.722 --> 02:52:31.403]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:31.403 --> 02:52:32.704]  You're being warned!
[02:52:32.704 --> 02:52:33.724]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.724 --> 02:52:34.864]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.864 --> 02:52:35.785]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.785 --> 02:52:36.665]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.665 --> 02:52:39.186]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:39.186 --> 02:52:42.147]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:52:42.147 --> 02:52:43.067]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:43.067 --> 02:52:48.048]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:48.048 --> 02:52:49.549]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[02:52:49.549 --> 02:52:50.629]  Don't Tread on Me.

[02:54:11.267 --> 02:54:15.369]  Look, I shouldn't have to sit here and sell people on getting gold and silver.
[02:54:15.369 --> 02:54:17.770]  It's a very simple equation.
[02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:25.654]  I told people to buy when it was $265, $280 an ounce because I knew that the central banks of the world were artificially suppressing it.
[02:54:25.654 --> 02:54:35.419]  I knew banks were inflating our currencies and that the law of finance and of economics said gold and silver and other metals would only go up.
[02:54:36.391 --> 02:54:40.314]  Now, they can manipulate for short periods, but not long-term.
[02:54:40.314 --> 02:54:47.821]  You look at the year graph, the two-year graph, the three-year graph, the four-year graph, the five-year graph, back to seven years, gold is only going up.
[02:54:47.821 --> 02:54:49.342]  I don't buy it as an investment.
[02:54:49.342 --> 02:54:51.764]  I buy it as an emergency backup.
[02:54:51.764 --> 02:54:54.767]  But it's the best thing for investment out there that I've seen.
[02:54:54.767 --> 02:54:59.191]  I mean, it's head and shoulders above everything else.
[02:54:59.191 --> 02:54:59.931]  It is the best
[02:55:00.757 --> 02:55:02.759]  Investment, period.
[02:55:02.759 --> 02:55:07.723]  But for me, it's the best insurance policy, and I just hope that people will call and take advantage.
[02:55:07.723 --> 02:55:09.505]  Ted, what are the silver half dollars?
[02:55:09.505 --> 02:55:10.846]  What do you have in silver for folks?
[02:55:11.778 --> 02:55:17.723]  Well, obviously, silver is shooting up in price, too, and I am still holding that price of Walking Liberties down.
[02:55:17.723 --> 02:55:19.725]  They're at $9.75.
[02:55:19.725 --> 02:55:26.710]  For those of you who want to have the old bags of junk silver, they call them, or 90% silver, we have those bags, too.
[02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:33.216]  I don't know what the price is off the top of my head, because we just had silver run up, and I didn't bring that price into the studio with me.
[02:55:33.216 --> 02:55:35.818]  But if you want to pick up something like that, that's a great buy, too.
[02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:36.518]  We're good to go.
[02:55:52.065 --> 02:55:52.325]  I think so.
[02:56:14.445 --> 02:56:19.888]  Even CNBC says $2,500 an ounce gold in the next year.
[02:56:19.888 --> 02:56:22.770]  But, I mean, regardless, gold and silver is real.
[02:56:22.770 --> 02:56:28.194]  Paper dollars and fiat derivatives are not real.
[02:56:28.194 --> 02:56:29.915]  Folks, get involved in gold and silver today.
[02:56:29.915 --> 02:56:29.975]  800-686-2237.
[02:56:29.975 --> 02:56:30.095]  800-686-2237.
[02:56:30.095 --> 02:56:31.096]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[02:56:31.096 --> 02:56:32.396]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:38.640]  You bet.
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:43.004]  Again, that number if you missed it, 800-686-2237.
[02:56:43.004 --> 02:56:46.046]  Now, I've got some good news and some bad news.
[02:56:46.046 --> 02:56:53.271]  We were going to have Dr. John Coleman on earlier in the week, but he was ill.
[02:56:53.271 --> 02:56:57.034]  And he is ill again today, and he's apologized.
[02:56:57.034 --> 02:57:00.337]  But there's a lot to talk about, so I'm going to get him on for one segment.
[02:57:01.391 --> 02:57:01.571]  I think?
[02:57:25.802 --> 02:57:32.144]  Talking to Dr. John Coleman, of course he was also MI6, about drug war against America, how the British and U.S.
[02:57:32.144 --> 02:57:33.424]  government are shipping in drugs.
[02:57:33.424 --> 02:57:37.285]  Of course he wrote this years ago, it's now completely in the open.
[02:57:37.285 --> 02:57:40.786]  Of course he worked with MI6, he can tell you all about it.
[02:57:40.786 --> 02:57:44.387]  And Dr. John Coleman is also a constitutional lawyer.
[02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:52.330]  What you should know about the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, just an amazing book he wrote on that front, but we should carry his books, we don't carry them.
[02:57:53.911 --> 02:57:59.655]  Of course, the conspiracy, conspirators hierarchy, the Committee of 300, Dr. John Coleman.
[02:57:59.655 --> 02:58:05.880]  I mean, he really, the more research I do, I realize what an amazing trailblazer he is.
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:10.323]  So, I hope he's well enough to be with us for a full hour next week.
[02:58:10.323 --> 02:58:13.585]  Again, that's why I hadn't had him on in years, because of health issues.
[02:58:13.585 --> 02:58:20.631]  Of course, he wrote the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, shaping moral, spiritual, cultural, political, and economic decline in the United States of America.
[02:58:21.852 --> 02:58:24.033]  I want to get him on about that.
[02:58:24.033 --> 02:58:25.855]  We're just out of time for this hour.
[02:58:25.855 --> 02:58:30.719]  I'm going to come back, take your calls in this short next segment.
[02:58:30.719 --> 02:58:35.744]  And then we got Dr. Coleman on for one segment, then calls for the balance and a bunch of news.
[02:58:35.744 --> 02:58:40.047]  Illegal aliens rioted with Mexican flags and burned things and overturned cars in L.A.
[02:58:40.047 --> 02:58:40.528]  last night.
[02:58:42.489 --> 02:58:47.072]  Bringing you the best in alternative talk radio for over 10 years.
[02:58:47.072 --> 02:58:48.513]  GCN.
[02:58:48.513 --> 02:58:51.235]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[02:58:51.235 --> 02:58:53.556]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:58:53.556 --> 02:58:55.938]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:58:55.938 --> 02:58:59.140]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:58:59.140 --> 02:59:04.243]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:59:04.243 --> 02:59:08.446]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:59:08.746 --> 02:59:11.109]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:59:11.109 --> 02:59:13.653]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:59:13.653 --> 02:59:16.897]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:59:16.897 --> 02:59:24.507]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:59:24.833 --> 02:59:30.214]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:59:30.214 --> 02:59:32.535]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:59:32.535 --> 02:59:36.776]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:59:36.776 --> 02:59:37.836]  And I got news for you.
[02:59:37.836 --> 02:59:39.176]  You're everyone else.
[02:59:39.176 --> 02:59:40.677]  Invisible Empire.

[02:59:54.238 --> 02:59:56.619]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.619 --> 03:00:08.123]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:08.123 --> 03:00:14.305]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:14.305 --> 03:00:19.427]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in California.
[03:00:19.427 --> 03:00:21.627]  Welcome, Sam.
[03:00:21.627 --> 03:00:22.528]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:22.528 --> 03:00:22.868]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:24.286 --> 03:00:26.668]  Alright, so good to talk to you.
[03:00:26.668 --> 03:00:31.551]  Yes, uh, I have an opinion on what's going on in the Gulf.
[03:00:31.551 --> 03:00:37.715]  What I really wanted to talk about was a new weapon in the Info Wars, which I've created.
[03:00:37.715 --> 03:00:40.457]  Ah.
[03:00:40.457 --> 03:00:42.578]  So which one should I talk about?
[03:00:42.578 --> 03:00:43.479]  Whatever you wish, sir.
[03:00:43.479 --> 03:00:45.860]  Alright.
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:52.385]  I am doing a local cable public access television show here in San Rafael, California.
[03:00:53.191 --> 03:00:55.313]  I'm calling it Conspiracy TV.
[03:00:55.313 --> 03:00:59.598]  The first episode premieres tomorrow.
[03:00:59.598 --> 03:01:04.584]  I've been given permission to broadcast The Panama Deception, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
[03:01:13.086 --> 03:01:15.789]  The government was dealing narcotics with Noriega on record.
[03:01:15.789 --> 03:01:20.473]  He threatened to blackmail Bush and there was an overnight invasion, claiming that two women had been kidnapped.
[03:01:20.473 --> 03:01:22.255]  Then it turned out it was totally fake.
[03:01:22.255 --> 03:01:23.416]  No one kidnapped them.
[03:01:23.416 --> 03:01:25.878]  That's the good old USA.
[03:01:25.878 --> 03:01:26.498]  Oh yeah.
[03:01:26.498 --> 03:01:29.982]  They went in and just killed civilians like they were in the way.
[03:01:31.081 --> 03:01:31.701]  Right, right.
[03:01:31.701 --> 03:01:35.764]  And the reason I'm calling is because I would like to share with other people my idea about this show, I think.
[03:01:56.363 --> 03:01:58.846]  It's something that people could do all over the country.
[03:01:58.846 --> 03:02:09.477]  Everybody can start a show and air clips of other people's documentaries and analyze it, talk about it, take calls, do a different issue, show a different film every week.
[03:02:09.477 --> 03:02:13.561]  That's what I've been doing for 16 years, almost 16 years.
[03:02:13.561 --> 03:02:15.603]  Is that your idea?
[03:02:15.603 --> 03:02:15.804]  Yes.
[03:02:17.458 --> 03:02:20.479]  Yeah, it's a two-hour show every Saturday night at 10 p.m.
[03:02:20.479 --> 03:02:22.860]  on my local cable public access channel.
[03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:28.941]  If you don't mind, I'd like to give the... No, that's fine, you can put flyers out around your town and anybody else can do this.
[03:02:28.941 --> 03:02:29.521]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:02:29.521 --> 03:02:34.743]  Right, it's channel 26 on Comcast cable here in Marin.
[03:02:34.743 --> 03:02:41.405]  But the key is, the key is to go around to all the coffee shops and on telephone poles and put up
[03:02:42.270 --> 03:02:44.332]  The time and showing and when it's going to happen.
[03:02:44.332 --> 03:02:45.392]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:45.392 --> 03:02:46.513]  Good job.
[03:02:46.513 --> 03:02:49.415]  To hear from you, Sam, keep it up.
[03:02:49.415 --> 03:02:51.197]  What they really need to see is the Obama deception.
[03:02:51.197 --> 03:02:52.077]  Follow the Republic.
[03:02:52.077 --> 03:02:54.379]  Don't tread on me in films like that.
[03:02:54.379 --> 03:02:59.563]  But I'm sure they'll be informed by the Panama deception.
[03:02:59.563 --> 03:03:02.165]  That's just kind of ancient history, but it's still important.
[03:03:02.165 --> 03:03:04.427]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[03:03:04.427 --> 03:03:06.008]  Ronnie, go ahead.
[03:03:06.008 --> 03:03:08.229]  Thank you, sir.
[03:03:08.229 --> 03:03:11.532]  From fluoridated, illegal alien friendly
[03:03:12.362 --> 03:03:16.046]  Uh, overrated, over-fluoridated Austin, Texas.
[03:03:16.046 --> 03:03:26.295]  It's the, I've got a, the exaggerated oil slick is just the latest Monica Lewinsky level of distraction, in my mind, of this tyrannical meltdown of our sacred constitution.
[03:03:26.295 --> 03:03:29.257]  But instead, instead Monica Lewinsky, instead
[03:03:30.475 --> 03:03:36.258]  Clinton bombed an aspirin factory in Nigeria to distract from Monica Lewinsky.
[03:03:36.258 --> 03:03:42.141]  The oil spill is the distraction from the war on Iran that they're lining up right now and they don't want us kids talking about.
[03:03:42.141 --> 03:03:50.064]  You're exactly right, and it's the total destruction through crises of our sacred constitution.
[03:03:50.064 --> 03:03:52.225]  Let me ask you a question, Ronnie.
[03:03:52.225 --> 03:03:55.667]  How much weed, how much devil marijuana have you smoked today?
[03:03:57.623 --> 03:04:02.965]  Oh, I try to stay medicated at all times, but... Ronnie, I appreciate your call.
[03:04:02.965 --> 03:04:05.446]  Well, you got the government medicating you to the water and the chemtrails.
[03:04:05.446 --> 03:04:06.126]  Why not?
[03:04:06.126 --> 03:04:07.446]  Mike in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:04:07.446 --> 03:04:07.866]  Go ahead.
[03:04:07.866 --> 03:04:09.747]  Hello, Alex.
[03:04:09.747 --> 03:04:10.167]  Hey, Bob.
[03:04:10.167 --> 03:04:20.851]  I just called to make you aware of something that I've seen on YouTube in Green Coast Springs, Florida, where they have thousands of UN vehicles lining up at a
[03:04:22.319 --> 03:04:23.821]  Uh, Air Force Base there.
[03:04:23.821 --> 03:04:25.843]  I wanted to know if you know anything about it.
[03:04:38.619 --> 03:04:43.645]  I have the link and I have emailed it to you through your contact.
[03:04:43.645 --> 03:04:47.069]  Alright, I'm going to put you on hold and you can get the specific name of the video.
[03:04:47.069 --> 03:04:51.293]  We're going to do one segment with Dr. John Coleman because he isn't feeling well today.
[03:04:51.293 --> 03:04:59.142]  He'll be back with us a full hour next week, God willing, and that'll give us time in three other segments to take your phone calls and cover the news.
[03:04:59.142 --> 03:04:59.623]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:04.844]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.844 --> 03:05:10.171]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.171 --> 03:05:12.234]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.234 --> 03:05:17.220]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.220 --> 03:05:18.422]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.422 --> 03:05:19.143]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.523 --> 03:05:21.403]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.403 --> 03:05:22.464]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.464 --> 03:05:24.684]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.684 --> 03:05:26.005]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:26.005 --> 03:05:27.545]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.545 --> 03:05:32.806]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.806 --> 03:05:36.387]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.387 --> 03:05:39.848]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.208 --> 03:05:41.429]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:42.350]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.350 --> 03:05:43.451]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.451 --> 03:05:44.372]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.372 --> 03:05:45.473]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.473 --> 03:05:48.515]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.515 --> 03:05:50.717]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.717 --> 03:05:51.738]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.905 --> 03:06:05.868]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:05.868 --> 03:06:06.869]  What have we got?
[03:06:06.869 --> 03:06:09.310]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:09.310 --> 03:06:10.311]  A republic.
[03:06:10.311 --> 03:06:12.973]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:06:12.973 --> 03:06:15.234]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:06:15.234 --> 03:06:17.255]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:06:17.255 --> 03:06:18.936]  So they think they own our land?
[03:06:18.936 --> 03:06:20.257]  They think they own our water?
[03:06:20.257 --> 03:06:20.877]  Children?
[03:06:20.877 --> 03:06:21.998]  Our education?
[03:06:21.998 --> 03:06:22.819]  Our money?
[03:06:22.819 --> 03:06:26.481]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:06:26.841 --> 03:06:31.807]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:06:31.807 --> 03:06:32.848]  We have the facts.
[03:06:32.848 --> 03:06:33.989]  We have the Constitution.
[03:06:33.989 --> 03:06:34.911]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:06:34.911 --> 03:06:35.792]  We have common law.
[03:06:35.792 --> 03:06:38.315]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:38.315 --> 03:06:42.099]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:06:42.199 --> 03:06:47.144]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[03:08:03.388 --> 03:08:10.018]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.018 --> 03:08:12.983]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.038 --> 03:08:21.461]  Well, he's only with us for one segment because he's under the weather, and I'm going to nail down a full hour with him next week.
[03:08:21.461 --> 03:08:30.567]  Dr. John Coleman, author of Drug War Against America, What You Should Know About the United States, Constitution, Bill of Rights, a separate book.
[03:08:30.567 --> 03:08:36.910]  Of course, he's best known for The Conspirator's Hierarchy, the Committee of 300, now in its fourth edition.
[03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:42.714]  Doctor of Constitutional Law, reportedly worked with, well, you know what?
[03:08:43.374 --> 03:08:45.535]  Doc, it's always good to have you because you've done so much.
[03:08:45.535 --> 03:08:52.140]  How would you describe yourself best in your bio in this short segment we've got you with us for?
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:53.901]  How would I describe myself?
[03:08:53.901 --> 03:08:54.221]  Yes.
[03:08:54.221 --> 03:08:58.804]  Just a very ordinary fellow trying to get information out to the people who need it very badly.
[03:08:59.926 --> 03:09:01.507]  Well, you've put out invaluable info.
[03:09:01.507 --> 03:09:06.729]  We don't have a lot of time with you today because I don't want to twist your arm into a full hour with you being under the weather.
[03:09:06.729 --> 03:09:08.009]  But so much is happening.
[03:09:08.009 --> 03:09:10.770]  I wanted to get you back on about the globalist hierarchy.
[03:09:10.770 --> 03:09:15.012]  But the limited time we have today, they're openly saying they want to attack Iran.
[03:09:15.012 --> 03:09:19.694]  They want to board their ships with a blockade, which is an act of war.
[03:09:19.694 --> 03:09:22.055]  Looks like that's going to the front burner.
[03:09:22.055 --> 03:09:24.596]  I see this oil spill as a diversion
[03:09:25.336 --> 03:09:32.739]  While they get their internet censorship bills passed, their carbon tax passed, what's your take on the oil spill?
[03:09:32.739 --> 03:09:37.041]  I think that it's a contrite situation myself.
[03:09:37.041 --> 03:09:41.343]  I've not voiced that opinion before, but I believe that is the case.
[03:09:41.343 --> 03:09:46.986]  In other words, it's something like akin to Pearl Harbor, which was a contrite situation, you know?
[03:09:46.986 --> 03:09:53.949]  Roosevelt told Stimson and Knox, and he said, we've somehow got to get the Japanese into the position where they will fire the first shots.
[03:09:54.855 --> 03:09:56.340]  I think what this is all about.
[03:09:56.340 --> 03:09:58.325]  It's a bunch of the same kind of thing.
[03:09:59.654 --> 03:10:03.057]  Absolutely, and what brought you to that conclusion?
[03:10:03.057 --> 03:10:04.678]  Because that's the only conclusion I have.
[03:10:04.678 --> 03:10:12.023]  Day one, my gut told me that, but now we know they ordered the people on the rig to dump seawater in instead of cement for a month.
[03:10:12.023 --> 03:10:14.946]  The rig operator said this will explode, so they gave orders.
[03:10:14.946 --> 03:10:16.127]  They knew it would lead to it.
[03:10:16.127 --> 03:10:19.529]  Turns out Goldman Sachs really owned much of BP.
[03:10:19.529 --> 03:10:22.091]  Its chairman was also the chairman of BP.
[03:10:22.091 --> 03:10:25.233]  Goldman Sachs dumped 44% of its stock the week before.
[03:10:25.233 --> 03:10:26.214]  The BP
[03:10:27.495 --> 03:10:28.916]  I don't think that's the answer at all.
[03:10:28.916 --> 03:10:30.116]  I think that what they've got to do is put
[03:10:57.702 --> 03:11:01.465]  Six or seven hundred boats out there to clean the mess up as quickly as they can.
[03:11:01.465 --> 03:11:02.786]  That's what the solution is.
[03:11:02.786 --> 03:11:06.288]  I've seen so many of these things in the past, in history itself.
[03:11:06.288 --> 03:11:08.230]  Like to go back to the Second World War.
[03:11:22.529 --> 03:11:32.257]  Supposedly insane Dutchmen to fire some shots and they said, oh, this is a, this was something done by one of the nations and the cause for war.
[03:11:32.257 --> 03:11:48.991]  So it's, there's so many things in history that have been similar to this and Pearl Harbor sending the Japanese cutting off their supplies of raw materials that vital for their production and their continued wellbeing.
[03:11:48.991 --> 03:11:51.453]  A unilateral action by Roosevelt,
[03:11:52.196 --> 03:11:54.217]  Not even consulting the Japanese.
[03:11:54.217 --> 03:12:04.082]  And then, of course, you know, when the Japanese came to see him in Washington, Marshall was out riding in Central Park and they couldn't get to anybody.
[03:12:04.082 --> 03:12:07.124]  Of course, I have no grief for the Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor.
[03:12:07.124 --> 03:12:08.485]  It's inexcusable.
[03:12:08.485 --> 03:12:11.586]  But nevertheless, this is the kind of thing that happens.
[03:12:11.586 --> 03:12:17.209]  These contrite situations are made from time to time when it suits the purpose.
[03:12:17.209 --> 03:12:20.651]  And we all know that the committee of 300 of the people pulling the strings, mainly,
[03:12:21.385 --> 03:12:24.808]  From every situation, from every angle.
[03:12:24.808 --> 03:12:41.225]  That's right, and if they have to sacrifice the name of BP, formerly Anglo-American Oil, they'll just change the name again, and BP has always been at the heart of pushing the global carbon tax to fund the world government, and then now notice it was a BP rig that this happened with.
[03:12:41.225 --> 03:12:45.289]  I don't know if you remember what happened in the time
[03:12:46.022 --> 03:12:55.054]  In Iran, when they had the big blow up there, and things went completely wrong, and that was called the American Oil, or Aramco, and was called a whole lot of other names.
[03:12:55.054 --> 03:12:59.780]  It was only after that disaster there that they changed the name to British Petroleum.
[03:12:59.780 --> 03:13:00.320]  That's right!
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:00.961]  Indeed.
[03:13:00.961 --> 03:13:01.502]  That's right.
[03:13:01.502 --> 03:13:03.064]  Indeed.
[03:13:03.064 --> 03:13:04.706]  So it is very easy to change names.
[03:13:06.633 --> 03:13:07.494]  Absolutely.
[03:13:07.494 --> 03:13:13.318]  That's what DynCorp did after they got caught involved in sex slave trafficking.
[03:13:13.318 --> 03:13:21.143]  Well, Doc, in the limited time we have here, and again we're going to nail you down for next week, so much is happening in the world.
[03:13:21.143 --> 03:13:24.526]  What's your concern dealing with Iran?
[03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:29.750]  Do you see frightening movements towards war with Iran?
[03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:34.233]  I see that in my opinion, for what it's worth, war in the Middle East is
[03:13:35.126 --> 03:13:37.666]  It's almost imminent.
[03:13:37.666 --> 03:13:39.947]  I see this is where it's heading.
[03:13:39.947 --> 03:13:43.667]  All factors point to it.
[03:13:43.667 --> 03:13:45.148]  Wow, absolutely.
[03:13:45.148 --> 03:13:48.608]  We're on the same page on that front, unfortunately.
[03:13:48.608 --> 03:13:52.389]  You see how they're driving Iran into a corner?
[03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:53.889]  They're doing everything they can to.
[03:13:53.889 --> 03:13:59.970]  And Russia has disgraced itself by reneging on their contract, which they've had since 2003, to supply the S-300 anti...
[03:14:05.282 --> 03:14:07.184]  Aircraft missile system.
[03:14:07.184 --> 03:14:08.264]  It's probably the best.
[03:14:08.264 --> 03:14:19.954]  It is not probably, but certainly the best in the world that could shoot down aircraft from 75 miles away and not miss because each one, each missile has its own guided system, which cannot be jammed.
[03:14:19.954 --> 03:14:23.116]  Once fired, it's bound to hit its target.
[03:14:23.116 --> 03:14:28.120]  And so they stopped supplying that to make the way easy for them to attack Iran.
[03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:33.605]  That's next on the cards, which I think will lead to a major conflagration in the Middle East.
[03:14:34.747 --> 03:14:38.970]  I think that Putin has completely disgraced himself and Russia in this move.
[03:14:38.970 --> 03:14:42.632]  So, Lord knows what they're up to.
[03:14:42.632 --> 03:14:52.377]  Russia had been claiming that they were going to not go along with an attack on Iran, but they are now, it looks like, starting to renege on that.
[03:14:52.377 --> 03:14:54.359]  Also, as you mentioned, Venezuela.
[03:14:54.359 --> 03:14:56.580]  What pressure do you think was brought to bear on Russia?
[03:14:58.914 --> 03:15:00.915]  By the United States?
[03:15:00.915 --> 03:15:01.676]  Yes.
[03:15:01.676 --> 03:15:02.436]  Oh, a great deal.
[03:15:02.436 --> 03:15:15.064]  They sent several androids over there to talk with Medvedev, who, by the way, is not exactly the brightest of people, but Putin had to step down because of his constitution.
[03:15:15.064 --> 03:15:19.828]  And Medvedev, of course, does whatever Putin tells him in the background.
[03:15:19.828 --> 03:15:26.512]  So I think they went to put a lot of pressure on Russia, a tremendous amount of pressure on Russia, to join in the game.
[03:15:27.904 --> 03:15:36.189]  China's gone along very, very reluctantly, but of course, and I think that they'll find Iran a very, very hard nut to crack.
[03:15:36.189 --> 03:15:40.151]  They have their militia called the Fasdarans, about a million men.
[03:15:40.151 --> 03:15:40.971]  Very well trained.
[03:15:40.971 --> 03:15:43.953]  They have their regular army, which is an enormous size.
[03:15:43.953 --> 03:15:46.854]  And you know, Iran itself was ten times the size of Iraq.
[03:15:48.368 --> 03:15:55.861]  Since we found such a terrible job on our hands trying to subdue Iraq, I don't know if we're going to do the same thing to Iran.
[03:15:55.861 --> 03:15:58.004]  I think it's a physical impossibility.
[03:15:58.004 --> 03:15:59.607]  I think it's beyond the capabilities.
[03:16:00.512 --> 03:16:03.334]  Well, the United States military power has the sense now.
[03:16:20.285 --> 03:16:27.071]  But as we get towards the end and the formation of world government, clearly they want to pin all their crimes on us.
[03:16:27.071 --> 03:16:33.676]  Why do they want to destroy the goose that laid their golden eggs of tyranny and empire?
[03:16:33.676 --> 03:16:37.219]  And where do you see all of this basically winding up?
[03:16:37.219 --> 03:16:39.121]  What's their endgame strategy?
[03:16:39.121 --> 03:16:46.887]  The endgame, as I said before, the endgame is to usher in a new world order inside of one world government, which will be the Committee of 300.
[03:16:48.158 --> 03:17:04.046]  And the way to do this is, first of all, destroy the most powerful nation in the world, the United States of America, which is a temporary expedient, and they feel that they can, once this is up and running, they can revive the patient by applying all the necessary techniques.
[03:17:04.046 --> 03:17:12.090]  It's like a person who gets knocked temporarily unconscious, you know, killed with oxygen and all kinds of stuff, and in a very short while they recover.
[03:17:12.090 --> 03:17:17.052]  So they've got such faith in the United States, and rightly so, it's a tremendous economic
[03:17:17.970 --> 03:17:19.891]  I've made about 500 predictions in my lifetime.
[03:17:47.353 --> 03:17:50.935]  Almost all of them have come to pass.
[03:17:50.935 --> 03:17:56.459]  No, I know you have on record, but I mean, what is their final plan then for the United States?
[03:17:56.459 --> 03:18:08.526]  Final plan will be the United States will be the premium, the number one country inside, their showcase country inside the new world order, one world government.
[03:18:08.526 --> 03:18:10.808]  That's their plan.
[03:18:10.808 --> 03:18:13.970]  They can't dispense with the United States altogether.
[03:18:13.970 --> 03:18:16.111]  It's too important an organization
[03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:18.793]  From an economic point alone.
[03:18:18.793 --> 03:18:21.556]  So it has to remain viable.
[03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:29.186]  And of course, once this organization is in place, and it's not a new thing, you know, they've been trying this since the days of King George III.
[03:18:29.186 --> 03:18:35.013]  He, at that time, he was lining up all the European powers to join in the scheme he had, which he also called a New World Order.
[03:18:36.868 --> 03:18:47.071]  Well, sure, but the Republic as we know, the free market, private property system that we've known, that is to be dismantled.
[03:18:47.071 --> 03:18:48.631]  Oh yes, that'll go.
[03:18:48.631 --> 03:18:49.712]  That definitely will go.
[03:18:49.712 --> 03:18:59.414]  Yes, everything will become, it will become like the social, you know, it's actually, the clear goal is to socialize the United States.
[03:18:59.414 --> 03:19:02.255]  You can see it in every move that the President is making.
[03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:06.252]  Oh, every step he's taking, I mean, is towards socialism in America.
[03:19:06.252 --> 03:19:08.073]  America will be socialized.
[03:19:08.073 --> 03:19:10.154]  I don't think there's a slightest doubt in that.
[03:19:10.154 --> 03:19:12.996]  Roosevelt strove mightily to bring that about.
[03:19:12.996 --> 03:19:14.636]  He didn't quite succeed.
[03:19:14.636 --> 03:19:17.858]  But he built a very good bridge towards socialism.
[03:19:17.858 --> 03:19:21.080]  And I think that Obama's continuing to build that bridge.
[03:19:21.485 --> 03:19:34.670]  And of course that's because they want everyone dependent on the system and so everyone's so poor they would never have their own means to organize any type of even political resistance to the social engineers so they can have their way with us.
[03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:37.351]  Doctor, we'll talk to you again next week.
[03:19:37.351 --> 03:19:45.475]  Let me say bye to you during this break and try to nail down a time later on next week when you feel a bit better so we can do a full hour on this because I want to talk about your book.
[03:19:46.215 --> 03:19:54.982]  Dealing with the Tavistock Institute, one of the premier organizations really fashioning the modern mind control that we're under.
[03:19:54.982 --> 03:19:59.465]  Your phone calls are straight ahead and we'll talk about the riots after the Lakers game yesterday.
[03:19:59.465 --> 03:20:00.226]  Stay with us.
[03:20:02.560 --> 03:20:05.581]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:05.581 --> 03:20:10.903]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:10.903 --> 03:20:12.963]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:20:12.963 --> 03:20:17.705]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.945 --> 03:20:18.385]  We're good to go.
[03:20:35.896 --> 03:20:36.216]  Good to go!
[03:21:02.113 --> 03:21:07.076]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:21:07.076 --> 03:21:07.856]  What have we got?
[03:21:07.856 --> 03:21:10.518]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:21:10.518 --> 03:21:11.538]  A republic.
[03:21:11.538 --> 03:21:14.180]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:21:14.180 --> 03:21:16.441]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:21:16.441 --> 03:21:18.462]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:21:18.462 --> 03:21:24.045]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[03:21:24.045 --> 03:21:27.667]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:21:28.044 --> 03:21:31.748]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:21:31.748 --> 03:21:33.029]  You're being warned!
[03:21:33.029 --> 03:21:34.050]  We have the facts.
[03:21:34.050 --> 03:21:35.191]  We have the Constitution.
[03:21:35.191 --> 03:21:36.112]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:21:36.112 --> 03:21:36.993]  We have common law.
[03:21:36.993 --> 03:21:39.515]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:21:39.515 --> 03:21:42.478]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[03:21:42.478 --> 03:21:43.399]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:21:43.399 --> 03:21:48.383]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:21:48.383 --> 03:21:49.885]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[03:21:49.885 --> 03:21:50.946]  Don't Tread on Me.
[03:21:50.946 --> 03:21:52.227]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:02.190 --> 03:22:05.151]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:05.151 --> 03:22:09.292]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[03:22:09.292 --> 03:22:11.552]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:11.552 --> 03:22:16.713]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:22:16.713 --> 03:22:18.534]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:22:18.534 --> 03:22:19.854]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:22:20.074 --> 03:22:21.575]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:22:21.575 --> 03:22:24.937]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:22:24.937 --> 03:22:30.320]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:30.320 --> 03:22:39.405]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:22:39.605 --> 03:22:40.166]  We're good to go.
[03:23:01.829 --> 03:23:05.733]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[03:23:05.733 --> 03:23:07.675]  And I know you are too.
[03:23:07.675 --> 03:23:08.716]  Are you ready?
[03:23:08.716 --> 03:23:10.678]  Don't wait for an emergency to happen.
[03:23:10.678 --> 03:23:15.283]  Put a plan together now with quality dehydrated food from Ready Reserve Foods.
[03:23:15.283 --> 03:23:19.727]  For nearly 40 years, Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation canning the
[03:23:19.807 --> 03:23:20.588]  We're good to go.
[03:23:47.731 --> 03:23:50.556]  Call today for a free catalog, 1-800-453-2202 or visit ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[03:23:50.556 --> 03:23:50.896]  Call 1-800-453-2202.
[03:23:50.896 --> 03:23:52.940]  Ready Reserve Foods, Factory Direct, Wholesale Pricing.
[03:24:07.679 --> 03:24:11.361]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am in complete information overload.
[03:24:11.361 --> 03:24:21.888]  We do cover 50, 60 stories generally a day here on this four hour radio broadcast, but there's a story up on InfoWars.com and I just watched the video earlier and I just can't believe it.
[03:24:22.864 --> 03:24:33.630]  Federal agents harass and intimidate congressional candidate Charles Black, and he announced he was having a congressional campaign meeting at a gun range.
[03:24:33.630 --> 03:24:39.774]  And the federal officers drove three and a half hours to harass and intimidate congressional candidate Charles Black, running for U.S.
[03:24:39.774 --> 03:24:41.535]  House of Representatives for Arizona District 2.
[03:24:42.575 --> 03:24:53.678]  Agents then demand the people at the gun range unload their firearms and put them down and basically say they can't have a political meeting with guns and then demand that a ten-year-old girl stop videotaping them.
[03:24:53.678 --> 03:24:59.579]  This is exactly the type of corrupt government Mr. Black is out to shut down for the protection of the U.S.
[03:24:59.579 --> 03:25:00.139]  citizens.
[03:25:00.139 --> 03:25:03.300]  We have constitutional rights and no man is above the law.
[03:25:03.300 --> 03:25:06.201]  And I saw a video last week we posted on Infowars.com.
[03:25:06.201 --> 03:25:11.042]  A woman went out and had a pro-Palestinian rally of peaceful Americans
[03:25:12.478 --> 03:25:14.720]  against what happened with the flotilla.
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:17.102]  Whether you're for that or against it, it's her right.
[03:25:17.102 --> 03:25:24.508]  And two FBI agents come to her door and ask her if she's basically a terrorist and if she's planning violence.
[03:25:24.508 --> 03:25:27.691]  And she says, you know, I'm not planning anything, but why are you here?
[03:25:27.691 --> 03:25:31.494]  And it's because she had that public meeting.
[03:25:31.494 --> 03:25:32.836]  They want you to shut up.
[03:25:32.836 --> 03:25:34.157]  They want you to be intimidated.
[03:25:36.232 --> 03:25:39.813]  And I'm watching this video, it's up on Infowars.com.
[03:25:39.813 --> 03:25:41.254]  It's just how crazy they are!
[03:25:41.254 --> 03:25:45.495]  They're so crazy!
[03:25:45.495 --> 03:25:51.557]  I had FBI last year, about a week before Obama Deception came out, calling.
[03:25:51.557 --> 03:25:53.458]  And I called the number, and it was the FBI.
[03:25:53.458 --> 03:26:03.221]  They were calling my employees here, asking them about Alex Jones, asking about what I think of Obama, about the film.
[03:26:03.221 --> 03:26:04.882]  And so I had to release the film early.
[03:26:05.902 --> 03:26:08.343]  Because they were getting ready to come in here and try to shut it down.
[03:26:08.343 --> 03:26:12.344]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, this is secret police!
[03:26:12.344 --> 03:26:27.529]  And I've got a whole bunch of mainstream news articles today, CNS News, AP, you name it, where they're going, yeah, Obama could shut the internet down and he may start shutting it down and they may restrict free speech and they may restrict political statements because it's what we need now.
[03:26:27.529 --> 03:26:31.910]  I mean, they're just kind of coming out real calm and saying, yeah, we're going to take your freedom.
[03:26:35.131 --> 03:26:37.872]  Anthony in New York, then Danny Nelson, John Jim.
[03:26:37.872 --> 03:26:39.413]  Anthony, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:26:39.413 --> 03:26:41.974]  Hey Alex, this is Anthony Tolda.
[03:26:41.974 --> 03:26:47.256]  We spoke back in October after I made national news yelling at Steve Israel at a healthcare meeting.
[03:26:47.256 --> 03:26:48.056]  Yes, good job.
[03:26:49.352 --> 03:26:53.614]  Yeah, and Jason was kind enough to have me on his show on November 1st, too.
[03:26:53.614 --> 03:27:07.159]  Yeah, I mean, back then, 14, 15 months ago, the media was still saying that you were all financed by lobbyists, and that whole crowds would say, we don't want government health care, and they would say, it's a hoax!
[03:27:07.159 --> 03:27:10.420]  But now national polls show over 80% against it.
[03:27:10.420 --> 03:27:12.901]  When it passed, it was over 75%.
[03:27:12.901 --> 03:27:14.702]  And they just say it's all a hoax!
[03:27:14.702 --> 03:27:15.882]  It doesn't exist!
[03:27:15.882 --> 03:27:17.183]  You must be a racist, Anthony!
[03:27:18.562 --> 03:27:36.156]  Oh, well you're going to get me started on what I call the... Now there's a famous YouTube video or viral YouTube video of a woman screaming in my face calling me a racist in front of Atla Church in Harlem at day one of the Obama-CIA-Columbia University trial.
[03:27:36.156 --> 03:27:43.642]  I'm a friend of and ally of Reverend Manning, as I know you are, and there's been pretty much a media blackout on this whole trial.
[03:27:45.319 --> 03:27:55.562]  Well, we had Reverend Manning on about it, and covered the fact that he had a public trial to put this evidence out, but that's basically the skinny.
[03:27:55.562 --> 03:27:57.343]  But Obama is illegitimate.
[03:27:57.343 --> 03:27:58.383]  He is CIA.
[03:27:58.383 --> 03:28:00.104]  He is an Indonesian citizen.
[03:28:00.104 --> 03:28:00.864]  He is a traitor.
[03:28:00.864 --> 03:28:02.024]  He is a mobster.
[03:28:02.024 --> 03:28:12.627]  He does get his home and things in the past paid for by mobsters, just like BP paid for the million-dollar condo for years of Rahm Emanuel.
[03:28:12.627 --> 03:28:14.228]  It's just a lawless group of thugs.
[03:28:15.967 --> 03:28:23.577]  Sure, and if you want to talk about people being shut up and even shut up about this issue, Alex, a friend of mine got her radio show shut down.
[03:28:24.299 --> 03:28:37.829]  The station was shut down and the website was shut down 90 minutes before her program was going to air and I was going to be a guest and we were going to discuss this trial and my attendance there and the viral video and all this stuff.
[03:28:37.829 --> 03:28:42.112]  You know it takes a lot of time to do something like that even if that happened that might have been coincidental.
[03:28:42.112 --> 03:28:45.675]  I mean stations are being bought and sold and changing hands constantly.
[03:28:46.215 --> 03:28:47.637]  I mean, I have seen censorship.
[03:28:47.637 --> 03:28:52.021]  I've been censored myself many years ago, but I found The Awakening is on.
[03:28:52.021 --> 03:28:55.244]  They're trying to intimidate us now by taking the gloves off.
[03:28:55.244 --> 03:28:56.566]  I think it's going to backfire.
[03:28:56.566 --> 03:28:58.948]  So the answer is just scream more bloody murder, Anthony.
[03:28:58.948 --> 03:29:00.409]  Well, sure, Alex.
[03:29:00.409 --> 03:29:01.250]  That's why I called you.
[03:29:01.250 --> 03:29:04.874]  And of course, we can't prove that it was shut down because of the topic, but
[03:29:05.696 --> 03:29:16.065]  She did tell me that in the past when she was going to be a guest on the same network, different program, she was contacted by his truth squads and they threatened to sue her.
[03:29:16.065 --> 03:29:20.609]  Oh no, that does go on and we've had that happen and you've got to ignore it and I appreciate your call.
[03:29:20.609 --> 03:29:21.570]  Good to hear from you, Anthony.
[03:29:21.570 --> 03:29:22.751]  Keep up the good work.
[03:29:22.751 --> 03:29:23.511]  We're going to break here.
[03:29:23.511 --> 03:29:25.393]  I'm going to come back with more calls.
[03:29:25.393 --> 03:29:26.094]  It's a Catch-22.
[03:29:26.094 --> 03:29:29.777]  I could talk to each one of these callers for an hour but then I'll never get to your other calls.
[03:29:29.777 --> 03:29:32.499]  I have the newscast, in fact it's in
[03:29:33.940 --> 03:29:42.527]  All the Republican-Obama deception, we have short clips of it, where they have police on the news in Missouri and other states going, look, you talk bad about Obama, we're gonna come arrest you.
[03:29:42.527 --> 03:29:45.189]  This is how thuggish and how crazy they are.
[03:29:45.189 --> 03:29:47.091]  This is what they think of America.
[03:29:47.091 --> 03:29:48.752]  This is what they think of your rights.
[03:29:48.752 --> 03:29:51.915]  You gotta stand up to these mobsters and say, I'm not intimidated.
[03:29:51.915 --> 03:29:53.276]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.276 --> 03:29:55.818]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.818 --> 03:29:58.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.297 --> 03:30:05.478]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:30:05.478 --> 03:30:11.879]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:30:11.879 --> 03:30:19.260]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:30:19.260 --> 03:30:24.141]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:30:24.141 --> 03:30:26.282]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[03:30:29.102 --> 03:30:32.846]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:30:32.846 --> 03:30:35.128]  I'm happy to say, our business is going down the drain.
[03:30:35.128 --> 03:30:35.668]  Call us at 1-800-536-7000.
[03:30:49.881 --> 03:30:50.902]  We're good to go.
[03:31:02.912 --> 03:31:06.873]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:31:06.873 --> 03:31:15.735]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:31:15.735 --> 03:31:20.356]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:31:20.356 --> 03:31:31.178]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:31:31.818 --> 03:31:41.321]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:31:41.321 --> 03:31:46.763]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:31:46.763 --> 03:31:54.246]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:31:54.246 --> 03:31:57.007]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:32:00.759 --> 03:32:05.323]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:05.323 --> 03:32:06.243]  Number 1.
[03:32:06.243 --> 03:32:09.666]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:09.666 --> 03:32:10.527]  Number 2.
[03:32:10.527 --> 03:32:15.410]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:32:15.410 --> 03:32:16.151]  It's true.
[03:32:16.151 --> 03:32:21.035]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:32:21.035 --> 03:32:21.855]  Number 3.
[03:32:21.855 --> 03:32:25.438]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:32:25.438 --> 03:32:29.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:32:29.341 --> 03:32:30.142]  Number 4.
[03:32:30.142 --> 03:32:32.904]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:32:32.904 --> 03:32:36.587]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:32:36.587 --> 03:32:37.368]  Number 5.
[03:32:37.368 --> 03:32:41.532]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:32:41.532 --> 03:32:46.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:46.556 --> 03:32:50.738]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:50.738 --> 03:32:52.519]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:52.519 --> 03:32:54.781]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:32:54.781 --> 03:32:57.122]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:33:03.704 --> 03:33:09.786]  We've got 27 minutes left in live radio broadcast.
[03:33:09.786 --> 03:33:13.227]  I'll be back live this Sunday with the abbreviated Sunday Show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:13.227 --> 03:33:14.827]  Central, that's 5 to 7 p.m.
[03:33:14.827 --> 03:33:16.128]  Eastern.
[03:33:16.128 --> 03:33:23.250]  I want to try to hurry through Danny, Nelson, John, Jim, and Eric's calls, at least those calls, perhaps even more at 1-800-259-9231, because I then
[03:33:27.807 --> 03:33:33.249]  I want to go through all this news that I haven't yet covered yet.
[03:33:33.249 --> 03:33:37.910]  Look at this article out of the San Antonio Express News, hidden in plain view.
[03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:43.292]  Agents find 48 immigrants locked in tractor trailer.
[03:33:43.292 --> 03:33:46.713]  48 unauthorized immigrants were found locked in a tractor trailer.
[03:33:48.618 --> 03:33:49.958]  In Laredo.
[03:33:49.958 --> 03:33:50.979]  Unauthorized.
[03:33:50.979 --> 03:33:52.259]  It's not illegal alien.
[03:33:52.259 --> 03:33:53.760]  It's not illegal immigrant.
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:54.800]  It's unauthorized.
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:57.121]  See, this is the political correctness, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:57.121 --> 03:34:06.084]  You try to sneak into Mexico, they will put you in a forced labor camp for at least a year and extort money out of your family on record.
[03:34:06.084 --> 03:34:08.164]  But nobody talks bad about that.
[03:34:08.164 --> 03:34:12.286]  No, it's only America, because we're a bunch of schmucks, according to the elite.
[03:34:12.286 --> 03:34:15.667]  We're a bunch of people who can be guilted into going along with anything.
[03:34:17.557 --> 03:34:20.439]  And I wanted to dovetail that with Mexican flag.
[03:34:20.439 --> 03:34:22.501]  And we'll play some of this in the background while I talk about it.
[03:34:22.501 --> 03:34:25.764]  Mexican flag waving Lakers fans riot in L.A.
[03:34:25.764 --> 03:34:26.664]  This is out of the sun.
[03:34:26.664 --> 03:34:29.086]  And we have the video of this.
[03:34:29.086 --> 03:34:32.489]  Illegal aliens.
[03:34:32.489 --> 03:34:34.491]  Just incredible photos in the L.A.
[03:34:34.491 --> 03:34:34.891]  Times.
[03:34:34.891 --> 03:34:36.713]  It's even more powerful than the video.
[03:34:36.713 --> 03:34:41.617]  They go up to people's cars and turn cars over with people in them.
[03:34:43.732 --> 03:34:50.274]  By the way, with Hispanics in them, if you look at the photos, but they are waving Mexican flags as they turn cars over.
[03:34:50.274 --> 03:34:57.357]  So it's not even an anti-white thing, it's just a crazy pro-Mexico thing with big, giant Mexican flags waving.
[03:34:57.357 --> 03:34:59.697]  There's photos and videos all over the web in a minute.
[03:34:59.697 --> 03:35:04.559]  On this video you can see the Mexican flags, two giant ones being waved.
[03:35:04.559 --> 03:35:06.540]  And, I mean, this is the insanity.
[03:35:06.540 --> 03:35:10.141]  Why don't these people go to Mexico and riot against their corrupt government?
[03:35:11.223 --> 03:35:14.526]  Well, because their government would machine gun them, as they do routinely.
[03:35:14.526 --> 03:35:15.988]  There's the Mexican flags.
[03:35:15.988 --> 03:35:16.949]  Why?
[03:35:16.949 --> 03:35:19.831]  Why wouldn't they get upset against the tyranny in their own country?
[03:35:19.831 --> 03:35:19.871]  No!
[03:35:21.598 --> 03:35:22.719]  The Lakers win.
[03:35:22.719 --> 03:35:24.300]  Did they win?
[03:35:24.300 --> 03:35:25.080]  I wouldn't even pay attention.
[03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:26.001]  They said it was a celebration.
[03:35:26.001 --> 03:35:26.922]  I guess they won.
[03:35:26.922 --> 03:35:33.286]  And so let's riot all over the downtown area and let's turn cars over with people in them.
[03:35:33.286 --> 03:35:34.427]  Let's break out windows.
[03:35:34.427 --> 03:35:36.908]  Let's set fires to cabs.
[03:35:36.908 --> 03:35:44.013]  Let's, I mean, let's do all of this for hours and have the police just stand down.
[03:35:44.013 --> 03:35:50.998]  Can you imagine if the Tea Party would have tumped over a newspaper stand or would have burnt a car or would have turned a car over?
[03:35:51.958 --> 03:35:53.279]  In fact, I didn't give you this, guys.
[03:35:53.279 --> 03:35:59.884]  I'm going to give you an LA Times article where they have a photo of the Hispanics in a car and then the car was turned over.
[03:35:59.884 --> 03:36:05.489]  You got a Hispanic family in a car and these crazy lunatics with Mexican flags run up and turn the car over.
[03:36:05.489 --> 03:36:06.189]  I mean, what?
[03:36:06.189 --> 03:36:09.371]  And they're all smiling and laughing like it's fun.
[03:36:09.371 --> 03:36:11.053]  This is mob psychology, folks.
[03:36:11.053 --> 03:36:12.894]  This is what happened in Nazi Germany.
[03:36:12.894 --> 03:36:15.356]  This is what happened in Soviet Russia with the communists.
[03:36:15.356 --> 03:36:17.017]  They just get all like it's fun.
[03:36:17.017 --> 03:36:20.340]  It's just they get all wound up because a stupid sports team won.
[03:36:22.912 --> 03:36:29.730]  But again, at a tribal level, all humans have this when your team is mock gladiatorial warfare.
[03:36:30.939 --> 03:36:41.804]  And so it hits the same neurons, the same ganglia in the brain that when you invest in your basketball, football, baseball, or favorite golfer, when they make that score, you feel like you had a victory.
[03:36:41.804 --> 03:36:50.427]  You're supposed to feel good in a war because a tribe that was coming to kill all the males, take the women and children as slaves, that's what all cultures did.
[03:36:50.427 --> 03:36:53.368]  Africans, the Germanic tribes, they all did this.
[03:36:53.368 --> 03:36:54.509]  Didn't matter what area of the world.
[03:36:56.670 --> 03:37:00.354]  The war instinct is so you see your wife and kids again.
[03:37:00.354 --> 03:37:03.418]  It doesn't matter if you get your bones broken or your head clubbed in.
[03:37:03.418 --> 03:37:06.541]  You're happy to go out there and you're not afraid.
[03:37:06.541 --> 03:37:09.104]  You know, the enemy lands in their ships.
[03:37:09.104 --> 03:37:10.826]  It's 4,000 years ago.
[03:37:10.826 --> 03:37:13.149]  They're going to try to drag your women and children off.
[03:37:13.149 --> 03:37:14.450]  You are ready to kill some people.
[03:37:15.131 --> 03:37:16.152]  And you can really fight.
[03:37:16.152 --> 03:37:17.552]  You can go wild.
[03:37:17.552 --> 03:37:25.496]  And always those being attacked statistically have a higher victory rate even when they're overwhelmed than those who are attacking.
[03:37:25.496 --> 03:37:37.062]  Because the guys being attacking are from some big rich tribe who are there to get more women and money and gold for King Booga Booga who's on a power trip back across, you know, the ocean 200 miles away on his island.
[03:37:37.062 --> 03:37:38.123]  Okay?
[03:37:38.123 --> 03:37:41.725]  And so they don't really want to go up the hill and kill these people.
[03:37:43.308 --> 03:37:51.452]  So all this hopping around and tumping cars over, that's meant to defend liberty, your freedom, so you don't go into bondage.
[03:37:51.452 --> 03:37:59.477]  And so when your team wins, you get all irrationally happy because it means you're not going to have your head clubbed in and your women aren't going to be hauled off to be slaves.
[03:38:01.004 --> 03:38:02.306]  That's where that comes from.
[03:38:02.306 --> 03:38:08.472]  See, when I get all animated and excited and angry and upset, that's because I'm ready for war, folks.
[03:38:08.472 --> 03:38:10.755]  I'm waging war against the New World Order.
[03:38:10.755 --> 03:38:14.519]  I am exposing their fraud, their hypocrisy, their dehumanization.
[03:38:14.519 --> 03:38:16.882]  I know they think of us as worse than scum.
[03:38:16.882 --> 03:38:19.285]  They see us as negatives to be removed like trash.
[03:38:24.305 --> 03:38:26.708]  They are burning cars after they turn them over.
[03:38:26.708 --> 03:38:29.411]  I mean, this went on.
[03:38:29.411 --> 03:38:32.114]  Agents, but again, you can't call them illegal aliens.
[03:38:32.114 --> 03:38:34.817]  They'd be called unauthorized immigrants.
[03:38:34.817 --> 03:38:39.562]  Mexican flag-waving Lakers fans riot in L.A.
[03:38:39.562 --> 03:38:39.922]  L.A.
[03:38:39.922 --> 03:38:42.485]  struck by basketball riots.
[03:38:43.496 --> 03:38:47.619]  Despite heavy LAPD presence, violence breaks out after Lakers victory.
[03:38:47.619 --> 03:38:54.703]  Crowds hurl bottles, other objects at police, smash marquees, jump on vehicles, break windows, and light fires along, uh...
[03:38:56.374 --> 03:39:02.456]  I think this is the LA Times article that had the photo on the page, where it shows the family, and then you'll notice it's the same white car.
[03:39:02.456 --> 03:39:03.216]  They didn't set on fire.
[03:39:24.170 --> 03:39:26.071]  Oh, and everybody's smiling.
[03:39:26.071 --> 03:39:30.012]  Oh, it's fun to top this car over full of a family that went to a Lakers game.
[03:39:30.012 --> 03:39:31.613]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[03:39:31.613 --> 03:39:39.476]  Well, see, these guys have got what their great-great-great-great-grandfathers had, an instinct to defend themselves and to have war.
[03:39:39.476 --> 03:39:48.780]  But now they go and feel like their team won, so they're so jazzed up for war because they just had a simulated combat, bread and circus, that they've got to go out and have a war.
[03:39:50.046 --> 03:40:01.571]  But see, notice the other warrior class, the police didn't do anything to them, because the police know this is a protected group, the big bosses want the borders open, and so this group's gotta be left alone.
[03:40:01.571 --> 03:40:06.573]  That's why they riot all the time, because they've been given the message it's okay.
[03:40:06.573 --> 03:40:13.537]  Now, Paul Watson wrote an excellent article that's up on GCN Live, that's G-C-N, like the network, GCNLive.com.
[03:40:15.490 --> 03:40:22.281]  And it says, what if the Tea Partiers waving Gadsden flags had trashed L.A.?
[03:40:22.281 --> 03:40:27.149]  Story's also up on PrisonPlanet.com, but what if Tea Partiers waving Gadsden flags had trashed L.A.?
[03:40:27.149 --> 03:40:28.391]  Yeah, what would happen?
[03:40:29.735 --> 03:40:30.736]  No, that's not the one.
[03:40:30.736 --> 03:40:31.416]  I don't know.
[03:40:31.416 --> 03:40:33.118]  There's a bunch of LA Times stories.
[03:40:33.118 --> 03:40:34.599]  It's an LA Times story.
[03:40:34.599 --> 03:40:36.420]  I linked off it off Drudge this morning.
[03:40:36.420 --> 03:40:40.123]  And it shows the family in their car with everybody around it smiling, rocking it.
[03:40:40.123 --> 03:40:41.605]  The car's kind of on its edge.
[03:40:41.605 --> 03:40:42.926]  It's a white car.
[03:40:42.926 --> 03:40:46.789]  And then you read the article later, they turn it over and set it on fire.
[03:40:46.789 --> 03:40:49.751]  Oh, look, we're setting a car on fire full of people.
[03:40:49.751 --> 03:40:53.014]  And again, they didn't go out and find white people's car to burn.
[03:40:53.014 --> 03:40:53.875]  It was other Hispanics.
[03:40:55.152 --> 03:41:00.994]  Just mindless violence, mindless idiocy, mindless craziness.
[03:41:00.994 --> 03:41:05.455]  It's like black people randomly attacking whites during the LA riots.
[03:41:05.455 --> 03:41:06.816]  Remember Reginald Denny?
[03:41:06.816 --> 03:41:08.976]  Banging his face into where he had reconstructive surgery.
[03:41:08.976 --> 03:41:10.077]  It was like a flap of skin.
[03:41:13.399 --> 03:41:14.940]  At least this didn't appear to be racial.
[03:41:14.940 --> 03:41:16.980]  It was just waving Mexican flags.
[03:41:16.980 --> 03:41:18.641]  And any group can behave like this.
[03:41:18.641 --> 03:41:24.883]  The point is, political correctness has said it's okay for these groups to do it, so they're constantly doing it.
[03:41:24.883 --> 03:41:26.103]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[03:41:26.103 --> 03:41:27.204]  I'm going to get into all this other news.
[03:41:27.204 --> 03:41:31.765]  Like 10 stories in the news that the BP oil spill is overshadowing.
[03:41:31.765 --> 03:41:34.406]  Very important article up at GCNLive.com.
[03:41:34.406 --> 03:41:42.069]  It also originates from PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson, Paul Watson, and myself.
[03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:46.142]  We all worked on this story together this morning.
[03:41:46.142 --> 03:41:49.244]  Let's go ahead and go to Danny in Tejas in Texas.
[03:41:49.244 --> 03:41:49.744]  You're on the air.
[03:41:49.744 --> 03:41:51.265]  Go ahead.
[03:41:51.265 --> 03:41:51.745]  Hey, Alex.
[03:41:51.745 --> 03:41:53.406]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:41:53.406 --> 03:42:01.271]  I'm calling in regards to a Fox News report about the 10 Afghan soldiers that are missing from Likeland Air Force Base.
[03:42:01.271 --> 03:42:04.854]  This whole report kind of stinks to high heaven.
[03:42:04.854 --> 03:42:11.178]  All of these soldiers appear to have DOD Common Access cards.
[03:42:11.178 --> 03:42:13.179]  The report says that they
[03:42:13.907 --> 03:42:21.644]  Have all the credentials to gain access to certain government sites, but also they have been missing for three months.
[03:42:21.644 --> 03:42:23.709]  The last one went missing three months ago.
[03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:35.990]  Well, some of these attacks are real Muslim extremists, but most of them are double or triple agents who aren't defecting.
[03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:39.533]  Their money, their leader, has been paid by the U.S.
[03:42:39.533 --> 03:42:48.962]  on record, they've been caught over and over again, to go out and tell their low-level idiots who really believe they're fighting for Allah to go blow something up, and that's why it's come out that Israeli, U.S.,
[03:42:49.522 --> 03:42:50.623]  Well, I just thought it was kind of odd that
[03:43:17.665 --> 03:43:39.090]  The Fox News reports that one day after the Be On Lookout bulletins went out to every law enforcement agency in the country, but a senior law enforcement official says that there appears to be no ties to terrorists or any other organization like that.
[03:43:39.090 --> 03:43:44.751]  Why would they wait three months to send this out the day before it's released on Fox News?
[03:43:46.141 --> 03:43:51.884]  Because it's all public relations to create the illusion that there are all these Muslims that want to kill us.
[03:43:51.884 --> 03:43:58.248]  They think we're so dumb they admit they put out fake Al-Qaeda videos of Bin Laden and then tell us that Bin Laden's still alive in Iran.
[03:43:58.248 --> 03:44:03.391]  I mean, you know, now they say Al-Qaeda works with the militias.
[03:44:03.391 --> 03:44:08.354]  Al-Qaeda is literally... Bin Laden is like a little play doll with a turban and a beard.
[03:44:08.354 --> 03:44:09.915]  Well, we want to attack the militias?
[03:44:09.915 --> 03:44:11.176]  Say he's with them.
[03:44:11.176 --> 03:44:12.397]  We want to attack Iran?
[03:44:12.397 --> 03:44:13.257]  Say he's with them.
[03:44:13.257 --> 03:44:14.198]  I mean, it's literally
[03:44:15.419 --> 03:44:17.781]  I mean, I feel like you can't believe anything
[03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:24.641]  That you hear.
[03:44:24.641 --> 03:44:27.463]  Anything put out by the mainstream media.
[03:44:27.463 --> 03:44:27.783]  Nothing.
[03:44:27.783 --> 03:44:28.643]  It's all lies.
[03:44:28.643 --> 03:44:30.224]  And that's what they want.
[03:44:30.224 --> 03:44:32.446]  They want it to where you just can't believe anything.
[03:44:32.446 --> 03:44:42.373]  And yes, on big PR issues, when you see them hyping something across the board, it is almost always a complete lie, or at least a spin or distortion.
[03:44:42.373 --> 03:44:46.596]  Now, if they report something good though, you can bet it's true.
[03:44:54.206 --> 03:44:56.608]  American gun owners?
[03:44:56.608 --> 03:45:00.991]  Isn't it great they take your blood secretly for a Pentagon database at birth?
[03:45:00.991 --> 03:45:07.855]  Isn't it great that they're forcing flu vaccines in New York State and Massachusetts?
[03:45:07.855 --> 03:45:11.177]  So there's different types and you learn to recognize it.
[03:45:11.177 --> 03:45:17.622]  Isn't it great we're going to attack Iran because they've got Bin Laden?
[03:45:17.622 --> 03:45:18.663]  Then you can tell
[03:45:20.354 --> 03:45:25.697]  Again, I should write a book or a handbook just on what I've learned because I've totally learned how they operate.
[03:45:25.697 --> 03:45:27.679]  They basically have got game plans.
[03:45:27.679 --> 03:45:29.540]  They've got a playbook.
[03:45:29.540 --> 03:45:33.122]  So, they'll admit horrible things but say they're good.
[03:45:33.122 --> 03:45:35.803]  Or they'll say good things are bad.
[03:45:35.803 --> 03:45:37.764]  Or they'll flat out lie.
[03:45:37.764 --> 03:45:38.605]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:45:38.605 --> 03:45:45.369]  I follow you, but it's also surprising to me why is Fox News the only one that's reported it?
[03:45:47.699 --> 03:45:58.028]  I noticed Sky Television, owned by Rupert Murdoch in England, five years ago was saying white Al-Qaeda, white people, gun owners, conservatives, secretly are being trained by Bin Laden.
[03:45:58.028 --> 03:46:06.156]  And then I saw these talking points in neocon publications saying I had been raised in Afghanistan as a child, that I was an Al-Qaeda operative.
[03:46:06.156 --> 03:46:08.217]  And that was directly from the CIA putting this out.
[03:46:08.217 --> 03:46:11.721]  It didn't matter how crazy it was, it was just meant to confuse people.
[03:46:12.341 --> 03:46:20.968]  And then I told you they're going to announce white Al-Qaeda, and now the last two years they claim that militias and gun owners secretly are all working with Al-Qaeda.
[03:46:20.968 --> 03:46:26.373]  Because they're getting ready to sic homeland security on the American people and say we're all Al-Qaeda.
[03:46:26.373 --> 03:46:29.535]  I mean, all the real training is for the American people to begin with.
[03:46:29.535 --> 03:46:34.039]  But they'll just say, if you're for the Second Amendment or the Tea Party, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[03:46:34.039 --> 03:46:37.162]  And most of these conservatives will go, I'm not for Al-Qaeda, I'm turning my guns in.
[03:46:38.083 --> 03:46:39.685]  Yeah, because nothing's worse than Al-Qaeda.
[03:46:39.685 --> 03:46:43.710]  I mean, you understand the brainwashing here, Danny?
[03:46:43.710 --> 03:46:45.433]  Yeah, I understand.
[03:46:45.433 --> 03:46:51.481]  I also wonder if Alex Jones' listeners are going to be on that death list.
[03:46:52.403 --> 03:46:53.284]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:46:53.284 --> 03:46:56.526]  They're not going to want to move with a big giant takeover death list.
[03:46:56.526 --> 03:46:58.107]  They'll just start shutting the web down.
[03:46:58.107 --> 03:47:00.429]  I mean, here's a mainstream, you know, analysis.
[03:47:00.429 --> 03:47:04.932]  Lieberman introduces bill targeting internet freedom.
[03:47:04.932 --> 03:47:07.434]  I mean, this is from Joe Lieberman's own website.
[03:47:07.434 --> 03:47:09.995]  I mean, it's just they're openly, look, they're crooks!
[03:47:10.876 --> 03:47:13.817]  The entire White House is the most criminal group.
[03:47:13.817 --> 03:47:20.779]  I mean, Bush and Cheney were crooks, but they didn't openly have oil companies pay for their houses, which is completely illegal.
[03:47:20.779 --> 03:47:23.340]  I mean, they just do not care.
[03:47:23.340 --> 03:47:24.661]  They do not care.
[03:47:24.661 --> 03:47:29.942]  Well, it's like Bush two weeks ago saying, yeah, I ordered torture, which is totally illegal.
[03:47:29.942 --> 03:47:31.223]  They do not care.
[03:47:38.390 --> 03:47:39.110]  It was good Alex, Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:40.391]  It's actually Melvin from New York.
[03:48:00.325 --> 03:48:01.146]  Yeah, yeah, what's good?
[03:48:01.146 --> 03:48:02.927]  We spoke, like, a couple months back.
[03:48:02.927 --> 03:48:06.729]  I just want to tell you, man, I'm agnostic, but God bless you, man.
[03:48:06.729 --> 03:48:18.616]  I think the force that guides the universe is guiding you, because truth stands up by itself, and it's not on a man's integrity that is base, man, and I think you got a lot of it anyway.
[03:48:18.616 --> 03:48:20.717]  I just want to throw a quick little spark at you.
[03:48:20.717 --> 03:48:24.639]  Basically, from out here in New York, thanks to you, I'm waking one or two people up.
[03:48:24.639 --> 03:48:26.200]  It's becoming a police state out here.
[03:48:27.023 --> 03:48:29.705]  It's random searches in the subway.
[03:48:29.705 --> 03:48:37.912]  I mean, it's not like a movie, but it's happening, and it's there, the table's there, and it says, you are subject to random searches, no Fourth Amendment.
[03:48:37.912 --> 03:48:44.078]  They give announcements in the subway platforms, same thing, they give announcements in the train while you're riding it.
[03:48:44.078 --> 03:48:53.486]  And every time I go to work, there's a military with large machine guns, which goes against, that's against the law, the separation between police and military.
[03:48:53.486 --> 03:48:54.627]  Number two, zeitgeist.
[03:48:55.214 --> 03:49:02.216]  It has a bunch of truth in it, but in the end, it promotes the agenda of the United Nations, which is anti-private property.
[03:49:02.216 --> 03:49:03.517]  You want to get rid of all money.
[03:49:03.517 --> 03:49:05.137]  You're already exposed in an interview.
[03:49:05.137 --> 03:49:15.160]  That's anti-private property, and the United Nations believe the same thing, that that property belongs, quote-unquote, to everyone, and you don't have a right to your own property.
[03:49:15.160 --> 03:49:17.881]  Number three, the rise of the new right is disgusting.
[03:49:17.881 --> 03:49:20.202]  It's an insult to me, personally, as a person.
[03:49:20.202 --> 03:49:20.742]  I grew up
[03:49:21.900 --> 03:49:28.203]  I didn't grow up, but I was a worshipper of Bill Maher.
[03:49:28.203 --> 03:49:31.384]  Ed Schultz calling for the Fairness Doctrine?
[03:49:31.384 --> 03:49:31.984]  Disgusting!
[03:49:39.907 --> 03:49:52.612]  I haven't even counted 10, 20, 30 articles a day about military checkpoints, regular army at checkpoints, police in Missouri and in Texas and in New York, Vermont, randomly setting up checkpoints.
[03:49:52.612 --> 03:49:53.072]  Here's one.
[03:49:54.244 --> 03:49:54.884]  Uh, right here.
[03:49:54.884 --> 03:50:02.068]  Uh, it says, cops use check lane to solicit information about homicide from Shawnee Police Department.
[03:50:02.068 --> 03:50:17.875]  On Wednesday, June 16, 2010, between 9.30 and 10.30 p.m., the Shawnee Police Department will conduct a check lane at 7600 Block and Northbound Quiviria Road in an effort to solicit information which may be of assistance in the investigation of a homicide of Mr. G's Liquor Store.
[03:50:17.875 --> 03:50:18.235]  So, look.
[03:50:18.775 --> 03:50:26.437]  They just randomly set up a checkpoint and ask you questions, training you to line up, to be stopped, to answer questions.
[03:50:26.437 --> 03:50:27.477]  Nothing to do with crime.
[03:50:27.477 --> 03:50:36.380]  It's all about... Again, I sent my guys to a federal drill in Illinois and they witnessed troops with foreign troops training to take our guns this week.
[03:50:36.380 --> 03:50:37.740]  We have the video.
[03:50:37.740 --> 03:50:39.581]  They didn't even hide it.
[03:50:39.581 --> 03:50:42.402]  They're training the military to take our guns.
[03:50:42.402 --> 03:50:43.082]  Here's another one.
[03:50:44.505 --> 03:50:50.189]  Mayor admits NAFTA superhighway will run through Memphis by Eyewitness News.
[03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:53.991]  And here's the mayor saying we'll have a superhighway from Mexico through.
[03:50:53.991 --> 03:51:02.597]  Meanwhile, CNN says you're a dangerous criminal if you believe it's a North American Union Highway when it's publicly been built in Texas.
[03:51:02.597 --> 03:51:03.918]  Don't answer it!
[03:51:04.463 --> 03:51:12.567]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:51:12.567 --> 03:51:14.047]  800-477-9256.
[03:51:14.047 --> 03:51:20.130]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:51:20.390 --> 03:51:24.675]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:51:24.675 --> 03:51:32.043]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:51:54.961 --> 03:51:55.261]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:52:01.525 --> 03:52:03.848]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:52:03.848 --> 03:52:06.231]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:52:06.231 --> 03:52:09.434]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:52:09.434 --> 03:52:14.540]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:14.540 --> 03:52:18.745]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:19.045 --> 03:52:21.387]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:21.387 --> 03:52:24.290]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:24.290 --> 03:52:27.193]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:27.193 --> 03:52:34.800]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:35.140 --> 03:52:40.523]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:40.523 --> 03:52:42.845]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:42.845 --> 03:52:47.067]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:47.067 --> 03:52:48.148]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:48.148 --> 03:52:49.489]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:49.489 --> 03:52:50.970]  Invisible Empire.

[03:53:00.874 --> 03:53:01.554]  You worry.
[03:53:01.554 --> 03:53:03.916]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[03:53:03.916 --> 03:53:04.456]  Hi.
[03:53:04.456 --> 03:53:07.238]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[03:53:07.238 --> 03:53:11.781]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[03:53:11.781 --> 03:53:14.263]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[03:53:14.263 --> 03:53:17.285]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[03:53:17.685 --> 03:53:18.226]  We're good to go.
[03:53:38.869 --> 03:53:39.570]  I don't know.
[03:54:11.383 --> 03:54:15.386]  I mean, think how dumb that the establishment thinks you are.
[03:54:15.386 --> 03:54:18.288]  The contempt!
[03:54:18.288 --> 03:54:24.512]  They, for four years, had giant trans-Texas corridor highway signs up everywhere.
[03:54:24.512 --> 03:54:31.737]  They were seizing the existing roads with taxpayer money, building new ones and putting toll roads on it, saying it was going to fund the North American Union.
[03:54:31.737 --> 03:54:33.499]  We had the SPP documents.
[03:54:33.499 --> 03:54:34.920]  The legislature said no.
[03:54:34.920 --> 03:54:36.041]  Rick Perry went ahead with it.
[03:54:36.781 --> 03:54:43.807]  And then I've got video clips of CNN two years ago saying Ron Paul is insane and this doesn't exist.
[03:54:43.807 --> 03:54:51.014]  Now I saw them a month ago saying Rand Paul's nuts on CNN and MSNBC and believes in the Napa Superhighway.
[03:54:51.014 --> 03:54:52.195]  I have the federal documents.
[03:54:52.195 --> 03:54:53.576]  It's on record.
[03:54:53.576 --> 03:54:57.299]  84 national highways to be turned into international trade zones.
[03:54:57.299 --> 03:54:59.161]  The mayor of Kansas City is on record.
[03:54:59.161 --> 03:55:00.822]  The mayor of Memphis is on record.
[03:55:02.250 --> 03:55:03.591]  It's CBS television!
[03:55:03.591 --> 03:55:06.172]  You can go watch the stinking video!
[03:55:06.172 --> 03:55:10.874]  I mean, one of the stinking things is four miles from me, the big giant, what is it?
[03:55:10.874 --> 03:55:12.655]  What's that big toll road that's part of it?
[03:55:12.655 --> 03:55:12.895]  IH30?
[03:55:15.089 --> 03:55:18.150]  I mean, it is just, yeah, yeah, 130.
[03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:19.851]  I mean, this stuff is just everywhere.
[03:55:19.851 --> 03:55:25.573]  And then, last year, I saw the headline, Trans-Texas Corridor Cancelled, Lost American Statesmen.
[03:55:25.573 --> 03:55:35.297]  And I instantly knew that within the fourth or fifth paragraph they would announce, they were simply renaming it and breaking it into sub-pieces, and that none of it was cancelled.
[03:55:35.297 --> 03:55:36.738]  Because I've seen them do this in Europe.
[03:55:36.738 --> 03:55:37.898]  I've seen them do this in Canada.
[03:55:37.898 --> 03:55:39.299]  I've seen them do this in New Jersey.
[03:55:39.299 --> 03:55:40.419]  I know their tactics.
[03:55:40.419 --> 03:55:42.080]  And the third paragraph, I read it on air,
[03:55:43.060 --> 03:55:57.285]  That's how dumb MSNBC and CNN thinks you are.
[03:55:57.285 --> 03:55:59.446]  That's what scum they think you are.
[03:55:59.446 --> 03:56:08.489]  That's how evil and how deceptive they are as they get up on television and tell you this doesn't exist.
[03:56:08.489 --> 03:56:09.469]  It's like they're still saying there's
[03:56:10.697 --> 03:56:16.101]  In that Chris Matthews special, I had gone there and said, oh wow, they didn't imply I'm going to kill cops.
[03:56:16.101 --> 03:56:17.281]  They cut me out of that part.
[03:56:17.281 --> 03:56:18.823]  I'm very thankful.
[03:56:18.823 --> 03:56:22.625]  And I was talking to my mom yesterday, like I said, I dropped by her house to say hi to my parents.
[03:56:22.625 --> 03:56:26.648]  And I said, mom, they cut the part out where they said that I was going to influence people to shoot cops.
[03:56:26.648 --> 03:56:28.109]  She said, no, they didn't.
[03:56:28.109 --> 03:56:31.751]  They had POTOC from the Southern Poverty Law Center call you Alex.
[03:56:31.751 --> 03:56:34.413]  Like, yeah, we're watching Alex, you know, like personal.
[03:56:34.413 --> 03:56:36.775]  Not Alex Jones, not Mr. Jones, Alex.
[03:56:38.407 --> 03:56:45.688]  That's how much, you know, they feel familiar with me as they spy on us and everything else and write demonization reports.
[03:56:45.688 --> 03:56:49.209]  He said, Alex probably isn't going to shoot and kill anybody.
[03:56:49.209 --> 03:56:51.009]  I went back and watched it.
[03:56:51.009 --> 03:56:53.890]  But his followers certainly are.
[03:56:53.890 --> 03:56:56.230]  I mean, you know, that's how these people are operating.
[03:56:56.230 --> 03:56:58.211]  And I'm just flat out of time.
[03:56:58.211 --> 03:57:00.071]  And I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:57:00.071 --> 03:57:01.051]  I got to a lot of calls.
[03:57:01.051 --> 03:57:02.812]  I apologize to those that are holding.
[03:57:02.812 --> 03:57:03.612]  But we will get to you.
[03:57:06.829 --> 03:57:18.986]  Back on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., the very important article up on PrisonPlanet.com, 10 stories in the news that BP oil spill is overshadowing, like the impending attack on Iran, and you heard
[03:57:20.489 --> 03:57:26.192]  The doctor earlier concurring with my analysis that that is a serious, serious threat.
[03:57:26.192 --> 03:57:28.574]  We do have some big guests lined up next week, by the way.
[03:57:28.574 --> 03:57:30.435]  You'll definitely want to join us for that.
[03:57:30.435 --> 03:57:34.117]  In closing, I want to also thank the sponsors that have made this show possible.
[03:57:34.117 --> 03:57:37.699]  The online video bookstore at InfoWars.com funds us.
[03:57:37.699 --> 03:57:40.921]  Your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships fund us.

[03:57:48.786 --> 03:57:51.467]  Uh, not 10-year-old crud that most of these other companies are selling.
[03:57:51.467 --> 03:57:53.388]  And I'm just sorry to say a lot of them are selling old crud.
[03:57:53.388 --> 03:57:55.449]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years old.
[03:57:55.449 --> 03:57:56.530]  Not eFoodsDirect.
[03:57:56.530 --> 03:57:58.090]  The letter eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:57:58.090 --> 03:57:59.891]  Just eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:57:59.891 --> 03:58:02.492]  Links on Infowars.com.

[03:58:09.476 --> 03:58:11.316]  eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[03:58:14.858 --> 03:58:17.459]  And lastly, I want to thank PureWaterFreedom.com.

[03:58:38.806 --> 03:58:39.546]  We're out of time.
[03:58:39.546 --> 03:58:40.746]  See you back Sunday and Monday.
[03:58:40.746 --> 03:58:41.146]  God bless.
[03:58:41.146 --> 03:58:41.787]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:41.787 --> 03:58:42.267]  Fight tyranny!
[03:58:43.780 --> 03:58:45.641]  A decade of talk.
[03:58:45.641 --> 03:58:51.603]  Great Talk Radio is here on the Genesis Communications Network.
[03:58:51.603 --> 03:58:55.725]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:58:55.725 --> 03:58:56.986]  Tyranny is here.
[03:58:56.986 --> 03:59:00.807]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:59:00.807 --> 03:59:03.149]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:59:03.149 --> 03:59:08.571]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
