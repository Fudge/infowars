[02:17.760 --> 02:26.560]  segment daily presidential tracking poll daily presidential tracking poll rasmussen has Obama
[02:26.560 --> 02:36.280]  at an all-time low of 41 percent now that is kind of a mainstream mainline poll some polls
[02:36.280 --> 02:41.040]  have him in the low 30 so he's continuing to break his previous records of having the lowest
[02:41.040 --> 02:46.760]  approval rating of any president six months into their administration one year into their
[02:46.760 --> 02:55.920]  administration a year and a half into his administration showing you the people see through
[02:55.920 --> 03:02.080]  this manifest fraud but do they see through the fraud of the entire system and how the
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.520]  Republicans are bought and paid for by the very same interest and are playing the part of the
[03:06.520 --> 03:13.480]  anti-establishment well just like Obama Barry Sitaro did to get into power yes they're starting
[03:13.480 --> 03:23.160]  to wake up to that final illusion $7 a gallon gas that's what a Harvard study shows that's what
[03:23.160 --> 03:27.640]  happened in Europe with the carbon tax that's what's gonna happen if Obama is able to implement
[03:27.640 --> 03:34.120]  his carbon tax meanwhile Obama plans to sneak through carbon tax by stealth that's the prison
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.280]  planet dot com article and the only way he's doing it by stealth is the mainstream media
[03:38.280 --> 03:47.400]  won't really report what's in the Lieberman carry bill it is a version of the House bill
[03:47.400 --> 03:57.040]  that passed last year and it does give a blank check power to the EPA to carry out their carbon
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.160]  taxes in the middle of this emergency the answer is tax the American people but don't
[04:02.160 --> 04:10.280]  worry the gallant little Nobel Prize winning genius that 50 days ago Obama 50 plus days
[04:10.280 --> 04:16.200]  ago early in the oil spill dispatch down there did the gallant little genius fix everything
[04:16.200 --> 04:25.240]  remember Henry Kissinger is a Nobel Prize winner for peace what a sick joke how about
[04:25.240 --> 04:30.200]  Israel give Hitler an award it's about the same thing or let's give an anti-communist
[04:30.200 --> 04:39.840]  award to Joe Stalin posthumously I mean it's that stupid remember Al Gore Mr. Fraud was
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.920]  given one I mean it's a disgrace to be given a Nobel Prize but don't worry all the Nobel
[04:44.920 --> 04:52.080]  Prize winners and all Barry Sitaros men couldn't put their global warming stinking fraud back

[08:21.800 --> 08:27.480]  former member high-level member of MI six who really trailblazed right up there with
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.200]  Jim Tucker and others documenting the true power structure of the new order system the
[08:32.200 --> 08:40.560]  Anglo-American committee of three hundred that goes back to the black nobility of Italy
[08:40.560 --> 08:49.920]  and the city states that have really developed the modern imperial system that we live under
[08:49.920 --> 08:56.280]  he will be joining us coming up in the last hour today when I open the phones up at the
[08:56.280 --> 09:00.880]  bottom of the hour you're welcome to call in about any issue you want the fact that
[09:00.880 --> 09:08.040]  the UN has already passed sanctions and is set to pass more draconian sanctions to begin
[09:08.040 --> 09:18.160]  boarding all naval vessels bound for Iran or leaving Iran and not allowing refined gasoline
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.800]  to come in not allowing metal to come in not allowing a list of literally thousands of
[09:23.800 --> 09:30.200]  things to come into Iran which is an act of war under national law international law congressman
[09:30.200 --> 09:34.680]  Ron Paul of course has pointed that out in several house floor speeches that we've posted
[09:34.680 --> 09:41.320]  at info wars dot com and present one dot com we've also played here on air this is serious
[09:41.320 --> 09:48.280]  Israel is openly saying they may nuke preemptively Iran at any time Israel is also saying that
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.480]  they want the U.S. to support them in a bombardment and the word from Bilderberg group is that
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.840]  they are now green lighting an attack on Iran that is Bilderberg is given the nod the majority
[09:58.840 --> 10:04.820]  of them and so that is moving into play right now and other analysts we have on like Ray
[10:04.820 --> 10:10.000]  McGovern top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior agree it's becoming more
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.880]  more green lighted Webster Tarpley dr. Tarpley agrees just every expert we talked to and
[10:17.880 --> 10:25.520]  of course my own historical breakdown analysis can clearly see that war with Iran has moved
[10:25.520 --> 10:35.960]  from the back burner to the front burner big time big time and now you have this provocation
[10:35.960 --> 10:45.120]  while we're busy looking at the Gulf oil spill which is very important but compared to a attack
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.400]  on the nation of Iran almost 70 million people with high tech weapons systems that haven't
[10:50.400 --> 10:57.240]  been under a decade plus of crippling sanctions an attack on Iran will lead bare minimum to
[10:57.240 --> 11:03.600]  a major regional escalation and conflict in massive casualties by Shiite backed forces
[11:03.600 --> 11:13.040]  attacking U.S. forces inside Iraq U.S. ships being attacked in the Gulf black ops squads
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.040]  being activated in the West to carry out real terror attacks this is not going to be pretty
[11:18.040 --> 11:25.720]  Russia and China saying they may weigh in China even more so on record then Russia weigh
[11:25.720 --> 11:33.360]  in with some type of counter attack or sanctions on the United States the Iranians have said
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.600]  they will sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz they will block it it would take weeks to
[11:38.600 --> 11:44.240]  remove them if the engineer ships that the U.S. will send in and NATO will send in and
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.440]  Israel will try to send in even if you didn't have Iranian special forces from the cliffs
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.640]  above firing missiles firing artillery at them it would take bare minimum weeks to dredge
[11:56.640 --> 12:02.680]  out and remove sunken barges and ships now when they're being attacked you can forget
[12:02.680 --> 12:08.160]  it being removed ladies and gentlemen you know what's going to happen to oil prices
[12:08.160 --> 12:14.600]  they block the Strait of Hormuz well the conservative analysts say six to seven dollar
[12:14.600 --> 12:24.760]  a gallon gas in the United States an equivalent of twelve to fourteen euros a gallon as they
[12:24.760 --> 12:34.720]  do it in leaders over in the European Union and Britannia so Albion UK whatever you want
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.440]  to call it the point is that this is not good but it's good for the globalist who've stolen
[12:40.440 --> 12:45.080]  tens of trillions and are setting up a police state and are openly establishing a new bank
[12:45.080 --> 12:49.600]  of the world that we will all pay our carbon taxes to the only way they're going to get
[12:49.600 --> 12:55.080]  all this ram through is a war that's what the ran corporation called for almost three
[12:55.080 --> 13:01.600]  years ago read Paul Watson's articles about it it's all over the foreign European and
[13:01.600 --> 13:07.960]  Chinese and Russian news not in the news here in the United States game on ladies and gentlemen
[13:07.960 --> 13:15.440]  for an attack so so so what else what else is going on that is a distraction what is
[13:15.440 --> 13:22.680]  the oil spill really serving for well it's it's serving as a as a crisis to get the government
[13:22.680 --> 13:27.400]  takeover of our existing energy systems the globalists have already shut off our industry
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.120]  they've already raised our taxes they've already bankrupt the states all part of the
[13:31.120 --> 13:38.480]  stated Goldman Sachs JP Morgan private Federal Reserve plan we're going into indentured servitude
[13:38.480 --> 13:43.680]  we're going into economic bondage they've already destroyed us economically with naftan
[13:43.680 --> 13:49.600]  gatton globalism and so now they've already seized the automakers they've already are
[13:49.600 --> 13:54.760]  moving in with federal zoning federal land grabs a federal takeover of communications
[13:54.760 --> 13:59.640]  and the internet is all over the news being announced as if it's no big deal so so all
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.360]  of this is happening you've got Obama set and telling the U.S. ambassador to accept
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.240]  the U.N. ratification and he's saying he'll implement it through the bureaucracy through
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.720]  the Justice Department even the Senate won't ratify it officially for a total small arms
[14:14.720 --> 14:21.840]  ban worldwide including the U.S. that is openly going on we have the bugoi of its trial with
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.120]  a gag order they're moving for a gag order to block him because he came out two days
[14:26.120 --> 14:32.000]  ago and said look these payoffs lead back to Obama and Rahm Emanuel and Axelrod I'm being
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.640]  set up this is standard operating procedure in Chicago and we know Obama gets his houses
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.880]  paid for Rahm Emanuel gets him paid for by Goldman Sachs BP on record nobody gets in
[14:42.880 --> 14:50.800]  trouble so so this oil things a distraction from that it's a distraction from the economic
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.800]  meltdown the joblessness it's a distraction from Obama's falling approval ratings it's
[14:55.800 --> 14:59.600]  a distraction for all the other legislation happening around the big banks have gotten
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.480]  legislation through to actually shut down their competition now they're gobbling up
[15:03.480 --> 15:08.400]  banks everywhere or how how the U.S. is on the verge of losing its credit rating so I've
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.200]  got Steve Watson and Paul Watson in consultation with myself writing a big article coming out
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.560]  in the next hour and a half at prisonplanet.com and the headline hasn't been written yet but
[15:19.560 --> 15:29.680]  it will be something like the 10 things the 10 big things the BP oil spill is distracting
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.040]  the people from or the 10 things the BP oil spill is being used to distract the public
[15:34.040 --> 15:40.000]  from remember how right after 9-11 all sorts of tyrannical things got put in place while
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.520]  we weren't watching well I was watching many of you were watching with the general public
[15:43.520 --> 15:49.960]  wasn't this is a big deal now separately I want to take your calls not just on the 10
[15:49.960 --> 15:57.080]  or 15 or 20 what do you see this serving as a distraction from the fact that they're
[15:57.080 --> 16:01.320]  on the verge of passing legislation that expands on the enemy combatant act that already allows
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.920]  them to grab U.S. citizens and say take them away secretly into a torture dungeon they've
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.280]  actually got legislation that's passed the House in the Senate to allow open torture
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.760]  of citizens open secret arrest and only an act of Congress can find out even where you
[16:14.760 --> 16:23.320]  are I mean this is bonafide hardcore tyranny but not only are there all these distractions
[16:23.320 --> 16:28.360]  I mean I say 10 there's a lot more than 10 their whole agenda is being crammed rammed
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.840]  down right now oh yeah the Gulf all spells bad but what about trillions in taxes they
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.680]  want you to pay what about all the new taxes the feds are levying what about the fact that
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.520]  health care was political suicide for the elite but they don't care cuz they know they've
[16:44.520 --> 16:49.640]  got a war they're brewing and oil spill distractions what about the fact that the tarp was really
[16:49.640 --> 16:56.120]  a swindle to all of the criminal insiders that put Barry sitaro aka Barack Obama into
[16:56.120 --> 17:04.920]  power there everything is moving right now they're going for broke ahead of this election
[17:04.920 --> 17:14.920]  coming up they know in every election incumbents whether they're Republican or Democrat in
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.720]  all the off-year elections we've had this year and last year every incumbents been thrown
[17:19.720 --> 17:27.000]  out this is a total political realignment and the system knows it so yes the oil spill
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.480]  is dangerous the oil spill is serious it's economically destructive and it's more destructive
[17:32.480 --> 17:36.680]  you know there's a big ABC news headline last night and it's all over the news that the
[17:36.680 --> 17:41.160]  Coast Guard pulled up to private fishermen in their own boats scooping up the oil under
[17:41.160 --> 17:46.800]  the direction of local counties and taking it to oil tanks and the government pulled
[17:46.800 --> 17:51.240]  up the Coast Guard pulled up and said you've got to have special permits for your you've
[17:51.240 --> 17:56.200]  got to be Coast Guard registered to be out here that matter if you've got life preservers

[18:32.840 --> 18:37.040]  here to shake your grocery store down anything you see the mafia doing the last hundred
[18:37.040 --> 18:43.480]  years that's government it is a mafia government I was reading this morning I mean I already
[18:43.480 --> 18:49.960]  knew it but George Soros owns a large portion of the big state run because it's got all
[18:49.960 --> 18:55.360]  these private kingpins that are part of it but it's state run in Brazil Brazil's drilling
[18:55.360 --> 18:58.480]  all over the Gulf they had a big spill three years ago off the coast of Mexico much bigger
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.140]  than what you see now not in the news see George Soros who controls the Obama White
[19:04.140 --> 19:11.960]  House whose minions were the head of the transition team this is in all over the news today thank
[19:11.960 --> 19:17.940]  God it's actually being pointed out they control America so see if they can shut off America
[19:17.940 --> 19:24.000]  drilling well then Al Gore owns Occidental Petroleum based in South America he's able
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.600]  to drill George Soros owning big oil companies he's able to drill you understand that the
[19:31.600 --> 19:37.480]  Dutch are able to drill it's only America that can't have those jobs what's the same
[19:37.480 --> 19:42.840]  thing it's about the religion of worshiping government and licking boots and before you

[26:43.960 --> 26:53.440]  it could be less but uh... normally a gusher this size they're saying two billion gallons
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.000]  two billion gallons that could be drained into the gulf of mexico to then be sucked

[33:25.400 --> 33:32.680]  this new world order isn't in disguise they're right out in the open i got an email this
[33:32.680 --> 33:38.960]  morning we had a petroleum engineer call in and say that many other people have pointed
[33:38.960 --> 33:47.000]  this out that the webcam of the supposed gulf oil leak that it looks like the oil is slowly
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.920]  coming out it's not really blasting out of that bloody hole in the gulf that's causing
[33:51.920 --> 34:00.040]  so much death and destruction and economic turmoil and pain decimation of people's lives
[34:00.040 --> 34:06.760]  and livelihoods and absolutely it looks like it's slowly moving it looks like maybe a few
[34:06.760 --> 34:12.320]  hundred gallons are coming out every minute and engineers who have looked at it think
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.760]  have said that they think it looks pretty suspicious but he he asked me he said in an email dear
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.880]  alex yesterday i was on your radio program and we talked about the oil pressure that
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.760]  is not present in the oil well that is shown on british petroleum's website it appears
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.920]  that you cut me out of the program did you censor it i would sure like you to explain
[34:31.920 --> 34:37.520]  why the repeat programs do not have me on it and i am referring to the part of the program
[34:37.520 --> 34:45.600]  that lindsay when williams was on and that's from dave won't give us last name dave we
[34:45.600 --> 34:51.360]  only have four hours programmed in with radio ads and that are on the satellite that am
[34:51.360 --> 34:58.600]  in fm stations can pick up okay when i go into overdrive it is internet only and so
[34:58.600 --> 35:04.400]  when you're listening to the info wars dot com audio streams that are live from eleven
[35:04.400 --> 35:11.400]  a.m. to three p.m. central twelve noon to four p.m. eastern you are you are listening
[35:11.400 --> 35:17.600]  to what's sent out on the satellite and ted anderson at genesis communications has a star
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.560]  guide satellite leased he has one for the rest of his network and then he has one just
[35:23.560 --> 35:28.720]  for this broadcast because so many stations one and some stations can tape it and then
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.480]  re-air it but sometimes they're taping another program while they're taping this program
[35:33.480 --> 35:39.360]  and it causes a problem so ted about two years ago to the station request he puts my show
[35:39.360 --> 35:44.840]  up twenty four hours a day on star guide for stations to grab it at their leisure we have
[35:44.840 --> 35:51.320]  our own channel okay and so the internet feed you hear is the feed that we're sending to
[35:51.320 --> 35:57.400]  that satellite okay so that's why when the show ends every day you hear four hours of
[35:57.400 --> 36:05.440]  it concurrently played back to back until i'm live twenty hours later okay and so when
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.040]  i do do overdrive normally about once a month i've been doing a lot more lately because
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.240]  so much is happening i did over an hour of overdrive last week i did fifty plus minutes
[36:13.240 --> 36:20.200]  of overdrive yesterday you will not hear that when the show starts replaying when we end
[36:20.200 --> 36:26.480]  the overdrive you will hear the concurrent four hours because that's already still playing
[36:26.480 --> 36:29.960]  in the background for stations that want it that's what's going on over the satellite
[36:29.960 --> 36:36.440]  but it's not a conspiracy overdrive is only heard by the internet info wars dot com stream
[36:36.440 --> 36:42.760]  listeners and prison planet dot tv viewers it is then archived to the podcast we got
[36:42.760 --> 36:48.320]  another complaint this morning saying my podcast is usually this size today it's bigger why
[36:48.320 --> 36:55.880]  are you doing this well because it was fifty some minutes longer it's larger and i'm burning
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.320]  time on something that really doesn't matter and it not with day i'm sure he's a smart
[37:00.320 --> 37:04.680]  guy but this will now be a new conspiracy i've already seen the conspiracy that overdrive
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.480]  is censored or that overdrive is secret and that people will take things from overdrive
[37:09.480 --> 37:14.480]  and broadcast and say this was secretly behind the scenes with george umfrey or tax mars or
[37:14.480 --> 37:20.360]  someone or this is secret behind the scenes with ron paul now it's not secret stations
[37:20.360 --> 37:25.200]  and the satellites are not programmed to be able to it's all automated to be able to pick
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.200]  it up you notice there's no ads during overdrive maybe i'll just stop overdrive it's too confusing
[37:30.200 --> 37:37.080]  for people and okay admitted i'm evil i censored it all and i'm being sarcastic folks it's
[37:37.080 --> 37:44.360]  all up on the podcast you can go to info wars dot com up at the top it says home alex

[54:40.360 --> 54:48.120]  this is what normally happens and these guys write all these textbooks about how other elites have
[54:48.120 --> 54:53.320]  failed to kill everyone and cement their total global domination because they weren't ruthless
[54:53.320 --> 54:58.040]  enough and didn't exterminate all their enemies they weren't scientific about their tyranny
[54:58.040 --> 55:01.480]  but we're going to do it we're going to put fluoride in their water and dump them down

[55:23.720 --> 55:28.920]  world cup and oh isn't it great the united states just won but the referees stole one of their goals
[55:28.920 --> 55:34.600]  from them oh we're outraged this is so sickening hey folks that doesn't matter a hill of beans
[55:37.320 --> 55:43.160]  but again if i yelled and screamed about the u.s having one of their goals stolen in south africa
[55:43.160 --> 55:48.440]  it would be that's a good american right there boy he's mad about them damn people stealing one
[55:48.440 --> 55:55.400]  of our goals but i get up here and start yelling and screaming about total criminals taking over
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.000]  everything and it's like shut up all right i'm gonna settle down
[56:03.400 --> 56:09.880]  bp tells cleanup workers they'll be fired if they wear respirators and uh this is just all over
[56:09.880 --> 56:19.160]  the mainstream media washington post ovington post wired yahoo those are the sources of that
[56:19.720 --> 56:26.840]  article at prisonplanet.com i mean you can't even make this stuff up anymore it's just it's just
[56:26.840 --> 56:32.200]  it's just you can't even imagine whatever i found whatever you can imagine they're doing if you go
[56:32.200 --> 56:37.160]  randomly search engine it like it was about a month ago and i said i'll guarantee you they're mixing
[56:37.160 --> 56:42.760]  it with jet fuel because i've seen other patents about mixing aerosolized chemicals uh in with
[56:42.760 --> 56:48.920]  jet fuel at the source so it's compartmentalized for weather modification i'll bet there's a pentagon
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.880]  patent and program because that'd be the group they'd picked to carry it out i already knew they
[56:54.840 --> 57:00.040]  had done some studies 20 years ago or more about adding to jet fuel to manipulate weather
[57:00.040 --> 57:03.960]  and erin comes running and he goes oh my god it's army dot mill at state department it's all here
[57:03.960 --> 57:07.880]  they admit they're doing it here it is i mean this is what we're putting in my new chemtrail film
[57:07.880 --> 57:11.560]  you notice i'm not hiding that i know other people are making chemtrail films good stick it in your
[57:11.560 --> 57:18.200]  chemtrail film all i want to do is get the word out folks i mean the anything i can imagine
[57:19.160 --> 57:23.080]  that's based on understanding this enemy i can then go search it and there it is
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.760]  any evil you can imagine they've already done it what does the bible say they would
[57:28.760 --> 57:37.480]  would ran around continually inventing new evil inventing sins inventing blasphemies
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.920]  blasphemies against the creation blasphemies against the beauty of the world blasphemy
[57:42.920 --> 57:48.360]  i mean i look at my children innocent loving good full of life and i think about how innocent and
[57:48.360 --> 57:53.560]  decent and wholesome they are and i think about how ravenous and corrupt this world is and how
[57:53.560 --> 57:57.880]  they're selling corruption to us because they know once you're corrupt and once you're not
[57:57.880 --> 58:03.240]  virtuous that your mind becomes shuttered to other realities and your heart becomes
[58:03.240 --> 58:08.840]  hardened and you become spiritually blinded it's one thing to read that in the bible
[58:09.640 --> 58:15.880]  it's another thing to physically experience it and to see how those that have chosen evil
[58:15.880 --> 58:21.240]  make laugh make jokes about everything they giggle about evil they giggle about corruption
[58:21.240 --> 58:26.440]  they giggle when you warn them they giggle when you have heart they giggle when you have fight
[58:26.440 --> 58:32.760]  they giggle at everything strong everything good everything real well don't worry all you giggling
[58:32.760 --> 58:40.040]  unhappy soft scum you want to be enslaved and smashed into guts you will be by your owners

[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:37.320]  jones all right i tried my best to cover a bunch of the news and as usual i scratched the mere surface
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.560]  and i'll be interspersing news throughout this hour the next hour and then we have
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:48.520]  john colman former mi6 probably in the top two or three leading experts on the black
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.520]  nobility on the bill de berg group on the new world order global corporate state
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.240]  so much of the research that you see out there about the bill de berg group the new world order
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.640]  is basically dr john colman's information he'll be joining us and he's been in bad health often on
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.520]  so it's a it's a very great honor to have him with us in the last hour so we look forward to that
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.840]  we'll be going over some of his books the taba stock institute you name it and i want to reschedule
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.720]  him when he's on today again for a month or so from now it was must have been 10 years ago by last
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.600]  interviewing and then i he was in the hospital and sick and i couldn't interview him and then i
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.840]  called back and he was in bad health again this is like nine years ago and i kind of forgot about him
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.360]  kind of like you'll have a cousin who you grew up with and went hunting with and on fishing trips
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.680]  whether it was a great friend and you blink and 20 years past well same thing happened with uh
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.800]  same thing happened with john colman of course not a cousin i went fishing with but yeah you
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:50.520]  know the point i interviewed him many times 15 years ago 14 years ago 13 12 11 and then i've
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.720]  interviewed him in 10 years until two weeks ago and an hour wasn't enough so he's back today that's
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.000]  coming up but in the next two hours wide open phones and i appreciate you holding but please
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.320]  have your point ready and move forward i'll recap some of the main questions i'm throwing out there
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.120]  what are the things you think this oil spills distracting us from not taking from the severity
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.240]  of the oil spill it is being used as a media distraction and what do you think about the
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:23.720]  clear cover up of these deadly chemicals and the off gassing and reports all over the gulf
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.920]  from louisiana to the panhandle of florida people getting really sick and the kerosene smell
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.400]  everywhere and the media trying to cover that up let's talk to michael in california uh you're on
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:41.720]  the air welcome welcome uh thank you alex it's nice to talk to you since we haven't talked since
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:48.840]  february three quick points yes please have ted the engineer on i would love to get his uh take
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:55.800]  on what's happening down there uh number two i seem to agree with lindsay williams i think this was
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:03.640]  an accident but as ron emmanuel said don't ever let a disaster go to waste um and the distraction
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:11.160]  on this is that most people are forgetting that come the middle of july heart is going to begin
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:18.200]  creating plasma shields which is ronald ragan's uh defense mechanism that that they're putting
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:25.480]  into effect and by the way that's admitted that they could ignite the atmosphere uh with harp
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:32.040]  i've had the director of harp on uh four years ago and he admitted that so they have a lot of
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.240]  things beyond that's what you're talking about but but how do you say they're igniting the plasma
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:46.600]  shield uh in in july i mean how do you know that uh because of people that i know that are up in that
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:52.600]  area and that are associated with harp um that's all highly classified but i don't know how you
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:59.160]  know that but go ahead the the problem is is that their scientists themselves when they were asked
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:05.320]  have you ever done this before they say no we haven't and when asked well what would happen
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:12.680]  if a rogue plasma reaction begins they could ignite the atmosphere exactly can you stop it
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:19.400]  and they go we don't know how to you know that's an incredibly important point you just brought
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:24.600]  up and i appreciate your call let me briefly comment on that there is an obsession by the elite
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.000]  oppenheimer and others with playing god and the majority of manhattan project scientists making
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.080]  the a bomb thought that it would probably ignite the atmosphere and burn off the atmosphere of the
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:40.360]  earth but they still did it they love playing god many scientists at cern believe that there is a
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:46.280]  chance it could uh cause a strangelet a black hole the singularity and destroy much of the planet
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:52.120]  or the entire planet but they're still going ahead with it uh they're genetic engineering cross
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.960]  species all of this uh and they still continue to play god they're now playing around with any
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:05.400]  matter weapons the question is where should the american people draw their line in the sand
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:11.320]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:16.440]  protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.800]  dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children our education our
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:28.840]  money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:33.800]  during the patriot uprising you have been warned we have the facts we have the constitution we have
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:38.680]  the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and i'm so excited
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.640]  to be able to offer you don't tread on me rise the republic tyranny is upon us but liberty
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.760]  and the sleeping giant that is the american people is rising a new tool in the info war don't tread

[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:11.240]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:21.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.200]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.640]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:37.000]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a

[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.560]  okay wide open phones on this friday edition anything you want to talk about
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.880]  at the bottom of the hour i will engage in about a five minute news splits and i'll do that
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.840]  at the bottom of the next hour because there's so much to cover but most of listeners want to
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:28.840]  discuss the oil spill i'm throwing out just this point the oil spill is decimating the coast
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.160]  there is a cover up about people having trouble breathing and all the chemicals and gases that
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:44.440]  are coming out of the oil it is confirmed by roiders ap wired magazine prison planet dot com
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:51.160]  you name it that bp is running around telling their poor employees their contractors many of
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:57.240]  them getting minimum wage we're talking six dollars an hour that they can't wear gas mask or even a
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:02.360]  paper mask because then they have to admit that there's liability and that people are getting sick
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.120]  it's just like 9 11 or thousands of emergency workers got deadly ill many of them have died
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:14.680]  uh the universities and medical centers have done the scans of the lungs they're filled
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:21.400]  with concrete mercury asbestos and they do not get the treatment and the media you've seen the
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.600]  headline says their ambulance chasing scum so if you go out there and work for the next six months
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:32.760]  cleaning up the toxic oil and you get sick you will be thrown in the ditch and of the 20 billion
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:38.040]  they're getting from bp remember it'll all go to martha's veneered it'll all go to george soros
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:43.160]  you're not going to get a stinking red nickel you're going to pay for it and obama has announced
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.880]  they are going to ram through the carbon tax isn't it funny he was going to allow gulf oil drilling
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.440]  then the top globalist oil company caught being the ones bullying exxon mobile and others
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.480]  into going along with carbon taxes two years ago the top globalist company they just so
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.600]  happened to have this big spill and it now turns out not for two weeks but for over a month it's
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:13.160]  confirmed that they were telling their drillers on the deep water horizon to carry out the drilling
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:18.920]  in a way that never before been done and it's on record that all the three contractor groups
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.000]  including halliburton and i hate to defend them but it's the truth of the truth that this is going
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.640]  to effing blow up that's one of the quotes uh in the atlantic monthly and there's a bunch of other
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.440]  publications you've seen it on the news you know it's coming out but but but but but it's the background
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:39.960]  story uh that they said this is going to blow up this is not going to work and for a month first
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.200]  it was two weeks now it's a month they knew there were cracks and fissures and that it had failed
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.840]  did they try to emergency block it did they start dumping more real concrete and they said no
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:55.480]  pressure rise it with seawater dump seawater down the hole and hope that its pressure holds the
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:00.440]  oil and gas in when of course they hit oil and gas at many levels they're going for the big payday
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:06.840]  down there deep at 30 000 feet all right i'm already ranting about this so uh there's no
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:14.040]  doubt it's an inside job there is no doubt 100 percent that they knew it was going to blow up
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.680]  and so many false flags are like that they give orders governments the military
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.440]  corporations they give orders that they know are going to have an outcome then they have plausible
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:33.240]  deniability well we you know okay all the engineers said it was going to blow up 100 percent that they
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.080]  bare minimum knew this was going to happen and then they blocked the recovery effort so the
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:42.440]  estuaries got ruined for at least the next four or five years with oil and so they could have lots
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:49.400]  of dead turtles and and and although a dead sperm whale floating around yes there are whales in the
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.280]  gulf every time i say there's sperm whales out there i get i get calls saying or not i guess because
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.000]  you watch movie dick and that was in the atlantic you know with uh you know the old movie moby dick
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.440]  with gregory peck folks i've seen sperm whales in the gulf okay okay all right i'm going to stop
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:14.040]  ranting about that um let's go ahead and go to your calls let's talk to who's up next here john

[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:27.480]  call this is danie from we are changing new york city as far as the oil distraction i think that
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:34.840]  it's distracting from a host of issues including iran and israel that situation with iran sending
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.520]  an armed flotella over there and the possible of starting off world war three i think the economy
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.520]  is going to be uh it this is going to be a big excuse for them to raise oil prices and gas prices
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:52.360]  which will continue to tax basically everything uh and put a greatest strain on the economy you
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.960]  know like gerald fontes says it's bread and circus and i just wanted to really thank you

[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:38.440]  and good luck let's talk to jonathan in kansas you're on the air hey alex um i have three
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:47.400]  key videos for you one one is about police corruption in new orleans and before i go into that
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:56.840]  if people don't believe alex jones when he says there's this uh segment of uh police that are on
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:04.840]  steroids well look up uh world-class bodybuilder ronnie colman he was a police officer from several
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:13.800]  years and he won uh i believe i don't know what's the title of it mr olympia and he was a police
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:22.120]  officer and he admitted to using um what do you call it uh performance enhancing drugs and he was
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:30.360]  never tested for okay but i mean sir i mean a month ago the police chief in one of the biggest
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:37.320]  cities in texas fort worth came out and gave a speech and said injecting testosterone is good
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.120]  and they've done national studies on average more than a third some police forces more than half
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:51.240]  i've seen police women who have male features giant biceps clearly on roids you know they have the
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:58.360]  fatty uh what do they call it buffalo hump on their back i mean i played football in high school
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:04.360]  and i knew the guys who were 14 15 years old who could bench press 400 pounds and had hair all over
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.440]  their chest and no matter how hard i worked out i couldn't get as strong as they were until i got
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.320]  older you're you're meant to get you know gross slower and you know by the time i was 20 and i
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.080]  could still bench press a lot they couldn't and they were all shriveled up and you know couldn't
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.960]  even you know have kids uh because i know some of the guys that did steroids and their lives are
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.920]  ruined i know one guy who took roids in college he's already had a heart attack at 35 years old
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.160]  and yes a large portion of the cops are on anabolic steroids whacked completely out of their
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:39.800]  brains uh and now the police openly uh are giving them uh amphetamine pills and steroids
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:45.400]  just like the troops and so it's just terrible and and you've got police on total roid rages
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.160]  and they'll beat your wife to death they'll beat your son or daughter to death uh they'll do whatever
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.560]  they want and or beat them half to death and then they'll charge you with assaulting them
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:59.320]  and laugh about it they have been turned into uh just the army of satan and that doesn't mean
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.960]  all police are but the feds want to forge them into this weapon and i don't know how many videos
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:10.680]  i've seen of police beating somebody for no reason and then charging them with assault i mean you know
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:17.320]  this we have a lot of steroid head criminals who are becoming police because they want to
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.880]  bust some heads and they're completely out of their minds go ahead yeah okay i have three videos for
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:31.080]  you um might need a pen and paper one is about police corruption in new orleans if you type in
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:39.640]  um let's see culture of police corruption the first video and it talks about how new orleans
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:47.400]  is so tainted it's like two of your texas all right that's one another video is whistleblower
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:54.840]  fired for reporting 200 that's all you have to put in whistleblower fired for reporting 200
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:03.800]  he was reporting 200 missing bodies from um i think military grave you know that they missed the
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.880]  government just missed place 200 bodies remains from wars and whatnot they don't care and he got
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.680]  fired for telling the truth about what they're doing is they're selling the body parts and i
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:23.480]  appreciate your call i remember over a decade ago getting reports that u.s forces in columbia
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.440]  were capturing people and then taking them to contractors that has sanguated their blood
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:37.320]  stripped their skin sold their kidneys their lungs uh their livers and on average we're getting about
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:44.680]  400 000 for it and then the rumors came out about israel running some of the torture camps
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:51.000]  in iraq abu graib among them and families would then be given their their family members body
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:57.560]  when they'd have an incision from the neck all the way down to their genitals and all their organs
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.520]  were scooped out in some cases the blood was even removed because they like to deliver the same blood
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:09.080]  type with the organ and it was a rumor uh but now israel had to admit what late last year that okay
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:16.520]  we are selling palestinians organs we get them we kill them we take the goods i mean that's like
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.320]  china 15 years ago would deny it now china does full page brochures the government does
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:29.800]  uh advertising that they quote have fresh organs and americans europeans uh you name it they fly
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:35.080]  into china they fly into japan because it's just a short plane flight from china to there
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.640]  they have a 24 mobile execution vans per major city this is times of london the chinese show it
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.040]  and it shows them taking a young woman out who they say was caught stealing their choking herb
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:53.400]  her face is purple they leader to the van and they cut her organs out on the way to the airport
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:19:00.040]  put them on ice and fly them into japan where americans line up for the goods and so again our
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:07.400]  government uh murder operations they're taking our troops organs again my father is a dentist but
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:13.800]  he also does oral surgery and when i was a kid he was always having to get up at 2 3 in the morning
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:22.040]  he'd get called into dallas or mesquite to do uh rewiring of jaws people whose jaws were shattered
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.880]  because they couldn't wait to the next day for some reason that he'd have to do an emergency
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:36.200]  wiring i guess for further surgery uh so he worked in hospitals and uh i was 15 and i was going to
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.560]  do my driver's ed and he said son don't sign the organ donor card and i said why and he said well
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:45.000]  the word in dallas is if you come in hurt they'll go ahead and won't give you aid and let you die to
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.560]  get your organs and then i thought my dad was crazy but i said no you know don't put me on the organ
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:54.600]  donor card and then it came out on 60 minutes that chicago dallas and other places take your eyes
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:59.080]  your retinas your levers and they do cap you of course for the goods to murder squads running everything

[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:23.080]  by the way israel two years ago demonized european press
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:30.280]  and so they were liars about kidnapping people and selling their organs and then it came out
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:37.880]  in ap and reuters israel said okay we do do this and the us does it and the chinese do it
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:45.000]  and you are seen as an animal by the new world order they don't just see human life as cheap
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.000]  as say the romans did 2000 years ago you are seen as expendable you are seen as garbage
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:58.360]  you are seen as having negative value and once you understand that you understand everything
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.920]  all right let's continue with your phone calls but if you think i'm joking just go do an internet
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:09.960]  search on israel admits to harvesting organs of detainees or china has mobile execution vans or
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.480]  60 minutes hospitals caught killing for organs and here's another issue you know
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.160]  that those private organ companies that lobby they pay off the hospitals they make 200 300
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:28.200]  400 500 000 dollars off those organs and then the family gets nothing it's like well the family
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.000]  shouldn't well why do these companies get all that money you know why did steve jobs get organs
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.440]  and get around the wedding list it's all a big scam folks okay crooks run things and we become a
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.160]  bunch of schmucks it's time to be more widely it's time to realize how much trouble we're in
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.880]  brian and montreal you're on the air hi elix i'm calling to disagree with things that lindsay
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.720]  williams has told you the first thing i wanted to disagree with him is most importantly that this
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.200]  is just an error and this is just a mistake and that nobody knew it was going to go on told him
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.520]  i disagree with him on that i mean he has he doesn't have evidence of that he's just giving us his
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:12.600]  opinion uh but i agree with you this my gut told me day one but i didn't say it for two weeks
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.760]  that this was an inside job and i said they're going to use it for carbon tax and now we know
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.640]  they gave orders that they knew would cause it to blow up period they're guilty arrest them
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:29.320]  yes well i have a pdf from 2005 it's called the outer continental shelf estimate oil and
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:37.640]  gas results reserve gulf of mexico from december 31st 2005 and just in that one now i've got the
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.400]  report it's a 600 square mile area right off louisiana where they drilled right in the middle
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.400]  it's got more than saudi arabia and alaska combined and they know it's they want to shut
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.760]  that off go ahead exactly there's that fact too and then the other aspect that i'd like to address
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.280]  is that lindsay says that these people are the elitists the uh supposed new world order
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:02.760]  we all know that their god is lucifer they go to worshipers of lucifer they go to uh
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.840]  psychics clairvoyance this is the who they are asking they ask demons for their advice
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.400]  and this was the advice that they were given so it's a complete fallacy in a life to say that
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.040]  these people don't know what they're doing they know exactly what they're doing and one supposedly
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:25.160]  foul accident they have covered carbon tax codex alimentarius depopulation martial law
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.840]  implementation the list goes on and on this is no accident and it's a nice distraction from the
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:37.080]  nuke subs and us forces and and bunker busters and a ago garcia an open talk of our government
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:44.040]  with israel striking iran israel say they're going to run the israeli blockade uh the un set to vote
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.600]  as well as the congress on a blockade of iran which is an act of war meanwhile
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.400]  meanwhile you've got the masons of the united states when they're asked who they pray to this
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:28:00.920]  is what they say lucifer what is your problem just that sir okay i'm a christian sir i'm pure
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.120]  and virtuous and wholesome and innocent how can you say anything to buy it about me sir you need
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:11.320]  to be born again i am born again now did you just say that you were lucifer i am lucifer

[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:37.320]  it says a sperm whale uh floating off the coast believed to have died via marine biologist analysis
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:45.720]  by oil they're concerned that oil caused its death too bad for the toothed whale
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:56.040]  continuing with the economy green span says us may soon reach borrowing limit green span says
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:04.440]  us may soon reach borrowing limit which is the goal imagine your private banks that make money
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.880]  up out of that nothing you've created hundreds and hundreds of trillions of fake fiat derivatives
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:17.400]  that you've now leveraged it to 1.5 thousand quadrillion 1,500 trillion you heard me right
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.800]  that's a conservative year old estimate by tarply some economists we have on say 500 trillion
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:27.160]  once you're talking it's like did you know did the cops shoot the guy 50 times or 5,000 at a
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:34.040]  certain point it doesn't matter and again uh it's like the un saying oh my gosh uh there's
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.920]  going to be 40 increase in food prices and tens of millions more will starve the death each year
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.240]  you have 15 million conservatively some numbers say 25 million starve death a year and the un's out
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.560]  oh this is terrible we've got to have a global tax to fix this meanwhile the un and its own
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:54.360]  memorandums via the state department 200 said department random 200 states on record that
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.720]  their job is to create war famine death and destruction and to put gmo in to take control
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.680]  of these people in latin america africa and asia and that their job is to cause people to starve
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.680]  to death and to have wars and to kill each other and sterilize them through vaccines that's all
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:15.000]  stated but meanwhile oh they're so concerned we've got a carbon tax that'll help the africans
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.760]  you're not a racist are you i'm a liberal like margaret sangra who wrote private letters about
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.480]  killing subhuman blacks and how much she hated them but how she had to pose as their friend and
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:29.480]  how much she hated it but that she would do it because she got to kill them there and it's so
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:37.080]  good oh yes but see but see that's how it works the nice little liberals who support all the wars
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.520]  owned by general electric the bomb makers christ matthews teaches you about race all day and
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.680]  how he's going to take good care of you and how you got to have open borders and north american
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.320]  union to bankrupt everything are you a racist meanwhile he never talks about the un caught
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:56.280]  all over the world adding hormones to tetanus to sterilize people and he knows all about it
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:02.520]  guaranteed because it's their stinking religion of these rats reality is so much horrific that
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.760]  when people can admit there's all the beauty in the world as well that's why we're exposing the
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:13.160]  evil because it's attempting to overthrow the beauty but greenspan who was there in 99 when
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.480]  they changed the glass steel act who helped engineer all this and then he told us about a
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:23.080]  rational exuberance five years ago getting us ready for this so he could now explain to us how
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.120]  he's going to take good care of us you know he's a sellout he's literally a darth vader if you want
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:34.360]  to use the star wars universe analogy he was anakin skywalker of finance writing books exposing the
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:41.880]  bankers the federal reserve the new world order fractional reserve banking proto derivatives
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:49.960]  counterfeiting schemes hanging out with ron paul hanging out with eindran hanging out with
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:58.840]  some of the top libertarian people harry brown and then he sold out in about 1979
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:05.080]  and then went to the bohemian grove and trial lateral commission and knelt to sauron and the
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:11.000]  rest is history so he knows full well full well this is somebody who was on the same path as
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.360]  and he wrote multiple books you can go get him you can go read them they republish his essay in
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:25.000]  capitalism the unrealized dream i remember reading that in high school allen greenspan
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:35.640]  and oh he knelt to the emperor rise lord greenspan you have done well lord greenspan
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:43.000]  now you must butcher the u.s economy only by destroying it will you be powerful in the dark side
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.400]  former u.s federal reserve chairman allen greenspan testified at a hearing of the financial crisis
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:59.240]  inquiry commission in washington he has the center of the cancer that's been testisized
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.760]  out and sending tentacles down to the smallest hamlets now former federal reserve chairman
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:10.680]  allen greenspan said the u.s may soon face higher borrowing costs on its swelling debt
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:16.120]  and called for a tectonic shift in fiscal policy to contain to contain borrowing
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.840]  yeah we don't need all that chicken feed to get you in on the government trough
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:27.560]  or the government uh mammary system no no that's not needed now now we must raise your taxes is
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.360]  all the heads of the central banks e u central bank federal reserve we've seen bernacky calling
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:39.480]  for carbon taxes vat financial vat valker calling for albama republicans calling for it
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:45.880]  john mccain calling for it all these new taxes as they announce all the states are all going
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:55.320]  bankrupt i'm afraid oh i'm afraid your states won't survive oh and my federalized your police
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:01.160]  they'll be following our orders now i'm afraid that the police will follow any orders for their
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:06.760]  paychecks and by cutting essential services we scare the government minions into believing
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:13.160]  their jobs are in danger and then they'll go out and rob you at gunpoint we'll be sitting offshore
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.800]  or while our forces reduce you down to vassal serves
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.320]  look at the slaves cleaning up the oil where we allow them to they're not allowed to wear
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.920]  breathing apparatus that would scare the other slaves and we might have to actually
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:37.240]  give them gas mask when when when it's so useful we're even causing some of the slaves to become
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.360]  ill that will further bankrupt the local emergency centers and more federalization
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:47.240]  the more we wreck the more we destroy the better everything gets
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.640]  though it's so easy destroying and creating order out of the chaos
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:00.280]  you ever watched a cfr meeting that's basically how they talk even if they're from america they
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.600]  have this affected atlantic accent of course at the turn of the 20th century even
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:12.280]  turn of the 19th century into the 20th uh it was a very trendy in new york and canadica to
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:22.200]  to to affect a british accent continuing here former federal reserve chairman allen greenspan
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:29.880]  so the us may soon face higher borrowing cost on its swelling debt and called for a tectonic shift
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:35.800]  in fiscal policy to contain borrowing everything must go to them preparations of a large u.s barring
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:42.040]  capacity armist leading perceptions he said and current long-term bond yields are masking america's
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.200]  debt challenge greenspan wrote an opinion piece posted in the wall street journal website long
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:52.520]  term rate increases can emerge with unexpected suddenness such as the 4 point surge over four
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:59.640]  months in 79 1980 he said he went on to talk about how we've got a cut uh spending on
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:08.200]  local chicken feed increased taxes to engorge the bankers continuing gold etf's rise to new all-time
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:15.160]  highs yes and gold is now broken in europe it's all-time high of just a week ago and it's all
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.720]  time high of a few months ago it's now broken here in the united states breaking one thousand
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:25.080]  two hundred and sixty dollars i think it may have changed in the last hour since i looked let's
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:35.160]  go look up spot gold of course the gold's trading for way way way way over
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:40.680]  what they say it's trading for
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:46.520]  it says uh that it's at one thousand two hundred and fifty seven
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.320]  twelve dollars forty cents today so it's dropped a bit as the bankers try to drive it down

[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:08.200]  wear respirators because that would alert the public to something happening just like it's
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.840]  old firefighters and police the first few days of 9-11 don't wear a mask then later said there was
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:19.640]  no problem you don't get any money uh this is damage control the bp ceo hayward has been relieved
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:25.000]  of management duties we're going to be covering that but but also what is this distracting us from
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:30.040]  iran says they're going to run the israeli blockade into gaza that's confirmed israel says they've
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:37.160]  got nuke subs off the coast of iran the us and the u n on the verge of passing sanctions to stop
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:43.640]  all ships in the different waterways straight away mus uh and the persian gulf and other areas
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.840]  going in and out of iran an act of war they say the iranians say they're going to start seizing us
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:55.400]  ships they're going to start uh grabbing other ships this is going to escalate quickly so while
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.880]  the media is openly admitting that war could be imminent with iran that's a back burner
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:04.360]  the that's back on the newspaper even though the war is going to the front burner
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:10.040]  so what else is this oil spill distracting us from and of course now it's coming out to the
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:17.160]  coast guard for five weeks straight won't let anybody uh go in and and and even drain oil
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:23.400]  out of estuaries because the federal government is god it's like a trina for five plus days no
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:29.640]  food no water stacked up in front of the sports dome on the news for three days people saying can i
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:35.080]  have food and water and troops saying no it was a laboratory experiment to see what would happen
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:41.080]  they wouldn't let people walk out on the highway that was high and dry police were ordered to
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:46.360]  shoot people they were those cops were thrown in prison um that's like the white house ordering
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:50.600]  torture and then a whole bunch of people going to prison who did torture and then bush comes out
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.240]  two weeks ago and says i did order torture i'd order it again and he doesn't get in trouble
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.640]  but then they send people that followed his orders to prison like the cops were ordered
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:04.840]  use lethal force threat continuum do not let people walk out on these highways the fed say
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:11.000]  the cops mow a bunch of people down and were finally sent to prison last year for it and
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.560]  they deserve to go to prison you don't follow an illegal order i mean if the government told
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:20.360]  you to run around and kill uh you know little kids uh would you do it i mean if the government
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:28.760]  joseph mingola had a german military attachment to his uh medical facility and sometimes he wrote
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:34.920]  in his diary he would give little kids chocolate ride out in his mercedes with them and have troops
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:40.040]  then shoot them in the head just for enjoyment in the morning i said i think i with my coffee i'll
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:45.960]  kill some children that's what i'm into uh you know should those german shoulders get in trouble
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:51.240]  for shooting the kids in the head yes it's the same thing here i don't want to hear bobby gendall
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:55.640]  complaining that the feds won't let him clean it up go out there and have a you know go out there
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:01.320]  and saying as the governor we're going to clean this up on our seashore if this is state property
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:07.080]  right here coast guard get out of here or have the states have a convention or or or have the
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:14.200]  states speak up and say no i mean look that's what the tenth amendment's all about the federal
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:19.320]  government's out of control it's telling us who we can hire who we can fire what we can do
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:24.120]  how big our house can be how small it can be when we can build a barn when we can tear a barn down
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:29.320]  when we can plant crops when we can't how many chickens we can have everything it is not the
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:34.040]  government's job much less a remote federal government bought and paid for by foreign

[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:46.840]  to you it's a pleasure to be part of the little people and yeah we're down here in our catastrophic
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:51.720]  all spill land but uh... i had a couple of things to say i totally agree that looks like they're
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:56.680]  setting up some kind of scenario like that i had on nine eleven with the uh... breathing issues
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:01.560]  around uh... ground zero uh... you know everybody should be wearing a respirator down here on these
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:07.960]  beaches are cleaning this up uh... you know i wouldn't worry about the pr aspect of it in the media
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:12.920]  because uh... i want to ask these people what's more important your life or uh... you know play in
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:19.880]  the pr no but but but bp saying you will be fired if you do it because for five weeks they've had
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:24.360]  people cleaning stuff up without them people are getting sick so they go so they can't go back and
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:29.880]  say they were wrong they have to say no you are fired if you were breathing apparatus which makes
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.480]  them more liable doesn't it uh... yeah well i mean but the thing of it is when when you're
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:41.160]  offshore i'm i'm a offshore hand okay i uh... worked drilling rigs i was uh... you know rough
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:46.040]  neck i worked there it's a drilled and also into the production of it what these people should be
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.120]  asking when whenever you got to clean out a separator offshore and you have to enter this
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:55.080]  vessel you gotta dress up in biohazard gear you gotta sniff it out get all the gas out of it to
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:59.320]  clean the sand and everything out and you have to wear a respirator for that you don't even have
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.360]  active oil in there but my brothers and my cousins are out working this still right now and they're
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:09.480]  telling me it's as thick as peanut butter on top of the water and so you have you know like you said
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:14.840]  the chemicals benzene it could be h2s could be a number of things and you do not want to breathe
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:20.200]  this stuff because uh... i mean uh... yeah they could be threatening the fire people but i tell
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:25.240]  you what if i'd be down there on that beach they threaten to fire me because i i want to wear a
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:30.520]  respirator believe me i'd be contacting a lawyer and there'd be some lawsuits coming well wired
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:35.800]  magazine ap roiders and others are reporting bp is ordering uh... mainly the minimum wage poor
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.600]  people that are out there on the beach scooping up the oil soak seaweed because it is the sargasso
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:46.120]  season and uh... and i look at them on the news they're not wearing respirators in most of the
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:53.560]  videos i see they're not even wearing a mask uh... you know to to to stop any of it but i guess a
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:58.360]  paper mask wouldn't stop the gas to begin with and there's also all these heavy metals uh...
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:03.400]  that are in oil i mean what is it about these companies that it's just they don't care how
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:09.480]  evil they look they don't care how corrupt they are you're right and from my experience in all
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.520]  field i really believe this was a staged event i mean for the simple fact uh... they was on top
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:19.880]  one of the biggest fines in the gulf of mexico in years and then they're going to use substandard
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:25.400]  casing substandard equipment to uh... you know to produce this well i mean it just don't make
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:29.720]  sense they would have made all this money back why save money on the well when they'd made all this
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.040]  money back once the well would have started flowing say a month in or a month and a half they would
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:40.200]  have made all their rig cost back all the all the manpower labor back and all the equipment
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:45.640]  that they put down hold to produce this well so to me it makes no sense you know well you know
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:49.560]  i've i've been attending to do a special video report i've done the research for it in the last
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.960]  week but haven't produced it yet uh... fifteen twenty minutes special report right just go over
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:13:01.480]  all the evidence in one spot but it's the quotes of how a burden of the other two companies running
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:08.520]  the rig and concert going back a month before and then two weeks before arguments beginning and saying
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:13.720]  this is this is on record before it happened and this is now been in the coast guard hearings
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.280]  that we told him it was going to blow up that this had never been done before i don't understand the
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:23.560]  fracking and cement and the mud but they're supposed to pump this down to secure the shaft
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:28.200]  in fact maybe you should explain it to me and that they said no we're gonna dump seawater in
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:35.880]  to to to hold the pressure down before we complete the well and that uh... again major
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:43.800]  newspapers roiders atlantic monthly have the quotes uh... from the coast guard hearings and i can't
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:49.320]  read this on air because of family reasons uh... but you know the quotes are i read some of the
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:58.760]  last week minus the f bombs and s bombs but the the oil rig uh... head and these ships that were
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:05.880]  there so so the head of the ships and that contingent the supply ships and the head of the rig
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.680]  were on the phone to bp in front of all these witnesses saying you fools
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:17.960]  i told you this would blow up it was a hundred percent there was no way to stop this we told you
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:23.640]  and so clearly bp just told their employees it'd be like if the government wanted to ban fireworks
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.040]  and so they went to the biggest fireworks factory in the u s and said one of their employees i want
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:33.000]  you to go in there with a flamethrower and start shooting at all the fireworks and the guys follow
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.440]  the orders and walked in with a flamethrower and did it and then now obama says ban fireworks
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:45.080]  factories i mean that's basically what they've done anyway you cut it they did this on purpose
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:52.440]  and and as i said fifty plus days ago they're on record randy saying that they want a carbon
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:58.040]  tax and that they want to bring in all their new green taxes and federalize and nationalize the
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:05.000]  oil companies it's now happening and bp is teamed up with them to do this so they'll get preferential
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.960]  monopoly treatment they've always been again identified bp is key globalist years ago i'm
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:15.800]  not just saying this now they are the key globalist company financing this global green takeover
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.920]  and notice it's them doing it and now obama at the end of this is going to end up basically
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:26.520]  nationalizing the oil companies go ahead yeah wasn't that convenient how that worked out for
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:31.400]  well a couple of a couple of points i want to make my all field sources and i'm i got people in
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:35.240]  all field family i'm talking about company men i'm talking about tool pushes i'm talking about
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.960]  managers of all field companies they're telling me the deep water rigs i'm talking about you
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:43.880]  drill ships you send me submersibles they're hitting out the gulf they're going to brazil
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:48.680]  they're going to africa they're seeking other jobs but one of the things i'm hearing is they're
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:53.240]  going to open up drilling they're going to open up drilling off the california coast now so some
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:58.760]  of these rigs are going to go to california because the california economy is touching the toilet
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:07.400]  so that's all been separately confirmed they open uh well i just had a breakup are we still
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:14.200]  on the air john okay good we may have a caller are you still there yes sir okay good uh they
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:18.440]  are confirming drilling off the coast of california they are confirming that the russians
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:33.320]  go ahead yeah we broke up there in an hour can you hear me
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:58.360]  i know i want that
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:07.160]  down you can stand me up like the gates of hell but i won't back down
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:21.240]  no i'll stand my ground won't be turned around and i'll keep this world from dragging me down
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:30.920]  i'm gonna stand my ground and i won't be turned around again the miracle of technology the main
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:35.800]  networks of minnesota we're in austin we're going out on am fm tv shortwave satellite
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:41.240]  everything else we have a few glitches there uh randy uh finish up your point yeah i'm still
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:46.040]  with you alex uh yeah the point is uh it looks like they're going to be reversed in the louisiana
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:49.880]  economy now they're going to be taking a lot of our deep sea drilling now and they're going to be
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:55.160]  putting it off the coast of california so that's going to put louisiana people out of work but um
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:59.640]  again we was talking about you know the well coming in and everything and how everything was real
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:05.720]  you know weird how it came in and then that's true and uh i'm sure the drilling contractor uh you
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:10.600]  said the the the guys on the rig was just you know raising cane about are you happy the well
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.320]  came in all these guys are trained in well control when you know these drilling contractors they
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:19.080]  take their personnel they train them in well control they show them how to control the well
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.360]  you know every aspect of drilling a well and these guys i've seen i've seen little oil wells being
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:29.640]  drilled in east texas and there's engineers and trucks and hundreds of people running around
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:35.720]  and so i mean there's engineers on site for small gas wells when the thing that is alex they knew
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.200]  this well was taking a kick because some of the tests they did they had indications they was
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:45.080]  getting gas back well if they had pipe in the hole what you want to do is you want to circulate
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:50.520]  some heavier mud down that hole vent that gas off but you contain you keep control of the well
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:55.640]  and from what it looks like to me they was trying to cement this well whether they was doing a
[02:18:55.640 --> 02:19:01.960]  squeeze job they was either squeezing some casing but anyway they was trying to uh put cement into
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:07.880]  a contaminated situation uh cement don't harden and it don't do his job whenever it's contaminated
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:14.520]  with gas and oil so evidently and whatever idiot decided to displace the drilling mud
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:19.640]  out the riser and just go ahead and try it to get off the well or whatever they was trying to do
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:26.280]  he let the well come in i mean you he was probably replacing uh 16 or 20 pound drill mud now what i'm
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:32.680]  talking about is a gallon of drill mud weighing about 16 to 20 pounds replacement with seawater
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:37.560]  that probably weighs about nine well guess what i was going to say no this is in the coast guard
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:45.720]  testimony that they said if you dump water in it is going to explode and cause a fire the well
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:51.560]  is going to come in and bp from houston they won't say who's who it was said you will dump water in
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:56.440]  now stay there briefly randy we're going to read a robert sam ronnie but this is important no i have
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:02.600]  the coast guard testimony anybody can go read it this is what the court found global meltdowns

[02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:26.200]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose

[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:25.320]  were making yes the coast guard hearing with the witnesses find that the entire rig was very angry
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:31.320]  for a month two weeks before they knew there were cracks they knew there were problems and that they
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:37.720]  were on record saying it's guaranteed you're gonna have this welcome in and you're gonna have a fire
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:42.680]  and then once it happened they saw all the different leaders of the three companies
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:48.840]  on their satellite phones saying are you happy you've now done it uh so bottom line
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:55.080]  bp should be criminally negligent for doing this and the question is why why does the media
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:59.880]  continue and why do the police continue what does the coast guard continue to say bp is in charge go
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:06.440]  ahead i don't i don't get it alex i and this is a plea to my governor you know governor jindal
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:11.320]  please step up to the plate and get involved with this and don't let the feds control this
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:16.520]  don't let bp control this i mean you're talking about our livelihood you know our coasts i mean
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:21.480]  this devastates us in every way i mean you got so many people across louisiana love to go red fish
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:26.440]  and speckled trout fish and you got shrimpers out here that they're livelihood you know depends on
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:31.400]  i mean that bp exact i heard one of them said that there's other parts of the world that uh he can
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:36.920]  get shrimp well well you know that bp exact that said that yeah he still has a paycheck and everything
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:43.240]  but our louisiana shrimpers are just trying to get by from a week to week month to month well my
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:49.320]  question is what is jindal doing in louisiana other than complaining what is hailey barber doing
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.600]  in mississippi yeah they complain they've got the authority under the ninth and tenth amendment to
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:00.120]  protect themselves just like arizona does from open borders and crime they've got a right to go
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:05.960]  out there and stop that oil what business does the federal government have having armed coast guard
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:12.440]  who are meant to protect us from foreign powers telling us we can't protect our industries that's
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.840]  exactly right and uh governor jindal got to remember that's the whole reason he was elected
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:22.120]  in this last election because he wasn't supposed to uh follow the status quo that he was going to do
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:27.240]  things different for louisiana you know cut the corruption different things like that he ran on that
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:32.360]  type of platform and they need to step up to the plate and uh just start taking charge because
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.440]  they could have contained this thing from the beginning yeah i'll guarantee you if the governor
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:43.160]  went out there with ships and told the coast guard to back off obama would back off there's no way
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:47.720]  he could win that pr fight but they won't do it because it's all inside baseball but going back
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:52.920]  to this coast guard reports for now for two weeks now uh where they talk about dumping water in
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:57.720]  briefly because i want i need to get to other calls and i appreciate your time briefly uh what
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:04.200]  what what is concrete used for versus mud versus seawater and and why were they so mad on the rig
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:08.600]  when they said we're going to use seawater i mean the court hearing says that that wouldn't
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:13.320]  hold the pressure down and then it would explode but i mean elaborate on that well it sounds like
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:20.040]  uh the bp of whatever the engineers want to put seawater into the uh well into the well bore
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:25.560]  before they had total control of the well um evidently they would i don't know if they had
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:29.560]  drill pipe in the well because i mean i don't know anybody that was on the rig and i could have
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.320]  found this out but evidently they was doing maybe a cement job uh and cement and a string of casing
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:40.840]  or something or they was trying to plug the top of the well so they could move off a location but
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:46.920]  whatever scenario they was doing you need to have total control that well and not have gas and oil
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:52.840]  in the the well bore to contaminate your cement job and what they do is if they was moving the
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.520]  the rig off the well they was done if they was done drilling and they was ready to move and a
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:01.320]  workover rig was going to come back and put tube and to bring the well in then that's possible
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:05.320]  what they was doing was a cement job to plug the well so they could move everything no that's
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:10.200]  admitted they were doing a cement job and then quote stopped using mud and they ordered water
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.640]  be injected but it wasn't engineers in the record it's engineers saying i don't want to do this
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:21.720]  it was bp in houston telling them what to do well that it was insane because if they was getting
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:26.920]  a kick with gas and they knew they was getting gas they knew dang good and well that that cement
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:32.280]  job wasn't going to hold because it was getting contaminated with gas and oil so it wasn't going
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:37.000]  to set in place so what they do is when they ready to move off a location you put a plug inside the
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.680]  casing you plug the well to where it holds the pressure back underneath the plug then you put
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.760]  a layer of cement on top of these sometimes you may put a couple of plugs you may put a couple
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:51.480]  of plugs depending on what your downhole pressures were to be able to contain this well and once
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:57.160]  this well is contained and it's shut in in a cement then you can get off the riser pipe that's
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:02.840]  going all the way to the seafloor you can even take you can even take the bop's off and what
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:07.640]  i'm understanding they had defective bop's they should have did this a long time ago was put a
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:13.800]  cement plug down there and get those defective bop's off of there and put a good set of bop's
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:18.120]  that didn't have leaks and uh because what i understand at some point in time they were
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:24.600]  circulating rubber bits up like you know little bits of rubber what i tell them that's the seals
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.360]  that's the seals inside the bop's they were circulating back up over there. Well no that's
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:33.720]  the word in the in the Coast Guard hearings is that there were engineers helicopters
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:39.400]  repair ships just buzzing around that rig when it blew up because the orders they'd been given
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:44.360]  had already screwed it up and it was leaking we'll come back with more calls stay with us this is
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:50.360]  Key Info straight ahead

[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:05.080]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:09.400]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:14.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:20.040]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.160]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:30.440]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:35.080]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from

[02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:35.560]  try to hurry through your calls right now rita in illinois thank you for joining us rita what's on
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:40.520]  your mind today hi alex well you mentioned a little bit of what i was calling about and then
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:45.400]  first of all before i i'd say what i want to say is that you know 1941 there's a video out there on
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:50.920]  youtube it's called rudolf diesel and henry fort against petroleum he made a hemp car that ran on
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:58.680]  hemp in 1941 was almost indestructible the video's out there but you know um the coast guard turns
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:04.120]  back these barges or else what and you know what let's see if they got the stones to open up on
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:09.080]  those barges it's time to either be mice or men clean the oil up they're going to die one way or
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:13.960]  the other they're going to die from the carcinogens and the poisons enough animals are dead let's see
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:20.360]  if the coast guard can open fire on those people but notice that notice these lawyers with 9 11 in
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:26.920]  the deadly dust or with the deadly carcinogens that the epa admits everybody's breathing even inland
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:32.040]  and bp and the feds say no there's no problem you're not allowed to wear respirators they love
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:39.240]  killing you slow they love something they can lawyer and deny later and have scond and and and
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:47.960]  twist and confuse uh and i just hate to see the coast guard put in this position but the coast
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:52.680]  guard shouldn't follow those orders i mean if they're told by the obama people and the bp people
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:57.000]  hey we want this to be as bad as it can be and of course obviously they're not telling them that
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:01.880]  but that's the main reason we want to get our carbon tax through it's a diversion from the economy
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:07.400]  it's a diversion from our preparations with war with iran you know they just shouldn't follow those
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:13.080]  orders to go up and stop local communities out there cleaning up the oil themselves this just
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:19.000]  shows how we have no freedom in this country anything else rita well didn't you say he who
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  fires first loses make them fire first because you know what these people are just going to
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.520]  clean up the oil enough dead animals already enough dead well i know what the feds will do
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:33.560]  they won't fire they'll wait till the boats land and then they'll arrest the people and tell them
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:38.120]  you're going to go to jail for 20 years if you don't plead guilty but i just look the government
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:44.440]  wants us as prisoners everything everything has to be okayed by them we have we are the
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:50.760]  opposite of what america was founded to be this is cancer we have to get rid of this out of control
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:55.320]  federal government it is not run by the federal government it is run by offshore interest that
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:00.120]  have gotten away with murder who've committed millions of different types of crimes over and
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:05.240]  over again and so they've said hey let's just go for broke we have to realize the stakes here
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:12.680]  we have an enemy that knows no limit that is completely naked in there over the top corruption
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:17.400]  i appreciate your call let's go to robert in west virginia robert you're on the air welcome
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:24.200]  hey alex how you doing good sir uh real quick before i get into what i was going to tell you
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:31.400]  you uh it was breaking news on drudge that uh there was a uh bomb threat called into your
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:38.280]  austin uh capital building now i saw that about an hour ago and now they've got metal detectors
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:44.040]  there because they grabbed some guy and he shot in the air last year and they you know the feds
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:49.720]  clearly uh firebomb their own governor's mansion to set up a police state and they even tried to
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.840]  set us up for that evidence show and then it turned out a federal informant set up people to firebomb
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:37:01.160]  from austin uh at the rnc in minnesota and that came out was a federal operation so this is just
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:06.440]  probably some mental patient or some fed uh the feds do these bomb threats all the time just
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:12.120]  just to you know scare their minions but uh anything else uh yes uh i'll tell you i've been
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:17.880]  feeling like i've been living in the twilight zone up here there's so much weird stuff going on uh
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:25.400]  let's see i've seen uh foreign troops up here as far as their transports they've got to be uh
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:34.600]  eastern european uh more of a german or technosavakian or romanian camouflage pattern with the
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:43.400]  international losses plate in the front the flat fronted uh mercedes uh troop transports
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:50.920]  uh i live out in the middle of nowhere and i'm nowhere near any air force base or military
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:58.840]  base uh and i'll tell you no lie i have seen in the last month and i have three of the huge
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:06.760]  bombers you know the real bigans that they they were they one of them flew above my property i'm
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:14.760]  not joking when i say it was 125 feet off the ground you're talking about a b-52 or a b-2 yeah
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:22.200]  they're practicing bombing runs in this in the howl valley i mean i've seen three three practices
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:29.160]  so far it was so close to ground i could see the rivets on the plane well let me comment on that
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:35.480]  robert and uh i appreciate your call i sent rob do and jason douglas and i was going to have him
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.160]  on today but at the end of the show rob do said can we do it next week that way i'll have time to
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:45.080]  get some of the video of the 20 plus hours they shot over four or five days and he'll have time
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:49.800]  to get all the documents together but he was showing me what the national guard and regular army
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:55.320]  gave them he went to a federally sponsored homeland security five-day drill sunday through
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:03.640]  thursday in chicago and in the literature online from the army it said the army will be working
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:09.000]  with local police in drug and gun interdiction remember about a year ago blagojevich right
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:14.040]  before that scandal started he was on cbs tv saying i'm going to use troops door to door
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:19.320]  to confiscate guns and then now about a month ago another uh state senator came out and called for
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:25.880]  that so my guys go to these drills the troops don't even hide it because back when i caught
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:29.720]  stuff like this on tape in the late nineties they would they would find out i was there
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:36.120]  and threatened me have police throw me off you know mainline streets california we had camera
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:42.920]  guys up in hebron maryland with the police walk up in maryland with marines that point machine
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:49.800]  guns at them and say stop filming us they had local kids looking for the quote militia people
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:56.680]  in the mock drill then last year i had a national guard colonel on from iowa who they admitted they
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.240]  were doing gun confiscation takeover drills of how to lock down arkadia and that's in my
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.560]  film police state for the rise of fema it's so important to have this film you know the tactics
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:12.440]  the program the brainwashing uh you've got the governor last year of tennessee they had army
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:19.320]  checkpoints marine corps uh i mean it was it was all the services air force mps homeland
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:26.040]  security shutting down whole highways and then the governor said don't do that and the feds
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:31.080]  said we're gonna do it anyways i even had state reps on and then we got photos and videos off
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:37.480]  the news it's in my film and they want to and it's a whole highway shut down u.s troops searching them
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:43.960]  training the troops it's okay training the people in the cars it's okay training the media it's okay
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:50.280]  and telling the governor hey boy we don't care what you say we don't care of the scaring people in
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:56.760]  small towns in big cities and it turned out it was a four state martial law lockdown drill and
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:03.480]  there have been these everywhere so continuing and expanding on that for everybody that's out there
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:15.160]  listening rob dew and jason douglas go to illinois and it was troops in police training to take on
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:22.280]  americans it was well well you've seen the new york times where it shows the uh explorers scouts
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:26.280]  and it shows a whole bunch of photos in the new york times article have a photo gallery
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:33.240]  and it says they're training to take on american terrorist and disgruntled vets and then homeland
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:38.680]  security plays the part of disgruntled vets and the kids come in with a laser tag and kill the
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:46.280]  the uh mock vets who won't turn their guns in and the new york times is saying isn't this great
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:52.520]  our 14 year olds are training to take on disgruntled gun owners that's what this was
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:58.520]  and they let my guys in they let them videotape the entire thing and we're going to be covering it
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:06.360]  next week again people like well we want to see this now my guys show up with 20 hours of video
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:14.120]  or more i saw like six boxes of tapes there's five tapes per box so probably 30 hours i don't know
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:25.880]  how many hours i'm just we got a lot of video and i mean what do you say i have been to the drills
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.640]  where they're training to take on the american people and of course over a year ago we got the
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:33.720]  secret homeland security in myack reports that law enforcement sent us who were concerned
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:39.320]  uh and in those reports that the media confirmed were real uh the number one threat to america is
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:44.600]  veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians landowners libertarians and anti-war activists
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:50.440]  for that matter anybody who is not for the new world order is an enemy ron paul you name it
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:57.800]  erin russo uh the list goes on and on this is what they teach this whole police state is for you
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:02.840]  you are the slaves all right we're going to go to sam ronnie mike and anthony before our guest
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:09.880]  comes on i got a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to yet but yes they've got foreign troops
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:14.280]  crawling all over the u.s and they've been incrementally increasing their numbers for
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:21.560]  decades and last year they had in le09 and it said in the fema press release troops from all
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.480]  these foreign countries mainly eastern europe are training to fight american terrorist i've seen
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:31.880]  articles in washington post eight years ago it's in my film wrote a tyranny where it said mexican
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:38.440]  and canadian troops will be used to fight american terrorist and then you noticed that the olympics
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.120]  it was in the news that the army was running checkpoints and now they're going to stay
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:48.280]  and u.s troops were used in canada see this is the world government this is the mercenaries
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:56.440]  this is bp all over the gulf coast telling camera people they can't videotape people say well what's
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:03.000]  your right well what's your authority my authority is i am god and the media follows their orders
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:08.760]  just some guy in a baseball cap walks up and says get out of here and if that guy in a baseball cap
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:13.560]  calls the cops and postures right like he's the boss the cops will get down and lick his boots
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:20.280]  but citizens that groveled the police a lot of cops now and steroids will just break your nose
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:24.440]  for fun and then charge you with assaulting them because you like a dog that rolls over you've
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:29.080]  never seen a dog that's called you walk over to it and it rolls over on its belly and you know
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:34.520]  grovels and and then you know maybe even squirts a little bit and that's a sign of i totally submit
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:40.280]  i'm scared i'm peeing on myself that's what the american people do we just see government and we just
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:44.040]  oh you want more taxes you want to tell me what i can do you want to run my life you want to be

[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:54.760]  over and and submit and and maybe that should be the new national symbol not the bald eagle but a
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:45:00.840]  man on his back in a fetal position with a little puddle of urine maybe we should make an american
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:06.440]  flag like that and then the stripes can be yellow for urine uh i mean i'm sorry that's what this you
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:12.600]  know of is urinating on ourselves and and the new american symbol will be a man in a fetal position
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:18.200]  peeing on himself i mean i'm sorry to get graphic but that is what we are we just government says
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:24.680]  something we ask how how do we jump master you are king you are god you are lord you are master
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:29.560]  nothing but government's good but fluoride my water give me vaccines full of poisons tell me

[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:42.040]  i'm sorry i mean are we land at the free home of the brave or are we the land of rolling over on
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:49.960]  our back and urinating on ourselves like a dog and so some guy on a baseball cap walks up to cops
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:53.640]  and says kick these people out of here they're not allowed to be here they're yes sir you look
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:46:00.920]  authoritative and then i mean it's just it's just to watch my fellow and i'm not bashing police here
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:04.760]  but police know the position you've been put in you know how you've been brainwashed you know how
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:10.440]  you've been encouraged to be thugs you know how the thugs get promoted you know the truth how it's
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:17.000]  macho to slap us the milk cows around now ladies and gentlemen allen greenspan is saying we're
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.840]  going to max out our debt that we're going to lose our triple a rating california connecticut
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:24.760]  and other states are losing their triple a rating which means we owe even more interest to bankers
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:29.160]  for the right to have currency it's all made up out of nothing gold is an all-time record today
[02:46:29.720 --> 02:46:34.360]  and i'm not going to spend a lot of time on this but if you want to protect yourselves if you want
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:39.160]  to not be completely castrated and completely under government control i suggest you move into
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:45.880]  gold and silver at bullion prices that are extreme high quality ted is running out of the gold he has
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:50.760]  at the lower price it's going to go up again but then as gold goes up he'll be able to sell you
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:56.120]  gold he bought at a lower price even as it goes up but you need to take advantage of this now
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:00.040]  ted good to have you on you've got some news articles for us today on what's happening with
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:04.040]  gold and why this is happening and today's coin offer before we go to break and come back with
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:10.840]  calls yeah just real quick on the news here um kitco published with debbie carlsson just wrote
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:17.640]  that gold sales to record highs as investors fear what wins of debt crises and future inflation
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:21.880]  and they're just talking about what's going on in europe and that's why people are getting into that
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:26.840]  then there then i was also looking at market watch market watch has gold pushes past record
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:33.800]  1260 dollars an ounce bloomberg has a title right up here china should raise its uh gold and oil
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:40.520]  holdings uh they're going to do that we also have the support level of gold pushed up now
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:47.560]  from that 1100 hundred or that 1200 and 10 range now it's 1216 20 and uh and the resistance levels
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:55.400]  at 1200 71270 we're going to see 1350 dollars an ounce with this trend going the way that it is
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:01.320]  real shortly and uh and i need to say it alex i don't know if i'll ever be able to buy gold again
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:07.400]  at 1220 dollars an ounce i was hoping to get that 1180 dollars to buy a bunch of it again i didn't
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:13.800]  get there i had to settle for just touching 1200 dollars an ounce here about a week ago and the
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:19.320]  world right now is turning to gold the weird part about it is we're in july it's acting more like
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:24.680]  it's october and uh you know because gold has been so strong there's a lot of things that are going
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:30.920]  up in the marketplace right now uh just across the board i mean gold hit a market peak today
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:37.000]  it right now is at 1258 dollars and some change which is higher than it's ever seen before so if
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:42.440]  it closes at that number we'll hit a market peak even though it went into the 1260 dollar range
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:48.600]  today is you know already so yeah we're gonna see we're gonna see some positive increases
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:53.240]  in the gold coins that people have been buying from us all these years and and i gotta say
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.640]  uh the you know they deserve it they're the mavericks that got into gold before all the
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:02.520]  yuppies jumped in and it's nice to see that they're able to take some profits and the yuppies are
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:06.440]  just now getting in now tell folks the special deals you've got today they're gonna run through
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:11.800]  the weekend it probably won't be available next week well i've got a few things again i am offering
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:18.440]  the same deal on francs with the forecaster as i did yesterday even gold jumped after gold jumping
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:27.160]  up 15 today i have the frank at 265 dollars that price will go up into the 270 dollar range
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:33.560]  after this weekend if gold holds its price and i don't know why it wouldn't uh i do have for sure
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:39.880]  my brokers don't even know this yet but i have a small group of 20 dollar liberties for those of
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:46.440]  you like 100 year old coins that are more of a collector type they're at 1518 dollars now i need
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:54.040]  to tell you that the u.s. eagle has jumped up over that that uh 1300 it's like 1340 now to buy those
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:50:00.280]  this is less than 200 over the u.s. eagle price and for a 20 dollar liberty that's unheard of
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:05.960]  but on monday they'll be at 1570 a piece so if you want to take advantage of that there's a
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:10.440]  good buy for you that's about buffaloes you got any of those luscious buffaloes left that is where
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:14.760]  i'm going next elix i'm going to tell people to buy the buffaloes because right now i have
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:20.440]  buffaloes and i can sell them i'm one of the few dealers that do and i can just tell you over the
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:26.200]  u.s. eagle i think the buffaloes are much better by just mainly about the fifth of an ounce frank's
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:32.040]  fifth of an ounce frank at 200 and 65 dollars elix it's again that you can't beat that especially
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:36.360]  considering that you're getting a full year most coin dealers are out of stock in there have huge
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:43.080]  premiums this isn't a great deal 800 686 2237 the brokers will be there tonight and throughout the
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:49.880]  weekend 800 686 237 tell them alex jones sent you to make sure you get the lower price because gold

[02:54:00.920 --> 02:54:15.160]  look i shouldn't have to sit here and sell people on getting gold and silver
[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:22.120]  it's very simple equation i told people by when it was 265 $280 an ounce because i knew that the
[02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:27.000]  scent the central banks of the world were artificially suppressing it i knew banks were inflating
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:34.040]  our currencies and that the law of finance and of economics said gold and silver and other
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:40.600]  metals would only go up now they can manipulate for short periods but not long term you look at
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:44.840]  the year graph the two-year graph the three-year graph the four-year graph the five-year graph
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:49.880]  back to seven years gold is only going up i don't buy it as an investment i buy it as an
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:54.680]  emergency backup but it's the best thing for investment out there that i've seen
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:55:03.000]  i mean it's head and shoulders above everything else it is the best investment period but for
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.640]  me it's the best insurance policy and i just hope that people will call and take advantage
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:12.600]  ted what are the silver half dollars what do you have in silver for folks well obviously
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:17.560]  silver is shooting up in price two and i am still holding that price of walking liberties down
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:23.240]  they're at 975 for those of you who want to have the old bags of junk silver they call them
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:28.680]  or 90 silver we have those bags too i don't know what the price is out the top of my head because
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:33.480]  we just had silver run up and i didn't bring that price into the studio with me but if you
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:38.120]  want to pick up something like that that's a great buy too we have the silver bars very close to
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:44.360]  spot you know for those of you are eliot wave people or read robert prector you'll see that
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:49.960]  right now we have a movement that is heading toward about 1350 and when we get close to that
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:54.680]  number then we'll see it back off and we'll have a bit of a correction but that bottom
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:56:00.200]  correction side is going to be close to 1280 and 1280 is going to be very similar to what we've
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:06.760]  seen when one gold was trading between 1150 to 1180 things are going to start picking up and then
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:12.520]  i expect that we'll have an acceleration coming right into you know september october november
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:20.440]  like we typically do in gold well even cnbc says 2,500 an ounce gold in the next year but i mean
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:28.840]  regardless gold and silver is real paper dollars and fiat derivatives are not real folks get involved
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:37.400]  in gold and silver today 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 thank you ted anderson yeah thanks for

[03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:13.000]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:20.200]  well he's only with us for one segment because he's under the weather and i'm going to nail down a
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:27.400]  full hour living next week dr john colman author of drug war against america what you should know
[03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:32.120]  about the united states constitution bill of rights a separate book of course he's best known for the
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:38.200]  conspirators hierarchy the committee of 300 now in its fourth edition uh doctor of constitutional
[03:08:38.200 --> 03:08:44.760]  law reportedly uh worked with uh well you know what doc it's always good to have you because
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:49.320]  you've done so much how would you describe yourself best in your bio in the short segment
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:55.480]  and we've got you uh with us for how would i describe myself yes just a very ordinary fellow
[03:08:55.480 --> 03:09:01.000]  trying to get information out to the people who needed very badly well you've put out invaluable
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:04.760]  info we don't have a lot of time with you today because i don't want to twist your arm into a full
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:08.840]  hour with you being under the weather uh but so much is happening i want to get you back on about
[03:09:08.840 --> 03:09:14.040]  the globalist hierarchy uh but the limited time we have today they're openly saying they want to
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:19.960]  attack iran they want to board their ships for the blockade which is an act of war looks like
[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:26.680]  that's going to the front burner i see this oil spill as a diversion while they get their internet
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:33.320]  censorship bills passed their carbon tax passed uh what's your take on the oil spill i think that
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:40.200]  it's a contract situation myself i've not voiced that opinion before but i believe that is the case
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:45.880]  in other words it's something like akin to pearl harvard which was a contract situation you know
[03:09:46.760 --> 03:09:52.200]  roosevelt told stimson and nokt and he said we somehow got to get the japanese into the position
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:57.080]  where they will fire the first shots i think what this is what about it's a bunch of same
[03:09:57.080 --> 03:10:03.560]  kind of thing absolutely uh and what brought you to that conclusion because that's the only
[03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:08.920]  conclusion i have day one my gut told me that but now we know they ordered the people on the rig
[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:14.200]  to dump seawater in instead of cement for a month the rig operator said this will explode so they
[03:10:14.200 --> 03:10:20.040]  gave orders they knew would lead to it turns out goldman sacks really owned much of bp its chairman
[03:10:20.040 --> 03:10:26.280]  was also the chairman of bp goldman sacks dumped 44 percent of its stock the week before the bp
[03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:33.480]  ceo dumped 30 plus percent of his stock the week before now we learned haliburton bought an oil
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:38.760]  cleaning company in the gulf the week before we know that the head funders of the carbon tax
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:43.480]  global neo surf system so come i mean there's a lot of other evidence now they've been blocking for
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:50.440]  50 plus days uh the governors and others trying to clean up the oil themselves and obama says the
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:56.120]  carbon tax is the answer i don't think that's the answer at all i think that's what they've
[03:10:56.120 --> 03:11:00.920]  got to do is put six or seven hundred boats out there to clean the mess up as quickly as they
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:07.000]  can that's what the solution is absolutely but a doctor in the time we have because i'm ranting
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.680]  here i mean what brought you to the conclusion that it's a contrived staged event i've seen so
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:17.720]  many of these things in the past in history itself like and to go back to you know to the
[03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:25.640]  to the uh second world war they got this supposedly insane dutchman to fire some shots
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:31.400]  and they said oh this is a this was something done by one of the nations and this caused for war
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:39.080]  so it's there's so many things in history that have been similar to this and pearl harbour sending
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:47.080]  the japanese cutting off their supplies of raw materials that vital for their production and
[03:11:47.080 --> 03:11:54.120]  their continued well-being a unilateral action by roosevelt but not even consulting the japanese
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:12:00.200]  and then of course you know when the japanese came to see him in washington marshall was out
[03:12:00.200 --> 03:12:06.040]  riding in central park and they couldn't get to anybody of course i have no brief for the japanese
[03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:12.120]  attacking for others inexcusable but nevertheless this is a kind of thing that happens is contrived
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:17.880]  situations are made from time to time when it suits the purpose and we all know that the
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:23.320]  committee of 300 of the people pulling the strings mainly from every situation from every angle
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:29.640]  that's right and if they have to sacrifice the name of bp formerly anglo-american oil
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:34.520]  they'll just change the name again and bp has always been at the heart of pushing the global
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:40.280]  carbon tax to fund the world government and then now notice it was a bp rig that this happened with
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:47.320]  i want i don't if you remember that what happened in in the time in iran when they had the big
[03:12:47.320 --> 03:12:52.920]  blowout there and things went completely wrong and that was called the american oil or aramco
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:57.560]  and was called a lot of other names it was only after that disaster there that they changed the
[03:12:57.560 --> 03:13:07.320]  name to various petroleum that's right that's right so it is very easy to change names absolutely
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:13.880]  that's what dinecore did after they got caught involved in sex slave trafficking well doc in
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:20.040]  the limited time we have here and again we're going to nail you down for next week so much is
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:27.000]  happening in the world what's your concern dealing with iran do you see frightening
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:33.800]  movements towards war with iran i see that in my opinion for what it's worth war in the middle
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:41.000]  east is is is almost imminent i see this is where it's heading all factors point to it
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:50.680]  wow absolutely we're on the same page on that front unfortunately you see how they're driving
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:57.320]  iran into a corner they're doing everything they can to and russia has disgraced itself by reneging
[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:07.000]  on their contract which they've had since 2003 to supply the s 300 anti aircraft missile system
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:11.160]  it's probably the best it is not probably but certainly the best in the world that could shoot
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:17.160]  down aircraft from 75 miles away and not miss because each one each missile has its own guided
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:23.640]  system which cannot be jammed or once fired it's bound to hit its target and so they've
[03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:29.080]  stopped supplying that to make the way easy for them to attack iran that's next on the cards
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:35.000]  which i think will lead to world to a major conflagration in the middle east i think that
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:40.680]  pewton has completely disgraced himself and russia in this move so lord knows what they're up to
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:49.480]  to russia had been claiming that they were going to not go along with an attack on iran but they
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:54.840]  are now it looks like starting to renege on that also as you mentioned venezuela what pressure do
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:15:02.280]  you think was brought to bear on russia by the united by the united states yes oh a great deal
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:07.800]  that's in several and or is over there to talk with medvedev who by the way is not exactly the
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:17.080]  brightest of people but uh pewton had to step down because of his the constitution and medvedev
[03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:21.880]  of course does whatever pewton tells him in the background so i think they went to put a lot of
[03:15:21.880 --> 03:15:28.760]  pressure on russia a tremendous amount of pressure on russia to join in the game china's gone along
[03:15:28.760 --> 03:15:34.920]  very very reluctantly but of course and i think that they're applying to iran are very very hard
[03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:40.840]  not to crack they have their militia called the past iran said by the million men very well trained
[03:15:40.840 --> 03:15:46.200]  they have their regular army which is an enormous size and you know iran itself was 10 times the
[03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:53.160]  sum the size of iraq since we found such a terrible job on our hands trying to subdue iraq how are
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:58.600]  we going to do the same thing to iran i think it's a physical impossibility i think it's beyond
[03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:05.000]  the capabilities of the united states military powers as it stands now well well doctor in in
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:09.800]  closing and we'll talk more about it next week you write time and time again as a theme in your
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:15.720]  many books about the intentional destruction of the united states by design we've been the empire
[03:16:15.720 --> 03:16:21.960]  for the anglo-american committee of 300 we've been the funding mechanism but as we get towards the end
[03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:27.320]  and then the formation of world government clearly they want to pin all their crimes on us why do
[03:16:27.320 --> 03:16:35.320]  they want to destroy the goose that laid their golden eggs of tyranny an empire and where do you see
[03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:41.400]  all of this uh basically winding up what's their end game strategy the end game as i said before
[03:16:41.400 --> 03:16:46.280]  the end game is to usher in a new world order inside of one world government which will be the
[03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:52.280]  committee of 300 and the way to do this is first of all destroy the most powerful nation in the
[03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:57.240]  world the united states of america which is a temporary experience and they tell that they can
[03:16:57.240 --> 03:17:03.960]  once this is up and running they can revive the patient by applying all the necessary techniques
[03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:08.360]  it's like a person who gets knocked temporarily unconscious you know kill oxygen and all kinds
[03:17:08.360 --> 03:17:13.160]  of stuff and they've been in a very short while they recover so they've got such faith in the
[03:17:13.160 --> 03:17:20.600]  united states and rightly so it's a tremendous economic power and its powers of recovery have
[03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:26.040]  been proved many many times even after the huge disaster of woodrow wilson and world war one
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:31.960]  and i'm sure that they know as well as i do that the united states can very quickly be resuscitated
[03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:38.120]  once the objective has been achieved amazing i know some of your listeners may think i'm off the
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:44.360]  wall but the surprising thing is and i don't have to toot my own horn but i've made about 500
[03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:51.160]  predictions in my lifetime and almost all of them have come to pass and i love some fun no i know
[03:17:51.160 --> 03:17:57.160]  you have on record but i mean what is their final plan then for the united states final plan will be
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:03.800]  the united state be the premium the number one country inside of the their showcase country
[03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:11.800]  inside the new world order one world government that's their plan they can't dispense with the
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:17.640]  united states all together is too it's too too important an organization from an economic point
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:25.320]  alone so it has to remain viable and of course once this organization is in place and it's not
[03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:29.800]  a new thing you know they've been trying this since the days of king george the third he at that time
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:34.360]  he was lining up all the european powers to join in the scheme he had which he also called a new
[03:18:34.360 --> 03:18:43.640]  world order abs well sure but but the republic as we know the free market uh private property system
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:51.240]  that we've known that is to be dismantled oh yes that'll go that definitely will go yes everything
[03:18:51.240 --> 03:18:57.960]  will become it will become like the social you know this it's actually the their goal is to
[03:18:57.960 --> 03:19:02.200]  socialize in other states you can see it in every move that the president is making

[03:19:21.720 --> 03:19:25.960]  that's because they want everyone dependent on the system and so everyone's so poor they would

[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:21.400]  there's a story up on info wars dot com and i just watched the video earlier and i just can't
[03:24:21.400 --> 03:24:28.280]  believe it federal agents harass and intimidate congressional candidate charles black and he
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:34.600]  announced he was having a congressional campaign meeting at a gun range and the federal officers
[03:24:34.600 --> 03:24:38.840]  drove three and a half hours to harass and intimidate congressional candidate charles black
[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:43.720]  running for us house representatives for arizona district two agents then demand the people at
[03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:48.920]  the gun range unload their firearms and put them down and basically say they can't have a political
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:54.280]  meeting with guns they then demand that a 10-year-old girl stop videotaping them this is exactly the
[03:24:54.280 --> 03:25:00.120]  type of corrupt government mr black is out to shut down for the protection of the u.s citizens we
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:05.000]  have constitutional rights and no man is above the law and i saw a video last week we posted on
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  info wars dot com a woman went out and had a pro palestinian rally of peaceful americans
[03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:16.920]  against what happened with the flotilla whether you're for that or against it it's her right
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:20.840]  and two FBI agents come to her door and ask her if she's basically a terrorist
[03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:26.760]  and if she's planning violence and she says well you know i'm not planning anything but
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:32.680]  why are you here and it is because she had that public meeting they want you to shut up
[03:25:32.680 --> 03:25:39.960]  they want you to be intimidated and i'm watching this video it's up on info wars dot com it's just
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:48.680]  how crazy they are they're so crazy um i had fbi last year two weeks before about a week before
[03:25:48.680 --> 03:25:53.800]  obama deception came out calling and i called the number and it was the fbi they were calling
[03:25:53.800 --> 03:26:01.480]  my employees here asking me asking them about alex jones asking about what i think of obama
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:07.160]  about the film and so i had to release the film early because they were getting ready to come in
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:12.600]  here and try to shut it down i mean ladies and gentlemen i mean this is secret police and i've
[03:26:12.600 --> 03:26:18.440]  got a whole bunch of mainstream news articles today cns news ap you name it where they're going
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:23.000]  yeah obama could shut the internet down and he may start shutting it down they may restrict free
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:28.040]  speech and they may restrict political statements because it's what we need now i mean they're just
[03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:31.880]  kind of coming out real calm and saying yeah we're going to take your freedom
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:39.320]  anthony in new york than danie nelson john jim anthony thanks for holding it on the year
[03:26:40.120 --> 03:26:44.920]  hey alex so this is anthony told that we spoke back in october after i made national news yelling
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:51.240]  at steve israel the health care meeting yes good job yeah and uh jason was kind enough to have me
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:59.160]  on his show on november first two yeah i mean back then uh 14 15 months ago uh the media was
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:04.120]  still saying that you were all financed by lobbyists and then whole crowds would say we don't want
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:09.560]  government health care and they would say it's a hoax but now national polls show over 80 percent
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:15.720]  against it when it passed it was over 75 percent and they just say it's all a hoax it doesn't exist
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:21.400]  you must be a racist anthony oh well you're gonna get me started on what i call this
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:27.080]  that now there's a famous youtube video or viral youtube video of a woman screaming in my face
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:33.960]  calling me a racist in front of otlet church in harlem at day one of the obama cia columbia
[03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:40.280]  university trial i'm a friend of an ally of reverend manning as i know you are and there's
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:46.840]  been a pretty much a near media blackout on this whole trial well we had reverend manning on about
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:50.520]  it and uh you know covered the fact that he had a public trial to put this evidence out
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:58.440]  but uh you know that's basically basically the skinny uh but obama is illegitimate he is cia he
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:03.800]  is an indonesian citizen he is a trader he is a mobster he does get his home and things in the past
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:11.720]  paid for by mobsters just like uh bp paid for the million dollar condo for years uh of uh
[03:28:11.720 --> 03:28:17.800]  ron emmanuel it's just a lawless group of thugs sure and if you want to talk about people being
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:23.960]  shut up and even shut up about this issue alex a friend of mine got her radio show shut down
[03:28:23.960 --> 03:28:29.560]  the the station was shut down and the website was shut down 90 minutes before her program was
[03:28:29.560 --> 03:28:34.440]  going to air and i was going to be a guest and we were going to discuss this trial and and my
[03:28:34.440 --> 03:28:39.720]  attendance there and the viral video and all this stuff you know it takes a lot of time to do something
[03:28:39.720 --> 03:28:43.560]  like that even if that happened that might have been coincidental i mean stations are being bought
[03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:48.600]  and sold and changing hands constantly i mean i have seen censorship i've been censored myself
[03:28:48.600 --> 03:28:54.440]  many years ago but i found the awakening is on they're trying to intimidate us now by taking the
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:59.560]  gloves off i think it's going to backfire so the answer is just scream more bloody murder anthony
[03:28:59.560 --> 03:29:03.400]  well sure alex it's what i called you and of course we can't prove that it was shut down
[03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:09.000]  because of the topic but um she did tell me that in the past when she was going to be a guest on
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:14.680]  the same network different program she was contacted by the uh his truth squads and they
[03:29:14.680 --> 03:29:18.840]  threatened to sue her and then she oh no that does go on and we've had that happen and you've
[03:29:18.840 --> 03:29:22.520]  got to ignore it and i appreciate your call good to hear from me anthony keep up the good work

[03:33:14.200 --> 03:33:20.360]  to seven eastern i want to try to hurry through danie nelson john jim and eric's calls at least
[03:33:20.360 --> 03:33:29.400]  those calls perhaps even more at 1-800-259-9231 because i then want to go through all this news
[03:33:29.400 --> 03:33:35.320]  that i haven't yet covered yet uh look at this article out of the san antonio express news

[03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:13.480]  because we're a bunch of schmucks according to the elite we're a bunch of people who can be
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:19.800]  guilted and they're going along with anything and i wanted to dovetail that with mexican
[03:34:19.800 --> 03:34:24.040]  flag and we'll play some of this in the background while i talk about it mexican flag waving lakers
[03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:30.040]  fans riot in la this is out of the sun and we have the video of this illegal aliens
[03:34:32.360 --> 03:34:37.240]  just incredible photos in the la times seem more powerful than the video they go up to
[03:34:37.240 --> 03:34:45.480]  people's cars and turn cars over with people in them by the way with hispanics in them if you
[03:34:45.480 --> 03:34:50.840]  look at the photos but they are waving mexican flags as they turn cars over so it's not even
[03:34:50.840 --> 03:34:57.480]  an anti-white thing it's just a crazy pro mexico thing with big giant mexican flags waving there's
[03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:02.440]  photos and videos all over the web in a minute on this video you can see the mexican flags two
[03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:07.560]  giant ones being waved uh and and i mean this is the insanity why don't these people go to
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.840]  mexico and riot against their corrupt government well because their government would machine gun
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:18.520]  them as they do routinely there's the mexican flags why why wouldn't they get upset against
[03:35:18.520 --> 03:35:25.000]  the tyranny in their own country no the lakers win did they win i wouldn't even pay attention
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:30.600]  they said it was a celebration i guess they won and so let's riot all over the downtown area
[03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:36.040]  and let's turn cars over with people in them let's break out windows let's set fires to cabs
[03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:44.920]  let's i mean let's do all of this for hours and have the police just stand down can you imagine
[03:35:44.920 --> 03:35:50.040]  if the tea party would have dumped over a newspaper stand or would have burned a car or would have
[03:35:50.040 --> 03:35:54.680]  turned a car over in fact i didn't give you this guy's i'm going to give you an la times article
[03:35:54.680 --> 03:35:58.760]  where they have a photo of the hispanics in a car and then the car was turned over
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:03.880]  over you got a hispanic family in a car and these crazy lunatics with mexican flags run up
[03:36:03.880 --> 03:36:09.960]  and turn the car over i mean what and they're all smiling and laughing like it's fun this is mob
[03:36:09.960 --> 03:36:14.200]  psychology folks this is what happened in nazi germany this is what happened in soviet russia
[03:36:14.200 --> 03:36:19.320]  with the communists they just get all like it's fun it's just get all wound up because a stupid
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:27.960]  sports team won but again at a tribal level all humans have this when your team is is is is
[03:36:27.960 --> 03:36:34.360]  mock gladiatorial warfare and so it hits the same neurons the same ganglia in the brain
[03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:39.560]  that when you invest in your basketball football baseball or favorite golfer when they make that
[03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:44.520]  score you feel like you had a victory you're supposed to feel good in a war because a tribe
[03:36:44.520 --> 03:36:49.480]  that was coming to kill all the males take the women and children as slaves that's what all
[03:36:49.480 --> 03:36:54.440]  cultures did africans the germanic tribes they all did this didn't matter one area of the world
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:37:01.400]  the war instinct is so you see your wife and kids again it doesn't matter if you get your
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:06.440]  bones broken or your head clubbed in you're happy to go out there and you're not afraid
[03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:11.720]  you know the enemy lands in their ships it's 4 000 years ago they're going to try to drag
[03:37:11.720 --> 03:37:16.520]  your women and children off you are ready to kill some people and you can really fight you can go
[03:37:16.520 --> 03:37:23.560]  wild and always those being attacked statistically have a higher victory rate even when they're
[03:37:23.560 --> 03:37:27.640]  overwhelmed than those who are attacking because the guys being attacking are from some big rich
[03:37:27.640 --> 03:37:32.680]  tribe who are there to get more women and money and gold for king booga booga who's on a power
[03:37:32.680 --> 03:37:39.400]  trip back across you know the ocean 200 miles away on his island okay and and and so they don't
[03:37:39.400 --> 03:37:45.560]  really want to go up the hill and kill these people so so all this hopping around and tumping
[03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:51.720]  cars over that's meant to defend liberty your freedom so you don't go into bondage and so when
[03:37:51.720 --> 03:37:56.280]  your team wins you get all irrationally happy because because it means you're not going to have
[03:37:56.280 --> 03:38:01.560]  your head clubbed in and your women aren't going to be hauled off to be slaves that's that's where
[03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:06.760]  that comes from see when i get all animated and excited and angry and upset that's because i'm
[03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:11.960]  ready for war folks i'm waging war against the new world order i'm exposing their fraud their
[03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:17.880]  hypocrisy their dehumanization i know they think of us as worse than scum they see us as negatives
[03:38:17.880 --> 03:38:28.120]  to be removed like trash now they are burning cars after they turn them over i mean this
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:33.640]  this went on agents but again you can't call them illegal aliens they'd be called unauthorized
[03:38:33.640 --> 03:38:42.440]  immigrants mexican flag waving lakers fans riot in la la struck by basketball riots
[03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:48.920]  despite heavy la pd presence violence breaks out after lakers victory crowds hurl bottles other
[03:38:48.920 --> 03:38:55.240]  objects of police smash marquise jump on vehicles break windows and light fires along uh
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:39:00.840]  fagura street at least one person is beaten unconscious you can bet it was a hundred times
[03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:07.800]  worse uh bread and circus has gone awry mindless sports fans riot in la info wars dot com curtain
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:13.640]  demo here's another one lakers celebration turns ugly as police motorists come under attack
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:19.880]  i think this is the la times article that had the photo on on the page uh where it shows the
[03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:25.160]  family and then you'll notice it's the same white car they didn't set on fire oh it's everybody's
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:30.680]  smiling oh it's fun to top this car over full of a family that went to a lakers game i mean what is
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:35.080]  wrong with these people won't see these guys have got what their great great great great
[03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:41.080]  grandfather's had an instinct to defend themselves and to have war but now they go and feel like
[03:39:41.080 --> 03:39:46.040]  their team won so they're so jazzed up for war because they just had a simulated combat
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:51.800]  bread and circus that they've got to go out and have a war but see notice the other warrior
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:56.200]  class the police didn't do anything to them because the police know this is a protected group
[03:39:56.760 --> 03:40:01.480]  the you know the big bosses want the borders open and so this group's got to be left alone
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:07.400]  that's why they riot all the time because they've been given the message it's okay now paul wants
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:13.880]  to write an excellent article that's up on um gcn live that's gcn like the network gcnlive.com
[03:40:15.240 --> 03:40:20.280]  and it says what if the tea partiers waving gadsden flags had trashed la
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:27.080]  stories also up on prismbunna.com but what if tea partiers waving gas and flags had trashed la
[03:40:27.080 --> 03:40:32.680]  yeah what would happen now that's not the one uh i don't know there's a bunch of la time stories
[03:40:32.680 --> 03:40:37.240]  it's it's an la time story i linked off it off a drudge this morning and it shows the family in
[03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:42.760]  their car everybody around it's smiling rocking at the cars kind of on its edge it's a white car
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:47.720]  and then you read the article later they turned it over and set it on fire oh look we're setting
[03:40:47.720 --> 03:40:52.760]  a car on fire full of uh people and again they didn't go out and find white people's car to burn
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:41:01.240]  it was other hispanics just just mindless violence mindless idiocy mindless craziness uh it's like
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:07.240]  black people randomly attacking whites during the la riots remember reginald denny banging his
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:14.120]  face into where he had reconstructive surgery it was like a flap of skin at least this didn't appear
[03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:19.400]  to be racial it was just waving mexican flags and any group can behave like this the point is
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:23.320]  political correctness is said it's okay for these groups to do it so they're constantly
[03:41:23.320 --> 03:41:27.320]  in doing it um all right i said i'd go to your calls and we get into all this other news like
[03:41:27.320 --> 03:41:33.640]  10 stories in the news that the bp oil spill is overshadowing very important article up at gcm
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:40.760]  live dot com it's also uh originates from prison planet dot com uh by steve watson paul watson uh
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:47.000]  and myself we all worked on this story together to morning uh this morning let's go ahead and go
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:53.800]  to denny and tejas in texas you're on the air go ahead hey thanks for taking my call um i'm calling
[03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:58.440]  in regards to a fox news report about the uh ten afghan soldiers that are missing from
[03:41:58.440 --> 03:42:06.360]  likeland air force base um this this whole report kind of stinks to our heaven it's it's uh all of
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:14.120]  these soldiers appear to have a dod common access cards the report says that that they have all the
[03:42:14.120 --> 03:42:20.680]  credentials to gain access to certain government sites but also they have been missing for three
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:28.440]  months the last one went missing three months ago and well some of these some of these attacks
[03:42:28.440 --> 03:42:34.600]  are real muslim extremists but most of them are double or triple agents who aren't defecting
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:40.760]  they're their money their leader has been paid by the us on record they've been caught over and over
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:45.560]  again to go out and tell their low-level idiots who really believe they're fighting for a la to
[03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:50.680]  go blow something up and that's why it's come out that israeli us and other forces british
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:55.960]  forces have been caught dressed up like muslims attacking shiites and sunnis in iraq to get
[03:42:55.960 --> 03:42:59.880]  different sides killing each other when they want to flare up so that they can then artificially
[03:42:59.880 --> 03:43:05.000]  turn that off and say look our plan worked and they create fake bin laden videos they have the
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:09.880]  airlift of evil in 2001 times of london where our government flew six to eight thousand taliban
[03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:15.080]  al-qaeda leaders out to safety the whole thing staged but give us your take on it danie well i
[03:43:15.080 --> 03:43:20.680]  just thought it was kind of odd that that the fox news reports that one day after the beyond
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:27.880]  lookout bulletins went out to every law enforcement agency in the country but a senior a senior law
[03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:35.800]  enforcement official says that uh there appears to be uh no ties to to a terrorist or or or any uh
[03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:43.480]  any other organization like that why would they wait three months to send this out the day before
[03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:49.640]  it's released on fox news because it's all public relations to create the illusion that
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:53.480]  they're all these muslims that want to kill us they think we're so dumb they admit they put
[03:43:53.480 --> 03:43:58.680]  out fake al-qaeda videos of bin laden and then tell us that bin laden's still alive and in iran
[03:43:59.400 --> 03:44:05.400]  i mean now they say al-qaeda works with the malicious al-qaeda is literally bin laden
[03:44:05.400 --> 03:44:09.800]  is like a little play doll with a turban and a beard well we want to attack the malicious
[03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:14.120]  say he's with them we want to attack iran say he's with them i mean it's literally
[03:44:15.240 --> 03:44:21.880]  like a like planting drugs on someone it's just an excuse i mean i feel like you can't believe
[03:44:21.880 --> 03:44:28.520]  anything that you hear anything put put put put out by the mainstream media nothing it's all lies
[03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:33.800]  and that's what they want they want it to where you just can't believe anything and yes on big
[03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:39.960]  pr issues when you see them hyping something across the board it is almost always a complete lie
[03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:46.200]  or at least a spin or distortion now you know if they report something good though you can bet it's
[03:44:54.200 --> 03:45:00.840]  American gun owners isn't it great they take your blood secretly for a pentagon database at birth
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:07.720]  isn't it great that they're forcing flu vaccines in new york uh state and and massachusetts you know
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:12.680]  so so there's different types and you learn to recognize it like isn't it great we're gonna attack
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:21.160]  iran uh because they've got bin laden you know you know then you can tell again there's i should
[03:45:21.160 --> 03:45:25.560]  write a book or a handbook just on what i've learned because i've totally learned how they operate
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:31.800]  they they basically have got game plans they've got a playbook so they'll admit horrible things but
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:38.040]  say they're good or they'll say good things are bad or they'll flat out lie uh i mean do you see
[03:45:38.040 --> 03:45:44.680]  what i'm saying uh i i follow you but but it's also surprising to me why is fox news the only one
[03:45:44.680 --> 03:45:52.280]  that's reported it i noticed sky television owned by rupert murdoch in england five years ago was
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:56.840]  saying white al-qaeda white people gun owners conservatives secretly are being trained by
[03:45:56.840 --> 03:46:02.360]  bin laden and then i saw these uh talking points in neocon publications saying i had been raised
[03:46:02.360 --> 03:46:07.480]  in afghanistan as a child that i was an al-qaeda operative and that was directly from the cia
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:12.920]  putting this out didn't matter how crazy it was it was just meant to confuse people and then i told
[03:46:12.920 --> 03:46:17.880]  you they're gonna announce white al-qaeda and now the last two years they claim that militias and
[03:46:17.880 --> 03:46:23.000]  gun owners secretly are all working with al-qaeda because they're getting ready to sick homeland
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:28.120]  security on the american people and say we're all al-qaeda i mean all the real training is for the
[03:46:28.120 --> 03:46:32.520]  american people to begin with but they'll just say if you're for the second amendment or the tea
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:36.360]  party you're with al-qaeda and most of these conservatives will go i'm not for al-qaeda i'm
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:41.560]  turning my guns in yeah because nothing's worse than al-qaeda i mean you understand the brainwashing
[03:46:41.560 --> 03:46:50.280]  here uh danny yeah i i understand i also i also wonder if uh alex jones was there's gonna be are
[03:46:50.280 --> 03:46:54.760]  gonna be on that death list well here's the deal they're not gonna want to move with an
[03:46:54.760 --> 03:46:59.000]  big giant takeover death list they'll just start shutting the web down i mean here's a mainstream
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:05.320]  you know analysis Lieberman introduces bill targeting internet freedom uh i mean this is
[03:47:05.320 --> 03:47:11.400]  from jo Lieberman's own website i mean it's just they're openly look they're crooks the entire
[03:47:11.400 --> 03:47:16.520]  white house is the most criminal group i mean bush and shani were crooks but they didn't openly
[03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:22.440]  have oil companies pay for their houses which is completely illegal i mean they just do not
[03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:28.360]  care they do not care it well it's like bush two weeks ago saying yeah i ordered torture
[03:47:28.360 --> 03:47:33.240]  which is totally illegal they do not care they
[03:47:33.240 --> 03:47:42.600]  know happening they're moving on every front and while we're all busy watching the oil spill which
[03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:48.200]  is important they're getting ready for world war three with iran and they're stealing all our freedoms
[03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:55.400]  uh let's talk to uh nelson in new york you're on the air it was good alex mr alex jones it's
[03:47:55.400 --> 03:48:01.000]  actually melvin from new york okay sir well welcome melvin you said yeah yeah it was good
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:05.640]  we spoke like a couple months back i just want to tell you man i'm agnostic but god bless you
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:11.880]  man maybe i think the force that guys the universe is guiding you because true stands up by itself
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:17.320]  and it's it's not on a man's integrity that is baseman and i think you got a lot of it anyway
[03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:22.040]  um i just want to throw a quick little spark that you're basically from out here in new york
[03:48:22.040 --> 03:48:27.960]  thanks to you i'm weak and one or two people up it's becoming a police state out here it's random
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:32.520]  searches uh in the subway i mean it's it's not like a movie but it's happening and it's there
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:38.200]  the table's there and it says you are subject to random searches no force amendment uh they give
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:43.240]  announcements in the subway platforms same thing they give announcements uh in the train while you're
[03:48:43.240 --> 03:48:48.440]  riding it and every time i go to work there's military with large machine guns which goes against
[03:48:48.440 --> 03:48:54.600]  uh uh that's against the law the separation between police and military number two zeitgeist
[03:48:54.600 --> 03:49:00.360]  has a bunch of chupus in it but in the end it promotes the agenda of the united nations which
[03:49:00.360 --> 03:49:05.000]  is anti-private property you want to get rid of all money you're already exposed in the interview
[03:49:05.560 --> 03:49:10.760]  that's anti-private property and the united nations believe the same thing that that property
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:15.480]  belongs quote unquote to everyone and you don't have a right to your own property number three
