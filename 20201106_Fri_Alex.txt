[00:00.000 --> 00:21.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.400 --> 00:24.080]  Owen Troyer sitting in studio for Alex today.
[00:24.080 --> 00:25.880]  We will be hearing from Alex.
[00:25.880 --> 00:33.800]  He was on a special mission last night, took a flight to Arizona in the middle of the day,
[00:33.800 --> 00:38.960]  landed at night, went right to the stop, the steel rally that are happening around
[00:38.960 --> 00:39.960]  the nation.
[00:39.960 --> 00:42.680]  By the way, where are the Biden supporters out in the streets?
[00:42.680 --> 00:49.120]  They're nowhere, folks, just like during the Biden rallies.
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.680]  There is a lot to be addressed today.
[00:53.680 --> 00:57.240]  And I'm looking at the video list thinking, well, what should we start it off with?
[00:57.240 --> 01:04.520]  Is it Ted Cruz and the Trumps and the president and everybody saying, hey, look, they rigged
[01:04.520 --> 01:05.520]  this election.
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.440]  They're stealing it in Philadelphia.
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.200]  Is it now for the third time they steal a state at the wee hours of the night, 420 time
[01:14.200 --> 01:21.680]  local Georgia after losing all week long, magically, Biden, just like in Michigan and
[01:21.680 --> 01:25.080]  Wisconsin in the dark of night, takes the lead in Georgia.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.960]  And now they're done counting.
[01:26.960 --> 01:27.960]  How convenient.
[01:27.960 --> 01:32.160]  Oh, nobody saw that coming.
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.640]  No, nothing to see here.
[01:37.640 --> 01:41.400]  Total theft, total chicanery.
[01:41.400 --> 01:49.000]  I mean, at this point, it's just spitting right in your face.
[01:49.000 --> 02:00.320]  So the war is on, sadly, as we have been saying, the 79 days of hell is here.
[02:00.320 --> 02:06.080]  So I would pace yourself emotionally, pace yourself intellectually and understand that
[02:06.080 --> 02:13.440]  the elections over Trump won, but the Democrats have been voting since the election ended in
[02:13.440 --> 02:14.440]  Trump won.
[02:14.440 --> 02:18.640]  The Democrats just kept voting until Biden won a couple of states he needed to win in
[02:18.640 --> 02:20.440]  order to be declared victor.
[02:20.440 --> 02:22.760]  That's now the time that we're in.
[02:22.760 --> 02:24.640]  Trump is going to have to challenge this legally.
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.640]  He's going to maybe even have to go to the Supreme Court.
[02:26.640 --> 02:28.280]  Let's hope not because I don't like that.
[02:28.280 --> 02:30.280]  I don't think ACB will vote for him.
[02:30.280 --> 02:32.000]  I think she'll stab him in the back.
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.360]  I think Kavanaugh will favor with him, probably Clarence Thomas, but I don't know.
[02:39.360 --> 02:42.440]  I don't like it.
[02:42.440 --> 02:49.840]  But they have been caught videos of them filling out hundreds of ballots, just nonstop filling
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.480]  them out, caught in Arizona, telling people, oh, use a Sharpie and then I'm sorry, your
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.480]  ballot doesn't count.
[02:55.480 --> 02:56.480]  Or maybe it's Trump.
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.480]  Maybe it's Biden.
[02:57.480 --> 03:01.080]  We'll just go with Biden.
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.480]  Military ballots burned boxes and bags of ballots being drug into Pennsylvania overnight.
[03:06.480 --> 03:12.600]  I mean, it's insane.
[03:12.600 --> 03:23.080]  Again, the analogy is if you're playing basketball and you're in the fourth quarter of the NBA
[03:23.080 --> 03:30.600]  finals, game seven, and you're up by 30 points, you're up by 30 points and there's a couple
[03:30.600 --> 03:36.320]  minutes left and then all of a sudden the team that's losing, the team you're playing
[03:36.320 --> 03:39.520]  against decides they're just going to have their whole team on the floor.
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.640]  So they've now got 12 guys on the court.
[03:41.640 --> 03:43.920]  They're getting on each other's backs.
[03:43.920 --> 03:46.120]  They're blocking all your shots.
[03:46.120 --> 03:47.400]  They're scoring every time down.
[03:47.400 --> 03:50.960]  They're outnumbering you 12 to five on the court and then two of the guys are boxing
[03:50.960 --> 03:51.960]  out the refs.
[03:51.960 --> 03:52.960]  The refs can't see the game.
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.200]  They don't know what's going on and then, well, magically two seconds left.
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.600]  They're up by five and game over, they win and you're like, hey, they had too many guys
[04:01.600 --> 04:04.080]  on the floor and the rest are like, well, we didn't see anything.
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.440]  We were being blocked by all the guys on the floor, but they win.
[04:09.440 --> 04:12.600]  Biden 2020.
[04:12.600 --> 04:20.560]  They want you to believe that Joe Biden set the record amount of votes by like 10 million.
[04:20.560 --> 04:23.960]  No, actually, you want to know what happened last night.
[04:23.960 --> 04:26.600]  Actually, you want to know what happened on election night, which feels like it's still
[04:26.600 --> 04:27.600]  last night.
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.600]  Trump won and Trump got more votes than Barack Obama did.
[04:31.600 --> 04:34.760]  Trump set a record for most votes in an election.
[04:34.760 --> 04:41.560]  Trump won in a landslide, I would guess at least 305 electorally, probably more.
[04:41.560 --> 04:44.080]  All the Democrats had was the steal.
[04:44.080 --> 04:46.240]  We knew where they were going to do it.
[04:46.240 --> 04:47.440]  Everybody knew it.
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.640]  They've been caught red-handed and we shouldn't even have to have a legal battle.
[04:52.640 --> 04:56.640]  Americans should be out in the streets in droves demanding these Democrats resign because
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.720]  they've been totally caught.
[04:57.720 --> 05:00.760]  They know it.
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.960]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[05:04.960 --> 05:05.960]  And why is that?
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.760]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.280]  produces more mustard seeds.
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.400]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.400]  They didn't know why.
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.560]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[05:24.560 --> 05:26.040]  selenium.
[05:26.040 --> 05:34.280]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off,
[05:34.280 --> 05:37.760]  store-wide free shipping, and triple Patriot points.
[05:37.760 --> 05:44.760]  Biotrue selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing
[05:44.760 --> 05:46.280]  in that it funds our operation.
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.520]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.680]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[05:53.680 --> 05:58.440]  It's back in stock 50% off, triple Patriot points, at infowarsstore.com, and with free
[05:58.440 --> 05:59.440]  shipping.
[05:59.440 --> 06:09.440]  Oh, yeah, while you were sleeping, Biden won another state.
[06:09.440 --> 06:12.560]  Isn't that magic?
[06:12.560 --> 06:19.720]  Yeah, my analogy in the first segment with the basketball team wasn't even enough.
[06:19.720 --> 06:22.160]  It's not just that they have 12 players on the floor.
[06:22.160 --> 06:27.600]  We've also got 30 basketballs that they're scoring with.
[06:27.600 --> 06:32.280]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show here on this Friday, November 6th.
[06:32.280 --> 06:34.000]  We do have Leigh Ann McAdoo in studio.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.280]  I'm going to be live with you for seven hours today.
[06:36.280 --> 06:41.960]  I've got a lot to address, including a interview I had with Steve Pachinick that went beyond
[06:41.960 --> 06:44.760]  viral.
[06:44.760 --> 06:48.480]  And I want to explain something from that, because a lot of people are asking up, follow
[06:48.480 --> 06:50.600]  up, and it seems that somehow that got everywhere.
[06:50.600 --> 06:58.280]  And I want to explain what happened yesterday and what Pachinick is talking about.
[06:58.280 --> 07:04.400]  But folks, we have exclusive footage today, right here on this Friday, November 6th on
[07:04.400 --> 07:08.200]  the Alex Jones Show that you've never seen anywhere before.
[07:08.200 --> 07:17.360]  And I'm almost afraid to show this to you because it's so blatant what the Democrats
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  are doing.
[07:18.360 --> 07:19.360]  But we're going to have to do it.
[07:19.360 --> 07:25.280]  When you go to bed and Trump is up hundreds of thousands in Michigan, and then you wake
[07:25.280 --> 07:28.640]  up and Biden's won Michigan, that's cheating.
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.440]  When you go to bed and Trump is up hundreds of thousands in Wisconsin, and you wake up
[07:33.440 --> 07:36.040]  and Biden won, that's rigged.
[07:36.040 --> 07:40.920]  When you go to bed and Trump's been leading Georgia for the entire race, and then five
[07:40.920 --> 07:47.720]  days later, you wake up, Biden won, and now they're done counting, that's illegitimate.
[07:47.720 --> 07:53.120]  And this is the fraud they're trying to run on you with graphs where Biden votes literally
[07:53.120 --> 07:54.120]  shoot straight up.
[07:54.120 --> 07:58.280]  I mean, it's like a steroid injection into his votes, and it's like, hey, oh, nothing
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.280]  to see here.
[07:59.280 --> 08:04.760]  Just 138,000 mail-in ballots for Biden here, 50,000 mail-in ballots for Biden here.
[08:04.760 --> 08:06.280]  The split is 100% for Biden.
[08:06.280 --> 08:07.800]  It's totally normal.
[08:07.800 --> 08:10.800]  It's totally normal.
[08:10.800 --> 08:11.800]  Nothing to see here.
[08:11.800 --> 08:12.800]  Biden won.
[08:12.800 --> 08:14.360]  Don't ask any questions.
[08:14.360 --> 08:23.120]  And this has been Fox News, but folks, this is unbelievable footage that we have for you
[08:23.120 --> 08:25.560]  right here.
[08:25.560 --> 08:27.200]  So let's begin rolling it.
[08:27.200 --> 08:36.400]  Check this out, Biden ballots, Biden ballots landing in Arizona last night.
[08:36.400 --> 08:38.440]  Unbelievable footage that we have for you right here.
[08:38.440 --> 08:41.200]  We were lucky enough to have a man on the ground filming.
[08:41.200 --> 08:48.560]  And as you can see, this is a plain load of mail-in ballots landing in Arizona last night.
[08:48.560 --> 08:51.280]  So they got a lot of counting to do.
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.080]  As you can see here, this is a jumbo jet.
[08:54.080 --> 08:59.760]  They've got 5 million mail-in ballots for Biden loaded up on that C-5.
[08:59.760 --> 09:00.760]  And so here you go.
[09:00.760 --> 09:01.920]  It's going right to the polling place.
[09:01.920 --> 09:02.920]  There it goes.
[09:02.920 --> 09:03.920]  Maricopa County.
[09:03.920 --> 09:07.520]  They've just discovered another million mail-in ballots for Joe, but that's not it.
[09:07.520 --> 09:09.720]  We have footage from Georgia.
[09:09.720 --> 09:12.080]  This is early last night.
[09:12.080 --> 09:14.240]  Here's footage from Georgia.
[09:14.240 --> 09:15.320]  Another plain load.
[09:15.320 --> 09:16.320]  Look at this.
[09:16.320 --> 09:18.640]  Mail-in ballots arriving in Georgia.
[09:18.640 --> 09:20.640]  It's unbelievable.
[09:20.640 --> 09:27.720]  As you can see here, the plain load of mail-in ballots landing in Fulton County last night.
[09:27.720 --> 09:29.320]  Magically all for Biden.
[09:29.320 --> 09:31.360]  Thank God we were able to get that plain.
[09:31.360 --> 09:32.480]  We also have footage, guys.
[09:32.480 --> 09:34.880]  Can we go to Pennsylvania?
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.200]  This is in Pennsylvania.
[09:36.200 --> 09:37.360]  We have similar footage.
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.760]  As you can see here, they had to go right to the polling place, landing nearly on top
[09:41.760 --> 09:43.320]  of cars on the road.
[09:43.320 --> 09:47.600]  That's how desperate they were to get these ballots to Philadelphia County right there.
[09:47.600 --> 09:48.600]  They're landing.
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.600]  They're going right to the polls.
[09:49.600 --> 09:52.640]  That plane is going to be pulling up right to the polling station in Philadelphia County.
[09:52.640 --> 09:53.640]  That's not it.
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.880]  We've got Wisconsin, guys.
[09:54.880 --> 09:56.480]  Let me see Wisconsin.
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.080]  We've got a plane in Wisconsin.
[09:59.080 --> 10:01.320]  It's just landed right there.
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.320]  So they're going to make sure they've got at least 50,000 more mail-in ballots for Biden.
[10:05.320 --> 10:10.440]  They're going to make sure that Biden takes Wisconsin with a big margin of victory as
[10:10.440 --> 10:11.440]  well.
[10:11.440 --> 10:12.640]  And guys, did we have Michigan too?
[10:12.640 --> 10:14.840]  Did we even catch them in Michigan?
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.200]  Oh, my God, and there it is, folks, the Motor City.
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.760]  Another plain load of mail-in ballots for Biden has landed in Michigan.
[10:24.760 --> 10:32.560]  This footage was actually shot on November 4th, magically, right before Biden won the
[10:32.560 --> 10:33.560]  election there.
[10:33.560 --> 10:37.680]  So wow, that's amazing, isn't it?
[10:37.680 --> 10:38.680]  That's amazing.
[10:38.680 --> 10:41.280]  Of course, that's satire.
[10:41.280 --> 10:43.080]  That's a joke.
[10:43.080 --> 10:49.720]  But it's as real as believing that Biden gets 138 mail-in ballots all for him.
[10:49.720 --> 10:56.360]  It's as real as believing that in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, they'll probably
[10:56.360 --> 10:57.920]  go with North Carolina too.
[10:57.920 --> 11:07.000]  People have to see Biden down all night, losing all night for multiple nights, all week.
[11:07.000 --> 11:16.000]  Biden's behind all week, and then magically, in the dead of night, Biden takes the lead.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.960]  It's the most obvious, most ridiculous thing we've ever seen, but it's the year 2020.
[11:20.960 --> 11:22.880]  So it's not win in Rome anymore.
[11:22.880 --> 11:25.160]  It's win in 2020.
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.480]  Win in 2020, do as the Democrats did.
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.120]  Fake everything.
[11:32.120 --> 11:35.280]  So I mean, what is the most obvious fake job?
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.360]  The fake pandemic, which is over, is the fake pandemic over?
[11:38.360 --> 11:40.080]  I'm not hearing about the pandemic.
[11:40.080 --> 11:41.880]  Is anyone else hearing about it?
[11:41.880 --> 11:42.880]  I'm sorry.
[11:42.880 --> 11:43.880]  Is the pandemic over?
[11:43.880 --> 11:45.320]  Did the health issue become a non-issue now?
[11:45.320 --> 11:46.820]  Are we done with that?
[11:46.820 --> 11:48.840]  Can we take off the face diaper?
[11:48.840 --> 11:51.720]  Can we open up now that the pandemic's not a thing anymore?
[11:51.720 --> 11:52.720]  Or will it be a thing again?
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.200]  Are we just not going to talk about it?
[11:54.200 --> 11:57.400]  Are we just going to not talk about how that thing that ruined all of our lives is just
[11:57.400 --> 11:58.400]  not a thing anymore?
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.120]  How are we dealing with that one?
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.200]  We're just going to let that one go, huh?
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.440]  Oh, kind of like we let Obama spying on Trump go, and then all the lies about Trump, and
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.280]  then the Russia hoax, and the impeachment hoax, and then the pandemic hoax.
[12:13.280 --> 12:15.400]  Now the election hoax, we're just going to let this one go, too.
[12:15.400 --> 12:22.840]  We're just going to let these people rape us intellectually, torture us psychologically.
[12:22.840 --> 12:26.120]  I sure hope not.
[12:26.120 --> 12:27.120]  But you know what?
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.360]  Since I'm here in this three minutes, because I'm sure a lot of people are tuning in, and
[12:31.360 --> 12:33.800]  I'll probably address this again on the war room for that audience.
[12:33.800 --> 12:40.600]  But Steve Pachinick has never BS'd me.
[12:40.600 --> 12:42.600]  He has a reputation that's very strong.
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.040]  That's why when he came on the war room yesterday and said that there's a sting operation run
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.800]  against the Democrats with the mail-in ballots, it went mega viral.
[12:49.800 --> 12:53.840]  I'm just going to be fully transparent.
[12:53.840 --> 12:56.520]  Steve Pachinick knows what he's doing.
[12:56.520 --> 13:02.640]  He came on the war room yesterday, and he threw a smoke grenade, and we were able to
[13:02.640 --> 13:04.560]  see where the smoke followed.
[13:04.560 --> 13:06.360]  And you were able to see where the smoke followed.
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.120]  And crazy enough, the smoke went everywhere in case you didn't notice.
[13:10.120 --> 13:17.480]  So I mean, you know, for info wars being banned, boy, we sure know how to control a narrative,
[13:17.480 --> 13:19.480]  don't we?
[13:19.480 --> 13:25.480]  And then Alex Jones lands in Arizona and dominates Twitter.
[13:25.480 --> 13:30.640]  So for info wars being banned, and Steve Pachinick coming in on Skype from his kitchen in a floral
[13:30.640 --> 13:35.280]  shirt, boy, looking pretty good here, aren't we?
[13:35.280 --> 13:37.160]  Thanks to you.
[13:37.160 --> 13:41.960]  That's us, all of us, the crew, me, Alex Jones, everybody.
[13:41.960 --> 13:42.960]  But the smoke went everywhere.
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.960]  Did you notice that?
[13:45.960 --> 13:52.600]  Now, part of that is just total proof that everyone's listening to info wars every day,
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.760]  whether they want to admit it or not.
[13:53.760 --> 14:02.560]  The other point of that is that what Steve Pachinick said on the air yesterday is totally
[14:02.560 --> 14:04.920]  true.
[14:04.920 --> 14:07.720]  It's not even really a secret.
[14:07.720 --> 14:13.680]  If there was any secret that Dr. Pachinick said, it was that he has people who will just
[14:13.680 --> 14:18.920]  say, you know, he's got intelligence sources, and they're saying that this is a sting operation
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.760]  and they use the mail-in ballots and they've been caught.
[14:23.760 --> 14:31.000]  Now everybody is so desperate for answer to election night, they took that notion and
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.640]  buried it and like planted a seed and wanted it to be like a huge tree overnight.
[14:37.640 --> 14:44.240]  Now personally, look again, yes, you can go look it up, the USPS and the Department of
[14:44.240 --> 14:50.280]  Homeland Security had encrypted ballots with the mail-in ballots as a cybersecurity measure.
[14:50.280 --> 14:53.720]  Call it a watermark, call it blockchain, call it whatever you want, it doesn't matter.
[14:53.720 --> 14:55.000]  They did set that up.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.800]  That is a real thing.
[14:56.800 --> 14:59.000]  Is that going to be used to stop voter fraud?
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Absolutely.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.520]  That's why they set it up.
[15:01.520 --> 15:03.240]  What kind of technology is involved?
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.320]  Well, maybe they're being fully transparent, maybe not.
[15:07.320 --> 15:14.040]  So if you're looking for some sort of a solace in that segment, if you're looking for solace
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.920]  in the notion that all these people are going to be caught and arrested because of the mail-in
[15:18.920 --> 15:24.920]  ballot fraud, I personally don't believe that's going to be the case.
[15:24.920 --> 15:29.120]  And I looked into this last night because everyone and their mom was blowing me up about
[15:29.120 --> 15:30.120]  it.
[15:30.120 --> 15:36.440]  And so I personally think, yes, will there be voter fraud exposed from the mail-in ballots?
[15:36.440 --> 15:37.440]  Absolutely.
[15:37.440 --> 15:38.440]  Will it lead to arrests?
[15:38.440 --> 15:39.440]  I don't think so.
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.560]  Will it be enough to stop this steal?
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.160]  No.
[15:46.160 --> 15:47.160]  And that's the key.
[15:47.160 --> 15:52.000]  There are so many angles to this steal, they all have to be attacked.
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.080]  Dead people voting, fake mail-in ballots, ballots flipping on election day in the machine,
[15:58.080 --> 16:10.160]  it's all an issue.
[16:10.160 --> 16:14.640]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone.
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.000]  Simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.260]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[16:21.260 --> 16:24.760]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home screen.
[16:24.760 --> 16:26.840]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[16:26.840 --> 16:29.120]  I suggest Band.video.
[16:29.120 --> 16:33.720]  You will now have Band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[16:33.720 --> 16:34.720]  to stop it.
[16:34.720 --> 16:38.840]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.040]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.040]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.880]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[16:50.880 --> 16:59.440]  Be sure and share Band.video.
[16:59.440 --> 17:02.800]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[17:02.800 --> 17:07.120]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.840]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.320]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.120]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.840]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.840]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[17:32.840 --> 17:39.480]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[17:39.480 --> 17:44.080]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[17:44.080 --> 17:49.880]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[17:49.880 --> 17:52.680]  facts that pertain to reality.
[17:52.680 --> 18:02.320]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[18:02.320 --> 18:17.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:17.760 --> 18:33.320]  My friends, Alex Jones here on the road, I am in Phoenix, Arizona, and I have been contacted
[18:33.320 --> 18:34.320]  by the highest levels of the White House this morning.
[18:34.320 --> 18:37.960]  And I'm riding along with folks from the State Department right here in the car.
[18:37.960 --> 18:41.400]  And when I tell you that, I just want you to know that we're giving you, as always,
[18:41.400 --> 18:44.040]  the inside scoop on what's happening.
[18:44.040 --> 18:49.960]  That's why we were able to predict with exact precision what was coming down.
[18:49.960 --> 18:58.480]  We have seen an orchestrated, communist, Chinese-funded, DNC-directed attempted coup against the country.
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.080]  Even a Biden had actually won this election and had done it through verified mountains
[19:04.080 --> 19:11.480]  of fraud and law-breaking by the governors of Pennsylvania and other states.
[19:11.480 --> 19:15.120]  And even if the machines hadn't been run by George Soros and the Carlaw Group in Georgia
[19:15.120 --> 19:19.320]  and in Arizona, and we have all the proof of that coming up, even if he'd have won
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.960]  this election fair and square, you can't be a communist Chinese agent with recordings
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.720]  of Hunter Biden saying, I take my orders from the head of Chinese intelligence.
[19:28.720 --> 19:29.760]  This is the end of the country.
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.800]  I have been there when grandparents died in front of me.
[19:33.800 --> 19:36.480]  I've been there when I see people run over and killed.
[19:36.480 --> 19:40.760]  I've been there with three guys who are breaking my bones, and I felt wonderful compared to
[19:40.760 --> 19:41.760]  this.
[19:41.760 --> 19:42.760]  And I'm serious.
[19:42.760 --> 19:48.280]  There is nothing in my life this horrible, okay?
[19:48.280 --> 19:52.840]  This must be what it's like to watch your kid die or something, because this is a 240-something-year-old
[19:52.840 --> 19:58.680]  great country, and it's being stolen from us by a bunch of absolutely demonic filth.
[19:58.680 --> 20:02.440]  And then I see these laughing, gibbering leftists on the streets, flipping me off and stuff,
[20:02.440 --> 20:05.760]  saying, I don't know, Trump's losing, we're winning, when these idiots are having their
[20:05.760 --> 20:09.800]  whole birthright and everything destroyed and taken away from them.
[20:09.800 --> 20:13.400]  And the millions of Americans that have fought and died for this country and all of their
[20:13.400 --> 20:17.080]  chivalrys being flushed down a giant stinking toilet.
[20:17.080 --> 20:22.960]  And I'm also sick because I love my children and I love this country, but I'm not sure
[20:22.960 --> 20:25.680]  the American people are recoverable.
[20:25.680 --> 20:27.240]  We've already killed 62 million babies.
[20:27.240 --> 20:29.400]  We already do all these horrible things.
[20:29.400 --> 20:33.520]  We have an outside overthrow of our government, our overthrow of our local police.
[20:33.520 --> 20:35.680]  All of this is unfolding.
[20:35.680 --> 20:42.840]  All evil is taking place right now, and we need to see a giant rejection of this.
[20:42.840 --> 20:52.760]  When Pelosi says that Trump is an internal enemy, that is a total projection.
[20:52.760 --> 20:53.760]  Trump is a great patriot.
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.280]  He saw the steel coming.
[20:55.280 --> 20:59.480]  He laid it out perfectly, but even his own party pulled back from him because they're
[20:59.480 --> 21:01.000]  all hedging your bets.
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.640]  They don't hedge your bets in a existential existence war with a communist country that
[21:07.640 --> 21:11.880]  owns your debt and owns Hollywood and has about a third of the population literally
[21:11.880 --> 21:12.880]  worshiping them.
[21:12.880 --> 21:15.240]  I know Democrats.
[21:15.240 --> 21:21.520]  We have crew members at the office who have sisters that literally worship GG Ping.
[21:21.520 --> 21:24.200]  They've never been to China.
[21:24.200 --> 21:25.880]  They've never been to China.
[21:25.880 --> 21:29.880]  They're not communist Chinese.
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.120]  They just think GG Ping is the good guy.
[21:33.120 --> 21:36.320]  And so we're going to stay here a few minutes and we're going to go out.
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.320]  So I'm here.
[21:37.320 --> 21:43.960]  I'm about to be at the counting center, and I'm going to skype in with video from there.
[21:43.960 --> 21:47.360]  The problem is we're going to get so mobbed, it may be hard to actually do it out there.
[21:47.360 --> 21:50.040]  I know Ellen's got some clips of last night that were pretty powerful.
[21:50.040 --> 21:54.280]  And when I came down here and I said the things I said last night, I absolutely meant it.
[21:54.280 --> 21:55.440]  We are under attack.
[21:55.440 --> 21:56.440]  We are being taken over.
[21:56.440 --> 21:59.400]  This is 21st century asymmetrical warfare.
[21:59.400 --> 22:06.200]  And a lot of people I've talked to go, well, at least if the Democrats get in, at least
[22:06.200 --> 22:09.240]  if the Democrats get in, maybe they'll leave us alone and let us live again.
[22:09.240 --> 22:13.240]  No, they're not giving you your football and your Miller beer and your pizza and your hot
[22:13.240 --> 22:14.240]  dogs, folks.
[22:14.240 --> 22:15.720]  They're going to continue the lockdown.
[22:15.720 --> 22:16.720]  They're going to bankrupt the country.
[22:16.720 --> 22:17.720]  They're going to suck it.
[22:17.720 --> 22:22.160]  This has been a long-term agenda to deindustrialize us and ship our jobs overseas.
[22:22.160 --> 22:25.920]  This has been a process of conquering us culturally, spiritually.
[22:25.920 --> 22:28.960]  And this is it, okay?
[22:28.960 --> 22:30.160]  This is an absolute program.
[22:30.160 --> 22:38.160]  So if we don't defeat this now, it's only going to get worse.
[22:38.160 --> 22:39.640]  And so I don't want to die.
[22:39.640 --> 22:41.000]  I don't want to get in the fight.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.560]  I don't want to have to lead stuff.
[22:42.560 --> 22:46.840]  I'm just telling you I'm physically sick right now because everybody's got to have the discussion
[22:46.840 --> 22:47.840]  about what we're going to do.
[22:47.840 --> 22:48.840]  Are you going to leave the country?
[22:48.840 --> 22:49.840]  Because there's nowhere to run.
[22:49.840 --> 22:50.840]  Are you going to roll over?
[22:50.840 --> 22:53.640]  Are you going to join the chai comms and the soulless globalists?
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.560]  Because when everybody sells out, everybody loses.
[22:57.560 --> 23:00.760]  All these idiots think they're about to get a free ride and free houses and free cars
[23:00.760 --> 23:04.400]  and free health care and free education and a guaranteed monthly income.
[23:04.400 --> 23:09.280]  Yeah, you'll have money like Venezuela, but they won't buy you anything.
[23:09.280 --> 23:10.480]  This is a tried and true formula.
[23:10.480 --> 23:14.040]  Yes, why do they run a communist formula when they're actually billionaire bankers?
[23:14.040 --> 23:17.760]  Because it works on the spoiled countries that have been wealthy.
[23:17.760 --> 23:19.560]  Because enough of the public becomes lazy.
[23:19.560 --> 23:20.560]  They don't want to work.
[23:20.560 --> 23:21.560]  They don't have any dreams.
[23:21.560 --> 23:24.240]  And they just want to think, oh, I can have the yacht.
[23:24.240 --> 23:25.920]  I can have the private jet.
[23:25.920 --> 23:26.920]  I can have all that.
[23:26.920 --> 23:32.560]  If I just vote in communist, no, it's capitalism and freedom that produces the bass boat and
[23:32.560 --> 23:36.440]  your four bedroom house and the pool in the backyard and the vacations work in your normal
[23:36.440 --> 23:37.440]  job.
[23:37.440 --> 23:38.680]  You don't get that a communist country.
[23:38.680 --> 23:39.680]  You get slavery.
[23:39.680 --> 23:40.680]  They want you poor.
[23:40.680 --> 23:41.680]  They want you stupid.
[23:41.680 --> 23:42.680]  They hate you.
[23:42.680 --> 23:43.680]  It's the ideology.
[23:43.680 --> 23:50.120]  And to watch people really cut their own nose off despite their face and to have this invincible
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.120]  ignorance is disgusting.
[23:51.120 --> 23:52.720]  But here's what I'm going to tell you right now.
[23:52.720 --> 23:56.360]  This is sure as the sun came up this morning.
[23:56.360 --> 23:58.920]  President Trump is going to fight this in the courts.
[23:58.920 --> 23:59.920]  He's 100% right.
[23:59.920 --> 24:01.800]  They violated the law in Georgia.
[24:01.800 --> 24:04.480]  They violated the law in Nevada.
[24:04.480 --> 24:06.440]  They violated the law in Arizona.
[24:06.440 --> 24:08.640]  They violated the law in Pennsylvania.
[24:08.640 --> 24:10.960]  They violated it all and they did it right in front of everybody.
[24:10.960 --> 24:12.240]  That's what Pelosi said last week.
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.640]  She said, it doesn't matter what happens with this thing coming up, the election.
[24:15.640 --> 24:21.160]  It doesn't matter this thing, he will be installed.
[24:21.160 --> 24:22.160]  He will be put in.
[24:22.160 --> 24:25.000]  I played that clip probably 20 times.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.080]  But because these are criminals, they want to brag to all their people that they're
[24:29.080 --> 24:33.920]  competent and that they're going to win so that they'll roll in in Michigan where they
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.200]  violated the laws even more than Pennsylvania.
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.560]  With what looks like, I know the look and the cut of them, looks like Chinese intelligence
[24:41.560 --> 24:42.560]  operatives.
[24:42.560 --> 24:43.560]  They got that look.
[24:43.560 --> 24:45.560]  It's not an arrogant look.
[24:45.560 --> 24:49.440]  It's the look of somebody better do this or they're dead, bringing those damn ballot
[24:49.440 --> 24:51.440]  boxes in at 4 a.m.
[24:51.440 --> 24:55.160]  We've got Chinese freaking communists crawling all over us, man.
[24:55.160 --> 25:01.800]  So you have fleas all over you and it's just so pathetic that America thought it was invincible
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.560]  and so this is now happening to us and I'm not a Machiavellian person, but I can look
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.480]  into the Machiavellian mindset as good as anybody is Machiavellian and I can tell you
[25:11.480 --> 25:14.400]  the globalists have sowed the seeds of their destruction.
[25:14.400 --> 25:17.880]  They're never going to get away with this, but it's going to cause giant wars, huge
[25:17.880 --> 25:23.760]  revolutions, and at the end of it Bill Gates and Bezos and all these megalomaniacs are
[25:23.760 --> 25:25.840]  going to end up paying for it.
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.920]  And that's the victory here is identifying those guys and who the real kingpins are over
[25:29.920 --> 25:30.920]  the Communist Party China.
[25:30.920 --> 25:36.920]  That's really multinational corporations, Jane Baker III and that in Houston.
[25:36.920 --> 25:45.600]  He holds the keys to the Bushes and to Kissinger that actually set up China and opened it up.
[25:45.600 --> 25:48.480]  And again, they've all written books about this, they've written New York Times articles.
[25:48.480 --> 25:51.320]  That's what's frustrating is we know all this.
[25:51.320 --> 25:52.800]  This is not my opinion.
[25:52.800 --> 25:59.600]  Okay, Bill Gates's new vaccine is a nanotech recombinant DNA reprogramming system that
[25:59.600 --> 26:02.200]  makes you a GMO creature that reprograms your cells.
[26:02.200 --> 26:03.600]  I'm outside doing a video on it.
[26:03.600 --> 26:06.400]  So Yuppie walks by laughing at me saying I'm crazy.
[26:06.400 --> 26:10.640]  And then two minutes later, a bus drives by saying nanotech will cure your cancer.
[26:10.640 --> 26:12.400]  Take the nanotech vaccine.
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.640]  The Prime Minister of England says soon we'll all be injected with nanotech.
[26:16.640 --> 26:19.080]  I mean, this is a cult people.
[26:19.080 --> 26:20.080]  It's the year 2020.
[26:20.080 --> 26:21.600]  It's a science fiction movie.
[26:21.600 --> 26:22.600]  It's a nightmare.
[26:22.600 --> 26:23.600]  It's an dystopia.
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.600]  It's real.
[26:24.600 --> 26:25.600]  And I'm not trying to scare you.
[26:25.600 --> 26:29.640]  I'm trying to tell you submission to this is death.
[26:29.640 --> 26:30.960]  They think you're weak.
[26:30.960 --> 26:32.960]  They think you're soft.
[26:32.960 --> 26:36.120]  They've pushed out the warriors and the defender class in America.
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.360]  They brought in ruthless corporations that absolutely hate your ass.
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.680]  And so you better get that through your heads and you better understand you don't have any
[26:45.680 --> 26:48.760]  future if you do not realize how much trouble you're in.
[26:48.760 --> 26:50.520]  I know I sounded dystopic all these years.
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.640]  I know I sounded crazy, but I knew it was all going to unfold because these people have
[26:54.640 --> 26:57.960]  done every damn thing they say they're going to do.
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.360]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper.
[27:03.360 --> 27:05.320]  And it's true.
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.840]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even of what they're talking about
[27:09.840 --> 27:12.480]  is important, people tend to tune it out.
[27:12.480 --> 27:13.480]  You know why I know that?
[27:13.480 --> 27:15.960]  Because I'm Alex Jones.
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.800]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order.
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.480]  And I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, start the third world and then
[27:25.480 --> 27:27.480]  enslave the first world.
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.440]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect.
[27:32.440 --> 27:37.040]  But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way where you get
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.720]  people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[27:40.720 --> 27:46.240]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[27:46.240 --> 27:50.280]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[27:50.280 --> 27:52.000]  So this is live and death.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.760]  Please share infowars.com and band our video and watch our live election coverage.

[29:01.200 --> 29:10.440]  The days of hell, the nightmare is here, 79 days of hell has begun.
[29:10.440 --> 29:16.720]  Multinational corporations, the mainstream media apparatus, and social media tech giants
[29:16.720 --> 29:23.120]  are all now being deployed by the archaic, inbred, crooked establishment to interfere
[29:23.120 --> 29:30.080]  with the 2020 US elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump, and
[29:30.080 --> 29:36.960]  install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet, Joe Biden, along with
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.040]  rabid radical hag, Kamala Harris.
[29:41.040 --> 29:49.360]  Keep your heads on a swivel, and tune in to 79days.news for tomorrow's news today.
[29:49.360 --> 30:00.200]  79days.news, America's last stand, 79days.news.
[30:00.200 --> 30:30.040]  We are back live, we are back live, yesterday, I got a wild hair and I was talking to
[30:30.040 --> 30:38.840]  the folks in the White House as well and they said, yeah, you really need to get out to
[30:38.840 --> 30:39.840]  one of these events.
[30:39.840 --> 30:43.480]  They talked about Pennsylvania, they talked about Arizona, they talked about them all,
[30:43.480 --> 30:46.640]  so I decided to come to Arizona, and I was great seeing the great crowd that was there.
[30:46.640 --> 30:50.840]  I'm about to be there again, you know, I'm back live, I'm going to handle the condo
[30:50.840 --> 30:56.080]  in shorter here in just a few minutes, but all the leftist media put out the clips of
[30:56.080 --> 30:57.720]  some of what I said in my speeches.
[30:57.720 --> 31:02.280]  They edited out why I was saying Bill Gates is a criminal or why Fauci is a criminal, how
[31:02.280 --> 31:08.040]  they run the Wuhan lab, how even Newsweek reported that, how it was all a Chinese Psyop, and
[31:08.040 --> 31:10.760]  how it creates this police state by making assault suspects.
[31:10.760 --> 31:14.480]  They edited that out, but they played me simply saying we're going to dig like Hitler, Bill
[31:14.480 --> 31:18.360]  Gates and all these people out of their bunkers of it, and that they're the ones, they're
[31:18.360 --> 31:20.440]  the enemy and we shouldn't be killing each other.
[31:20.440 --> 31:23.080]  I don't want to kill them either, I just want them to know that when they come in force
[31:23.080 --> 31:28.440]  inoculations, they're trying to kill our economy, that we understand that they are the problem
[31:28.440 --> 31:31.800]  and that we're standing up to them and that we're fighting back.
[31:31.800 --> 31:34.720]  And because they are assaulting us, they're assaulting our economy, they put us under
[31:34.720 --> 31:35.720]  martial law.
[31:35.720 --> 31:39.400]  They're trying to overthrow and kill the local police, so they submit and bow to them.
[31:39.400 --> 31:42.080]  This is a classic takeover with a high-tech overlay.
[31:42.080 --> 31:47.760]  So I got into textbooks in military history when I was a kid because the books were around
[31:47.760 --> 31:50.800]  the house, and as soon as I started reading them, whether it was Julius Caesar's Battle
[31:50.800 --> 31:57.560]  for Gold, he wrote 2,000 years ago, or whether it was Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, I learned
[31:57.560 --> 32:00.320]  about how these people actually think.
[32:00.320 --> 32:06.320]  And when you're looking at the modern context, it's the nastiest, most evil thing in history.
[32:06.320 --> 32:11.680]  I mean, this is, if there's cancer, if a political system can be cancer, this is like the worst
[32:11.680 --> 32:14.560]  brain cancer or bone cancer or lung cancer.
[32:14.560 --> 32:16.480]  I mean, the nastiest stuff that kills you like in a week.
[32:16.480 --> 32:19.840]  I mean, this is, and I'm only telling you this folks because it's not going to be like
[32:19.840 --> 32:21.040]  business as usual.
[32:21.040 --> 32:22.400]  You think the lockdown is going to end?
[32:22.400 --> 32:23.400]  It's going to get worse.
[32:23.400 --> 32:25.120]  They're going to release real viruses now.
[32:25.120 --> 32:30.400]  I mean, their playbook, I told you two months before Bill Gates said it, that COVID is a
[32:30.400 --> 32:35.640]  drill with a gain-of-function bio-weapon that only kills those that are deficient, but that
[32:35.640 --> 32:39.840]  spreads very rapidly and then reinfects, and that there's no antibodies for it because
[32:39.840 --> 32:43.720]  it's a cold bug, which they've never been able to produce, antibodies and vaccines
[32:43.720 --> 32:44.720]  that work.
[32:44.720 --> 32:46.720]  That's the literature.
[32:46.720 --> 32:47.720]  And they admitted that later.
[32:47.720 --> 32:50.680]  The next one on TV, and he said, on Colbert, he said, this is just a drill.
[32:50.680 --> 32:51.680]  The real attacks coming.
[32:51.680 --> 32:53.680]  Terrorists are going to kill millions of people.
[32:53.680 --> 32:55.480]  Well, who's the terrorist?
[32:55.480 --> 32:56.480]  Who wants it?
[32:56.480 --> 32:57.480]  He populated.
[32:57.480 --> 32:58.480]  It's Bill Gates.
[32:58.480 --> 32:59.480]  So he's assaulting me.
[32:59.480 --> 33:01.480]  I don't want to attack Bill Gates.
[33:01.480 --> 33:02.960]  He finances the lawsuits against us.
[33:02.960 --> 33:03.960]  The dirty tricks.
[33:03.960 --> 33:04.960]  Bill Gates is a killer.
[33:04.960 --> 33:06.440]  His dad's a killer.
[33:06.440 --> 33:09.080]  His dad ran the secret army eugenics operations.
[33:09.080 --> 33:11.520]  These people don't play games, okay?
[33:11.520 --> 33:17.560]  They are the bad embeds inside our country that are nasty, evil, corrupt sons of bitches.
[33:17.560 --> 33:19.320]  It's time to wake up.
[33:19.320 --> 33:20.320]  It's time to oppose.
[33:20.320 --> 33:23.520]  It's time to say no and realize this is 21st century war.
[33:23.520 --> 33:25.040]  Now, let me get to these points.
[33:25.040 --> 33:28.520]  Here's a clip from last night where I was laying out 1776 Worldwide.
[33:28.520 --> 33:42.680]  We don't know how this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe
[33:42.680 --> 33:44.680]  they got one.
[33:44.680 --> 33:54.680]  If they want to fight, they better believe we're a grown one, and we're going to win.
[33:54.680 --> 33:59.280]  We're not going to fight your little bet-handing as you can see from scumbag.
[33:59.280 --> 34:04.480]  We're going to take on the Sauroses and the Thaisoses and the Gates.
[34:04.480 --> 34:09.680]  We're going to take it directly to those scumbag, Nazi bastards that thought they'd kill this
[34:09.680 --> 34:12.680]  country just like we are.
[34:12.680 --> 34:21.680]  They'll be in their time gap, they will be hiding, they will pay, they will be destroyed
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.680]  because America is rising.
[34:26.680 --> 34:32.680]  1776 is the answer to 1984.
[34:32.680 --> 34:33.680]  1776.
[34:33.680 --> 34:34.680]  1776.
[34:34.680 --> 34:35.680]  1776.
[34:35.680 --> 34:36.680]  1776.
[34:36.680 --> 34:37.680]  1776.
[34:37.680 --> 34:38.680]  1776.
[34:38.680 --> 34:39.680]  1776.
[34:39.680 --> 34:46.680]  1776.
[34:46.680 --> 34:47.680]  1776.
[34:47.680 --> 34:48.680]  Okay folks.
[34:48.680 --> 34:49.680]  So here we are.
[34:49.680 --> 34:50.680]  They see us as chumps.
[34:50.680 --> 34:51.680]  They see us as weak.
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.680]  The Globalists are making their move against us.
[34:52.680 --> 34:54.680]  It's happening right now.
[34:54.680 --> 34:56.280]  And our message to the White House is this.
[34:56.280 --> 34:58.080]  We love you President Trump.
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.920]  We understand what you took on.
[34:59.920 --> 35:01.660]  We sucker punched the enemy four years ago.
[35:01.660 --> 35:03.400]  Now they've mobilized for four years.
[35:03.400 --> 35:04.600]  They've run these scams.
[35:04.600 --> 35:06.440]  They're going to try to drive the president from office now.
[35:06.440 --> 35:08.500]  Overman's saying kill him.
[35:08.500 --> 35:09.500]  Execute him.
[35:09.500 --> 35:17.760]  It's so evil and we must stand against these people, we must resist, and we must pray to
[35:17.760 --> 35:25.660]  God to divinely expose all their works of corruption and evil, which is happening.
[35:25.660 --> 35:32.180]  Massive news is coming out of people with ballots for Trump-hidden stealing votes.
[35:32.180 --> 35:33.180]  You've all seen it.
[35:33.180 --> 35:36.220]  It's so much of it that made my head spin today.
[35:36.220 --> 35:42.540]  On Facebook, Twitter, Google, they all block those and call it election meddling because
[35:42.540 --> 35:45.420]  it will defeat them.
[35:45.420 --> 35:47.180]  It will crush them.
[35:47.180 --> 35:53.540]  It will prove their fraud and they can't have that.
[35:53.540 --> 35:54.540]  Look at Congress.
[35:54.540 --> 35:58.780]  You let them censor everybody else, now the president, and now they're censoring poll watchers
[35:58.780 --> 36:03.020]  that show a woman sitting there filling out hundreds of ballots, and there's hours of
[36:03.020 --> 36:04.020]  this footage.
[36:04.020 --> 36:07.260]  My brother-in-law caught it and was almost crying on the phone.
[36:07.260 --> 36:11.140]  A guy at the post office in Austin filling out 50 ballots with the same name and taking
[36:11.140 --> 36:13.540]  pictures of himself with them, and the clerks were taking them.
[36:13.540 --> 36:18.660]  They were obviously watching her crying, and that's what's going on.
[36:18.660 --> 36:20.180]  So this is the takeover.
[36:20.180 --> 36:22.420]  We have to realize it's a takeover.
[36:22.420 --> 36:23.820]  We have to keep fighting.
[36:23.820 --> 36:24.820]  We can't give up.
[36:24.820 --> 36:30.540]  This is the mainstream media bought by multinational corporations that set up China as a slave
[36:30.540 --> 36:32.980]  colony, and now they're going to set up America as a slave colony.
[36:32.980 --> 36:40.460]  I talked to the highest levels of the White House, contacted me this morning.
[36:40.460 --> 36:41.980]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[36:41.980 --> 36:44.860]  The highest levels of the White House, that's what Trump's doing.
[36:44.860 --> 36:46.740]  That's what his son's doing.
[36:46.740 --> 36:54.260]  That's what his people are doing, is they are on the phone, and I'm going to leave it
[36:54.260 --> 36:55.260]  at that.
[36:55.260 --> 36:56.260]  I've got a mission I'm going to carry out.
[36:56.260 --> 37:00.740]  I'm dealing with Soros and the voting machines, a lot of the things that are going to be breaking.
[37:00.740 --> 37:03.220]  I don't know why I forgot about Soros being involved with the voting machines in the key
[37:03.220 --> 37:07.260]  states, but a certain individual reminded me of it and sent me a bunch of links.
[37:07.260 --> 37:09.140]  We appreciate them reaching out.
[37:09.140 --> 37:15.580]  We appreciate, really appreciate those folks, and we're going to execute.
[37:15.580 --> 37:17.860]  We're going to carry out the operations peacefully.
[37:17.860 --> 37:21.500]  We're going to defeat the globalists together, and you see the understanding that we're entering
[37:21.500 --> 37:23.500]  the season of them assassinating our president.
[37:23.500 --> 37:25.500]  It needs to be very, very careful.
[37:25.500 --> 37:26.820]  That's why they're calling for him to be drugged out.
[37:26.820 --> 37:28.620]  That's why Pelosi said the military will drag him out.
[37:28.620 --> 37:32.820]  That's why the Clintons are also confident, because they were perched on top of this country.
[37:32.820 --> 37:34.820]  They stole $3 million from Haiti.
[37:34.820 --> 37:35.820]  They destroyed Serbia.
[37:35.820 --> 37:40.140]  They've gotten away with so much crap, they think they can get away with it again, but
[37:40.140 --> 37:42.860]  now the world's watching them, and now we're fighting back.
[37:42.860 --> 37:45.900]  Even more dirt's going to come out of the Bidens and the Clintons and the Obamas and
[37:45.900 --> 37:46.900]  all of them.
[37:46.900 --> 37:51.180]  If you think that we're not going to take them down while they take us down, well, I'm
[37:51.180 --> 37:54.220]  Captain Ahab, and they're a movie frickin' dick, or the other way around.
[37:54.220 --> 37:56.460]  The point is, I'm looking for you.
[37:56.460 --> 37:57.460]  You're not looking for me.
[37:57.460 --> 37:58.460]  I'm coming for you.
[37:58.460 --> 37:59.460]  And I'm not going to stop.
[37:59.460 --> 38:00.460]  You understand that?
[38:00.460 --> 38:01.460]  You're going to pay.
[38:01.460 --> 38:02.460]  But violence is not the way.
[38:02.460 --> 38:03.460]  We must defend ourselves, though.
[38:03.460 --> 38:07.460]  It is information warfare, and the truth, and never backing down.
[38:07.460 --> 38:09.460]  So I'll be on later, live, with Owen Troyer.
[38:09.460 --> 38:13.460]  He's about to take over, but here's Pelosi saying Trump is the domestic enemy.
[38:13.460 --> 38:17.460]  When she is the domestic enemy, openly saying she works for communist China, hot red-handed,
[38:17.460 --> 38:18.460]  her disgusting daughter.
[38:18.460 --> 38:22.460]  And then here is the government saying he wants the president killed and murdered or
[38:22.460 --> 38:23.460]  the COVID.
[38:23.460 --> 38:24.460]  It's his fault.
[38:24.460 --> 38:25.460]  When it's Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci.
[38:25.460 --> 38:29.460]  And the Wuhan lab.
[38:29.460 --> 38:30.460]  Here are those videos.
[38:30.460 --> 38:32.460]  And back to Ahab Troyer.
[38:32.460 --> 38:38.500]  So, sadly, instead of crushing the virus, it appears that the Trump administration will
[38:38.500 --> 38:45.460]  use its final moments in office and a desperate last step to destroy every possible protection
[38:45.460 --> 38:48.540]  for American health and well-being.
[38:48.540 --> 38:53.860]  So many people have said to me, and perhaps some of you along the way, what damage do
[38:53.860 --> 39:00.300]  you think that Trump will do between losing the election and the swearing, the inauguration
[39:00.300 --> 39:02.940]  of Joe Biden?
[39:02.940 --> 39:07.220]  Maybe you didn't phrase it quite that way, but that's how I heard it.
[39:07.220 --> 39:13.940]  And we knew that he would be up to mischief, separate and apart from trying to destroy
[39:13.940 --> 39:18.980]  the credibility of our elections, which we criticize other nations for doing.
[39:18.980 --> 39:24.260]  And now all enemies, foreign and domestic, making assault on our elections, well, we
[39:24.260 --> 39:25.580]  have one domestic.
[39:25.580 --> 39:34.100]  But apart from that, on the policy side, which is why we are here, people asked that question.
[39:34.100 --> 39:36.980]  What will he try to do that is harmful?
[39:36.980 --> 39:44.140]  And this week, they showed their hand, we had suspicions of it, but didn't speak publicly
[39:44.140 --> 39:45.140]  about it.
[39:45.140 --> 39:46.660]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break now.
[39:46.660 --> 39:53.300]  But boy, if you're half as mad as I am, I mean, how can we take people like Pelosi
[39:53.300 --> 39:56.300]  another week, let alone another year or two?
[39:56.300 --> 40:00.780]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that
[40:00.780 --> 40:01.780]  will pay them.
[40:01.780 --> 40:02.780]  It's that simple.
[40:02.780 --> 40:05.980]  They use our open free society against us.
[40:05.980 --> 40:09.300]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess
[40:09.300 --> 40:10.300]  over it.
[40:10.300 --> 40:15.060]  They see he's a liar on purpose, even though our success rate, our accuracy rate is way,
[40:15.060 --> 40:16.060]  way better than theirs.
[40:16.060 --> 40:17.060]  They try to tell the truth.
[40:17.060 --> 40:18.060]  They try to lie.
[40:18.060 --> 40:19.060]  They try to deceive.
[40:19.060 --> 40:24.180]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate, how they manipulate,
[40:24.180 --> 40:26.780]  how they bamboozle the public.
[40:26.780 --> 40:30.860]  I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and to not believe what they're told in the
[40:30.860 --> 40:31.860]  face.
[40:31.860 --> 40:36.500]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[40:36.500 --> 40:40.780]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting
[40:40.780 --> 40:47.020]  media is evil and is a conspiracy theory, but again, on its face, that is a fraud.
[40:47.020 --> 40:51.020]  Question everything, question info wars, add your own research to it and then decide what
[40:51.020 --> 40:54.100]  you're going to promote to others and what news sources are accurate.
[40:54.100 --> 40:57.140]  I believe info wars is the best source out there.
[40:57.140 --> 41:01.500]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when
[41:01.500 --> 41:02.500]  it comes to the show?
[41:02.500 --> 41:07.060]  And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what
[41:07.060 --> 41:12.140]  the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying developed the hypothesis that
[41:12.140 --> 41:16.580]  the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then
[41:16.580 --> 41:19.660]  make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[41:19.660 --> 41:24.780]  Well, now China owns the debt now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[41:24.780 --> 41:29.460]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[41:29.460 --> 41:34.300]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus
[41:34.300 --> 41:35.300]  on that issue.
[41:35.300 --> 41:39.180]  They did and you focused on it by supporting us at info wars.
[41:39.180 --> 41:43.660]  So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[41:43.660 --> 41:47.660]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[41:47.660 --> 41:50.260]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.

[41:52.260 --> 42:22.220]  I'm going to thank you for your support.
[42:53.260 --> 43:02.500]  Thank you all for tuning in introducing info wars life, pure turmeric extract.
[43:02.500 --> 43:07.140]  This is taken under the tongue, it is pure turmeric.
[43:07.140 --> 43:12.140]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[43:12.140 --> 43:16.500]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[43:16.500 --> 43:20.660]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[43:20.660 --> 43:22.220]  then absorbed by the stomach.
[43:22.220 --> 43:24.820]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[43:24.820 --> 43:29.180]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[43:29.180 --> 43:30.180]  reviews.
[43:30.180 --> 43:32.100]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[43:32.100 --> 43:35.580]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies, some like bodies better.
[43:35.580 --> 43:40.140]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the
[43:40.140 --> 43:41.140]  info war.

[44:01.220 --> 44:18.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[44:18.580 --> 44:21.820]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[44:21.820 --> 44:24.860]  Last segment of this first hour, Alex Jones is going to be rejoining us shortly.
[44:24.860 --> 44:30.380]  He is on a mission in Arizona right now trying to stop the steal.
[44:30.380 --> 44:32.780]  We've got Pelosi declaring Trump the enemy.
[44:32.780 --> 44:34.900]  We've got Pelosi declaring Biden the victory.
[44:34.900 --> 44:40.980]  We've got Keith Olderman and other liberals and media declaring that Trump and Trump supporters
[44:40.980 --> 44:41.980]  be arrested.
[44:41.980 --> 44:48.540]  I'm about to go to those clips real quick, but I want to explain something.
[44:48.540 --> 44:53.220]  Before we hear from the real domestic enemy, Nancy Pelosi, and then a real nut job who
[44:53.220 --> 44:58.900]  belongs in the mental institution, Keith Olderman.
[44:58.900 --> 45:12.780]  In March and April, when they started this fake pandemic, who was the stalwart?
[45:12.780 --> 45:13.900]  Who was the rock?
[45:13.900 --> 45:17.940]  Who was the leading edge in saying this is a fake pandemic?
[45:17.940 --> 45:18.940]  This is a scam.
[45:18.940 --> 45:20.780]  This is an economic weapon.
[45:20.780 --> 45:22.020]  We cannot shut down.
[45:22.020 --> 45:23.260]  We cannot lock down.
[45:23.260 --> 45:25.260]  We cannot wear these masks.
[45:25.260 --> 45:26.940]  Who was that lone voice in the wilderness?
[45:26.940 --> 45:29.940]  It was us right here at info wars.
[45:29.940 --> 45:32.860]  Now, why am I saying this?
[45:32.860 --> 45:33.860]  This isn't the story of the day.
[45:33.860 --> 45:45.260]  No, it is because you see here at info wars, we have zero tolerance for bullshit.
[45:45.260 --> 45:50.180]  And we knew COVID was BS back in March.
[45:50.180 --> 45:53.500]  And so I just want to be clear about something here because I'm pissed.
[45:53.500 --> 45:54.500]  I'm fighting mad.
[45:54.500 --> 46:00.860]  And so are you, but all those people in the media who may or may not be raising a stink
[46:00.860 --> 46:06.820]  about the steel today and the mail-in ballots today, all those people, you caused this when
[46:06.820 --> 46:09.820]  you went along with the COVID BS.
[46:09.820 --> 46:14.420]  So if you're pissed about this steel and you're pissed about the mail-in ballots, you better
[46:14.420 --> 46:19.660]  look yourself in the mirror and be pissed at yourself for falling for that BS that allowed
[46:19.660 --> 46:21.020]  them to do it.
[46:21.020 --> 46:25.220]  And if we fall for this BS of a Biden victory that I think they're going to claim before
[46:25.220 --> 46:30.540]  the end of the night, then they'll pull their next BS and their next BS and their next BS
[46:30.540 --> 46:34.980]  until we have nothing, nothing.
[46:34.980 --> 46:37.420]  So understand that.
[46:37.420 --> 46:40.620]  This is why I get mad at cuck servatives on TV.
[46:40.620 --> 46:44.860]  This is why I get mad at conservatives who want to fit in on social media and are scared
[46:44.860 --> 46:46.060]  of getting banned.
[46:46.060 --> 46:49.220]  We lost because of you.
[46:49.220 --> 46:51.340]  You fell for the fake pandemic.
[46:51.340 --> 46:55.180]  You told us to wear masks and lock down and accept mail-in ballots.
[46:55.180 --> 46:56.180]  And now here we are.
[46:56.180 --> 46:59.620]  Joe Biden has 90 million votes.
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.620]  So congratulations.
[47:00.620 --> 47:07.720]  Now, here's Nancy Pelosi, the biggest enemy in the house this country's ever seen, declaring
[47:07.720 --> 47:10.860]  Trump the enemy.
[47:10.860 --> 47:16.340]  Oh, sadly, instead of crushing the virus, it appears that the Trump administration will
[47:16.340 --> 47:23.260]  use its final moments in office and a desperate last step to destroy every possible protection
[47:23.260 --> 47:26.380]  for American health and well-being.
[47:26.380 --> 47:31.700]  So many people have said to me, and perhaps some of you along the way, what damage do
[47:31.700 --> 47:38.180]  you think that Trump will do between losing the election and the swearing, the inauguration
[47:38.180 --> 47:40.780]  of Joe Biden?
[47:40.780 --> 47:45.060]  Maybe you didn't phrase it quite that way, but that's how I heard it.
[47:45.060 --> 47:51.780]  And we knew that he would be up to mischief, separate and apart from trying to destroy
[47:51.780 --> 47:57.460]  the credibility of our elections, which we criticize other nations for doing.
[47:57.460 --> 48:06.020]  Trump is up to mischief, guys, Trump, Trump, Trump is up to mischief, Biden, Biden is behind
[48:06.020 --> 48:12.620]  the entire time for weeks, Biden is behind the whole election, Biden is behind in Michigan,
[48:12.620 --> 48:19.820]  in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, and then suitcases, suitcases of ballots
[48:19.820 --> 48:26.460]  come pouring in in the dark of night and Pelosi says, Trump is up to mischief.
[48:26.460 --> 48:30.580]  How do we put up with this for another second?
[48:30.580 --> 48:34.900]  I mean, this is a joke, go back to Pelosi.
[48:34.900 --> 48:42.340]  So we criticize other nations for doing, and now all enemies foreign and domestic making
[48:42.340 --> 48:45.420]  assault on our elections, well, we have one domestic.
[48:45.420 --> 48:53.900]  But apart from that, on the policy side, which is why we are here, people asked that question,
[48:53.900 --> 48:56.780]  what will he try to do that is harmful?
[48:56.780 --> 49:03.940]  And this week, they showed their hand, we had suspicions of it, but things speak publicly
[49:03.940 --> 49:09.340]  about it because until they went public, this week, the Trump administration put forward
[49:09.340 --> 49:16.460]  a radical new rule that would make regulations from the.
[49:16.460 --> 49:22.540]  So there's Nancy Pelosi.
[49:22.540 --> 49:23.540]  This is just unbelievable.
[49:23.540 --> 49:28.420]  They're just signaling to the lowest common denominator intellectually that no Trump
[49:28.420 --> 49:32.980]  is the bad guy, he's the he's the enemy.
[49:32.980 --> 49:36.220]  And they know most Americans don't have a freaking clue what's going on.
[49:36.220 --> 49:40.380]  They know most Americans aren't watching the ballots aren't seeing the magic shift to
[49:40.380 --> 49:41.380]  Biden.
[49:41.380 --> 49:43.900]  They just wake up, turn on their TV, wake up, open their web browser, and then whatever
[49:43.900 --> 49:45.980]  they see, they believe there's no fake news.
[49:45.980 --> 49:46.980]  No one's lying to them.
[49:46.980 --> 49:48.700]  They're completely clueless.
[49:48.700 --> 49:52.260]  They're still in Kansas.
[49:52.260 --> 49:54.260]  So, but it doesn't stop there.
[49:54.260 --> 49:58.740]  Here's Nancy Pelosi declaring Biden the victor, which I predict there might do before the
[49:58.740 --> 50:02.340]  end of the night because Biden now leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia magically too.
[50:02.340 --> 50:05.660]  They just landed two C-130s with 500 billion ballots for Biden.
[50:05.660 --> 50:06.660]  It's magic.
[50:06.660 --> 50:07.660]  He said a world record.
[50:07.660 --> 50:10.100]  Biden has a world record for most votes in any election ever.
[50:10.100 --> 50:11.100]  It's incredible.
[50:11.100 --> 50:13.780]  So here's Pelosi declaring Biden the victor.
[50:13.780 --> 50:16.860]  Good morning, everyone.
[50:16.860 --> 50:19.700]  I wish we weren't wearing masks so we could see.
[50:19.700 --> 50:20.700]  Oh yeah.
[50:20.700 --> 50:21.700]  I'm sure.
[50:21.700 --> 50:23.740]  I'm sure you do, you bimbo.
[50:23.740 --> 50:24.740]  You whore from hell.
[50:24.740 --> 50:32.620]  Joe Biden having the tremendous mandate that he has and that pretty soon the hyphen will
[50:32.620 --> 50:37.460]  be gone from vice president to president-elect Joe Biden.
[50:37.460 --> 50:38.460]  He's not vice president.
[50:38.460 --> 50:45.340]  A happy day for our country because Joe Biden is a unifier because he is determined to bring
[50:45.340 --> 50:49.420]  people together because he respects all points of view.
[50:49.420 --> 50:55.060]  And as he has said, Iran is a Democrat I'll govern as president for all of the people
[50:55.060 --> 50:57.900]  whether they voted for me or not.
[50:57.900 --> 51:08.980]  So I am so officially pleased with the outcome that is imminent and also personally delighted
[51:08.980 --> 51:16.380]  because of the quality and caliber of leadership that Joe Biden will provide.
[51:16.380 --> 51:22.220]  This morning it is clear that the Biden-Harris ticket will win the White House.
[51:22.220 --> 51:27.580]  His election is historic, propelled by the biggest vote ever in the history of our country.
[51:27.580 --> 51:28.580]  Yeah.
[51:28.580 --> 51:29.580]  Do you believe that?
[51:29.580 --> 51:30.580]  73.8 million.
[51:30.580 --> 51:33.220]  A guy who didn't have anybody show up for a rally.
[51:33.220 --> 51:34.540]  The most votes ever received by president-elect Biden.
[51:34.540 --> 51:35.940]  A guy who didn't even have rallies.
[51:35.940 --> 51:38.260]  A ticket in history.
[51:38.260 --> 51:43.300]  President-elect Biden has a strong mandate to lead and it will have a strong Democratic
[51:43.300 --> 51:44.820]  House with him.
[51:44.820 --> 51:45.820]  No, he doesn't.
[51:45.820 --> 51:49.260]  Folks, this is such a fraud.
[51:49.260 --> 51:50.500]  There's so much to explain.
[51:50.500 --> 51:53.860]  I'm going to go to this Keith Olderman clip.
[51:53.860 --> 52:01.500]  Just go play the Keith Olderman clip.
[52:01.500 --> 52:04.460]  This is Olderman versus Trump and I'm not Trump.
[52:04.460 --> 52:09.180]  President Karen is now yelling at the manager, demanding to see the manager's manager.
[52:09.180 --> 52:12.380]  But President Karen has continued to mismanage his own coup.
[52:12.380 --> 52:15.580]  He sent Rudy Giuliani out in public to argue his case.
[52:15.580 --> 52:19.500]  They actually screamed, you think we're stupid, you think we're fools, permitting all of us
[52:19.500 --> 52:23.420]  to pause and say, oh my, yes, we know you're stupid.
[52:23.420 --> 52:24.820]  We know you're fools.
[52:24.820 --> 52:27.940]  We're just wondering if you're wearing pants.
[52:27.940 --> 52:33.660]  The bad news is I think the lame duck president is now pivoting to Trump 2024.
[52:33.660 --> 52:35.100]  For months I've been predicting this.
[52:35.100 --> 52:39.740]  First mention it here in the second of these comments on October 8, when it's finally over,
[52:39.740 --> 52:43.940]  he utters this breathless sentence, I concede and I'm running for president 2024, the rally
[52:43.940 --> 52:45.740]  start next Friday.
[52:45.740 --> 52:49.260]  The following appeared over the bylines of Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman in the New
[52:49.260 --> 52:50.260]  York Times.
[52:50.260 --> 52:54.740]  I have not seen it reported previously, quoting, for months as his chances of being reelected
[52:54.740 --> 52:55.740]  dwindled.
[52:55.740 --> 53:00.420]  Mr. Trump told advisors, sometimes joking, sometimes not, that should he lose, he would
[53:00.420 --> 53:04.180]  promptly announce that he was running again in 2024.
[53:04.180 --> 53:08.700]  Two advisors said they anticipate he will make good on that declaration if his legal
[53:08.700 --> 53:14.500]  challenges fail and is defeated, a move that if nothing else would allow him to raise money
[53:14.500 --> 53:18.660]  to finance the rallies, that sustain him.
[53:18.660 --> 53:22.820]  Trump can still live in a version of the bubble that he and the 69 million morons who voted
[53:22.820 --> 53:26.100]  for him have lived in since 2015.
[53:26.100 --> 53:29.980]  Inside Trump world, it's fun and exciting and there's no pandemic and nothing but white
[53:29.980 --> 53:32.900]  people and lots of guns and everybody will be a billionaire.
[53:32.900 --> 53:34.300]  Actually the statistics prove that it was.
[53:34.300 --> 53:38.820]  We have not had a lot of exotic exiles in this country, but Trump and his people will
[53:38.820 --> 53:41.860]  form their own grudge driven alt government.
[53:41.860 --> 53:48.260]  Biden's lying, Biden's Chinese, Biden's a robot and their vendetta fuel will be limitless.
[53:48.260 --> 53:53.220]  I always think of Bob Schalke, manager of the baseball New York Yankees in 1930 for one
[53:53.220 --> 53:54.220]  season.
[53:54.220 --> 53:58.860]  They fired him and his successors won 23 of the next 45 pennants and when they brought
[53:58.860 --> 54:08.580]  him back at the age of 85, you know what 45 years later off the screen.
[54:08.580 --> 54:12.380]  You know, I'm a adult male, okay?
[54:12.380 --> 54:17.500]  And I don't like to hang around things where it's all rigged against me.
[54:17.500 --> 54:22.860]  I don't like to hang around events where people like to spit on me and throw things at me.
[54:22.860 --> 54:29.860]  And you know, as an adult male, we have to make a decision you either fight and start
[54:29.860 --> 54:34.900]  kicking dicks in or you just get up and leave and because I mean this is just folks, I mean
[54:34.900 --> 54:35.900]  this is ridiculous.
[54:35.900 --> 54:38.220]  Are we really going to sit here and take this?
[54:38.220 --> 54:39.300]  I'm not mad at the president.
[54:39.300 --> 54:40.500]  I love President Trump.
[54:40.500 --> 54:43.380]  Alex Jones coming up, but these people need to be arrested.
[54:43.380 --> 54:46.900]  We're never going to be free without it.
[54:46.900 --> 54:47.900]  Look it up for yourself.
[54:47.900 --> 54:52.980]  The head of the Davos Group issued a report more than six months ago calling for world
[54:52.980 --> 54:58.580]  government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 was a blessing
[54:58.580 --> 55:01.900]  to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[55:01.900 --> 55:07.540]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[55:07.540 --> 55:14.420]  The most ancient form of total war is called seed and that's when you cut people off from
[55:14.420 --> 55:19.740]  their resources, that's when you lock them down and this isn't seeds to make us capitulate
[55:19.740 --> 55:21.580]  to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[55:21.580 --> 55:22.580]  That's only part of it.
[55:22.580 --> 55:26.780]  This is seeds to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[55:26.780 --> 55:32.580]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social
[55:32.580 --> 55:34.740]  credit score surveillance grip.
[55:34.740 --> 55:38.700]  You've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things.
[55:38.700 --> 55:40.580]  Well, that's what the lockdown is doing.
[55:40.580 --> 55:43.020]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of deaths.
[55:43.020 --> 55:45.260]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society.
[55:45.260 --> 55:46.260]  It's their mission.
[55:46.260 --> 55:49.260]  It's all on record.
[55:49.260 --> 55:56.540]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then again six
[55:56.540 --> 56:02.060]  months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and
[56:02.060 --> 56:06.340]  how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling people heroes
[56:06.340 --> 56:07.340]  that do it.
[56:07.340 --> 56:09.500]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[56:09.500 --> 56:11.740]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[56:11.740 --> 56:16.900]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get a lock down for 15 days, you
[56:16.900 --> 56:18.940]  notice now they say it's permanent.
[56:18.940 --> 56:19.940]  That's how it works.
[56:19.940 --> 56:21.900]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[56:21.900 --> 56:26.020]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[56:26.020 --> 56:27.020]  No.
[56:27.020 --> 56:30.940]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[56:30.940 --> 56:35.700]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[56:35.700 --> 56:37.100]  That's the allegory.
[56:37.100 --> 56:38.540]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[56:38.540 --> 56:40.020]  We got to say no now.
[56:40.020 --> 56:44.020]  We got to make a run for it now and we still can't once he gets us in that base, but it's
[56:44.020 --> 56:50.660]  going to get a lot, lot worse, folks, so stop submitting.
[56:50.660 --> 57:10.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:10.340 --> 57:12.660]  Alright Alex Jones is live right now.
[57:12.660 --> 57:19.940]  The live stream seems to be glitching here, so we're going to pull back from that.
[57:19.940 --> 57:20.940]  There he is.
[57:20.940 --> 57:29.940]  If you call it as China, Xi Jinping is celebrating that they believe that they have put Biden
[57:29.940 --> 57:30.940]  in power.
[57:30.940 --> 57:31.940]  They have publicly stolen Pennsylvania.
[57:31.940 --> 57:32.940]  They have publicly stolen Georgia.
[57:32.940 --> 57:44.940]  But we're going to take it back because under the law, they have broken the law and when
[57:44.940 --> 57:52.020]  John Paul Jones' ship was fighting a ship three times the size back in the Revolutionary
[57:52.020 --> 58:01.020]  War, they said he was ready to surrender and he said surrender.
[58:01.020 --> 58:05.780]  We have only begun to fight. We have only begun to fight
[58:12.820 --> 58:18.360]  We're the Biden events somebody show me a Biden event anybody ever seen one her to one
[58:18.360 --> 58:27.160]  On the new world order now globalism is in trouble and it's one though he won in rocket turn out
[58:31.640 --> 58:35.200]  Being and Bill Gates and the new world order
[58:35.200 --> 58:46.680]  They're the ones that are in trouble that are going down. So I want to just come out here and salute the people of Arizona
[58:49.440 --> 58:54.600]  White Hispanic all young all Americans coming together with red blood
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.560]  So I salute you and America salute you
[59:01.560 --> 59:16.520]  All right, we've got a choppy feed here, so we'll go ahead and pull back from that. But again, that's Alex in Arizona
[59:17.800 --> 59:20.760]  I'm not sure what the plan is next. I know that we have
[59:21.440 --> 59:25.960]  other plans here coming up in the weekend, but I mean I just I
[59:25.960 --> 59:31.780]  Want to open the phone lines. I think Leanne McAdoo is set to come in studio. Is she still coming in guys?
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.560]  I'm sorry what
[59:37.640 --> 59:43.800]  Okay, so she'll be coming up. I mean, I just I can sit here and I can read headlines all day long
[59:45.560 --> 59:50.760]  But we haven't really taken many phone calls since the big steal so I'm thinking I'm gonna open up the phone lines
[59:50.760 --> 59:58.160]  We'll have Alex Jones popping in and out as well. Let me give out the phone number right now eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[59:58.160 --> 1:00:02.200]  Three nine eight seven seven eight nine two five three nine. What?
[1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:06.040]  What should we be doing right now?
[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.040]  Folks are gonna declare by in the winter
[1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:20.320]  Okay, they they stole four states right in front of your eyes. So
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:24.960]  I mean they're already declaring by in the winter
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:32.720]  They stole Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia and that's gonna put by and I think at 284 is something
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:34.800]  electorally
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:40.560]  In fact guys if you want to pull up let's actually let's actually pull up the the map here before we go to break just to
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:44.520]  just just so that you guys know what what what they're gonna announce probably before long and
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:49.480]  Then
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:51.600]  What are we gonna do?
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:56.080]  Yeah, guys go ahead and just give Biden Arizona and Georgia there in
[1:00:57.480 --> 1:01:03.880]  Minnesota, let's just get just get this corrected here so that because this is what they're about to announce probably tonight folks is
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:11.440]  That Biden one I think it's gonna be like 284 or something give him most constant in Michigan in New Mexico
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:14.280]  and
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.600]  That will be okay. It's gonna be even bigger than that. Yeah, they're gonna claim he won in a landslide
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:22.480]  He also had New Hampshire too, and he had one district in
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:26.280]  Nebraska
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:31.520]  Guys flip Michigan there in New Hampshire, so so they're gonna they're gonna claim that Biden won in a landslide folks
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:39.160]  I mean, this is a joke a guy who had no rallies a guy who had no enthusiasm no turn out
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:40.880]  nothing and
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:45.240]  They claim he got 80 million votes. This is the most
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:52.640]  Faking pandemics faking Russian collusion faking elections. I mean, how much longer are we putting up with this? I mean, what are we gonna do?
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:02:02.280]  The miraculous properties of tumeric have been admired even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:10.120]  With modern science, we know why tumeric is so popular. It's antioxidant effect. It's anti-inflammatory effect
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:18.400]  Everything it does is simply amazing and most tumeric's out there are simply food products. They're three to five percent
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:22.840]  Curcuminoid, but we have bodies ultimate tumeric formula

[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:25.000]  Play God, you're not God and every time these evil kings in history try to play God they get destroyed
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:47.240]  Yeah, George Soros burn it hell Soros burn it hell
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:13.800]  You guys this started with us we put a cult off now, and you guys showed up Wednesday Wednesday
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:20.200]  All right, we they took on all of our platforms have been deactivated. We have no more social media
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:24.840]  Yeah, folks, I have to air this because no one else will air it and everyone that's filming is banned
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:37.080]  We're being taken over but as long as we recognize it this could totally flip on the enemy
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:46.280]  We are here now guys. We are here. We are here. And what are we gonna do? We're not gonna back down
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:52.680]  What are we gonna do? That's the question and under the cover of darkness let these Tommy's take our state
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.320]  Take our children and take our freedom
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.600]  I just want to say something right now
[1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:07.800]  Whether it takes a month whether it takes a year a hundred years. We're never giving up. We're never backing down
[1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:10.040]  We're never giving in the globalists
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:15.080]  Are scared of us all over the world ball scenario and so many others are getting elected
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:21.400]  nationalism and patriotism and love of God and family a country is exploding the enemy is in trouble
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.400]  They have to extinguish the american system because it threatens their system
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:32.120]  We will defeat the authoritarians and their minions. We are strong and we are dug in and we're never backing down
[1:05:36.280 --> 1:05:43.160]  Absolutely, hey, they stole this in front of everybody now Trump's gonna fight in the courts. They did it right in front of god country
[1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:46.200]  It's a major miscalculation
[1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:49.080]  But they are now if they're successful gonna come after everybody
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:55.560]  That's what we got to realize the real fight's coming get ready for the fight and we're gonna take humanity back together
[1:05:56.200 --> 1:05:57.720]  because
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:03.320]  They're gonna give us a 1984 system. Well, what counters 1984 it is
[1:06:04.440 --> 1:06:06.440]  1776
[1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:08.440]  1776
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:19.880]  You know folks
[1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:22.600]  I am really uh
[1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:26.760]  Looking for the path of least resistance here, okay
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:29.720]  and uh
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:33.080]  I think we all are
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.080]  I
[1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.400]  So I mean
[1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:42.840]  This is hard to talk about but no one else is gonna do it so I might as well do it
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:44.760]  Uh
[1:06:44.760 --> 1:06:49.000]  And I know I'm not the only one thinking it and they can publish their articles and claim we're calling for violence
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:55.240]  We're not I'm totally the non-aggression principle here. I'm the least violent person. I've never been accused of a violent crime
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:07:00.760]  I'm very tolerant even I turn the other cheek. It's I mean so but
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:05.480]  I'm gonna be honest here folks. They're gonna get away with this deal
[1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:12.360]  And I think that the trump campaign and president trump is making a big mistake
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:16.120]  They're not gonna win this legal battle and even if they do it won't matter
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:26.200]  There there's no coming back from this this is like again, this is like putting up with the fake pandemic in march and april
[1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:30.200]  Look where we are now
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:35.720]  Sure we fought it then we had the rallies we showed this the numbers we shared the science
[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:38.600]  Here we are folks
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:42.920]  Did it matter did any of it matter did all the cures matter did the statistics number
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:48.440]  The morbidity rage the no none of it matters. We're still here. We're still wearing stupid masks
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:51.960]  No one's talking about it now because we got this fake election, but oh, we're still in the pandemic
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:53.240]  so
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.240]  I think the trump campaign is making a big mistake
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:58.680]  The angle is to not go after the rigged elections
[1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:03.560]  Everybody saw it was fricking rigged if you focus on that it's a losing battle
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:07.800]  He needs to go after the biden crime family. This is a joke. Joe biden needs to be arrested
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:15.000]  This is a pathetic joke. Joe biden shouldn't be in jail by inauguration day. He will lose this battle legally
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.520]  They're gonna come out and make a press conference tonight
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:23.800]  You may even have doing press conferences tonight biden may come out and have a press conference and announce
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:27.720]  He's won and then trump will come out and have a press conference and say here's all the voter fraud
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:33.320]  Here's all the proof. Here's it all. We already have it. So what why are we sitting here showing each other the proof?
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:35.960]  We already have it. We know biden's a damn criminal
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:37.640]  We know he's taking money from china
[1:08:37.640 --> 1:08:43.880]  We know his son's taking money from china and russia and romania and kazakhstan and iraq and all of them and we just sit here
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:47.720]  And we just sit here
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:50.360]  So that's what i'm saying. I mean at some point you either just
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:53.720]  Just leave the room or you start fighting
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:09:00.840]  And so again, i'm not calling for violence. I'm of the non-aggression principle folks. They have come after our first amendment
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:03.320]  They've come after everything
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:11.480]  And I at this point I feel the path of least resistance is to just start fighting these people and I don't know what that means
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:13.640]  But it's not going to be one
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:16.120]  In the courts that are rigged against us
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:22.760]  It's not going to be one when you're legitimately having joe biden as a presidential candidate
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:29.400]  So I'm not trying to be pessimistic here. I just call it as I see it and
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:32.840]  This is the wrong angle
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:34.840]  Going after the voter fraud is the wrong angle
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:39.960]  That's going to be so much tougher to prove in court and you can have all the videos and you can play them all day long
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.480]  And you can sit here with all the evidence. We've already seen it. We know what happened
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:47.960]  How are you going to prove it? How are you going to reverse it? What are you going to do? Have a reelection?
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:52.680]  Have a recount of fake votes. How are you going to arrest the people that faked mail-in ballots?
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:00.120]  I'm serious. Trump should either just come out and and declare
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:02.760]  See but nobody has trumps back. That's the problem
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:05.720]  All the cowards in dc won't have trumps back
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:10.920]  Because if he came out and made a statement about how biden the rest of them committed treason and they should be tried for treason
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:13.640]  Nobody would have his back. Everyone would go hide and hold
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:15.400]  So we can't do that
[1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:19.640]  So he just puts up with the treason and puts up with the treason and puts up with the treason
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:23.960]  And then they say well, we'll have a legal battle in court over the election. They just stole from your president
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.520]  And then they'll just commit more treason
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:34.120]  And and and you and I will just sit here and suffer and be tortured and tormented with it for the rest of our lives
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:41.160]  There's no more going back to normal folks for get it for get it. It's over
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:45.960]  And again, I'm not mad at president trump, but I just think he's got the wrong angle here
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:50.600]  This is not the this is not the path to victory. This is not the path of least resistance
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:53.640]  You go after the biden crime family
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:11:04.200]  You go after Nancy Pelosi you you subpoena her financial records her dealings with her daughter her mule
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:07.800]  But they'll come out they'll they'll they'll have a press conference
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.320]  They'll show all the proof all the videos all of it all the fake mail-in ballots and everything
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:14.200]  And then it'll get censored on twitter and america won't see it
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:24.200]  And they'll just continue to move on with their giant fraud
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:27.320]  Hey, uh
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:29.320]  It's like you have a block party
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:32.120]  And one of your neighbors stayed home
[1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:38.760]  And the window to their living room is you can see through it. He's in there just beating his wife savagely
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:41.400]  And you're just out there eating barbecue like hey
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.160]  Hey, is that bob over there just savagely beating his wife to a pulp in the living room?
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:49.560]  And you're like, you know you're sipping your beer like hey, yeah
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:52.280]  Boy, I think he is
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:55.320]  Like maybe we should do something about that. Don't you think?
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Well, I don't know. I mean it's his house and technically we're looking through the window
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.960]  I don't know. Maybe we should just wait and see what happens and then maybe
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:06.680]  Maybe step in or call the police or something
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:10.280]  Um, yeah, I guess that's a good idea, isn't it?
[1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:17.400]  And then you hear the glass breaks and a dead carcass comes out and the woman's lying there bloody and dead
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:19.800]  And you're like, uh, oh
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:21.240]  Oh boy
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:25.800]  Well, she's dead now. Oh too bad. We couldn't have done something about it. Oh, well
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:31.240]  That's where we're at right now. All right, let's go to break with alex and rex jones
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:33.400]  And then we'll come back with more and start taking your calls
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:39.160]  Excuse me. It's voted. It's not that hard. You put in the ballot like come on
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:43.720]  No, you can vote for dancing with the stars and that works, but not for president
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:47.960]  They keep asking like this media like where's the proof of fraud? They violated the laws in michigan
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:54.440]  They violated the laws in pennsylvania in georgia and then they they froze everything and then brought in all these extra ballots later
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:00.440]  The days of hell
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:02.680]  The nightmare is here
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:06.120]  79 days of hell has begun
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:13.400]  multinational corporations the mainstream media apparatus and social media tech giants
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:22.440]  Are all now being deployed by the archaic inbred crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 us elections
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:29.560]  Remove the populist champion of the people donald j trump and install the decrepit perverted
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:37.000]  Traderous establishment puppet joe biden along with rabid radical hag kamala harris
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:45.320]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79 days dot news for tomorrow's news today
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:53.880]  79 days dot news america's last stand 79 days dot news
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.800]  election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:04.440]  We have all won by exposing the communist chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:09.240]  By exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil
[1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:13.960]  Now i'm personally a christian and i believe in god and i know god's real and i've experienced it in my life
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:16.200]  Believe me don't believe in god
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:18.680]  It's important to recognize that there is good in this world
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:23.080]  There is evil and there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:29.960]  And what i see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:33.160]  They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore
[1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:35.800]  Don't ever project your decency
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:42.520]  And your goodness on to other people until they've proven what they stand for and who they are or you're going to get hurt
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.160]  But those of you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:54.200]  Will then come together with those organizations and support them like info wars without your support info wars would not exist
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:00.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:14.360]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:18.920]  But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:25.800]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:33.320]  Oh nothing to see here just someone voting seven times for biden with mail-in ballots
[1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:41.000]  Oh boy, it's a roller coaster and it
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  I
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:49.240]  I'm gonna probably just shut up for a while because i'm just so livid and mad and just fed up
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:52.840]  I'll just say something that gets us in trouble here, but um
[1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:57.000]  Yeah
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  fake pandemics fake elections
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:02.280]  2020 is great, isn't it
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:04.280]  2020 is just great
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Oh, and it's nice to see uh
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  Conservatives uh
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:17.080]  Like ben Shapiro and dan krenshaw saying well the president lost so he lost
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:20.760]  So it's too bad, but he lost he'll just get over it. He lost
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:23.080]  Hmm, okay
[1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:30.120]  He lost. Yeah, biden had more votes. You know any other candidate in presidential history. Yep. That's what happened. Uh-huh
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:35.640]  That's what you believe that's what you want me to believe
[1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:45.080]  I have not plugged yet today ladies and gentlemen and i'm fortunate enough to be here at info wars
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:48.200]  Where I still have a platform. Well, I where I still have a voice
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:52.520]  Because i've been banned everywhere else like alex jones yet. We still dominate
[1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:55.160]  thanks to you

[1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:27.400]  imperative
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:33.000]  And thank god we have info wars to be reporting all of this right now because nobody else
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:36.920]  Nobody else will go
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:41.640]  Nobody else will go where info wars goes
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:45.480]  And you know that
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:51.800]  You've got the trumps calling out the gop
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:56.680]  For not having a spine boy who warned you about that
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:03.560]  You've got fox news will probably be the first to declare biden the victor tonight boy. I wonder who predicted that
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:09.320]  So it's just getting a little annoying
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:19.720]  When everybody knows our reporting is accurate and if people would just respond to it like they they should
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:23.560]  If if we were fox news say
[1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:29.080]  Then we wouldn't be dealing with any of this crap wouldn't be living in a fake pandemic. You wouldn't be dealing with fake elections
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:33.880]  But everybody just wants to stay separated from the dark night don't they
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:40.600]  And they just want to pretend that they don't know about the dark night and they don't know about our reports and all this stuff
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:45.640]  Oh, no, but then alex jones shows up in arizona and he's like the number one rock star of all time
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:53.320]  We have steve patinik on the war room and it's the most viral interview since any of the covid pandemic or the hunter biden emails
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:00.600]  And they say they've banned and they've defeated us. No, you didn't defeat us. You made us more stronger
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:04.440]  No, you didn't win the election. You cheated and made us more mad
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:11.400]  So i'm gonna go to the phone lines now. What do you think we should do? What should trump do?
[1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:14.040]  Are you as fighting mad as I am?
[1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:20.920]  Let's start with ryan in georgia lead us off today ryan go ahead
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.480]  How's it going? Oh, and these are crazy times we live in
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:33.080]  But I if biden gets in man, I'm going on strike. I'm not working one day in the city
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:39.080]  I'm not paying taxes and I think that's what we all need to do until they figure this thing out
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:44.040]  And when there's not food trucks coming in when there's not clean water
[1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:49.560]  Going to the taps man, they're gonna work this stuff out real fast
[1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:57.160]  It's the strangest thing and I'm trying to think about how to even
[1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:00.920]  So
[1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:02.920]  We need to have
[1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:05.960]  A 10 million 20 million man march on dc
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Now here's the problem
[1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:12.920]  If info wars tries to spearhead that movement some of the major
[1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:19.560]  Influencers and thought leaders in the conservative movement will immediately poo poo it put a stain on it and stop it from happening
[1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:24.920]  So it's like we can't even really I mean we could organize it and have a big turnout
[1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:29.320]  But it's like if if they know where the roots if they know where the foundation
[1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:36.040]  Most mainstream conservative people will just poo poo it and tell people not to go and so then it won't have the major influence
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:38.040]  but it's like
[1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:44.360]  Do we kind of sit back and wait for other conservatives and thought leaders or maybe even trump to organize this
[1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:49.640]  So that it doesn't have that that mark of oh info wars bad on the outset
[1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:51.720]  It's kind of like all the stop the steal stuff
[1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:55.880]  When people like hey help promote this help this stuff is like well first of all i'm banned everywhere
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:59.640]  So I can't help but if I start doing it they'll start label it conspiracy theories and stuff
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:04.280]  So what we need is a 10 million 20 million man march on dc
[1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:09.240]  And we just need to bring we just need to demand trees and trials is what we needed man
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.000]  We need to demand trees and trials for biden
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.440]  We need to demand trees and trials for clinton for obama for clapper for comey for brennan
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:18.440]  I mean that's what we need 20 million man march
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.600]  Washington dc bring your own rope demand trees and trials for these people anything short of that
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.960]  I really think anything short of that we fail. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna lie. I really do
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:34.440]  Man this is a real war and I don't doubt that that would be effective
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.520]  But we need to hit people
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:42.840]  Where it hurts man, you know what I mean? We need I agree but ryan, but let me just counter you with something
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:49.400]  They've all people have already been destroyed by the fake pandemic. It's destroyed their lives
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:55.320]  People are being destroyed by all of this. So it's already hit their pocketbook. It's hit everything
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:59.080]  It's hit everyone. It's hit every walk of life and they're still not getting it
[1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:01.080]  Yes, people are waking up every day
[1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:06.600]  But the masses are still watching cardi b and steven colbert and and porn all night
[1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:09.160]  So, I mean
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:11.000]  I don't know no man
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:15.320]  I agree though if they if they put biden in I mean, I I don't know how I go on
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:18.600]  I'm not gonna be whining in the streets
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:25.960]  I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm not working one day in the city man
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:31.320]  They're not going to get any of my energy any of my time. I'm not participating in the system
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:36.520]  Um, and then I I think that's what we all need to do and conservatives in general
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:40.920]  We need to do a mass strike a mass walkout
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:46.600]  We need to walk out of all our jobs businesses because we're going to lose everything anyways
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:49.160]  But people already have you know what I mean?
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:52.520]  Maybe we should just all move to South Dakota
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:58.440]  You know places that are
[1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:03.800]  You know act right or really American areas and leave the rest to
[1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:06.120]  fault
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:09.800]  Basically break down because I tell you man. It's already happening
[1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.000]  You can't get anybody out to jobs anymore
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.520]  Ryan real quick. I only got 30 seconds. They just stole Georgia in the last two hours. Are people in Georgia pissed?
[1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:26.840]  I I don't know man. It seems like everybody's pretty depressed right now. I'll tell you that but the people I've talked to
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:29.080]  Yes, they they they're really mad
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:34.440]  Yeah, I'm really mad. That's what I'm saying. I mean, I don't know how there isn't an organic
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:39.880]  response to the total theft of michigan, wisconsin, georgia, pennsylvania
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:43.000]  I mean, they just stole it right in front of your eyes
[1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:51.000]  I mean, would you let your daughter get kidnapped and tortured in front of your eyes? I mean, this is just a joke. We're pathetic
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:58.040]  I'm sorry. It's just pathetic. The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart
[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:00.600]  inventive people
[1:24:00.680 --> 1:24:02.280]  believe that
[1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:05.160]  Chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe in being aristocrats
[1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:10.760]  It's trying to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that predatory idea
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:14.680]  Civilization collapses very very quickly. You can't treat the least of us
[1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:17.560]  Like garbage and not treat your own family like that
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:20.920]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:25.880]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals of
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:31.800]  All sorts of horrible crimes try to get away from a humanity, but really they can't escape the laws of the universe
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:36.680]  they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves but
[1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:42.280]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:46.760]  Well, it's created by loving God. Well, it's created by having connection to God
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:52.040]  God is the source of all creation all success all power. We deny that you'll be destroyed
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:55.640]  DNA force plus if you did one thing for your immune system
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:01.800]  You would be get all the essential things and that's the clean i9 x2 or x3. That's the bio true selenium
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:07.160]  That is the vitamin d3 that is the c that is the zinc there's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:09.000]  You die and studies show you really need the other ones too
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.080]  But DNA force goes beyond that it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:18.440]  With pqq and coq 10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:25.320]  That unclog them so all that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in because the NIH website says
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:30.920]  And if you have all the proper things they can't replicate like they could but I do this because it's essential like oxygen like water
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:36.920]  DNA force sold out for months 50 off out of the gates triple pay three of points free shipping info or store
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:39.960]  Dot com DNA force election special that's gonna have to end in a week
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:42.760]  We got a limited supply and it was very hard to get the pqq this time
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:46.360]  A lot of our stuff is can't get any more a lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:51.320]  That's part of the global's plan info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:55.320]  I want to thank you all for tuning in

[1:26:55.640 --> 1:26:58.280]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:11.480]  Hello folks, I'm not trying to sound pessimistic
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:17.560]  I'm just always gonna call it as I see it
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:21.720]  Welcome back to the alex jones show. Owen stroyer here sitting in studio for alex
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:25.320]  Will be joined by alex before the end of the broadcast
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:28.360]  We're going to continue to take your phone calls leon macadoo will be in studio
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.960]  You know
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:33.320]  I think
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:35.320]  What president trump needs to do?
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:38.280]  Is
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.280]  Start having rallies again
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.240]  I think he should go
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:45.240]  To every state they stole
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:47.800]  I would announce it and give people a week in advance notice
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.520]  Damn them to hell if they try to shut them down
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  Just be like hey, they're shutting it down. I'm gonna show up anyway. Hope to show up too
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:58.040]  He should just do one in each state that they stole
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:02.760]  michigan, wisconsin, pennsylvania, georgia
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:07.560]  Arizona, north carolina or or just all seven in nevada, arizona, north carolina
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:15.800]  Should announce that a week in advanced and and have a hundred thousand people show up and then he should lay down the gauntlet
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:19.480]  And say where's your people biden?
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:24.840]  Where are your people joe? We won this election and we know it
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:30.040]  And I I just I know this that infowars is controlling the narrative now
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:33.720]  No brag just fact and so I'm trying to get people on the right thought
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:36.360]  Course here
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:42.440]  This isn't oh, we're still going to win. We're fighting this battle. I said no trump won the election folks
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.960]  He won in a landslide. He won with record number of votes
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:52.440]  The democrats have never stopped voting and they're not going to stop voting until they've won georgia north carolina pennsylvania
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:57.560]  They stole wisconsin and michigan and now they're going for arizona nevada because here's what they realized in 2016
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:28:59.560]  The mistake was letting trump win
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:09.960]  They're not making that mistake twice and so they're not going to stop voting in nevada and arizona in georgia and north carolina and pennsylvania and michigan and wisconsin
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:13.000]  Until they get the result they want and now that's what they have
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:21.960]  Now again, I'm non-aggression principle and if I wasn't in this chair right now
[1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:29.000]  I would be making personal decisions to live in a county
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:37.400]  Like for example loving county, texas where's only 64 people voted and 60 of them voted for trump
[1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:43.960]  And maybe there's a little lake I can go out and just live out on the water and just get away from this hell and this torment for as long as I can
[1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:45.960]  But I'm in this chair
[1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:48.680]  You're in this chair
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:50.680]  We're in this chair together
[1:29:50.680 --> 1:29:52.680]  so
[1:29:52.680 --> 1:29:57.640]  Maybe we can go run out in the woods and hide from this crap for some time, but it'll always come find us
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:01.240]  So
[1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:03.240]  Having accepted that reality
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:08.840]  Having accepted that reality, when do we declare war?
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:12.760]  When do we declare war?
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:15.480]  You faked a pandemic. We have the numbers
[1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:24.760]  You have faked an election result. You have the numbers. This is killing us as a country. This is killing us intellectually. This is killing us economically
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:31.480]  You you spied on us illegally. You spied on donald trump illegally. You you lied about crimes
[1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:35.800]  You committed so much treason. When do we declare war on you?
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.040]  They've declared war on us. When do we declare war on them?
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:48.920]  And every day that passes and we don't make these measurements is a day deeper into
[1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:52.920]  Their chokehold that we get
[1:30:54.120 --> 1:30:56.120]  so
[1:30:56.440 --> 1:30:58.440]  Trump has been rather silent
[1:30:58.440 --> 1:31:05.320]  I think trump needs to change his tact. Look, he's got legal people apparently looking at all this stuff and
[1:31:07.960 --> 1:31:12.120]  Only time will tell based on our history of winning these battles guys. I don't like it
[1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:18.760]  Again, I just call it as I see it. I don't like it. Our only hope is us guys. That's it. Our only hope is us
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:24.040]  You're your only hope. We're our only hope. Nobody's coming to rescue us. There's no superheroes
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:27.960]  Yeah, god wins in the end, but uh
[1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:33.000]  God doesn't fight for you you have to fight
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:42.840]  God gave you the abilities god gave you consciousness god gave you a moral compass god gave you reasoning and logic and freedom
[1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:48.360]  Now you have to exercise that or become a slave
[1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:57.960]  But I think trump should announce he's having a rally every day next week in all the states they stole
[1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:03.720]  Hundreds of thousands of people will show up to show their support for trump in this in this fake election
[1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:07.640]  And then throw down the gauntlet and challenge biden to do the same thing
[1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:12.920]  And then what are they going to do because I mean can we at least get out of the fake covet at this point?
[1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:14.920]  Can we at least get out of the fake covet?
[1:32:14.920 --> 1:32:19.480]  I mean he'll at least help us get out of the fake covet in the finals. I will we don't want to have super spreader events
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  No, that's an excuse
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:28.040]  Let's go back out to the phone lines. I'm just
[1:32:29.160 --> 1:32:30.360]  It's just very distraught, you know
[1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:33.320]  It's just very distraught knowing that they can do all of this to us
[1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:36.600]  And we just have to sit here and get tortured and shackled into all this crap
[1:32:37.320 --> 1:32:39.320]  fake covet fake elections
[1:32:39.880 --> 1:32:42.040]  Toby in virginia. Toby go ahead
[1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:45.640]  Because I can't so you can get to the next call
[1:32:46.120 --> 1:32:52.120]  First is the guys in the back could go to youtube's appalachian hillbilly resort to shed some light on covet
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:54.120]  I went into this g2k games the other day
[1:32:54.920 --> 1:32:59.480]  Man shouts at me to put a mask on I've not I'm not doing it. I've got anxiety and everything anyways
[1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:03.960]  When I tell him no he comes around the counter and starts screaming me
[1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:06.040]  I'm talking about like alex jones on the microphone
[1:33:06.040 --> 1:33:09.400]  He's screaming and he gets up within a foot to two foot of my face
[1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:14.280]  And I mean I get mad just talking about it. You know what I'm saying? And I mean he's got his fist balled up
[1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:18.280]  You know my ptsd kicks in I'm already out step back. I'm like I'm gonna let you know dude
[1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:21.560]  I'm right. I'm right now. I'm in defense of my you know my my safety
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:26.920]  So if you put your hands on me and then I kind of caught myself and I pull my phone out and film the rest of the
[1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:32.120]  Encounter and if you show it, you'll definitely have to bleep me out because I'm I'll lose it
[1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:37.880]  Yeah, they're actually there's fights. I think with Slovenia or something where there's lockdowns and mask orders now people are fighting
[1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:41.640]  They're told to put a mask on they just fight law enforcement. They just they're like, you know fight. We're fighting
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:47.640]  I mean this guy, I mean when he gets up in my face, he's screaming so hard that you can see the spit coming out of the side of his
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:48.040]  mask
[1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:53.880]  Yeah, but he's worried about COVID though, Toby. He's even on tape saying tell me he doesn't care that I have a medical condition
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:56.440]  You know what I'm saying? And that's the first thing he screams
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:01.320]  And if Jens could just maybe you know pull that up apple at steel billy wilderness resort
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:03.240]  That's just I put it on there. I was going to put my dogs
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:08.760]  But whatever and then the second fact I want to get to now is the elections. I'm just trying to be as quick and run down through it
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.760]  Maybe you can get back to that
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:16.600]  Look all of our models in this bag if Biden gets in there. There's no accountability for the rest of our days
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:19.800]  There will never be another Republican office period. It's not going to happen
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:23.400]  And I'm I'm I'm not off of the system right wing. I know what it is
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:27.000]  I'm awake. I've been listening to y'all since I was 17 years old and I'm 33 right now
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.080]  You know what I'm saying? I know what's going on. I don't want to get my kids these vaccines everything else
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:34.120]  Look, it's the million-man march. Like you said
[1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:36.680]  Hotep Jesus said at the other night
[1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:40.440]  We're gripping and being a bunch of cowards if this is the other way around
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:47.560]  That the antifa would be slamming rocks and stuff through the windows running into those offices to see those ballots counted
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:52.600]  And you know it. That's a fact. How much more are we going to take because once they get in there?
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:56.440]  They're coming to our doors next. No, that's it exactly though. You said it exactly
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:01.880]  There's no accountability if there's no accountability for the fake pandemic and all the destruction it caused
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:03.960]  There's no accountability ever accountable
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:08.680]  I wouldn't I'm not to interrupt by who's once they're in office and then everybody's like well Biden's in all this trouble
[1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:12.920]  Well, I whipped they do because then we get Kamala. They like that's any better
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:18.520]  We're screwed if we give this up. Trump should not concede whatsoever none and
[1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:20.760]  Hey
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:25.480]  Muskets and bricks like hotep Jesus said shout out to him muskets and bricks. He's right, man
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:33.080]  This is this I'm tired of it. I live in a small county and I can't even go to a game store without being screamed at and with the
[1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:37.480]  I grew and once I started filming he I mean he come out from around the counter
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:41.800]  You know what I'm saying. Oh and the kind of digression, but yeah, we got the video here
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:47.560]  We're playing the video and and what and what's by it then these people that run these businesses are going to
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:54.760]  They're just going to do whatever they want and I realize and they only had like 10 businesses seven of them closed in the past six months
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:35:56.200]  They only got two less
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:02.440]  I couldn't even call it a corporate office to complain that their employees tried to assault me because I refused to wear a mask
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:08.120]  And I mean I I filed a report with the civil rights thing like if anything, you know, I mean
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:11.320]  We got to be discriminated against for being a drug addict
[1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:15.880]  But I they took the cop on tape. He tells me that he don't even know federal law
[1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:22.040]  He said he's not he doesn't understand. I'm dull, man. I'm sorry Owen. No, this is an excellent rant. Toby
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:28.520]  Like I've got to get it out somewhere, man. I am about and they can't I can't be the only one just ready to snap this ready
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:31.480]  I am ready to go in the streets and but I'm just telling you I am
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:34.600]  Toby look that's what I'm saying today
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:39.160]  I mean I'm doing it to us for two more times. Toby. Okay. Whoo. Yeah
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:42.360]  That feels good, doesn't it
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:46.360]  Look, I'm Toby. I completely hear you like I'm holding my tongue, but I mean
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:51.000]  Folks, what's the path the least resistance going and hanging out in a lake or fighting these mothers
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:56.600]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll pay them
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:00.520]  It's that simple and they'd use our open free society against us
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:05.400]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over and say see
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:11.160]  He's a liar on purpose even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:14.520]  We try to tell the truth. They try to lie. They try to deceive
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:20.520]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate how they manipulate how they
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:26.520]  They have booze with the public. I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what they're told in the face
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  I'm trying to get people
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:31.320]  To research for themselves
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:38.360]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:41.160]  But again on its face that is a fraud
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:47.400]  Question everything question info wars add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:51.160]  And what new sources are accurate? I believe info wars is the best source out there
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:54.280]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:56.920]  If you want your children to listen to you
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:37:58.280]  whisper
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:02.040]  And it's true a lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:06.040]  Even if what they're talking about is important people tend to tune it out
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:09.480]  You know why I know that because I'm knowledge Jones
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:14.520]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the new world order
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.640]  And I read about all their plans to lock down civilization
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:21.080]  Start the third world and then enslave the first world
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:26.040]  So I've been really really loud and really really aggressive and we've had a big effect
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:30.920]  But but now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.360]  We can get people to think for themselves before it's too late
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:40.040]  The lockdown social distancing the mask is meant to end human civilization
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:43.960]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:50.920]  So this is live and death. Please share info wars dot com and band our video and watch our live election coverage
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:39:00.360]  There are many references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that it's one of the tiniest seeds out there
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:05.720]  But a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:13.160]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects. They didn't know why well with modern science
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:18.040]  We know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of selenium
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:26.280]  We have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at info wars store dot com at 50 off
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:34.200]  Store ride free shipping and triple of patriot points bio true selenium at info wars store dot com
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.160]  Is an amazing product and it's even more amazing and that it funds our operation
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:45.800]  But if you don't know about selenium research it it is an essential nutrient in the body that you've actually have to have
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:51.480]  It's back in stock 50 percent off triple patriot points at info wars store dot com and with free shipping
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:59.080]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments info wars is many many years ahead
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.480]  And almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that info wars has
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:08.360]  I've noticed that really informed people have this as well
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:11.560]  I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most performable out there
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:15.240]  So I want you to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every day
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:17.880]  This hunter bite
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:25.000]  Top is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him where he admits he works under the communist chinese spy chief
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:28.760]  He should be arrested right now. That is so huge
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:31.480]  That is hiding in plain view
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  And it's getting almost no attention
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:38.120]  We have to get that information out to everybody. It's all posted on info wars dot com
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:45.240]  So many other major patriotic sites, but we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:50.440]  We knew it a long time ago. So when it breaks now, we kind of go. Okay. Tell us that we didn't know the point is now
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:52.520]  It's documented now. It's proven
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:41:13.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:19.400]  Welcome back my friends
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:22.040]  Alex jones here live on this
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:25.240]  Friday global transmission
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:28.120]  And history's here. We all have a duty
[1:41:29.400 --> 1:41:33.320]  I would expect within two to three days. They're going to be attacking the white house kind of drive from from office
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:35.720]  They're just we're plunging the stock market next week
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:42.280]  This is our darkest hour. This is we killed 62 million babies. We they gave up on what made us great. We became a bunch of
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:47.560]  Jellyfish and idiots. I'm gonna talk about our audience, but the general public and so the enemy made a move on us
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:53.320]  If you act like a sheep, if you act stupid and you roll over on your back and piss on yourself wolves come
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.440]  And we're like a rabbit with leg broken out in the field squealing and squeaking
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  And so again coyotes are coming
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:02.920]  It's very very sad
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:08.680]  We were sold their modern feminism and leftism that masculinity and and and the whole sheepdog phenomenon was bad
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:10.760]  And so now the wolves
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.440]  Have successfully trained us to get rid of our sheepdogs. And so we're in a lot of trouble
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:19.080]  But here's the good news and I I'll always just tell you and shoot you straight. I don't think you need me to tell you this
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.080]  Stuff now it's it's all out in the open, but
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.880]  the good news is
[1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:25.880]  The articles are on info wars.com
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:31.400]  They're they're at band-up video. There's senators and house members saying look biden is a chinese agent. It's on record
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.760]  It's not like what trump where they made it up to project that
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:38.440]  So they have a big normalized, you know five for three years about it
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:42.760]  So when we accuse them of being chinese agents they just go. Yeah, we work with china big deal
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:47.960]  They are hiding that in plain view that psychiatrists and psychologists came up with that
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:50.360]  to inoculate us
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:55.240]  In the washington post saying gg ping runs america in the new york times saying china runs america
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:59.080]  In all the publications so that when patriots went, hey
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:03.320]  You're working through globalist corporations and communist china as governmental muscle
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:05.960]  to enslave us
[1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:08.840]  It'll locate big deal, you know gg ping's crushing trump
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:12.920]  That was the ultimate insane sigh up, but but but here's the big deal
[1:43:13.880 --> 1:43:18.760]  I've been here. I've been talking to the white house today. I've been talking to folks the state department
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:20.760]  You know, they're all asking me what I think is going on
[1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:23.400]  But I asked them what is your battle plan and they said well
[1:43:24.520 --> 1:43:26.280]  It's common as china
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:31.800]  With the democrats and your america is being occupied by common china and their clients the democrats
[1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:36.280]  And that's what we're going with because that's the truth. So think about the magnitude
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:42.280]  That the president is getting ready today or tomorrow. That's what they want to drive that office to address the nations from the oval office and say
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:48.280]  Look, we've been infiltrated by communist chinese. We're declassifying all this information. They stole the election their people did this
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:50.280]  Here's all the proofs all the proofs there
[1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:56.520]  And then see what happens because it's just insane that america can't believe something like this would happen
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:43:59.000]  Because we're america
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.480]  Well, just because we won world war two doesn't mean that we're going to continue to go on we got infiltrated
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:06.040]  We got taken over and here's the big issue
[1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:13.800]  Everywhere everyone is calling every major site every major conservative or nationalist or patriot group or the president or his sons
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:19.400]  They're all being totally blocked or partially blocked and all these sites are being suspended blocked
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.320]  across the board if they show anomalies and fraud and corruption and
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:28.040]  governors violating
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:30.040]  federal and state law and violating court orders
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:35.400]  When mainline nationalist publications just american publications put out truthful information
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:38.200]  They are being completely shut down
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:43.720]  Okay, so think about that long and hard and so this is our communications cut off
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:47.080]  They're going to then
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:49.080]  Probably stage the shooting of some black people
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:50.920]  We'll be the next move
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:56.920]  And then hype up a race war. That is the reason to drive trump from office if he doesn't leave america has just come together
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:01.880]  We should see through all of this, but the internet kill switch has been put in place
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:06.840]  Again, he wouldn't do it overnight people would say no congress would act you do it incrementally
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:09.480]  That's how authoritarians do it
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:11.560]  until you've got full control
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:16.280]  But in the last phase of a takeover it goes from slow and incremental to
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:19.960]  The last third it's instant. It just snaps shut like a bear trap
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:23.000]  So imagine it's like the petals of a flower closing slowly
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:27.240]  Like a famous fly trap as the fly doesn't notice it kind of slowly closes in the last minute
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  And so we're in that second hour. It's one bump
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:35.720]  And they think you know, we're used to them censoring us and the use of them attacking us and used to them saying they're
[1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:39.560]  Going to steal the election and biden said he's going to steal it. He said kamala Harris will be the president
[1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:45.000]  You're like, why is he doing that? It's all done on purpose to rub your nose in it. So
[1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:49.400]  It's up to you now america your email list your text messages
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.800]  That's one of the few areas. They're not totally censoring send out our emails. Send out our videos our articles now
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:58.040]  Send out the live feeds america's being attacked america's being over thrown
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:03.000]  If there's a chain reaction and we find our instincts and we find our heart and soul again
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:06.840]  I realized that this was all true and that info wars was dead on
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:11.320]  That their whole attempt to take over will collapse and it'll boomerang back on them very very quickly
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.960]  if we go with mitch mcconnell
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:18.600]  Then what fox news is already saying well the Senate will be in there and you know
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:22.840]  Biden will be a laying duck with all the laptop stuff and the china stuff and no
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:27.080]  It'll be the same old fbi the same old just department the same old crap
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:29.880]  I'll see you guys inside go ahead and go in
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:32.520]  and
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:34.520]  It'll be the same thing over and over again
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:42.840]  And then they're going to just keep launching culture war economic war new covet lockdowns covet 20 covet 22 covet 23
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:46.920]  They've got it all wargame. They've got it all laid out. This is sure as the sun came up
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:49.800]  So we have to get motivated. You have to get aggressive
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:54.280]  You have to go to info warshore.com and get great supplements. You already need to boost your immune system take care of yourself
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:47:00.200]  The x2 the x3 the body's ultimate formula back at stock the dna force plus pqq the coq 10
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:05.800]  You needed all all the t-shirts the books the films now the war goes through a dimensional on the streets with information war
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:09.560]  Exposed the globals now. We enter this season of race war and false flags
[1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:14.280]  Now we enter the season of economic warfare and depression now. We enter the season of lockdown 2
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:17.800]  Now we enter the season of this whole new world order system. So
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:20.680]  There's a battle plan
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:23.880]  We should be able to beat them because we have the facts folks have to understand
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:28.840]  I'm not just up there saying stuff that I've been right all along because I do my research. I live this it's all I do
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:31.640]  And so that's what we've come down to here
[1:47:31.640 --> 1:47:33.800]  Is you better understand we know what we're talking about
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:37.960]  And you better reach out to leftist other idiots and not fight with them and say don't you know your schmucks
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:41.560]  You're working for a foreign power that has millions of people in death camps in china
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:44.520]  And then all the big tech companies are super evil super corrupt
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:50.680]  We've been super fat. We've been super happy because you were protected for so long the protection's gone folks
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:55.160]  The honeymoon's over the party's over until we get right with god repent
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:57.720]  So pray to jesus for an awakening and then get out there and take
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:00.600]  legal lawful political action get to dc
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:04.360]  Surround the white house the commies have said they're going to drive from power
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:08.040]  They've been planning it for months this whole thing's been orchestrated this whole thing's been chronicled
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:14.280]  We know their battle plan stop asking if we know their battle plan. We have the god dogged death star plans
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:16.760]  So the kills which is going in
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  That's what we say don't talk radio on tv
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:23.480]  That's why info wars is an outpost still there knowing all this was coming. So we're here and you're here
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:30.840]  You're the info war so spread the links to everybody tell your neighbors knock on every door run around yelling and screaming fly banners behind airplanes

[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:39.160]  They think you're slaves. They think you're stupid. They think you'll take anything
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:45.560]  Don't do it get off your knees humanity and say no back to oh and shroyer and the info wars command center more reports coming up on
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:50.120]  Soros involved with the voting machines in georgia and in philadelphia pennsylvania and in

[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:31.240]  We need to be out loud and proud american flags trump flags trump hat saying we reject this steal
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:37.160]  biden did not get five billion votes. No trump won in a landslide and we know it
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:40.120]  The world knows it everybody knows it
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.560]  But folks here's the problem
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:47.160]  You're not gonna hear about stop the steal
[1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:53.320]  You're not gonna hear about the election theft on most outlets definitely not on cable news
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:56.440]  So you have to tell your friends and family
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:02.360]  You have to document all the videos all the videos you're seeing of democrats filling out ballots blocking poll watchers
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:04.760]  Suitcases being rolled in
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:12.360]  Days after the election you need to document all of that download it archive it put it in a folder save it forever
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:14.920]  Because it will be memory hold off the internet
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:16.920]  As sure as i'm sitting here
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:24.440]  When we come back i'm going to start taking your phone calls leon mac do in studio. I'm going to tell you what's happening right now behind the scenes though
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:28.440]  President trump wants to fight this
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:34.920]  He is going to fight this he knows it stolen from him and us he has his
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:43.480]  He has his advisors and administrators in the oval office today telling him to concede
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:47.960]  That's how bad it is
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:52.840]  Trump's own advisors are telling him to concede now. You'll know which ones are telling him to fight this
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:55.400]  You'll know which ones are fighting for america
[1:50:57.720 --> 1:50:59.720]  And you'll know which ones aren't
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:06.600]  Trump wants to fight this at every level his advisors and people in the white house are telling him just to concede
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:09.320]  That's how pathetic this is just give
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:15.000]  Everything to joe biden a total. I mean he's a damn child molester for god's sakes
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:25.160]  We'll continue to take your phone calls on the other side plus some videos plus leon mac do but
[1:51:25.160 --> 1:51:33.160]  Folks, I suggest you and your friends and family get to your state capital tomorrow at noon for the stop the steal nationwide
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:35.720]  We have to be in the streets
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:37.880]  peacefully
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:42.760]  Now to show our strength in numbers and our support for trump. We are only here on air facing
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:48.280]  The globalist onsots the dnc funded lawsuits and everything that's happening because of you
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:55.000]  We built the only truly multimedia independent radio tv print film organization in the world that promotes the truth
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:00.360]  Against the globalist. We've had a devastating effect. We're a national treasure. You're a national treasure for supporting us
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:03.320]  And so go get a t-shirt. Go get a historic t-shirt
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:08.120]  We've got a funny one. That's the biden groping a woman. It's it's a woman's design shirt
[1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:11.160]  My wife really likes it. She sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:13.000]  And it just you know, it's a little historic thing
[1:52:13.080 --> 1:52:17.160]  I think trumps gonna win but if biden's able to steal it will be probably shut down pretty quick
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:22.280]  So it'll be historic thing to have you only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti
[1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:27.960]  with handbills you hand out and with non-compliance not paying taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools and
[1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:33.560]  Just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of america
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:39.240]  We've gotten to that point biden for nursing home. I hope to retire biden that'd be a collector's item get it while you still can
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:41.240]  We're not ordering more info war store.com
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:45.960]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:51.560]  What am I most proud of when it comes to show and it's the fact that info war is more than 25 years ago
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:56.040]  Doing basic research with what the club of Rome and the cfr and others were actually saying
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:03.240]  Developed the hypothesis that communist china had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to china and then make us
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:10.360]  Economically destitute and position us into debt. Well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:14.280]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again
[1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:17.640]  It wasn't that hard the cfr and others admitted what they were doing
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:25.320]  But still others didn't want to focus on that issue. We did and you focused on it by supporting us at info wars
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:29.960]  So when you go to info war store.com and get all the great supplements books t-shirts films
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:35.800]  Water filtration air filtration all of it. You're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world
[1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:39.800]  What's really happening? So that's a big accomplishment for all of you. I want to thank you for your support
[1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:48.840]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:04.440]  All right folks
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:06.600]  We are back live. I'm sure it's about to take it over
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:11.640]  I'm sitting here in phoenix in the mexican food restaurant. It's like these americans that have no idea. They're being going
[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:14.920]  under communist chinese globalist and slave that is so sad
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:20.200]  To see this totally unfolding right now. So massive. I'm going to say what owens said is absolutely right
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:26.200]  They're already telling trump to concede. They're going to claim 22nd amendment 25th amendment. They're going to claim he's got to leave
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:30.200]  And this is the big fight now. This is when the knives are going to come out
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:35.160]  This is when the traders are going to come out. And what owens said is absolutely paramount. We must all go to dc
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:40.520]  We must all go to the state capitol. We must all demand that trump fight and trump stop the fraud
[1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:45.000]  And not let the chinese communist steal our election. So what owens says the most important thing of the day
[1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:47.480]  Everyone get that bad signal out back to you owens
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:54.200]  Thank you alex lian mackinou joins me now in studio. We're going to take your phone calls. I saw uh lian agreeing with that
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:58.760]  I want to get her take on that too, but let me just be clear about something because in the last
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:01.000]  week
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:05.720]  I've had about as much outreach to me personally from friends and family as I had probably
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:09.240]  And this is saying a lot for like the entire month before that
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:12.840]  Most of it in response to the steve patinik thing, which I've already addressed
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:15.320]  And I'll address again later on the war room
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:18.920]  But folks you have to understand something whether or not
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:22.840]  The department of homeland security and united states postal service
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:30.600]  Encryption blockchain watermark whatever technology they put on the ballots ends up finding voter fraud or leading to any arrest or something
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:32.600]  It's not going to save this country
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:35.160]  It's not going to save this country
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:41.560]  And it's not going to defeat this massive democrat steal of the election. It could work
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:46.760]  It it could be something that helps stop the steal, but it's not going to be the bend-up be all end all
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.040]  So I just want people to understand who keep asking me about this
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:52.840]  And I guess because it's really just hopes that
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:56.360]  This means they can sit back and relax. I suppose no
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:55:59.160]  no
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:02.520]  You have to get active now. You have to tell your friends and family. What's happening now?
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:04.440]  It is as bad as you think
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:09.880]  The answer is no one's coming to save you. No watermark on a ballot is going to save you
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:14.200]  It may catch voter fraud. It may help trump stop the steal. It's not going to save you
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:15.800]  It's not going to save this country
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:21.160]  You need to get to your state capital tomorrow at noon and I think what we may have to do is just you know what just say
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:25.240]  Bollocks to the mainstream news that'll probably try to squander this if we start it
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:29.240]  But lian, I think we maybe we just do it here today. I think we have to say, you know what?
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:36.920]  No matter what inauguration day dc every trump supporter needs to be there every we need to have 10 million in dc
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:39.240]  Maybe I mean you can't have a gun in dc
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:42.760]  But maybe we do it like richmond virginia and just come arm up and just say you know what?
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:46.360]  This is who you're about to pick a fight with this is your final warning
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:54.120]  Right and you know when you have the biden campaign putting out a message like well, we don't have any problem having the police escort out
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  A or the military trespassing
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:00.040]  There in the white house like just this inflammatory language
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:05.880]  When it's obviously contested more than half the country is not going to accept the results of this election
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:12.600]  Without it going to the supreme court and actually looking into the voter fraud that we can see with our very own eyes
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:17.320]  There's more evidence of voter fraud than there was ever for russian collusion
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:22.680]  We had to endure four years of that and they're not even going to think about all the investigations
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:29.000]  But all the investigations all the lies all of the sources say or sources familiar with his thinking or
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:36.440]  No one came out that actually put their life on the line to back up the tall tales that led to that investigation
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:38.440]  And we had to endure that for years
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:43.000]  And now they're wanting trump to just concede calling him a sore loser
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:46.760]  When we can see the voter fraud we could see that there was zero
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.120]  Intensity zero passion for joe biden or kamala harris and now we're supposed to believe that
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:59.480]  Millions and millions and millions of insane americans voted for him. I just I have such a
[1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:05.400]  I'm so sick to my stomach just thinking that this is what we're going to have to put up with now is
[1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:09.560]  It's like that bully on the on in the schoolyard that you know spits
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:13.400]  Spitballs at the teacher and then the teacher turns around and blames it on you and they're like
[1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:17.320]  Man, man, man because they're they know they're never going to get in trouble. They're never going to get caught
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:21.560]  I'm like what sort of hell planet have we been dropped on and it's just such torture
[1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:25.480]  For us to sit here and deal with this every day
[1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:31.880]  Because folks you have to understand you're a human. Okay, you're you're still a human. You're still a human
[1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:37.800]  So sitting in this limbo period is not you're going to be you're going to destroy yourself psychologically
[1:58:37.800 --> 1:58:44.200]  We we either have to decide you you have that you're going to fight now or you can go hide hide in the hills for another couple years
[1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:48.520]  With your food and your your guns and your dogs before they come to kill you that those are your two choices
[1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:54.920]  Two in full wars best-selling products are now back and stops for big sold out for months

[2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:04.840]  Uh, I'm gonna address what a lot of people want me to talk about on the war room coming up
[2:00:04.840 --> 2:00:09.800]  So tune into that three to six p.m. We're gonna take your phone calls as well. I want to ask leanna question
[2:00:09.800 --> 2:00:13.360]  But first I want to ask you all about the
[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:21.360]  People want me to talk about on the war room coming up. So tune into that three to six p.m. We're gonna take your phone calls as well
[2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:23.360]  I have a message for president trump
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:29.440]  And anybody and everybody inside the white house or that has a direct communication line with president trump
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:32.800]  Please relay him this message. It's short. It's sweet and it's what he needs to know
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:40.160]  The president can fight this election theft in the courts till the cows come home
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:42.160]  And that's good
[2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:50.480]  And he should and we totally have his back and support him in that and I do believe that he he should and would win that but
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:56.320]  What donald trump what president trump needs to understand
[2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:01.920]  Is that his strongest card right now? Is not winning a legal battle in the courts
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:09.200]  It's not waiting around for bar or any of these people to to come down with justice against obama or come here clapper
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:11.200]  And in the people that committed treason. We know that
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:15.680]  There's options there. There's cards there. There's percentages. There's odds
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:20.080]  President trump your strongest card right now
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:24.400]  The greatest odds for you to be successful and for america to survive this
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:27.840]  Is for you to understand that we have your back
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:30.480]  We have your back
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:34.640]  70 million of us minimum have your back and you say the words
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:37.520]  And we will save this country
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:39.520]  We will
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:41.760]  That's a damn guarantee
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:43.200]  so
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:45.680]  I understand why you want to take your chances in the court
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:52.080]  I understand why you want to take your chances in the department of homeland security the department of justice of the cia the fbi
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:56.000]  But president trump your odds there for success are very low
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:01.200]  In fact, maybe slim to none and I think slim is walking out the door
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:07.680]  But if you put your faith in us and you tell us to get active and you tell us to come meet you in dc
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:12.880]  And you point out the people that committed treason and the enemies of this country the true enemies
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:18.240]  Forget what the mainstream media will say about you president trump forget about the turncoach and the republican party will say about you
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:21.440]  We will have your back. We will save this country
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:25.200]  We just need to know
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:27.360]  That's what you need
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:30.320]  But you say the words we will and let this weekend
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.080]  Be an example at every state capitol at noon tomorrow
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:36.640]  Let this weekend to be an example folks
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:46.160]  We have your back president trump. You say the words will show up 10 million 20 million 30 million 40 million 50 million strong if we have to
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:49.440]  And if you tell us to execute our second amendment, right, we will
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:53.360]  Because that's our best bet to save this country right now now
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:55.360]  uh leon
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:57.360]  You've been here at info wars for a long time
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:01.840]  You understand the torment it is. I'm not complaining. Uh, but
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:04.720]  I'm very blessed to have this platform
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:09.040]  God put me here for a reason. I've embraced it. But you know
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:15.360]  Just like everybody listening to this to know all this corruption is happening to see it all right in front of your face
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:17.360]  And then to feel helpless every day
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:24.560]  But to come out and call it out with no action in response. It's torture. It's torment and now every american is experiencing it
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:28.960]  Something's got to give here leon. Yeah, I mean, it's like you're in an abusive relationship
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:31.440]  And you're being lied to again and again and again
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:36.560]  And you know you're being lied to and you just want that person to be straight with you and to be real with you
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:42.240]  But they are so pathological that they just can't help themselves and they have to lie to you and it's
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:48.880]  It is true psychological torture that you you have to step away from you have to shut off the mainstream media
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:51.760]  They're just lying to us. They are
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:56.240]  Filling our minds with disinfo and it is torturous. You know when you're reporting on
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:03.360]  Sex trafficking or you know all the pedophilia things like that that are going on and you're trying to expose this corruption
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:10.480]  This darkness this evil and then you realize how it's being protected and covered up from these high up levels
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:12.480]  I mean just the darkest sickest
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:15.040]  most evil things you can even imagine and
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  It's it's just
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:20.560]  It it does take a lot of time
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:24.640]  It it does take a lot out of you because even with this election just
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:32.000]  Brazen a steel right in your face a brazen theft and they're still just smiling and getting away with it
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:37.360]  And don't be a sore loser, you know bend over and take it. This is you know, this is our country now
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:40.080]  ha ha ha it's just
[2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:45.120]  It's I mean, I don't know scar it's like a scar if you keep ripping off the scar
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:49.920]  It's gonna stay there or that scab excuse me if you keep ripping off a scab and ripping it off and ripping it off
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:53.120]  Your skin is never gonna heal. You're gonna have your scab there forever
[2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:57.920]  And it's gonna turn into just hardened callous disgusting scars. That's what this is like
[2:04:58.160 --> 2:05:01.680]  It's like every day we we reopen the wound we reopen the wound
[2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:08.080]  We never get time to heal we never get time to to to repair and we just sit here and we become so hardened and so callous
[2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:13.360]  And and the more look the more they do that the more they're gonna make people battle hardened and I don't want to do that folks
[2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:16.240]  I've grown up in the greatest country on earth. I've had a great life
[2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:21.760]  I I grew up lower middle class and I still wouldn't complain a day about all the stuff that I've had to be through
[2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:25.280]  But it's like this is the greatest country in the world. I don't want to throw it all away
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:31.040]  But it's either lose everything or fight for it now. Let's go to the phone calls max in Detroit
[2:05:31.600 --> 2:05:36.720]  Uh, michigan is one of the states that they stole in the dark of night max. Are the people in michigan up in arms about it
[2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:39.840]  Uh, yeah, yeah
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.960]  Yeah, and they are and um, it's great to be on the show with you
[2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:48.720]  Um, it's been a dream of mine to talk to you guys over there and info or so. Thanks for having me on. I am glad you made it in today
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:52.320]  Thank you. I got a couple talking points on a piece of paper here
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:54.320]  I don't know if I'll be able to get through them today
[2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:58.480]  Uh, with yeah, but um, the first thing I want to talk about is I actually have a friend
[2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:01.360]  Who was a republican poll watcher in Detroit?
[2:06:01.760 --> 2:06:07.200]  And she can confirm that they were threatening her and they were being very, um
[2:06:07.840 --> 2:06:11.760]  Confrontational to the republican poll watchers there. So that's not fake news there
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:15.840]  Yeah, I mean we have it on video. They have biden harris masks on they bully people out
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:20.480]  They kick out the gop poll watchers in philadelphia. They cheer they cheer
[2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:23.920]  I mean, this is the most rampant rape of our republic. We've ever seen
[2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:30.240]  Yeah, it's like it's just you know, i'm 20 years old. This is the first presidential election
[2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:33.040]  I've ever voted in and this is just disgusting
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:36.080]  You know, this just turns a lot of young people off of voting
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.240]  You know and politics, which is what they want. They want us to go back into the stupor
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:44.560]  They want you to go watch netflix. They want you to go play a video game. They want you to watch porn all night
[2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:49.600]  Right. Yeah, they want us to go watch cuties with jill biden, right? Right. You're so lucky. Yeah
[2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:52.560]  Yeah, they want us to go sniff some hair
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:57.360]  But another thing I want to talk about is the michigan gop itself
[2:06:57.440 --> 2:07:05.600]  So I actually volunteer down here in the 12th district, which is south of detroit lot of union auto workers blue collar area
[2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:11.440]  We were running out of trump signs. We were running out of pamphlets for trump in our
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:16.560]  We had never seen it before and at the 11th hour three days before the election
[2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:19.760]  We were running out of signs. They're telling people. Okay only one or two
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:26.640]  We get an influx of 900 signs for the michigan gop. It's like we were sabotaged from the beginning with these people
[2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:34.640]  The trump the trump campaign this year just seems like it's so much more unorganized than it was last year
[2:07:34.640 --> 2:07:40.560]  And I don't know if it's it's these deep state moles that are you know sneaking their way in or whatever
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:43.600]  But but trump needs to nip this in the bud
[2:07:44.960 --> 2:07:50.560]  It's absolutely disgusting. Well, let me let me try to get you let me try to get you and the audience a better understanding here
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.560]  Of what's going on inside the gop
[2:07:52.880 --> 2:07:57.280]  There are a very small percentage of republicans or gop conservatives
[2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:01.920]  Who will actually fight for this country? I forget who coined the phrase wartime conservatism?
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:05.520]  I think it was buck sexton who who said wartime conservatism
[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:11.360]  You've got maybe one percent of republicans that are wartime conservatives. Most conservatives just like being involved
[2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:14.800]  They like feeling good. You give them a badge at an event. They like it
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:19.360]  That you know, they uh, they get to vote on some local issue. It makes them feel good
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:24.320]  Uh, they want to fit in they want to fit in they want to take their picture with the governor
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:28.720]  They want to shake hands with the city council. They want to schmooze. That's all they want to do
[2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:33.520]  And sadly we're learning that the hard way. Sure. There's operatives. Sure. There's people that are trying to sabotage
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:36.800]  But honestly max, it's mostly just pathetic people
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:42.000]  That are republicans that just they just want a picture with don jr. They just want to shake the hand of a governor
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:47.120]  You know, they just want to have a little placard a little name key. It just makes them feel good. They don't want to fight
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:52.000]  It's these rhino. I call them stiff. It's these rhino
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:54.720]  establishment stiff that are
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:00.560]  Abotaging this election and the last thing I want to talk about that no one's talking about talking about right now in michigan
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:06.880]  Is the vote disparity between john james who's running for senate and the amount of votes donald trump got
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.640]  No, in fact, maybe i'll come back with those numbers, uh max
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:17.840]  I think I sent you those daria. I'll come back with some of the numbers the uh anomalies lian between senate and house races
[2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:22.400]  And the presidential race again, it's just totally it just totally shows corruption magical math
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  Isn't it magic, huh?
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:26.480]  Yeah, no, I mean look
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:29.760]  I mean, I really believe joe biden got a hundred million votes
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:35.760]  Oh for sure. He definitely had way more enthusiasm than obama did. I mean, didn't you see all the record breaking?
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:38.320]  Didn't you see all those people packed in the six foot circles?
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:41.280]  I mean you couldn't he didn't have enough circles
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:45.440]  Yeah, I mean there were so many distance spaced out it went out into outer space
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:48.800]  It could see a biden rally from space. Oh wait. No, that was a trump rally
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:53.360]  Look it up for yourself the head of the devos group issued a report more than six months ago
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:59.200]  Calling for world government to be openly established to respond to cova 19
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:03.680]  The cova 19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:09.200]  Since then prince charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.960]  The most ancient form of total war is called
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:14.960]  seed
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:19.600]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:24.000]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:29.120]  That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:33.920]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives
[2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:37.200]  With the social credit score surveillance threat
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:42.800]  So you've heard the u.s. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown's doing
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:48.320]  It's starving the third world millions and millions of death is breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:54.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:09.120]  Is that that story we're live by the way on the alex jones show leon mackey who own shroy is that that story where they
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:16.960]  Found the computer glitch right that flipped was of michigan, right? Correct 47 michigan counties use the same software that was
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:22.960]  A glitch giving six thousand votes to biden and the democrats that should have gone to trump
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:26.880]  And this was just in one county where they found that after hand counting the votes
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:32.240]  They they found the glitch and so if you just add that six thousand votes into 47
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:36.080]  Different counties that are using the same software that's going to have the same glitch
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:43.440]  I mean this is you know, we deserve uh, we deserve to have a fair election regardless of the outcome
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:46.960]  If if you're a democrat you should be completely okay
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:53.680]  With it going to the supreme court or figuring out just getting to the bottom of this alleged election fraud
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:59.040]  Even the street average democrat knows it was stolen. Yeah, and you should be okay with transparency
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:05.680]  Because it is going, you know, we have to just keep keep the integrity of our elections intact
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.440]  But if you think that that your guy won that biden won then what's the matter?
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:11.600]  You're just going to embarrass trump for the second time
[2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:13.680]  You're going to make the rest of us upset again
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:17.600]  So, you know, you'll have a second opportunity to celebrate a win if
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:22.640]  If it goes that way so like what's your problem with the transparency? Let us get because they know they cheated
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:23.360]  That's what it is
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:28.240]  Right, and you know it'd be one thing if it was like a bernie sanders victory where bernie sanders actually had big rallies
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:31.840]  I mean he had tens of thousands of people show up for rallies. Uh, you know, he had
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:36.960]  You know eastluts on twitter flash tits for bernie and stuff. I'm sorry dump that it's just it's true
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:42.160]  That's what they do these little e-girls do little uh the bernie bro dances because they know they can sell their only fans account
[2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:46.480]  So, I mean the point is if it was like an actual candidate who had
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:52.160]  Voter enthusiasm and you could see it then you'd say, okay, you know what maybe he did win this biden had nothing
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:59.760]  Right even democrats hated biden. So these ridiculous redoculous numbers biden's getting he's gonna close like a hundred million votes
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:03.760]  I mean, you how could anyone believe that but here's some of the discrepancies
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:08.880]  Um that are in this graph and by the way, I was looking at all this last night
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:13.520]  I couldn't sleep until after they stole georgia last night. It was just instinctually. I just knew I had to watch georgia
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:18.160]  There's all kinds of anomalies if you look at 2016 to 2020 with counties
[2:13:18.160 --> 2:13:26.000]  Like double voter turnout magically biden has an increase up to like 85 percent in some of these counties that hillary won with 60 percent
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:27.920]  It's just impossible
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:29.920]  um, but here from uh
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:36.640]  us rebel on twitter biden with record low enthusiasm underperformed across many major cities compared to 2016
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:42.560]  But you notice these are the major uh cities that they didn't cheat all night new york city. He was down 200 000 chicago
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:49.040]  He was down 250 000 miami. He was down 7 000, but at 4 a.m. In the cities biden needed to steal atlanta
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:56.240]  He jumped 75 000 detroit. He jumped 67 000 milwaukee. He drumps 28 000 pittsburgh. He jumps 29 000
[2:13:57.200 --> 2:14:02.400]  so, uh, and then there's other discrepancies to why why do these jumps only happen in the
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:07.440]  Middle of the night when no one's around well because no one's watching you're sleeping
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:13.840]  But I just it just seems just so cool. It goes to bed uh at you know 6 a.m.
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:19.600]  Or whatever and then it only works when you're walking to and from your table once you sit down
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:25.360]  You're completely fine exactly, but but it's also um, and I don't have those other numbers in front of me
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:28.480]  I thought this was the graph, but there's also the discrepancies where
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:37.440]  In senate elections democrat turnout is is normal or below normal, but record turnout for biden record turnout more of a turnout
[2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:43.440]  Than president obama and that we could see the enthusiasm for when obama was running both times
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:50.320]  I mean, he had massive crowds. He had republicans voting for him too. So many people wanted obama to win and they voted for him twice
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:53.920]  Now we're supposed to believe that biden was able to surpass
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:59.520]  Surpass the record numbers that turned out to vote for obama. I mean, this is absolute crap
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:06.960]  This is like brazen lying me to to my face and just telling me to accept it total gaslighting and I remember in
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:12.400]  2008 and 2012 I couldn't stand obama. I hated obama. I knew he was gonna win
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:15.520]  He had huge I mean incumbents always have good turnout
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:19.040]  So I knew he would win versus weak romney and in 2008
[2:15:19.040 --> 2:15:25.040]  I wasn't really politically political at all, but at the university missouri obama came. I went and actually did an anti-obama
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:31.760]  Demonstration with a couple of my friends and we got dominated everybody loved obama. He had like 20,000 people
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:37.360]  So it was like, okay. Well, this guy sucks, but he's gonna win right this is nothing like that biden has nothing
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:44.320]  Right, but I mean to just try and gaslight us into accepting that biden did better than obama did
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:50.560]  I mean, there's just no way. I mean, there's more enthusiasm to give hunter biden a foot job than to vote for joe biden
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:54.720]  I'm sorry. Okay inappropriate humor. All right, let's go back to the phone lines though
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:00.080]  Let's go to let's go to carlos in texas carlos. Go ahead
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:07.520]  Hey owen, uh, how are you doing? I love the show. You're doing a great job. So is alex
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:11.040]  I like that alex is out there. Um
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:16.640]  Um, yeah, we'll be back out there tomorrow austin capitol the state capitol here in austin texas noon
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:23.280]  People were asking is it going to be noon? Just all over the country or noon local time? I would say noon local time
[2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:28.640]  I I'll I'll just say noon local time. I can't say yeah noon local time for sure noon local time state capitol tomorrow
[2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:33.680]  Every state cap. We're seeing you the guys there. Awesome. I'll probably be there with you guys
[2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:39.680]  Thing I did want to say is that this is going to go to litigation and I think
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:41.680]  And I hope
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:44.880]  Together with us not not letting anything
[2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:50.160]  Fall out and people forget about abstin. We're not going to let people forget about
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:55.840]  The the the covid-19 hoax that if biden wins is going to completely disappear
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:16:59.600]  But this has to be fought in the courts and we can't
[2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:04.320]  We can't do like the other republicans who are who are staying quiet
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:07.280]  I haven't heard not too many people
[2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:11.920]  You know on either in congress or in the senate except for like Ted Cruz
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:16.640]  Right and we address that and by the way the trump administration did make a statement that they're not
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:20.560]  They're not giving up. They know this whole thing was stolen. But but here's what trump needs to do
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:23.520]  I'm telling you trump needs to start having rallies next week
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:26.560]  He needs to have a rally do the five rallies a day do it all
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:33.680]  Have a rally in every state they stole to show how massive his support is throw down the gauntlet to joe biden to do the same thing
[2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:39.840]  He won't be able to do it. It just gives him more material and then have his legal team his team on the ground
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:46.880]  Just compile all the evidence of the total voter fraud the videos the eyewitness accounts all of it
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:52.480]  And and then when he gets done with his rallies, then he can say, okay, what do we have? All right, here it is
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:55.120]  Anything else carlos?
[2:17:55.120 --> 2:17:56.000]  We agree
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:18:04.480]  Yes, there's that part and then there's the steve pacenic mind you. I like steve pacenic. I and I would hope that what he said
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:07.040]  is valid now
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:09.040]  The director of the nsa did say
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:14.720]  That after we saw those shenanigans go on in 2018 and matt and matt bevin
[2:18:15.360 --> 2:18:17.840]  Not continue with his recount effort because I think
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:21.040]  Now let me just I've only got 90 seconds
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:26.400]  So I'm going to respond to your thing on on steve pacenic and I hope this answers people's question. Look
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:31.920]  The steve pacenic thing went viral and everybody globed onto it because we're desperate for answers
[2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:37.040]  Everybody is hanging out here just dying like looking for water in the desert
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:40.400]  Steve pacenic did not say anything inaccurate on the air
[2:18:41.840 --> 2:18:44.240]  In fact, probably everything he said is going to turn out to be true
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:51.040]  The problem is we think somehow that that one drop of water is going to satisfy our thirst or make us not dehydrated
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:56.800]  No, that's like a tiny little drop of water. Yes, they watermark the balance. Yes, there's cyber security encryption
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.320]  Yes, it's blockchain. Maybe it'll stop some theft of this election
[2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:06.800]  Yes, is it a sting operation to catch them? Is it going to stop the steel? No, is it going to save america? No
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:09.760]  So everybody just in their desperate
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:16.800]  First for anything for any resolution of this is basically saying, oh my gosh, it's the be all end all thank god
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:22.320]  Oh, and thank god steve pacenic. So I mean it's it's it's a weird thing steve pacenic didn't I mean
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:26.240]  He didn't lie about anything. He didn't bs anything the stories are all out there
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:28.800]  Washington post covered it with the codes on the on the ballots
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:34.400]  But it but it's not he never claimed this is going to save the republic and it's like somehow people are like thinking
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:38.560]  Oh, it's I can just sit back and relax now. They're handling it for us
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:47.120]  Yeah, this isn't cue here time to show up. All right, ladies and gentlemen again, stop the steel noon local time every state capital tomorrow
[2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:49.440]  It's all on record
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:52.560]  Yale, harvard, princeton, stanford
[2:19:53.040 --> 2:19:55.040]  They were all hired a year ago
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:20:01.360]  And then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[2:20:01.840 --> 2:20:03.680]  And how to get the public to take
[2:20:03.680 --> 2:20:11.520]  Anoculations and they talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't this has all been psychologically tested
[2:20:12.640 --> 2:20:18.160]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent
[2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:25.120]  That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:26.880]  No
[2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:31.440]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killers fan. He's taking us
[2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:36.320]  To his shack in the woods to slowly towards risk of death. That's the allegory
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:39.520]  We got a bust out of this thing now. We got to say no now
[2:20:39.760 --> 2:20:43.120]  We got to make a run for it now what we still can't once he gets us in that base
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:46.560]  But it's going to get a lot a lot worse folks. So stop submitting
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:50.240]  DNA force plus if you did one thing for your immune system
[2:20:50.800 --> 2:20:56.320]  You would be get all the essential things and that's the clean iodine x2 or x3. That's the bio trisilinium
[2:20:56.320 --> 2:21:01.760]  That is the vitamin d3 that is the c that is the zinc there's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them
[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:03.520]  You die and studies show you really the other ones too
[2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:07.520]  But DNA force goes beyond that it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells
[2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:13.040]  With pqq and coq 10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells
[2:21:13.520 --> 2:21:19.920]  That unclog them so all that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in because the NIH website says
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:25.440]  That if you have all the proper things they can't replicate like they could but I do this because it's essential like oxygen like water
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:28.400]  DNA force sold out for months 50 off out of the gates
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:34.560]  Triple patriot points free shipping info or store.com DNA force election special. That's gonna have to end in a week
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:35.600]  We've got a limited supply
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:40.800]  It was very hard to get the pqq this time a lot of our stuff isn't can't get anymore a lot of our products because the supply chain's broken
[2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:45.920]  Down that's part of the global's plan info or store.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:52.880]  I want to thank you all for tuning in it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your gps
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:59.200]  Location I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was unamerican
[2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:05.280]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on apple and androids
[2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:11.840]  Don't just track your location, but your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:13.200]  And they all
[2:22:13.200 --> 2:22:16.400]  Share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well
[2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:20.160]  Including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying
[2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:24.000]  Just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases
[2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:32.000]  Transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:37.040]  Surveillance scores based on information. This is the global Chinese communist social credit score

[2:22:43.920 --> 2:22:49.920]  infowarstore.com
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:52.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:08.480]  Leanne wanted to cheer me up
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:13.120]  I'm really happy Leanne our country is just being stolen and raped to me. Come on
[2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:19.360]  I'm a liberal. I love this evil is celebrating and dancing on the grave. I'm a good lib
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:22.480]  screw america
[2:23:22.480 --> 2:23:26.560]  That's how you'd be a good progressive dem lib can't beat them join them, right?
[2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:33.840]  The same people that think it's okay to kill a child expect us to believe voter fraud is beneath them
[2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:37.760]  Of course, you could replace so many things with what they're doing
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:44.160]  It's like, oh, they faked the pandemic. They fake russian collusion. They fake us into wars. They wouldn't steal an election
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:49.120]  Oh, no way not these people. They're willing to incite a civil war
[2:23:50.400 --> 2:23:54.640]  Get us fighting amongst ourselves so that we don't actually turn on them the people who are are
[2:23:55.360 --> 2:23:57.680]  Supposedly representing us and haven't done a damn thing
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:01.840]  You know what I think you know what I think is more sickening and depressing than
[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:05.200]  The corruption that we're dealing with that is to be expected, right?
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:09.840]  I think what's even sicker is when I see the lib celebrating it
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:15.040]  Isn't that just I mean it's like watching somebody vomit and then eat their own vomit
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:19.360]  They're like, oh, we have no integrity in our elections. We're just like venezuela. Whoo
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:25.040]  Yay, and it got my candidate in yay. I didn't even actually vote for him, but it says I did so
[2:24:26.160 --> 2:24:28.160]  Oh, yeah speaking of that. I mean
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:34.800]  These are flooding twitter today, uh, and and I just pulled two out because they they provide evidence
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:37.680]  Uh, but these are there's there's claims like this flooding twitter
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:44.320]  Uh, because you can go check your vote status. This lady says my vote says canceled. I voted in person last night
[2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:46.560]  I don't have early voting or mail in
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:51.520]  They made me use a sharpie and it bled completely through. I'm in arizona. This is voter fraud. She went to check
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:54.560]  She provided the documents here
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:25:02.000]  And here's her, uh, information says ballot was canceled. Here's her ballot voted for trump voted straight republican. So, of course
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:10.800]  Oh, uh, sharpie ballot for trump and canceled sharpie ballot for biden. Good. Uh, julia song who's been a guest on info wars before, um
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:15.280]  Says this also happened to her in where north caroline, uh
[2:25:15.920 --> 2:25:19.120]  She voted in person. She goes to check out her status says nope. You didn't vote
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:24.320]  Huh, yeah, so that's just magic leon. I mean, there were just so many instances
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:26.560]  It was like every
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:32.720]  Battleground state was given the directive to just whatever you can do whatever you can to just throw a wrench in it
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:34.880]  The machines are broke a pipe burst
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:37.520]  Only pass out sharpies
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:43.840]  Don't allow people to come, you know, bolt the doors lock the doors board up the windows. Don't let the poll watchers see
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:46.640]  Um, you know, there was just so many different instances
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:52.080]  You you were seeing them counting the votes and actually writing on them. What was that guy writing on the ballot?
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:54.320]  Oh dozens of them, right?
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:26:00.240]  Or just crumpling them up and tossing them over in the trash and then you see the other people around
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:02.240]  Not even
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:06.320]  It's like they're not even going hey, buddy. You can't do that. They're all just like do do do do do
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:10.160]  Yeah, like oh nothing to see here, but uh, don't let the poll watchers in. I mean seriously like
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:13.200]  like if you watched
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:16.800]  Professional wrestling growing up, you know and the guy would come in and they'd fight then
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:20.080]  You know, there'd be three guys in the ring and one guy would
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:23.920]  Have a chair smashed over his head. He'd be bleeding out of his head
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:30.160]  He'd get smashed into you know the announcers table and then the doctors would have to come out in a stretcher
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:34.160]  And they'd put him in he's dead and they put him in the back of the ambulance and they wheel him away
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:36.640]  It's like oh wow and then magically
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:38.880]  He comes out of the ambulance
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:44.080]  He gets free of the gurney and he beats two men in the ring and raises the bell. He's the champion
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:51.600]  It's like that's how ridiculous this is really. Oh, biden down all night in pennsylvania, wisconsin, michigan, georgia
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:58.000]  And then magically at the buzzer. He pulls it off for the victory with the perfect amount of votes and they stop counting
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:01.280]  Oh, I mean a wwe match is more believable than this
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:02.640]  Right, I mean
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:08.080]  That's that's you're exactly right perfect analogy for how they are wanting us to just be this gullible audience
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:13.680]  And like just get into it. You know, we know it's all fake, but it's fun to cheer it on and just get into it
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:16.560]  What do you what do you say to the people who are?
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:20.720]  Just kind of like giving in and saying, uh, you know what it doesn't really matter
[2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:22.560]  My life doesn't really change
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:28.880]  You know based every four years on who the president's going to be if biden harris get in well, whatever doesn't affect me that much
[2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:34.800]  These are people who cannot wait to grab on to a tyrannical power
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:38.000]  They're there there are people who are going to day one
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:44.080]  impose a national mask mandate everyone keeps saying oh covet no one's going to talk about it again after biden gets in
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:46.800]  Well, why would they give up that power?
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:52.800]  Why would they give up the power with this hoax of covet that has enabled them to shut down
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:56.240]  the economy worldwide and force people into
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:59.360]  You know doing whatever it is. They're told to they don't die
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:04.080]  I mean it made people walk in one direction in the freaking supermarket for goodness sakes
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:08.000]  For months and months because that'll save you just because they you know, they were like, hmm
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:14.000]  Maybe this will stop covet. You know, let's just walk in one direction and you know stand six feet apart
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:15.200]  so
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:23.120]  They're not going to give that power away and just magically let covet disappear especially not when double mask biden has promised to
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:30.560]  Make all of us mask up again indefinitely. By the way, I noticed something the double mask. I noticed what it's really about
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:34.720]  His his under mask has this weird thing that like
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:40.400]  Protrudes the mask out so that it's not actually skin tight so we can actually breathe if you notice
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:45.680]  There's always like an inch gap at the top of it when he double masks so that he can still breathe there
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:51.600]  Yeah, it's like kind of defeating the whole purpose when you're trying to keep your breath into your face signaling
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  You know try not to let the air disperse
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:59.440]  We want Joe biden. He's like I believe in this so much. I'm gonna wear two of them
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:04.320]  Two will save me from covet. But the truth is he probably would die if he got covet
[2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:08.160]  It I mean he's weak and frail. He can barely even walk
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:13.360]  Yes to have Jill out there with a mask telling him what to say. He can't even think yeah, I'm just
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:19.520]  It'll be very interesting to watch and see if if indeed they're able to steal this election
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:24.560]  You know if if indeed we have to accept a joe biden presidency
[2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:27.200]  It'll just be interesting to watch how long
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:35.600]  He'll he'll stay there for and then what's next? I mean, I don't want to think that too far that in the future because it's kind of frightening, but
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:39.360]  I mean 79 days of hell
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:45.440]  We're in the middle of it. They've been propping us and massaging us to get ready for Kamala Harris and why her
[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:50.640]  I mean joe even admits it. He's like I'm running with Kamala. She's gonna be present. You think I'm kidding
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:57.280]  They they they all told him what the plan was and they're all on board
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:01.760]  All of these democratic leaders in swing states, they're all on board with the steal
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:05.360]  Oh, you need us to stop counting the votes indefinitely so that
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:10.640]  Trump won't be able to get the electoral voting. You want to just keep on holding these out till
[2:30:11.280 --> 2:30:12.080]  I mean
[2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:18.240]  They're all in cahoots and now they figured out all of these different ways to cheat and steal with this election
[2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:24.480]  So do you think they're not going to use those same tactics in the future or build on those steal tactics?
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:28.080]  And of course, you know, this isn't the first election they've stolen
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:33.120]  I mean, let's just all be real like there's this kind of thing the fraud has always been there
[2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:37.840]  But now they've it's so in your face. It's so brazen and then they're going to get away with it
[2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:42.240]  I mean, there there's no pulling back from this. This is why people even democrats
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:46.640]  We need to stand up and fight to to protect the integrity of our elections
[2:30:46.640 --> 2:30:49.920]  Well, that's why that Philly democrat poll worker was like, yeah, I'm a democrat
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:55.600]  But uh, they're just cheating right there. He was on tucker crawlsson last night. He was like, hey, look, I'm a registered democrat
[2:30:55.600 --> 2:30:58.560]  I'm just a poll watcher. Uh, they're in there cheating for biden right now
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:02.400]  I just thought you should know and he was just stunned on tucker last night. He was just aghast
[2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:06.960]  He was just like a tucker. I can't believe what I'm witnessing. They're actually this is a coup against the president
[2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:08.640]  He's a democrat
[2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:12.080]  He's just an american. He knows what's going on. He probably didn't even vote for trump
[2:31:12.080 --> 2:31:18.320]  He just knows that oh a coup against the president. That's gonna hurt me like I know there are a lot of lefties out there that are
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:25.360]  Cannot wait until we become like venezuelas. Oh socialism and then hopefully we'll just descend right into communism
[2:31:25.840 --> 2:31:26.720]  It's gonna be great
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:28.720]  so I know there are some people that
[2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:33.840]  Are okay with the fact that our elections are being run and stolen like they were in venezuela
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:39.440]  But there's so many so many of us and people worldwide are watching our elections
[2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:45.920]  Oh, they're begging for us to get this corruption out of here begging for us not to just sit back and take it
[2:31:46.240 --> 2:31:54.000]  They look to america for us to exercise our freedoms that they they risk their lives to come here to experience
[2:31:54.160 --> 2:31:56.000]  And the crazy thing too is
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:32:00.080]  Because I had my friends from brazil reaching out there watching this they reached out to me for the first time in a while saying
[2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:03.440]  What the hell is going on like they're even seeing the steel happening
[2:32:03.680 --> 2:32:07.840]  But like they're afraid to say it. They're like, hey, what is taking so long? This seems a little weird
[2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:11.440]  And I'm like, yeah, they're just blatantly stealing it. They're like, oh good like that's what I thought
[2:32:11.520 --> 2:32:14.160]  So I'm not crazy. It's like everybody is seeing this
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:17.440]  Well, how could they count millions of votes on election day?
[2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:20.880]  And then they have to stop and take a little nap because everyone's tired
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:23.680]  And then then they're counting like one vote
[2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:31.040]  Per it's like they have six thousand votes. It takes them two days to count. I mean, what is going on? No, actually I just found a
[2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:34.080]  Another ballot right here in studio guys
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:40.640]  Oh, oh, no. Oh, hey, you guys forgot to count a ballot here. Oh, look, I found another
[2:32:41.920 --> 2:32:46.560]  Guys, where do these ballots come from? It's another Biden ballot. It doesn't even need to see my trash
[2:32:46.560 --> 2:32:49.760]  Oh my gosh, dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:54.080]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[2:32:54.320 --> 2:32:58.480]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition
[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:02.880]  Buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com
[2:33:02.880 --> 2:33:09.200]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure
[2:33:09.520 --> 2:33:11.520]  Decrease triglyceride levels
[2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:19.520]  Decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system
[2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:25.600]  Recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate
[2:33:25.920 --> 2:33:30.880]  Immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[2:33:30.880 --> 2:33:39.600]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality
[2:33:39.840 --> 2:33:45.680]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot com
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:52.960]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart inventive people
[2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:55.760]  believe that
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:01.200]  Chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe in being aristocrats trying to hold up civilization and power the people
[2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:04.240]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea
[2:34:04.800 --> 2:34:08.080]  Civilization collapses very very quickly. You can't treat the least of us
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:10.960]  Like garbage and not treat your own family like that
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:14.400]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:19.360]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals of
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:25.280]  All sorts of horrible crimes try to get away from a humanity, but really they can't escape the laws of the universe
[2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:27.200]  they may train themselves to
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:30.160]  commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves but
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:35.760]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:40.240]  Wealth is created by loving god wealth is created by having connection to god
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:45.520]  God is the source of all creation all success all power. We deny that you'll be destroyed
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:49.680]  The miraculous properties of tumeric have been
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:57.600]  Admired and even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations with modern science. We know my turmeric is so popular
[2:34:57.920 --> 2:35:01.920]  It's antioxidant effect. It's anti inflammatory effect

[2:35:55.440 --> 2:35:58.720]  79 days of hell has begun
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:05.840]  multinational corporations the mainstream media apparatus and social media tech giants
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:14.880]  Are all now being deployed by the archaic inbred crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 us elections
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:22.000]  Remove the populist champion of the people donald j. Trump and install the decrepit perverted
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:25.440]  traitorous establishment puppet joe biden
[2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:28.160]  along with rabid radical hag
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:30.560]  Kamala Harris

[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:57.360]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:12.960]  All right final segment here with leon macadoo. We've got your callers lined up

[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:22.720]  uh alex jones may even be joining me in the war room later
[2:37:23.840 --> 2:37:30.160]  Stop the steel nationwide at your state capitol noon local time looking forward to being out there to
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:35.920]  Morrow in austin texas and seeing a lot of you. I want to take a lot of these calls here right now. You've been holding
[2:37:35.920 --> 2:37:39.920]  Let's go to is it gene gene in virginia go ahead
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:41.920]  Oh
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:47.120]  Just watching the democrats burn our country to the ground. That's all
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:55.280]  I know man. Look this this is a fraud and everyone can see it that you know attached to reality at all and
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:37:59.200]  Well, hey leon also. I can't see you back on the show
[2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:04.800]  But the thing is is you know, I just feel like
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:08.240]  He should have done more while he had more power
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:13.120]  To make sure this didn't happen. That's my only thing. I got think if the country was unified
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  He would have been like the best president
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:18.000]  But I think in the circumstances that he was put in
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:25.360]  He didn't go all the way. It wasn't let me just defend trump here real quick because I don't disagree with you but here was the problem
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:31.840]  Trump knew it was this bad. He says, oh, I didn't know that the swamp was this deep. Well, okay
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:34.880]  Nobody knows how deep the swamp is. It's like, how do you know how deep a lake is?
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:36.880]  You can't see the bottom. You got to swim down
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:39.440]  So but but here's the problem
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:44.080]  As soon as trump got in the republicans started pandering catering
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:48.560]  And and in getting him to believe that they would fight with him and have his back. They lied
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:51.360]  I mean, just look at dan krenshaw. The other problem is
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:39:00.480]  He put swamp people in charge of the federal bureaucracies that have sabotaged him and he's had his advisors like look
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:04.480]  I don't like to do infighting and and this is why I like staying in austin and staying out of dc
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:10.240]  Because I don't want to do the dc politics. I want to wear jeans to a bar and not have people look down on me like screw you
[2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:14.240]  Okay, right, but exactly when you have match slap
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:22.320]  As part of trump's team to stop the steal. I mean, give me a break match slap sense slap sensors infowars
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:24.320]  So I'm not trying to attack match lap. It's just the truth
[2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:25.920]  But my point is
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:30.800]  These conservatives that pretend like they have trumps back. Do not they're weak. They do not
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:33.920]  So it's just hilarious for me to sit up here
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:40.480]  I mean, look, you can go listen to on august 28th and harrison smith has done this too. Alex jones said here's all the plans
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:46.880]  I mean, we've literally laid all of this out for president trump. We told president trump exactly what they were doing and people like
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:53.040]  Matt schlapper is here saying don't listen to infowars people like sabash and gorka are in his ear saying don't listen to infowars
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:56.080]  And that's what's so sad. So you have conservatives
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:40:00.720]  Sabotaging trump because they don't want our narrative to dominate because quite frankly
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:04.400]  We're ten times the men these these people are but we'll just leave that there
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:11.680]  And then they want to be able to turncoat on him when he loses to still pretend like they're the republican conservative establishment
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:14.000]  That will stab us in the back three times on sunday
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:18.560]  But then you have the mainstream news that has all these libtards out there
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:24.640]  Cheering for their own demise cheering for their own enslavement cheering against trump because of all the lies and
[2:40:24.640 --> 2:40:26.640]  Trump would be the greatest president in the history of the world
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:31.600]  If people would just get behind him and understand what he's trying to do sure he's not perfect of course you're going to disagree with him
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:38.400]  But yeah, it's the mainstream news lying about him. And then it's it's it's fake republicans fake patriots fake
[2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:44.480]  Conservatives that have trumps ear that are stopping him from getting the real narrative
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:48.880]  We have no unity and it's and it's and it's you the communists is who this is
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:55.520]  They're so unified. I don't even think we can understand it yet, you know, like they're so unified. They're doing
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:40:59.040]  We were just talking about that. I don't think they're as unified as we think
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:04.320]  I mean it appears that way because of Hollywood and the mainstream media echo chamber, but they're organized on the streets
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:06.320]  They don't have a clue
[2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:09.840]  The people running the show behind the scenes. I forget what they're doing
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:15.200]  They have their little, you know, antifa different layers of penetration
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:22.000]  The leaders of those groups the organizers. I mean, they're very organized and they've kind of figured it out how to use
[2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:27.840]  The the people the innocent people in the crowd who are just wanting to be part of a march or some mob
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:32.240]  Yeah, they they know exactly how to use the mob to their advantage
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:34.880]  So that is on the one hand if you're
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:37.840]  We're talking about today
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:44.240]  And if you're we're talking about taking it to the streets, you do have to have a little bit of concern for
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:50.320]  How unified some of these even though there's anarchy that they're believing total anarchy, but
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:52.160]  They're also
[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:55.040]  I you know what in some weird providential way
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:59.280]  I have a feeling that they're eventually gonna boomerang and not be on our side
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:03.200]  But it'll be like the same thing like you make strange bedfellows and love and war
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:08.080]  They're gonna get it that they're getting screwed by the establishment. I mean, they don't like the democrat party
[2:42:08.240 --> 2:42:10.400]  Well, they say that they're not for either
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:17.200]  Candidates they hate they hate they hate the united states the communist and austin tag buildings anti-biden stuff on it
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:20.560]  Right, and so it'll be interesting to see if they do indeed
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:27.440]  Follow through with the looting and the rioting that was planned and the destruction to take take down the us
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:32.720]  By the way, you did have people arrested antifa people arrested in portland who were planning violence and terror attacks
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:35.760]  Uh, the night of the election they got caught with guns and stuff. Hey, I mean, I don't know
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:40.080]  They've already destroyed portland. I don't know why they would they just burn their own communist stronghold of the ground
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:44.320]  I guess that's the the irony of a dumb ass commie. Uh gene. Thank you for the call. I got to jump
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:46.320]  Let's go to peter in washington
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:48.160]  Peter go ahead
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:50.160]  hi, oh, I will
[2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:54.080]  The key is we can put pressure on republicans only republicans control both
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:43:00.160]  The entire legislature and executive and governor's office in georgia and uh, arizona
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:05.360]  In michigan and wisconsin and pennsylvania. They control the legislature both chambers
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:09.040]  The house has to ratify the electors
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:13.120]  The senate has to accept the electors robert barn said
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:19.120]  When it comes down to it the senate gets to vote and then the house gets to vote, but it's by state
[2:43:19.660 --> 2:43:22.160]  Delegation it's not by individual member of the house
[2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:25.840]  So republicans have a majority in both the house of representatives
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:29.680]  And the senate for in terms of approval of the electors
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:35.360]  Every american should put pressure on their elected republicans to do something about this fraud
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:39.040]  And they have the ability to do it in the key states involved. Yep
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:46.240]  Call email go to your local representation your state representation go to their websites get their emails get their phone numbers
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:49.360]  Leave them messages leave them emails exactly. They can't set this one out
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:55.120]  The thing is we've got a whatever political capital. You think you have a republican party
[2:43:55.360 --> 2:43:59.280]  It expires forever on january 20th after the inauguration
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:04.640]  We're headed into venezuela territory and if you think you're going to enjoy your status within the republican party
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:10.560]  You're dreaming ask a california republican what it means to have power within the california republican party
[2:44:10.720 --> 2:44:13.120]  It's going to be the same thing in the united states as a whole
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:19.280]  Mitch McConnell better realize that yeah, he's been relatively silent throughout all this. So is lindsay graham
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:25.520]  He did have time to do a fox news hit last night and he somehow has half a million dollars to donate to the election defense fund
[2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:27.760]  Where did you get that money lindsay?
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:29.280]  but
[2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:34.400]  It is so frustrating lyanna and because I don't want to come on here and name names and say look at this
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:38.240]  Don't trust this guy. Don't trust this guy. This guy will sell you out
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:40.720]  uh, but
[2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:44.080]  I mean at what point do we just start telling
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:45.520]  I mean
[2:44:45.520 --> 2:44:46.400]  Well, it's I mean
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:50.400]  Do they not think that they're gonna have these same tactics used against them?
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:53.360]  You know the republican hopeful for 2024
[2:44:54.080 --> 2:44:59.680]  That you know, they're do they do they not think that they're gonna have to be dealing with the same type of election fraud
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:03.440]  And the same type of tactics that were used in this election
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:05.760]  They need this is the time
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:12.400]  Especially when there's so much support for this president from the people to get to the bottom of this and to really go into the
[2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:16.000]  Investigation and I I understand where you're coming from saying trump's taken the wrong
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:21.600]  uh angle with this by trying to go to the supreme court and department of justice and everything because they've
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:24.640]  They've totally thrown him under the bus time and time again
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:31.120]  So how can he trust them to really get to the bottom of this this time around and I agree with you on that
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:37.280]  It's it's just almost like we're we're stuck. We need to rock in our place and just be on the lookout for anybody
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:39.120]  any
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:41.120]  commentator who's talking down at you
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:48.560]  Because you won't accept the results of this election if Biden won or if they come out and they say just buy one just accept it
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:54.640]  Just just know who they are just know who they are and know who they're pandering to let me try to squeeze one more in here
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:56.960]  Mark in New Jersey mark go ahead
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:00.480]  Hey, what what's going on man? How you guys doing today?
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:02.080]  Good. Thank you
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:08.640]  So, uh, yeah, so jerseys like a fucking hella blue state and it's like dump that kind of kind of frustrating when I just like walk
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:11.840]  Around even with the dog early in the morning like you just see a whole bunch of like
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:13.680]  commie
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:17.680]  Commie shit. It's it's really crazy. All right. I got a drop you mark. That's too cussing. I'm sorry
[2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:20.960]  We're on trestle radio deon in ohio. Go ahead. Keep it clean
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.480]  We have deon john john in ohio
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:35.840]  John. Yep. Sorry. I'm uh, I'm a long time listener been listening for about 10 years now since I was about 17 years old
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:42.080]  um, I'm glad alex is out here now and uh doing something about this
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:50.080]  And uh, I'm glad you guys are organizing uh protests for everything statewide because I got on the website last night
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:50.880]  um
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:54.240]  Stopped the steal and there was nothing for ohio
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:57.280]  Because you know, there's tons of people here
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:03.840]  who are sick and tired of this man and they're ready to stand up and uh, see what they got to do
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:09.280]  Yeah, so we just have to continue to flex our muscle in the streets and show our strength and numbers in the streets
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:12.160]  And I'm telling you president trump, you should seriously have a rally
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:15.040]  You should have a rally in all the states they stole from you next week
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:16.480]  I'd announce it today
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:21.520]  You'll have hundreds of thousands of people show up throw the gauntlet down to biden say, you know what?
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:25.200]  Who knows what happened in the election? Let's see your supporters biden. My supporters are out here
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:30.240]  They're waving flags. Where are yours joe? And of course there will be none and then they'll have to say well the pandemic
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:35.280]  The pandemic no stay home. Yeah nobody's buying that anymore. It's died overnight
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:41.120]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll pay them
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:43.920]  It's that simple and they'd use our open free society
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:45.680]  against us
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:49.920]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it say see
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:55.680]  He's a liar on purpose even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:58.960]  We try to tell the truth. They try a lot. They try to deceive
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:04.320]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate and how they manipulate how they
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.960]  They have booze with the public. I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what they're told in the face
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:13.520]  I'm trying to get people
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:15.760]  To research for themselves
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:22.880]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and as a conspiracy theory
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:25.680]  But again on its face that is a fraud
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:32.000]  Question everything question info wars add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:35.680]  And what new sources are accurate? I believe info wars is the best source out there
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:42.560]  If you want your children to listen to you
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:44.000]  whisper
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:45.360]  And it's true
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:47.680]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:51.760]  Even of what they're talking about is important people tend to tune it out
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:55.120]  You know why I know that because I'm Alex Jones
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.160]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the new world order
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:06.720]  And I read about all their plans to lockdown civilization start of the third world and then enslave the first world
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:11.680]  So I've been really really loud and really really aggressive and we've had a big effect
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:16.560]  But but now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:20.000]  We can get people to think for themselves before it's too late
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:25.680]  The lockdown social distancing the mask is meant to end human civilization
[2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:28.160]  We are under a civilization
[2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:30.240]  Collapse weapon
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:31.920]  So this is live and death
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:36.640]  Please share info wars dot com and band our video and watch our live election coverage
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:42.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:49:51.280 --> 2:49:53.280]  You know what I'm so glad
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:49:59.600]  I meant to come in and tell the crew I want nothing but outlaw country coming in
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:04.480]  It's like my only solace right now. It's just like some Hank jr. Some Waylon Jennings
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:07.840]  So because this is what I mean, we're gonna have to turn into outlaw country here
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.800]  Right, that's I mean outlaw country is the only option we got at this point
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:15.600]  But you know what I want to go off the air of the Alex Jones show today with with a with a smile and a laugh
[2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:19.280]  and something that'll make your spirits a little brighter and uh
[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:24.480]  We're about to have the fourth hour hosted by dr. Nick baggots. So he's coming up shortly

[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:32.480]  um, so so if you want to hear more from from my uh
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:34.480]  Diabolical ranting, uh

[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:45.280]  But I want you to see this this will brighten your spirits a little bit today. Okay. I hope so. I need and everybody wants this moment
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:51.760]  I've been fortunate enough to have a few of these moments. I didn't quite uh, I didn't quite approach the moment like this individual did
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:56.800]  But you know when you see a scumbag politician, you got to say something you got to film it this guy understood it
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:03.360]  He was uh, well spoken like a true new yorker bill de Blasio was run into on the streets by a true new yorker
[2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:07.040]  I'd like to shake this man's hand and buy him a whiskey
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:12.720]  But uh, check this out. It's censored for the radio, but this is everybody wishes they could do this
[2:51:18.480 --> 2:51:21.040]  Not good you rat scumbag
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:24.880]  During the wrong city scumbag
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:26.880]  Oh
[2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:30.880]  Scumbag
[2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:34.880]  De Blasio
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:38.560]  All right, what?
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:44.240]  So uh, we can work on our you know, it doesn't quite have the gravity with the sensors
[2:51:44.320 --> 2:51:46.080]  But let me just tell you uh
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:50.400]  De Blasio got the earful and this is what we need to start doing to all of them
[2:51:50.400 --> 2:51:55.440]  They need they need to not feel so safe and comfortable walking these streets whose streets
[2:51:56.720 --> 2:52:00.960]  Let me just try to let me just paraphrase de Blasio walks up in his stupid little face diaper
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:07.120]  And the guy's standing there filming and just goes how are you doing and the guy goes not f-ing good you f-ing

[2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:26.160]  But I mean like see but that's what I love. I remember going to new york when I would go to new york as a kid like

[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:09.520]  I know I need to get down there and I need to get out on the boats with you guys
[2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:12.720]  We'll go gator hunting and everything
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:16.720]  Well, you know, I've been on hold for so long that um, you guys have already touched on a lot of my ideas
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:22.560]  You know, I was just gonna recommend that we need to go and buy the tens of millions very similarly to what we did in
[2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:27.120]  Virginia just go out to the most important places and mobilize and let them know like, hey, we're here
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:30.960]  You want to try us? It's fine, but we're here and we're not going away. We're not gonna roll
[2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:36.720]  We're not gonna take this lying down. I think that's what it is. There needs to be one more richman virginia moment where it's
[2:53:36.720 --> 2:53:41.120]  Whatever the number is, but you know, we're armed to the teeth and it's just one last warning
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:43.280]  It's just like look. This is what you're facing
[2:53:43.920 --> 2:53:47.600]  Okay, and I got news for you. The police are gonna stand down
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:53.120]  The military is not gonna fight the American people. Who do you think is gonna have your back?
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:54:00.080]  Well, I think they think they're gonna be like, well, we're gonna send out Antifa. You just watch you Patriots
[2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:04.400]  And then Antifa is gonna be like, uh, no you guys we don't actually have to do that
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:07.360]  We'd be like, uh, no you guys we don't actually care about you
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:11.680]  We just siphoned off the money that you are paying us to rabble riles around the country
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:15.760]  But actually screw you. We'd like to see you get taken out. So
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:18.800]  Yeah, and we saw what happened when they walked into the wrong neighborhood
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:21.120]  So it's only a matter of time before they all realized
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:24.720]  But um something else too. I wanted to touch on to kind of lift up the spirits
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:28.960]  I think hurry the funniest irony. All right, so we uh hired a young man
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:33.040]  He has Down syndrome who got furlough during the lockdown and it was the funniest thing
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:35.840]  He came up to me the other day. He's like, hey, I like did you watch the debate?
[2:54:35.840 --> 2:54:39.680]  I was like, oh, no, here we go. He was like, I love Donald Trump. He's destroyed Joe Biden
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:45.040]  Everybody all the leftist all the little teeny weenies in my story. They got so uncomfortable
[2:54:45.200 --> 2:54:48.320]  DNA force plus if you did one thing for your immune system
[2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:52.640]  It would be get all the essential things and that's the clean iodine x2 or x3
[2:54:52.800 --> 2:54:57.680]  That's the bio tricillinium that is the vitamin d3 that is the c that is the zinc
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:54:59.760]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential about him
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:01.600]  You die and studies show you really need the other ones too
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:05.680]  But DNA force goes beyond that it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:11.040]  With pqq and coq 10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:17.920]  That unclog them so all that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in as the NIH website says
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:23.520]  And if you have all the proper things they can't replicate like they could but I do this because it's essential like oxygen like water
[2:55:23.520 --> 2:55:26.400]  DNA force sold out for months 50 off out of the gates
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:32.560]  Triple patriot points free shipping info or store.com DNA force election special that's gonna have to end in a week
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:35.360]  We've got a limited supply and it was very hard to get the pqq this time
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:38.960]  A lot of our stuff is you can't get any more a lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:43.920]  That's part of the global's plan info war store.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  I want to thank you all for tuning in
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:55.120]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:56:01.520]  It's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:09.760]  And welcome back this friday afternoon in the election after
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:12.160]  very least
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:13.920]  What a week um
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:19.440]  Busy week here in alaska for me beyond the elections that we're going on and we still won't have our results here
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.640]  Until at least the 10th of november and maybe the 18th
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:25.920]  We're probably the slowest in fact. I believe we are the slowest to report
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.000]  Because we still use paper ballots and ink them up
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:36.400]  So the accounting is still going on here. I'm clearly the delegate votes are headed for trump
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:38.560]  There's three in alaska not too many
[2:56:39.040 --> 2:56:42.960]  But every vote will count this year as we're seeing play out
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:45.840]  You know the previous uh
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:49.040]  Broadcasts the last several days have been dealing with the election results
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:55.280]  So i'm going to deal with a few other aspects of the cycle and what we're dealing with here and
[2:56:56.880 --> 2:56:58.880]  You know we've been in a war
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:04.080]  And it's been an info may information war for 25 years plus and
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:09.840]  I want to make it really clear that this wasn't just uh our war
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:12.640]  It was also called
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:16.160]  Unrestricted warfare now this book which i've been reading this week
[2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:19.040]  This was written by two kernels in the chinese
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:21.520]  um army and it's on
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:27.840]  The nature of war in the 21st century and what's interesting about this book is it was written in 1999
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:35.840]  and our book earth rising revolution written in 1999 and published in 2000 we're quoting the same sources
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:44.000]  And they get into all these really interesting aspects of warfare that we're seeing play out even right now
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:51.360]  Because the chinese approach to warfare is way way different behind me on this rack of books
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:58:00.880]  Is three feet of literature dealing with china alone. All right, and this is going back for ancient literature in terms of chinese philosophy into the modern frame of
[2:58:02.080 --> 2:58:06.240]  warfare, okay, and why is unrestricted warfare
[2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:15.200]  Warfare the nature of warfare in the 21st century because the reliance on technological weaponry to fight the battles
[2:58:16.240 --> 2:58:22.400]  That we've leaned into so heavily negate the quiet the subtle warfare that's been going on
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:28.640]  Forever and it's about information. It's about the hearts and minds of human souls
[2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:34.160]  You see because this is what it is all about. It's a propaganda war. It's an information war first
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:43.280]  And everything else second or third or fourth or fifth way down the chain because if you control the operators
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:45.680]  The human beings
[2:58:45.680 --> 2:58:50.960]  Then you win the war. There is no war to be fought if you control the leadership you take the country
[2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:54.320]  Classical organizing I talked about in the last few weeks
[2:58:55.040 --> 2:58:57.360]  This is what is happening right now
[2:58:57.360 --> 2:59:05.360]  Is because when you're outgunned and outmanned in a direct warfare combat you approach combat way differently
[2:59:06.480 --> 2:59:12.880]  And the chinese philosophy on combat is to never shoot the first bullet never even shoot a bullet if you can help
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:15.440]  to win the war
[2:59:15.440 --> 2:59:16.640]  subtly
[2:59:16.640 --> 2:59:18.080]  through spy craft
[2:59:18.080 --> 2:59:19.600]  through infiltration
[2:59:19.600 --> 2:59:21.120]  through deceit
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:22.240]  through
[2:59:22.240 --> 2:59:24.240]  manipulation of every kind in any kind
[2:59:24.240 --> 2:59:27.600]  Because unrestricted war is what it says
[2:59:28.320 --> 2:59:30.320]  no rule
[2:59:30.640 --> 2:59:32.080]  Let me say that again
[2:59:32.080 --> 2:59:37.760]  No rule you see because a lot of the specter of warfare now is about
[2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:40.400]  little bits of data
[2:59:40.800 --> 2:59:45.520]  Flowing electrons flowing through wires all over the world wirelessly
[2:59:46.160 --> 2:59:48.560]  Broadcasts happening things happening
[2:59:48.560 --> 2:59:54.880]  But all of this is about information right if you go back deep enough fact far enough
[2:59:55.200 --> 3:00:00.960]  Where do you where do you control the heart of a population the mind of a population?
[3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:03.360]  It's through their medium
[3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:07.440]  Who owns so much of our medium now how much of it is owned by china in terms of?
[3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:09.440]  the
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:11.440]  entertainment industry
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:14.560]  An entertainment industry is not entertaining
[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:21.920]  It's prepositioning ideas and the consciousness of men and women in a manner which is unrestricted
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:26.800]  And after all it's not political. It's only entertainment. Well, it is
[3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:34.480]  Every breath you take every bit of data sent your way has an intention behind it
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:42.960]  Okay, and this intention is shaping the direction of too much of the public debate and what's being ignored is
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:44.960]  This conflict
[3:00:45.040 --> 3:00:53.520]  Um between the united states and russia as portrayed by the democrats or the conflict between the united states and china has
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:58.720]  Uh reflected by many conservatives. So what is really going on here?
[3:00:59.440 --> 3:01:03.840]  First of all, let me let me talk about russia in the context of of how i see the
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:07.360]  I don't think russia wants a fight with the united states
[3:01:07.360 --> 3:01:14.080]  I I really don't what they want is to be able to develop within their sphere of traditional influence
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:18.560]  An economic base that is so powerful that it overwhelms the work
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:25.920]  Okay, and and they're doing it. Okay, if you don't pay attention to where real wealth is you better look at russia
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:32.080]  czar's russia and the direction of of russian thinking at that time over a hundred years ago
[3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:34.720]  was about a new
[3:01:34.720 --> 3:01:40.240]  Roman empire a new empire you see and if you look at where they sit on the map and how much of the
[3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:44.400]  world landmass they control and then you look across
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:47.440]  At alaska what they used to have
[3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:50.880]  And they used to actually have the west coast because they were the first
[3:01:51.280 --> 3:01:56.640]  A discoverers, you know, they had established forts as far as california and organ people don't remember that
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:01.920]  But they didn't have the military might to defend the territory and they thought they were going to lose it
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:06.320]  And the british thought they were going to lose it too and the dialogue between the parties was
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:08.880]  Try and get the america's not to take it all
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:17.440]  Because we would have most likely and the treaty of secession for alaska was 1867 just after the civil war ended
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:19.040]  right
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:22.880]  And the british were were concerned about what was going on in the united states, obviously
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:26.720]  They looked at canada as a big resource base that they still controlled one of their
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:31.360]  colonies british columbia and and the other holdings within the america's
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:38.720]  You know what we're fighting about today is the same thing that was being fought over hundreds of years ago
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:40.800]  It's the wealth of nations
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:43.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's in play
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:49.760]  Wherever you're hearing this broadcast in the world. It's the wealth of your nation that is in play
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:52.960]  Now think about russia
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:59.600]  Okay, budin is not going to be there forever and whether we agree that it's a democratic process or something else
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:05.200]  I'm not going to weigh in on that. That's up to the russian people to weigh in on and decide and at this point
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:12.240]  I would say the country continues to prosper continues to develop as a democracy and it will take time
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:18.240]  And it's not going to happen overnight. You got 70 years almost a century to unravel
[3:03:18.240 --> 3:03:24.640]  Um, and that's just being done, you know, it's been a hundred years plus since the russian revolution
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:32.320]  That brought the communists in and then you look at what's happening in the united states under different words words and different phrases
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:34.800]  And a different narrative. Okay
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:42.960]  It's a narrative of the 1930s. It's the narrative of the early 1900s in russia. It's a communist narrative
[3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:49.200]  A socialist narrative being played out in the united states even today with a new set of words to make it feel good
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:53.200]  Words hide the deception
[3:03:53.840 --> 3:03:55.520]  If you're deceived
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:03:57.920]  You don't know it. That's one of the tricks of deception
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:03.440]  I heard owens say in the last hour that we got to be careful because we're about to become slaves
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:08.720]  I agree with that except I would say it even stronger. I'd say we already lost that one
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:11.120]  We lost it with the 13th amendment
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:14.240]  Uh, we lost it when uh, when
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:16.960]  income taxes was made legal
[3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:18.480]  and when
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:23.040]  Um involuntary servitude to your government was made legal
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:25.920]  You see, we were made slaves then
[3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:31.360]  Because the income tax when it started wasn't going to affect any of us that are talking right now
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:36.080]  The average soul wasn't affected. You had to make over 25,000 a year
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:38.480]  in 1913
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:41.280]  Now I got to put that in a little bit of perspective
[3:04:41.520 --> 3:04:44.880]  Multiply that by 100 times for today's
[3:04:45.440 --> 3:04:49.280]  Current valuation just looking at gold value as a standard. Okay
[3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:52.240]  100 times more
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:54.480]  not
[3:04:54.480 --> 3:04:56.480]  Not a quarter of a million
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:05:01.920]  2.5 million is where in today's dollar the income tax would have stopped would most americans
[3:05:02.320 --> 3:05:03.520]  Agreed on that
[3:05:03.520 --> 3:05:09.280]  Well, we're about to see because that's what's being proposed again. You see is that tax that wealth tax
[3:05:10.080 --> 3:05:12.080]  It's another layer
[3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:13.520]  laid on
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:18.000]  To everyone ultimately if you stop and think about it because we're not asking the first question is
[3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:25.760]  Why do we have an income tax on our labor? Why are we enslaved to our government through our labor?
[3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:28.320]  We've already done that
[3:05:28.320 --> 3:05:32.800]  We need to re-examine the whole foundation and this election has stirred it up
[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:37.200]  We're going to be right back. This is dr. Nick Davis and you're listening to the info war
[3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:58.160]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iphone
[3:05:58.160 --> 3:06:04.880]  You simply go to band.video with your safari browser, then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen
[3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:08.320]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen
[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:12.720]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video
[3:06:13.280 --> 3:06:18.480]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen despite the fact that tim cook tried to stop it
[3:06:18.720 --> 3:06:23.600]  The globalists think you're lazy but by taking a little bit of action you can override them have the app
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:29.280]  And then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[3:06:29.600 --> 3:06:33.680]  And click the share buttons below on your email on facebook on twitter on youtube
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:36.800]  However, you want be sure and share band.video
[3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:47.760]  Look it up for yourself the head of the devos group issued a report more than six months ago
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:53.520]  Calling for world government to be openly established to respond to covid-19
[3:06:53.920 --> 3:06:58.080]  The covid-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint
[3:06:58.560 --> 3:07:03.520]  Since then prince charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing
[3:07:04.320 --> 3:07:07.360]  The most ancient form of total war is called
[3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:09.280]  siege
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:13.920]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down
[3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:18.400]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump
[3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:23.520]  That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:28.320]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives
[3:07:28.880 --> 3:07:35.520]  With the social credit score surveillance threat. So you've heard the u.s. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:39.680]  Well, that's what the lockdown is doing. It's starving the third world millions and millions of death
[3:07:39.680 --> 3:07:43.920]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission
[3:07:46.800 --> 3:07:49.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:08.720]  The alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:10.080]  with
[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:10.880]  nick
[3:08:10.880 --> 3:08:12.880]  baggage
[3:08:17.040 --> 3:08:20.560]  Welcome back to this hour of the uh of info wars, you know
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:26.960]  Um, I just to remind people check out the info war store support the network in that way. That's how things happen here
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:32.640]  Um, it keeps everything going. So info war store dot com. Check it out and also check out
[3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:38.320]  My site earth pulse dot com it links you straight in if you're interested in books and videos to the info war store
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:42.880]  Which is where ours are offered. Um, check us out. Uh, earth pulse dot com
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:48.480]  You know get back into the subject of today, you know, I was talking a little bit before the break about russia
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:52.880]  And where I kind of see them and as a matter of disclosure, I I do make my living
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:59.840]  Uh, to a certain extent from things I export that do end up in russia, ukraine eastern europe all over europe
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:04.320]  Protected in a hundred countries around the world. Um, but this is what I know
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:09.440]  I've had the opportunity to meet thousands of uh, average russian people ukrainians
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:12.560]  Georgians lots of different people and this is what I know
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:15.600]  They're really just like you and me
[3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:22.720]  They're living souls just like you and me with the same aspirations the same hopes dreams for our children
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:26.240]  But what we have around the world in a lot of places
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:31.840]  Um, like china is leadership that does not reflect the soul of a nation necessarily
[3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:34.560]  You know think about chinese
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:40.160]  Um population in terms of mindset, you know, they were the dominant force in the world for millennium
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:44.640]  You know, uh, only the last few hundred years did they lose their position?
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:49.440]  But when you think about what's happening now the opportunity
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:57.440]  Presented by the chaos in the united states and this is what I have warned about and I'm I'm suggesting again. We need to be
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:06.400]  Eyes all open. Okay, because the opportunity to push a country around is in these times the chinese
[3:10:07.440 --> 3:10:16.240]  Who get it have been waiting for this opportunity and then they helped create it with a pandemic and with the manipulation of the united nations
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:19.040]  And talk about the united nations for just a moment
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:25.200]  Because increasingly we hear more and more about the power of the united nations
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:28.080]  And in my view as an american
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:30.800]  They can be an advisory group
[3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:34.800]  But they have no right to legislate a thing that affects me
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:37.840]  Because nobody elected anyone in the u.m.
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:44.560]  And this is a basic principle in the united states from the very founding of our foundation was
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:46.560]  That you voted
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:52.160]  That government people that took action on our behalf required our consent
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:54.960]  as a fundamental basic
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:10:57.840]  human aspect of life on this planet
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:01.040]  The consent of the governed
[3:11:02.080 --> 3:11:04.080]  No one gave consent
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:06.160]  the united nations
[3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:08.160]  No one gave consent
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:12.080]  To a lot of institutions that called themselves governments around the world
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:14.640]  But it is up to the sovereign people of those nations
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:18.240]  To rise up and be heard within their boundaries
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:21.600]  Within this country we still have a us supreme court
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:26.720]  And that us supreme court is going to rule on everything we see happening in our nation right now
[3:11:26.720 --> 3:11:29.040]  And this is why we have three branches of government
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:35.040]  Because when the legislative and the executive get in a fight like they're in right now
[3:11:35.600 --> 3:11:40.000]  We have an opportunity to see that fight resolved by the us supreme court
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:43.760]  And I think we need to give confidence to the supreme court at the moment
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:48.480]  We don't need to change the number of the supreme court justices. This is another
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:51.280]  slide by the democrats
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:58.160]  To corrupt the last branch of government the third branch of government corrupt that one too
[3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:02.160]  You know, we saw what happened to donald trump with so many of his insiders
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:04.960]  That weren't loyal to him
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:09.680]  That were there to disrupt and create chaos within his administration
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:13.520]  And he found most of them and chased them out during the course of it
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:19.600]  But he didn't have a full chance. We still have four more years. I don't think this is settled yet
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:22.720]  People need to remain calm right now
[3:12:23.360 --> 3:12:24.640]  We need to be
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:26.000]  supporting
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:29.840]  The inquiries we need to get to the bottom. We need to protect whistleblowers
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:32.800]  We need to call forward those whistleblowers make sure they're protected
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:38.320]  Because we need the truth of the integrity of this election more so than any time in our history
[3:12:39.440 --> 3:12:43.280]  This is a turning point not just for this nation but for the world
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:47.040]  And we can either accept the turning point and turn the wrong direction
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:52.400]  Or we can turn it around and begin to reclaim this democracy this republic
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:58.160]  And begin to be the light in the world through our example not through our imposition of our ideas
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:00.960]  Our ideas stand on their own
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:08.800]  The ideas of what human beings are stands on its own and needs nothing to support who we are and what we are is living soul
[3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:11.840]  That is what we are. There's nothing to defend in that
[3:13:12.720 --> 3:13:16.160]  But there is something to project through that through our living
[3:13:17.040 --> 3:13:18.720]  experience on this
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:24.240]  And we can decide as individuals to capitulate to lay down and die. That's always our choice
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:26.880]  Or we can say no
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:29.440]  We're going to stand up. We're going to recognize who we are
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:34.800]  We're going to begin to act on what we believe it is right and true and we're going to do it in a responsible way
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:38.320]  In a way that changes the world that helps change the opinion
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:41.280]  But let's get behind
[3:13:41.280 --> 3:13:45.200]  The litigations that are going to happen. Let's make sure that it it makes it
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:50.800]  Through the process. Let's get all those votes counted that are legitimate and let's figure out where the fraud is
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:53.360]  And let's get some people arrested this time for god's sake
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:13:56.240]  How much of this hijacking
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:13:58.240]  goes unnoticed?
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:00.880]  None of it. How many are in jail?
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:04.240]  The wrong ones ladies and gentlemen
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:07.040]  We need to reclaim
[3:14:07.040 --> 3:14:08.240]  the ground
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:11.680]  that we have not lost yet. We need to hold the ground that we have
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:15.200]  Get the votes in get the challenges completed
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:18.720]  And then inaugurate our next president Donald Trump
[3:14:20.240 --> 3:14:24.240]  Let's wait and see. Just stay calm. That's a big message today
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:26.240]  Who's our real adversary in this?
[3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:31.840]  It's China. Think about it. All these lockdowns started with the Chinese virus
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:37.840]  Yes, the Chinese virus and if you don't think they they took advantage of that read the book
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:40.640]  This is their book
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:46.640]  This is their philosophy. This is their way of winning the war. This was a grand opportunity
[3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:54.160]  to completely crush the west economy without firing a shot. How successful have they been?
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:14:58.720]  Look around you
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:05.120]  Half the small businesses this country have been crushed as if we'd just been invaded and bombed into oblivion
[3:15:05.920 --> 3:15:07.920]  And not a shot was fired
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:13.200]  Think about the change in our political comp composition of the country
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:16.400]  You know, this isn't some big landslide
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:19.600]  It's a hijack
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:25.680]  That's being projected and supported by those that have much bigger interest
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:31.760]  And keep the peripheral vision open start looking around seeing what else is going on in the world because opportunity
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:34.800]  For bad actors has presented itself again
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:38.800]  Now think back on the 15 day the two week
[3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:44.880]  Lockdown has turned into a 10 year sentence for every American
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:51.440]  What the hell is going on and why are we accepting this as our new normal?
[3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:53.760]  No, our new normal
[3:15:53.840 --> 3:16:00.640]  Is to come back into who we are begin to assert what we are in the world be able to accept some risks relative to our health
[3:16:01.040 --> 3:16:06.560]  Because you got bigger risk of dying a medical malpractice than most of the things that people are worrying about
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:08.560]  You have a greater risk
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:10.320]  Um
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:13.760]  Of getting struck by lightning than some of the things that they're talking about
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:17.040]  Okay, so let's stay calm
[3:16:17.680 --> 3:16:22.480]  Let's remember who we are is living souls and the power that we have when we link together
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:25.040]  Recognize what we are and begin to push
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:30.640]  And combine that emotion that intellect into action that we know is right and true
[3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:36.720]  This is dr. Nick baggage. We're on the info wars and you're in this war because you are the tip of the spear. We'll be right back
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:44.480]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media
[3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:51.200]  What am I most proud of when it comes to the show and it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research
[3:16:51.440 --> 3:16:54.560]  With what the club of Rome and the cfr and others were actually saying
[3:16:54.560 --> 3:17:00.880]  Develop the hypothesis that the communist china had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to china
[3:17:01.040 --> 3:17:04.160]  And then make us economically destitute and position us into debt
[3:17:04.640 --> 3:17:08.800]  Well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:12.800]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again
[3:17:12.800 --> 3:17:16.160]  It wasn't that hard the cfr and others admitted what they were doing
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:19.760]  But still others didn't want to focus on that issue
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:23.840]  We did and you focused on it by supporting us and info wars
[3:17:23.840 --> 3:17:28.560]  So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great supplements books t-shirts films
[3:17:28.800 --> 3:17:34.240]  Water filtration air filtration all of it. You're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:38.320]  What's really happening? So that's a big accomplishment for all of you. I want to thank you for your support
[3:17:41.680 --> 3:17:46.720]  There are many references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that?
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:48.880]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:54.160]  But a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:18:00.240]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects. They didn't know why
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:06.480]  Well with modern science, we know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of selenium

[3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:48.480]  The days of hell the nightmare is here
[3:18:49.520 --> 3:18:52.800]  79 days of hell has begun
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:19:00.000]  multinational corporations the mainstream media apparatus and social media tech giants
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:09.040]  Are all now being deployed by the archaic inbred crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 u.s. elections
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:16.160]  Remove the populist champion of the people donald j trump and install the decrepit perverted
[3:19:16.720 --> 3:19:19.600]  traitorous establishment puppet joe biden
[3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:22.320]  along with rabid radical hag
[3:19:22.720 --> 3:19:24.720]  Kamala Harris
[3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:31.920]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79 days dot news for tomorrow's news today
[3:19:33.520 --> 3:19:40.480]  79 days dot news america's last stand 79 days dot news
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:51.040]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:51.040 --> 3:20:02.400]  With nick baggage
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:13.440]  It's always good to be here on the friday afternoons, you know, it's a uh
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:17.040]  Still just a little bit before noon here in my part of the world, but
[3:20:17.040 --> 3:20:25.440]  You know when I think about sort of the wrap-up of each week, you know and try to bring some things into perspective and try and pick the points that are
[3:20:26.480 --> 3:20:33.680]  Not try to repeat everything that's been done all week long with all of the other hosts, but try and isolate some angles that maybe we haven't considered
[3:20:34.160 --> 3:20:40.400]  But also to talk about the spiritual mention and to remember who we are because oftentimes it's these times
[3:20:41.040 --> 3:20:43.040]  when fear rises in us
[3:20:43.600 --> 3:20:45.600]  And this is a very important point
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:52.160]  And this is what we have to guard against fear not, you know the angel always says as soon as they arrive
[3:20:52.880 --> 3:20:57.280]  Because this is what shuts down our higher capacities our created capacities
[3:20:57.840 --> 3:21:00.560]  If we fall into the flesh in those moments of fear
[3:21:01.440 --> 3:21:05.040]  We're lost and that's what it really represents is loss
[3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:10.000]  In every respect of the dignity of who we are is lost in fear
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:11.840]  you see
[3:21:11.840 --> 3:21:12.880]  because
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:16.240]  This idea of coming in and recognizing
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:21.120]  You know that we are walking on the water in the midst of the storm and we're standing in the quiet spot
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:26.720]  The center of it if we can hold our center and and this is metaphorical as well
[3:21:26.720 --> 3:21:32.640]  You know, it's like a saying hold your center stay in the center. We're in the center of the storm
[3:21:33.840 --> 3:21:40.080]  This has always been the storm and every once in a while we get grabbed and pulled into the mix and thrown around a bit
[3:21:40.080 --> 3:21:43.280]  But we need to find our calm in the middle of that storm
[3:21:43.760 --> 3:21:46.080]  We need to find our focus in the middle of that storm
[3:21:46.400 --> 3:21:48.400]  We need to combine our intellect
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:51.440]  With our heart and our intention and then begin to project
[3:21:52.160 --> 3:21:55.520]  Deliberately in the middle of that storm and then the storm calm
[3:21:56.960 --> 3:22:01.840]  And the seas are parted in front of us because that's the way in which this battle will be won
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:07.920]  It'll be won on the platform of values. It'll be run on the platform of knowing
[3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:13.200]  That the greatest power of all is the one that decides and we're just the
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:15.920]  Players on the board to a certain extent
[3:22:16.880 --> 3:22:18.880]  But we still have our free will
[3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:24.160]  We still have the essence of what we were created to do and to be if we can just remember long enough
[3:22:25.280 --> 3:22:27.680]  To press back into the world in a different way
[3:22:28.640 --> 3:22:35.040]  You know when I think about the world events, you know, what happens when you suppress a population for a long time is eventually
[3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:40.080]  They stopped accepting that as a standard. We saw it happen in Russia in the 90s
[3:22:40.640 --> 3:22:42.640]  as a whole thing fell apart
[3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:46.000]  spontaneously all through Eastern Europe fell apart change
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:51.120]  And it changed because of the hearts and minds of people came into a new place
[3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:57.840]  And decided to assert themselves a little bit differently. And if you remember very few shots were ever fired. It was calm
[3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:01.120]  It was done even in the calm of the battle
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:06.000]  Uh, as we saw it reshaped, but the battle lines that are drawn today
[3:23:06.560 --> 3:23:12.160]  Are ideological battle lines that didn't change with the so-called end of a cold war
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:17.280]  In fact, they continued on and what happened is we got sucked in
[3:23:18.240 --> 3:23:21.120]  by the new world order with Henry Kissinger
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:26.240]  Brzezinski during the next administration opening the gate to China
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:31.360]  So we could pour with a fire hose all that we had developed for 200 years in technology
[3:23:31.440 --> 3:23:33.680]  Just hand it off where they could just steal it
[3:23:34.800 --> 3:23:41.360]  And we talk about intellectual property rights being protected. We've heard all this crap from the last administration
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:44.240]  The obama administration and as a person
[3:23:44.880 --> 3:23:50.720]  Who's been a victim of intellectual theft in the united states? I can tell you the federal government does nothing
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:56.880]  It's up to you to fight it in the civil court. They don't enforce the law as a criminality of it. No, no, no
[3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:02.640]  That's selectively done for those that have power. I guarantee you they stand behind the rights of bill gates
[3:24:03.600 --> 3:24:05.600]  And other people that own intellectual property
[3:24:06.240 --> 3:24:08.880]  But it is not a fair play flat platform
[3:24:08.960 --> 3:24:15.040]  It's a platform designed for the rich the powerful and and those that would dominate the rest of the world
[3:24:15.600 --> 3:24:17.600]  And I don't say this loosely
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:21.760]  I've been there. I've seen that. I've been all over the world
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:27.760]  I've met presidents vice presidents congressmen senders hundreds of them in my lifetime and this is what I know
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:31.200]  They all have deep
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:35.440]  philosophies in in some level a lot of them are just props
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:40.000]  shoved in because they a good mouthpiece and they'll say whatever they're told
[3:24:40.960 --> 3:24:42.960]  A lot of them are put there deliberately
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:48.720]  Because they've blackmailed them all the way to the top. They've extorted all the way to the top
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:51.680]  Because a lot of these people are corrupted
[3:24:52.240 --> 3:24:54.240]  What we need now more than ever
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:00.640]  Are whistleblowers and whistleblower mechanisms to protect them so people can come forward
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:03.760]  And I'm not saying disclose the national secrets
[3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:09.600]  I'm saying disclose the national sins those things that violate the essence of who we are as americans
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:14.160]  We need transparency at a level that we've never seen before
[3:25:14.720 --> 3:25:19.280]  We need the truth of what's going on in our government. What's been hidden from us for decades
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:22.560]  We need to break down the walls
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:27.200]  Of secrecy that have corrupted this country. Let me talk about that
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:30.320]  You know in the in the 70s when we went through all this stuff the last time
[3:25:30.720 --> 3:25:35.920]  During the nix administration and we got the funeral information act and everybody thought how wonderful this was
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:39.040]  But it's the biggest fraud on america
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:46.880]  Ever because it didn't bring accountability only within government organizations private contractors are excluded
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:49.760]  In case you haven't watched the narrative in the last 50 years
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:52.720]  It shoved it all out the door anything
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:58.880]  Viable anything important for us to know about is now subcontract not such free information act
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:04.880]  And we need to extend and modify the free information act to extend every government contractor
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:09.760]  So that we have full transparency that we can get in and find out what's going on
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:12.960]  This has gone on too long
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:16.960]  Looking for ways to skirt the law instead of honor the law is what's wrong
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:24.560]  With our leadership at the bureaucratic level. It's not about meeting the requirements of the laws. How do we side step?
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:26.560]  How do we sneak around?
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:30.480]  The american public are sick and tired of being
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:34.560]  Snuck around and pigeon-holed and pushed around we're tired of
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:39.920]  Happens all over the world all different ways and we're seeing what's happening right now
[3:26:40.800 --> 3:26:44.000]  These people are sitting at the edge of uncertainty
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:46.880]  Let's stay calm
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:48.880]  Let's let it play a little further
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:52.080]  And then let's see what we have to do and you'll know you'll know in your heart
[3:26:52.160 --> 3:26:56.480]  You'll know in your head the tool comes together and you'll see clearly what you need to do and we'll do it
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:02.160]  But thinking about the future for our children
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:06.080]  How about better yet for our great great-grandchildren that none of us know?
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:09.680]  Can we visualize a future for them that's better?
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:14.400]  That's built on a sense of values a sense of strength a sense of what we are
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:19.840]  Can we reinvigorate those value statements and bring us together as americas?
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:25.760]  Even if we're really different culturally if we're really different in terms of our religious thinking can we not hold?
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:29.200]  Some values together in common and I believe we can't
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:34.560]  I see in my own family play out every holiday season and a lot of times in the middle
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:36.960]  Because we're all over the map politically
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:42.240]  And the important piece of it is it's a dialogue
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:48.560]  What we see happening right now is a manipulation by the left on steroids
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:54.480]  When we get back in the next segment, I'm going to get into china and russia and all of it
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:28:00.640]  But I want to talk about privacy within the context of what I see as a digital google law
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:03.600]  And and here's how I see it and I mentioned in the last segment
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:09.200]  I was talking about the income tax and what that started as and what that became and you know the income tax that
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:12.800]  Started in today's dollars at about two and a half million in income
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:17.360]  Everybody making less wouldn't be paying any if they just kept the standard
[3:28:18.880 --> 3:28:23.200]  And the top payers making a hell of a lot more their top rate was six percent
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:26.960]  Today I can tell you they take about 30 percent for me
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:30.560]  So 30 percent of my life. I'm enslaved to the federal government
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:34.240]  Okay, now I don't pay a lot of bank interest so I'm not enslaved to them
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:38.240]  But most americans pay about a third of their income to banks in the form of interest
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:43.440]  So you're a slave to the bankers and you're a slave to the federal government and your state government to have an income tax
[3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:45.200]  We don't in alaska
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:51.360]  But the point the matter is they control for most people as much as upper middle class middle class people
[3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:57.680]  They're controlling as much as 60 percent of our productive wealth coming out of our living souls
[3:28:57.840 --> 3:29:02.000]  They take claim to either an interest or they grab it for
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:06.080]  Some other puff money for somebody else's
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:09.280]  A national wet dream that isn't ours
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:16.240]  And then we let the gates of the world operate nonprofits not contribute up any to this
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:20.800]  And tie up billions and billions of dollars to tell us how to live
[3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:27.200]  And no accountability whatsoever and we're subsidizing every breath they take because they don't pay
[3:29:28.080 --> 3:29:34.320]  To play and we all do this is dr. Nick baggage. We're the tip of the spear and you're on it and you're in it with us
[3:29:34.640 --> 3:29:36.640]  We'll be right back after these brief messages
[3:29:40.480 --> 3:29:43.520]  Election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses
[3:29:43.520 --> 3:29:50.160]  We have all won by exposing the common Chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings
[3:29:50.720 --> 3:29:54.960]  By exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil
[3:29:55.520 --> 3:29:59.680]  Now i'm personally a christian and i believe in god and i know god's real and i've experienced it in my life
[3:30:00.160 --> 3:30:01.840]  But even you don't believe in god
[3:30:01.840 --> 3:30:05.040]  It's important to recognize that there is good in this world. There is evil
[3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:08.800]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that
[3:30:08.800 --> 3:30:15.680]  And what i see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that
[3:30:16.240 --> 3:30:18.880]  They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore
[3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:21.520]  Don't ever project your decency
[3:30:22.080 --> 3:30:28.240]  And your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who they are or you're going to get hurt
[3:30:28.720 --> 3:30:32.880]  But those of you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful
[3:30:32.880 --> 3:30:39.920]  Will then come together with those organizations and support them like info wars is without your support info wars would not exist
[3:30:41.040 --> 3:30:45.760]  It's all on record. Yale, harvard, princeton, stanford
[3:30:46.240 --> 3:30:48.240]  They were all hired a year ago
[3:30:48.880 --> 3:30:54.560]  And then against six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[3:30:54.960 --> 3:30:56.880]  And how to get the public to take
[3:30:56.880 --> 3:31:04.720]  Anoculations and they talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't this has all been psychologically tested
[3:31:05.840 --> 3:31:11.360]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent
[3:31:11.920 --> 3:31:18.320]  That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right
[3:31:19.040 --> 3:31:20.080]  No
[3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:24.640]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killers fan. He's taking us
[3:31:24.640 --> 3:31:29.520]  To his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory
[3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:32.720]  We got to bust out of this thing now. We got to say no now
[3:31:32.960 --> 3:31:36.560]  We got to make a run for it now what we still can't once he gets us in that basement
[3:31:36.960 --> 3:31:39.920]  It's going to get a lot a lot worse folks. So stop submitting

[3:33:46.880 --> 3:34:03.360]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide, it's nick baggage
[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:07.360]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:14.320]  So good to be here. It's always good to be here even in these painless moments
[3:34:14.320 --> 3:34:19.200]  Here it's always good to be here even in these chaotic times around the world as we're watching
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:21.840]  the election results unfold
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:24.320]  And the drama continues
[3:34:24.800 --> 3:34:29.200]  I was before the break I was talking about the digital gulag as I call it, you know
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:33.600]  And kind of what we've allowed to be constructed all around us because we're in it
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:38.480]  You know whether we know it or not and in this election cycle we saw
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:44.160]  Uh information utilized like it's never been used for uh to really pack
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:46.720]  Uh the brainwashing methods
[3:34:47.360 --> 3:34:49.440]  The new world order and let me tell you something
[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:52.480]  This has been uh
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:59.280]  A classic I mean from my perspective because those that are so lost on the mainstream news feeds
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:03.440]  Whether it's fox or cnn and are just dialed into that tunnel
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:09.840]  Open up your eyes because we need to broaden the perspective. You need to know what your adversary's thinking
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:13.280]  Obviously, you need to know what your allies are thinking but more importantly
[3:35:13.680 --> 3:35:18.960]  You need to know what the heart of god is thinking and begin to act that way because what we're seeing in the hearts of men
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:24.560]  Is a lot of fear driving too many decisions and they're not the kind of decisions that we're going to appreciate down the road
[3:35:25.040 --> 3:35:27.040]  It cannot be driven by fear
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:29.200]  It has to be driven by something deeper
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:35.200]  Something greater something more powerful something that represents the essence of what god is and that's love
[3:35:35.600 --> 3:35:40.000]  This is a real different equation ladies and gentlemen, and how do we manifest that in the world?
[3:35:40.800 --> 3:35:45.440]  Each of us has to find our path have to find our way have to find the center of our soul
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:48.720]  To project that because in that is the power of change
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:55.440]  And it's the change that we need to see because what's happening right now is a degradation of what we are
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:36:00.640]  It's the stripping of us of our humanity and that is not what should happen the opposite should happen
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:07.760]  But when you take take take take take and begin to wrap each person in a bubble of information
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:10.960]  That entraps them
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:13.520]  You see because
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:17.600]  What the goal is here? It's not to know every transaction on the internet
[3:36:18.400 --> 3:36:20.640]  Not to know about all the data in your house
[3:36:20.640 --> 3:36:25.360]  It's ultimately to control all the data in your head
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:28.880]  Now think about this for a moment
[3:36:29.200 --> 3:36:32.240]  There was a video produced by pbs almost 20 years ago
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:38.560]  And it's called the worldwide mind. I used to carry it on my website. I don't anymore, but you ought to go look it up
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:44.000]  The worldwide mind and what they said is the shift that was happening that would come
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:46.960]  Would be like the internet only instead of
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:51.200]  All of us being hooked up by computers would be linked up mentally
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:54.400]  through our heads
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:58.560]  Now think about what some of these morons are projecting for the world this
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:01.200]  merging of
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:02.400]  electronics
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:08.080]  In our heads you see because then we can see the internet live right in our brains on real time
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:11.760]  This this change
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:17.920]  In the way we see it is really what it's about because we already are linked
[3:37:18.960 --> 3:37:21.440]  It's the essence of what we actually are
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:26.800]  It's consciousness itself. It's the essence of God that's in each of us
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:31.200]  Whether we know it or not whether we can awaken it or not whether we can see it or not
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:38.400]  It's there and this already links us. It's what the new world order fears the most is empowered human soul
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:42.400]  Because it only takes one
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:44.560]  And there are millions
[3:37:45.040 --> 3:37:47.760]  Rising into the strength of who they are
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:52.000]  Remembering what we are and where we're headed and what we're doing
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:55.280]  And we're gonna and it's not going to be the guy leading the parade
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:37:59.680]  It's gonna be the cab driver. It'll be the truck drivers. It's gonna be the clerk and the grocery store
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:03.360]  You see because we're all created equal
[3:38:04.560 --> 3:38:06.160]  In that sense
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:11.200]  And our core we all have as great a potential as any other living soul on this planet
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:15.840]  And more so if we link our mind to the mind of God
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:18.880]  And it already is
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:25.280]  It already is the separation is our own. It's our own choices is how we evaluate the world and what we choose to do with
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:29.600]  That's what either separates us from God or brings us into unity with God
[3:38:29.600 --> 3:38:36.800]  Pick it ladies and gentlemen pursue the truth seek the face of God and he'll show himself to you
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:42.560]  I know that to be the truth and I know there's those listening right now. They're saying oh, but you didn't mention Jesus
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:44.720]  Okay, I'll mention Jesus for you
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:47.760]  But I want to appeal
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:49.760]  To all of us that know what that means
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:54.000]  To understand the mystery of that message
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:38:57.920]  That not only were we forgiven
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:04.560]  Not only can we forgive others, but most importantly we need to forgive ourselves
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:09.200]  We need to fall into the forgiveness that we've claimed
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:12.080]  And release it
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:16.720]  Now in this moment right now as we're hearing this broadcast and accept
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:18.480]  that
[3:39:18.480 --> 3:39:20.240]  forgive
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:22.800]  And then find the power in it
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:26.240]  Find the moment of it
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:29.440]  Find the freedom in it as you think about
[3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:39.040]  What the power of the universe is and that it flows through each of us if we will just get a little bit out of the way
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:45.760]  See, it's our flesh that gets in the way our materialistic part of us the fleshy nature of our bodies
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:47.600]  you see because
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:54.640]  This body wants to live it drives the ego it wants to survive it fears death every breath it takes because it knows it's finite
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:39:56.640]  In its form
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:00.000]  And it pushes us around and we let it do it
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:04.080]  It's the it's the fight against the flesh that we read about that we hear about
[3:40:04.720 --> 3:40:07.680]  I want to put it in a modern context if I can
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:14.720]  As long as we're falling in fear and worry and we're letting it carry the day
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:17.280]  We have lost the fight
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:19.280]  We have succumbed to the evil in the world
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:22.240]  That feeds on fear as a fuel
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:26.880]  Don't feed the beast with your fear
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.520]  I know it's hard to release it sometimes because things come against us all that
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:35.840]  Fall into your faith and not some blurry
[3:40:36.560 --> 3:40:39.520]  fictitious and fall into what you know to be right and true
[3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:44.080]  And if you have one segment of doubt and what is right and true, don't say it's true
[3:40:44.960 --> 3:40:46.960]  Say you want to know and seek
[3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:53.280]  So you can know the truth of what it is you're looking for to accept anything and say oh, I believe just because I want to
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:58.240]  Believe in something. This is what too much of the world has been doing. You see it's powerless thought
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:01.200]  What you know
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:02.560]  That's power
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:08.080]  That's faith what you know to be right and true that you act on that you begin to do as your
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:14.080]  Daily ritual you wake up in the morning you engage your prayer you set your intent for the day
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:17.600]  You combine your mind and your heart and you go fearlessly
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:19.760]  into the world
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:23.280]  And do what you can to make it a little bit different
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:30.080]  That's it. Just a little bit not what you can't do as I've said before not the impossible the possible for you
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:33.760]  Begin to do that on a platform of values and the world will change
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:36.960]  But if we do nothing
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:40.560]  If we continue to sit back and just sort of say well we lost that one
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:43.600]  No, we didn't lose anything
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:51.120]  We've got an intermission going on and a and the battle yet to unfold and let us ask each other the question
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:54.800]  What do we want the country to look like in 50 years?
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:41:57.440]  Do we want a socialist system?
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:41:59.600]  Because that's where we're headed right now
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:06.240]  We want a system that recognizes the sovereignty of the individual soul and the potential of each individual
[3:42:07.440 --> 3:42:09.440]  within a collective
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:11.440]  within a government
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:14.020]  Individuals forming something real
[3:42:14.500 --> 3:42:21.220]  Sovereigns as individuals as countries even sovereigns. We need to respect the sovereignty of each nation
[3:42:21.940 --> 3:42:26.500]  Respect the sovereignty of the living souls within that nation to have a self-determined form of government
[3:42:27.780 --> 3:42:29.780]  That's what we need to see
[3:42:29.860 --> 3:42:34.420]  Self-determination from my perspective is the essence of when our creative
[3:42:34.980 --> 3:42:37.060]  When our essence comes out of our core
[3:42:37.060 --> 3:42:40.820]  So where people are suppressed in the world like China look for revolution
[3:42:41.380 --> 3:42:48.020]  Where people are suppressed like Russia in certain respects expect political revolution changes in the politic political make
[3:42:48.580 --> 3:42:51.940]  But that will happen. It will always happen over time
[3:42:52.660 --> 3:42:54.660]  But I trust the integrity
[3:42:55.140 --> 3:42:56.980]  of living souls
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:43:00.980]  Enough of us recognizing what we are to make the difference in the world
[3:43:01.300 --> 3:43:04.820]  That's why I remain a an eternal optimist in the middle of the fight
[3:43:04.820 --> 3:43:09.540]  As much as we see things falling apart around us. I still remain optimistic because I believe
[3:43:10.660 --> 3:43:12.100]  I believe
[3:43:12.100 --> 3:43:14.980]  That we can overcome any obstacle placed in front of us
[3:43:16.260 --> 3:43:19.940]  That we have the power that we as living souls have the ability
[3:43:20.740 --> 3:43:24.580]  The government is afraid of us. They're afraid of people fully engaged
[3:43:25.140 --> 3:43:29.220]  They're afraid of a lot of the attributes of human beings that aren't often mentioned
[3:43:29.220 --> 3:43:34.020]  I've talked about them a lot in my broadcasts the anomalous human potential scare the hell out of the government
[3:43:34.020 --> 3:43:39.700]  Because when they researched all this since one of my primary years of research was the area of mind manipulation
[3:43:40.500 --> 3:43:42.900]  And what I know is the thing they discovered that
[3:43:43.860 --> 3:43:45.860]  Put the fear of god in them
[3:43:46.820 --> 3:43:48.820]  was that
[3:43:48.820 --> 3:43:50.820]  Was the essence of what we are
[3:43:51.140 --> 3:43:58.660]  Who we are what we're capable of what we can remember we can fall back into it and claim our birthright and begin to express in the world again
[3:43:58.660 --> 3:44:05.140]  New world order fears that because they know it only takes one. It only takes you
[3:44:05.860 --> 3:44:07.860]  The tip of the spear each of us changing
[3:44:08.740 --> 3:44:11.460]  Internally who we are and projecting it differently outwardly
[3:44:12.180 --> 3:44:16.900]  Change the world one person at a time. That's the way we do it. We're all in this together
[3:44:17.060 --> 3:44:19.780]  We're doing it one person at a time do it in your home
[3:44:20.340 --> 3:44:24.260]  Do it in your neighborhood do it amongst your friends and do it with those you don't even know
[3:44:24.260 --> 3:44:28.900]  God bless you. This is dr. Nick baggage
[3:44:30.100 --> 3:44:35.140]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll pay them
[3:44:35.460 --> 3:44:38.020]  It's that simple and they've used our open free society
[3:44:38.580 --> 3:44:39.780]  against us
[3:44:39.780 --> 3:44:43.540]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it
[3:44:43.620 --> 3:44:49.780]  They see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs
[3:44:49.860 --> 3:44:53.060]  We try to tell the truth. They try to lie. They try to deceive
[3:44:53.060 --> 3:44:58.420]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalist operate how they manipulate how they
[3:44:59.620 --> 3:45:05.060]  They have boozled the public. I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what they're told in the face
[3:45:05.620 --> 3:45:07.620]  I'm trying to get people
[3:45:07.860 --> 3:45:09.860]  To research for themselves
[3:45:10.260 --> 3:45:16.900]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory
[3:45:17.380 --> 3:45:19.700]  But again on its face. That is a fraud
[3:45:19.700 --> 3:45:26.020]  Question everything question info wars add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[3:45:26.260 --> 3:45:29.700]  And what new sources are accurate? I believe info wars is the best source out there
[3:45:31.620 --> 3:45:38.340]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart inventive people
[3:45:39.540 --> 3:45:41.140]  believe that
[3:45:41.140 --> 3:45:44.020]  Chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe in being aristocrats
[3:45:44.020 --> 3:45:49.700]  It's trying to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that predatory idea
[3:45:50.340 --> 3:45:53.540]  Civilization collapses very very quickly. You can't treat the least of us
[3:45:54.340 --> 3:45:56.420]  Like garbage and not treat your own family like that
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:45:59.780]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us
[3:46:00.980 --> 3:46:04.820]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals of
[3:46:05.380 --> 3:46:10.660]  All sorts of horrible crimes try to get away from a humanity, but really they can't escape the laws of the universe
[3:46:10.660 --> 3:46:15.540]  they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves but
[3:46:16.260 --> 3:46:21.140]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself
[3:46:21.780 --> 3:46:25.700]  Well, it's created by loving God. Well, it's created by having connection to God
[3:46:26.180 --> 3:46:30.900]  God is the source of all creation all success all power. We deny that you'll be destroyed
[3:46:30.900 --> 3:46:37.540]  You're listening to the alex jones show
