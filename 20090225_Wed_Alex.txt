[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:35.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.000 --> 00:49.000]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. It's the 25th day of February 2009 for this Wednesday edition of the Global Transmission.
[00:49.000 --> 01:18.000]  Coming up, we have State Senator Randy Barogdon from Oklahoma to talk about the state's rights move, continuing the drumbeat of awakening the states to the peril of world government in the enslavement system that is being set up all around us in the constitutional right and duty of the states to rebel against this and to put the criminal federal government back in line.
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  And prosecute the foreign banker agents that have hijacked the nation.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  So, Senator Randy Barogdon joining us coming up, and then we have F. William Engdahl coming on to talk about a host of issues.
[01:34.000 --> 01:49.000]  What's happening on the geopolitical front that is always informative and also looked at the economy with F. William Engdahl. So, that is always very, very informative.
[01:49.000 --> 02:08.000]  In the meantime, we're going to open the phones up yet again at 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231.
[02:08.000 --> 02:29.000]  In the meantime, we will go over the latest developments with the address of Congress. I guess he doesn't want to wait months until the scheduled ancestral ceremonial, ancient right of the State of the Union.
[02:29.000 --> 02:48.000]  This was an address of Congress, but the public can't tell the difference. And it was interesting watching all of those Congress critters, as some call them, and criminals, almost all of them, hardcore criminals, a large portion of them, those certainly in power, hardcore criminals,
[02:48.000 --> 03:03.000]  including the committee chairman and others, predominantly. There they were, just a 10-minute standing ovation, just clapping and clapping and worshiping and kneeling and bowing like some primitive ritual to the war chief.
[03:03.000 --> 03:16.000]  And it really was a celebration of their robbery. I mean, when they signed the Banker bailout bills, when they signed the stimulus bill, I've got video clips of Barney Frank.
[03:16.000 --> 03:28.000]  I'm probably putting it in the Obama deception. We're finishing the mastering in the next couple of days. But I ought to pull this clip and play it on air, and they're laughing, they're celebrating.
[03:28.000 --> 03:39.000]  Nancy Pelosi is celebrating, laughing, they're giggling. It's so funny to steal all this money. He comes over and he says, this is a solemn occasion. Stop it, they see you laughing.
[03:39.000 --> 03:52.000]  Then they all put fake long faces on. Oh, we're so concerned. It's terrible. Did you hear Obama say you need to all attend college?
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  That's code word for you all need to be a national compulsory service, because that's all the colleges are going to be turned into.
[03:58.000 --> 04:08.000]  There won't be any real jobs for your college diploma other than jackbooting and surveilling your neighbors. I mean, that really is the new economy. They're converting it over to that.
[04:08.000 --> 04:21.000]  It's just amazing. And you heard him, the global carbon tax, but it's free market, just like nationalizing the banks, and it's free market, just like bailing out the foreign banks.
[04:21.000 --> 04:37.000]  It's free market, just like Joseph Stalin was. But you can tell, I'm looking at Obama, and I can tell you right now, most polls show him down by 15 points already in a month, a month and three days.
[04:37.000 --> 04:45.000]  And I was looking into him and looking into his eyes, kind of like Bush looked into Putin's and saw a fellow kinsman.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Well, I looked into Obama's eyes and I can tell he knows they're going to have to carry out some terror attacks to get folks in line.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  He knows like a balloon being lanced that their agenda is stalling dead in the mud.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[05:44.000 --> 05:55.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com today. Or call 877-327-0365.
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[06:00.000 --> 06:08.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[06:11.000 --> 06:18.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  Release the dark shadow.
[06:20.000 --> 06:27.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[06:27.000 --> 06:33.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[06:37.000 --> 06:43.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[06:46.000 --> 07:08.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[07:17.000 --> 07:26.000]  When you taste the food in the 3-day responder, you will understand why families trust e-foods direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[07:26.000 --> 07:33.000]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-day responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  Food is an everyday need.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  The 3-day responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  The 3-day responder, $21.95, sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  Call 800-409-5633 on thewebefoodsdirect.com.
[07:54.000 --> 08:12.000]  That's 800-409-5633 on thewebefoodsdirect.com.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  Bankrupt the planet.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  He poses as the president of the planet.
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  Everybody smiles back at his smiling face and they stick the knife right in your gut.
[08:38.000 --> 08:48.000]  And they get their carbon taxes through to regulate every facet of your life, control every facet of your life, squeeze all small and medium-sized businesses out of existence.
[08:48.000 --> 09:03.000]  That is the stated goal of carbon taxes and they will be paid to the exploding local, federal, international government bureaucracy that's mushrooming everywhere.
[09:03.000 --> 09:11.000]  And their answer to the border imploding will be to just set up a North American Union as the SPP documents state security and prosperity partnership.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  Their answer to all the crises they create is giving them more power.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  But Obama is going ahead with carbon taxes.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  Now, there's a tactic they use. I'm going to break down some of his speech.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  There's a tactic they use over and over and over again. They go off a playbook.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's just Obama executes it a lot better than Bush because frankly Bush was lazy.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  I mean Obama sometimes gives 10, 15 speeches a day as president.
[09:39.000 --> 09:51.000]  He's constantly running around pitching and selling and, you know, flying back and forth across the country because they've got to get this agenda through now.
[09:51.000 --> 10:08.000]  There's a tactic they use. They will have all these states, Texas, Oregon, California, New York, I mean just all of them under federal funding and guidelines have already started putting satellite tracker boxes in thousands of cars per state.
[10:08.000 --> 10:18.000]  800 and something Austinites are being paid to put the government satellite tracker boxes in through a, quote, beta test.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  And they admit it is to put it in statewide.
[10:21.000 --> 10:30.000]  And then they have the head of transportation department come out and say, yeah, we're going to move in the next two years by 2011 to have all cars in the U.S.
[10:30.000 --> 10:42.000]  Fitted with these satellite boxes. They don't call them tracker boxes. That's what they are to tax you by the mile on all roads in the federal proposals.
[10:42.000 --> 10:54.000]  Well, the Texas proposal stated that we're talking about hundreds of dollars just to travel across the state upwards of six plus dollars a mile during peak times.
[10:54.000 --> 11:04.000]  And those big road signs everywhere, they'll be advising you, oh, you shouldn't be on the road right now. You're going to be charged for a congestion fee.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  You're always telling you it's your fault. This is why this is happening to you.
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  Paying over and over and over again for roads you already paid for.
[11:15.000 --> 11:28.000]  So the tactic is they let opposition build all of this, the satellite boxes, and then Obama comes out last Friday and says, we're not going to do this.
[11:28.000 --> 11:36.000]  And then all of the grassroots movements building just collapse. Oh, everything's fine. Oh, they're not doing it now.
[11:36.000 --> 11:48.000]  And then we have to, as they move forward with the plan, putting the system in, and as the government pushes major companies in China and other places to build the boxes by the tens of millions,
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  as they build up the infrastructure, we then have to go out and say, no, they really are going to do this.
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  See, I've warned you 12, 13 years ago about this from federal plans, and they would just say conspiracy theory doesn't exist.
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.000]  Now they're pushing it, setting it up, doing it, and then when you mount opposition, they say, oh, we're not doing that.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  It's the same thing with the methane tax on geese, chicken, pigs, cows.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  The EPA is moving ahead with it. States are moving ahead with it.
[12:20.000 --> 12:29.000]  They will beta test it in immunized and federally internationally controlled cities that have signed agreements so that they'll get bond loans.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  That's how the bankers take control of your local area, not just your entire nation or state.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  And so they're coming in there, moving ahead with the flatulence tax.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  Canada now has flatulent taxes. Europe has flatulent taxes in many countries.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  They are now proposing in Europe a human flatulence tax.
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  See, the New York Times even stated it in the headline, well, a year ago, a tax to breathe, but then went on to say it was good.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  But not just breathing, you know, gases are going both ways here.
[13:02.000 --> 13:10.000]  So there's going to be per body weight and per height, you will be taxed for the flatulence.
[13:10.000 --> 13:19.000]  You will also be taxed an extra tax on sewage treatment for global warming because of methane off-gassing from the sewage plants.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  I'm not kidding. You can Google this and read thousands of articles in government documents.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  I was doing research for the end of the film, the Obama deception a few days ago.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  It was going back over all the taxes and we couldn't list them all.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  It's more than a hundred. It's everything, everything, everything is carbon-based.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  This is a carbon-based planet. We're a carbon-based life form.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  It's not just taxing the carbon cycle, it's taxing everything.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  Now, they're moving ahead with the flatulence tax on animals and then on humans.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  And that's not me making a joke. You can Google flatulence tax.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  You can Google flatulence tax on humans and read the UN reports.
[14:05.000 --> 14:15.000]  Now, this builds to crescendo and then the New York Times goes, you know, farmers are panicking like crazy.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  They don't like it, but it's been canceled and then you read the article and it's not canceled.
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  So the opposition builds and in the past they would just say, it doesn't exist.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  Here's your tax bill. It doesn't exist and the citizens would say, does not exist, does not exist, does not exist.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  Now people are going, uh-huh, I'm not going along with this. They say, okay, we're not going to do it.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  Then you read the next paragraph until next year.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  Take the one leg of the NAFTA Superhighway, the one that got publicized because we've been fighting it.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  There's 34 of them going in all over the nation.
[14:49.000 --> 14:58.000]  Under the executive order, they hand the roads over to foreign companies, predominantly Spanish, Australian, British and others.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  They just give it to them. It's all part of IMF and World Bank deals. They're seizing the infrastructure.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  The globalists say, we'll keep giving the U.S. loans for the U.S. to have the right to print its own money.
[15:12.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's how the little fraud works, but you have to accept these 100-plus point plan we have.
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.000]  The IMF World Bank stipulations for countries in receivership, receivership they designed,
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  they just, with the struggle of a pen, create all the money to buy the world.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  As the founding fathers told you, as British lords told you, as the former head of the World Bank told you,
[15:41.000 --> 15:50.000]  as the former head of the Bank of England said, it's the same system over and over again.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  And so now that we were fighting it here in Texas, they're building it.
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  I mean, they're building these roads and seizing existing roads and have billboards up saying, Trans Texas Corridor.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  And the states on the website admits it's part of the NAFTA Superhighway Corridor system, and all the SPP documents say it.
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.000]  And they just have CNN come on TV and Fox and say it doesn't exist. We're insane.
[16:11.000 --> 16:20.000]  Well, that didn't work because Texans and Oklahomans and others saw the corridor signs and the toll road signs in Florida and New Jersey.
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  And so they said, okay, we're canceling the Trans Texas Corridor. Just Google, Trans Texas Corridor canceled.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Then you read the second paragraph and it says, oh, we're still doing the whole thing.
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  We're just renaming it and breaking it down into subsections.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  Then they have neocons writing news articles about me going, Alex, where's the NAFTA highways?
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  Where are they being built? Why don't you show us?
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.000]  Again, just people wanting to be deceived, wanting to be lied to.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  So this is the tactic they carry out over and over again.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  It's like Obama's saying, yeah, we're going to close.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  Then you read the executive order.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  It says we're going to look at it in the next year, but we're going to continue rendition, secret arrest, and secret camps.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  And then now they've announced, yeah, you have no Geneva rights, no nothing.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  You can be secretly held, harsh interrogation.
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  They just redefined torture.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  And now the human rights lawyers for Guantanamo Bay, Bagram, Airbase, and others.
[17:20.000 --> 17:29.000]  It's in Reuters, AP, everywhere saying they, as soon as he was sworn in, the torture went into full scale like no one has ever seen.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  Just savage torture. Absolutely, man.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  They're building death camps everywhere.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  They are going hog wild.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  They're building them for us right here.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  They're being built, publicly being sold.
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  And the Obama people, I mean, they are literally on cloud nine.
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  They are just walking around like they've just seen, you know, an apparition of an angel.
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  They are just, oh my gosh, everything's wonderful.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Oh, this is so beautiful.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  This is so incredible.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  We'll play a video coming up later.
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  When we go live at prismplanet.tv and listeners will hear the audio.
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  It just shows all these Hollywood people and folks.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  They're just going, I'm walking on clouds.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  It's like I'm in heaven.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  I just can't believe it.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  And you try to tell them, hey, he's torturing.
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  He's actually expanding it.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  And they say, shut up, Nazi.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  Oh my gosh.
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  Oh my gosh.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  I can't believe it.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  He's just so evil.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  Here it is.
[18:34.000 --> 18:41.000]  Guantanamo abuses has worsened since Obama loiterers.
[18:41.000 --> 18:50.000]  Abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has worsened sharply since Obama took office as prison guards get their kicks in before the campus closed.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Look how they spin that.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  Because the lawyers are saying, man, this is getting a lot worse.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  And then they're not getting their kicks.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  It's back to business as usual.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  According to a lawyer who represents detainees, abuse began to pick up in December after Obama was elected.
[19:05.000 --> 19:13.000]  Human rights lawyer Ahmed Gabor told Reuters he cited beatings and dislocation of limbs, spraying a pepper spray into closed cells,
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  applying pepper spray to toilet seats, and over force feeding detainees who are on hunger strike.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  That's a favorite.
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  They torture the fallen gong like that in China.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  Let us run this tube down your throat.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  We're going to put two gallons of water in your stomach.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  It's for your own good.
[19:31.000 --> 19:40.000]  The Pentagon said on Monday that it had received renewed reports of prisoner abuse during a recent review of conditions at Guantanamo.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  All right.
[19:41.000 --> 19:49.000]  Then it says, but they found that it's being done with the curtains with the Geneva Convention.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  What do you mean?
[19:50.000 --> 19:58.000]  It was in AP and Reuters three days ago that Obama said, headline, Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  Read it and weep, you Obama cult members.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  You worry.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.000]  Your answer may be at hand.
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[20:14.000 --> 20:19.000]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.000]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[20:31.000 --> 20:40.000]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching the subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers.

[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  Who is the enemy?
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  Bin Laden.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  This is his MO.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[21:17.000 --> 21:24.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[21:35.000 --> 21:43.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  the shadow government, and much, much more.
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty?
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt,
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  I will give a US silver dollar to everyone who purchases this book.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  It's 800-686-2237.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  It's critical to be made aware of the system.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  Get your copy today, 800-686-2237.
[23:57.000 --> 24:07.000]  That's 800-686-2237.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  All right.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  I want to go to your phone calls right now because I've been promising you to take a lot of calls.
[24:11.000 --> 24:18.000]  I know you want to respond to the president's address to Congress.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  And I heard the media last week saying the president's state of the union, and I went,
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  that's the state of the union come up later in the year.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  And I looked it up last night, and sure enough, it was just an address to Congress.
[24:33.000 --> 24:41.000]  They're trying to sell the public on the carbon taxes, on the socialism, on how much government loves you.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  And the good news is, if we can stop the bankers from setting up this bank of the world,
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  or even if they set it up, we can stop them from taking control of the US,
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  this will stall their whole agenda.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  And then NAFTA and GATT is in trouble.
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  Every time they have a referendum, they would never let anybody vote in Europe to get into the European Union.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  They said it didn't exist until they actually had it set up.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  It was the same thing they're doing here.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  Same tactic, but there is a European Union.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  Though people have emailed me saying I'm lying, it doesn't exist either.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  I mean, this is delusion.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  You have a nation and a world of cult members, so the government and the media and the television set,
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  who just are incredible.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  And as long as they can find fellow members of their cult to second that we're wrong,
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  it's like 8% of the country in polls thinks that the government didn't kill Kennedy.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  And then they tell 92% of us that we're the kooks, that we all wear tinfoil hats.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  No, it's you that are kooks.
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.000]  Or I'm going to go to your calls, it's just that Ireland said no to joining the European Union.
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.000]  They were going to expand European Union control to where the nations had no sovereignty left a few years ago.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  And every country where they allowed to vote said no.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  Because the people for a decade have been saying we want to vote, we want to vote.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  And they had the 50th anniversary of the European Union.
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  Oh, I thought it started in 2000. See, they kept it secret.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  Really set up in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  And they had parades all over Europe.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  And I saw the news feeds.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  They would have jugglers and huge floats and thousands of people on the parade and no one lining the streets.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  In some countries people would line the streets, but they would turn their backs on it.
[26:25.000 --> 26:40.000]  This New World Order is like selling a vampire crosses holy water and big chains of garlic.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  They aren't going to buy it.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  The New World Order is not what the people want.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Okay, it's anathema to them.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  And so all we've got to do is continue to expose these criminals and they will fall.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  No matter how invincible and slick their packaging is, it's paper thin.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  It's rotten and decaying on the inside.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  Alright, let's jam in one call now then I'm just going to race through calls when we come back.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  Tom in Wisconsin, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  Hey Alex, I hope you're doing well today.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  This is my first time calling into the show and I just want to thank you for everything that you've brought to my attention.
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.000]  I'm not the only person, but there's really five figures that I wanted to bring up and you can comment on this if you like.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  That can help bring awareness to the slave mind and that's you, David Ike, Jordan Maxwell, Bill Cooper and George Norring.
[27:35.000 --> 27:42.000]  And each of them focus on a different sort of stream of information and they present sort of a different view of this New World Order
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  and what it's going to be and where it comes from and its origination.
[27:46.000 --> 27:54.000]  The second part of me calling in is I wanted to find out, if you can flush this out,
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  when the bankers actually realize that people are moving away from the dollars and means of trade,
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  when the tax revolts start and the states actually begin to break away from the U.S. of A, the United States of America,
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  that Barack Obama said in his inauguration speech, we will always be through non-compliance.
[28:10.000 --> 28:17.000]  And the breaking point as far as a percentage of the people that are actually still enslaved in their mind
[28:17.000 --> 28:29.000]  and the use of military force by these criminals, these mafia feds, will actually be futile in maintaining their system of control and domination.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  And as a follow-up to that even, at what point do you see the elites actually using weapons of mass destruction
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  like you mentioned before, neutron bombs as an ally?
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  Let's be clear, they've said they will use neutron bombs on us if we try to rebel.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  Look, I appreciate your call. That is a mountain of important questions.
[28:48.000 --> 28:58.000]  Just to simplify it, I analyze the architecture, the physical, provable, demonstratable architecture of the New World Order.
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.000]  Occasionally we have guests that get into the more esoteric things and what the elite believe in and what they're doing.
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  And then it's just put out there in a secular fashion so people can make a decision about it.
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  It's a sociological, anthropological statement that the elite are Luciferians.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Whether you believe in Lucifer or not, they believe in it.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  And so atheists out there have to face that and then ask themselves why that is.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  That's in relation to what I cover versus some of those other people.
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  I'll briefly, when we get back, try to answer the other parts of the question
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  because it isn't the states seceding from the Union.
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  The Union has been hijacked. The states are the Union.
[29:42.000 --> 30:01.000]  Okay, so we'll explain this very important subtlety when we get back.
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.000]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.000]  Only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough.
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.000]  You need the pack light. The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  and simply snaps onto any 9 volt battery and uses two high powered LED lights.
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.000]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage and home.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  The pack light can survive severe impact, defrozen solid and still work flawlessly.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker magazine.
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  The pack light comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.000]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be,

[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  Like it always is.

[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  To business as usual.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  It was an inside job just like it always is.

[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  I'm doing it for you.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  And I'll keep doing it.

[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  I know it's hard to live out the light.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  To face the truth even about ourselves.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  But if we don't do it, we'll be slaves.
[35:21.000 --> 35:50.000]  He says it's so well right here.
[35:50.000 --> 35:57.000]  It's an inside job.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  To hang on to the joy of living.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  Know the road out which you came.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  They know your mother's late name.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  And what you had for breakfast.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  What you had in the mattress.
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  Insect politics.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  In different uniforms.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  I'll tell you Don Henley.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  Bob Dylan.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  Willie Nelson.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  People like that.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  You don't have to know them personally.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  To know what's in their heart and mind.
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  Know they know the truth.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  But I'll give you a little inside job knowledge as well.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  They do know what's going on.
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  Alright answering the last caller's question time.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  We're going to go through your calls here.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  Susan, Sean, Rob, Joshua, Mike and others that are holding.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  This is the problem.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  How do I ever get to all your calls?
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  Because the calls are all these complex questions.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  We're asking what the feds are going to do as the state secede.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Now I want to be clear about this.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  Because people get confused by it.
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  And then claim that I am being hypocritical or double faced.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  That is not, I'm not Janice here ladies and gentlemen.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  I want to be clear about this.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  I am not for state secession.
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  Unless it is an emergency last ditch effort where the United States is fully
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  been sucked in to the North American Union.
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  It's already being merged with via the transatlantic treaty agreement
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  with the European Union.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  What I am for is the states declaring their inherent sovereignty.
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.000]  It was the states that constituted and created the federal government.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  And so when states declare sovereignty and saying we're not
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  going to follow your gun laws, we're not going to follow your open borders,
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  we're not going to let the feds come in here and enforce taking people to jail
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  when you set up your national draft and conscription.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  That is their job.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  The states created the federal government.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  That's why it's the United States.
[38:22.000 --> 38:28.000]  And if 35 states got together and said we are abolishing the federal
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  government, it is law.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  It is stated in triplicate.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  Billerites, Constitution, Declaration of Independence,
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  that that would happen.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  But you could have states individually say that they're not
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  following what the federal government says.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  Okay?
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  Now that's why they love Lincoln so much.
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  And it's a complex case and very serious issue to weigh in on Lincoln.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  I will just say this.
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.000]  Lincoln set the table for total federalization and control.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  Then he didn't want reconstruction to be brutal,
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  so they assassinated him and the bankers took over.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  So see, you could even argue he was a good guy, which he really overall wasn't.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  But the system of tyranny he set up and the name of writing wrongs,
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  that mechanism was then used to bring us to where we are today,
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  totally dominated by foreign banking powers.
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  Now the feds will stage terror attacks.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  I'm sure of that now.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  They've staged Oklahoma City, 9-11, many other things.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  They fund real terrorist groups to carry out attacks.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Many times these criminal groups don't even know their funding is coming from
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  Western powers, but that's come out even in mainstream news over and over again
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  in hindsight because their system is stalling very, very quickly,
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  quicker than they thought it would.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  People are figuring out what Barack Obama is up to.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  There is massive awakening taking place.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  It's buoying to my heart and soul and to my intellect as I analyze this.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  But that doesn't mean it's going to be an easy victory against the globalists.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  We have to expose false flag terror and stage crises,
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  like staging a war with Iran.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  The globalists don't even need to stage terror attacks.
[40:19.000 --> 40:28.000]  If they attack Iran, Iran has more than 11,000 of one type of missile
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  that has a 300-mile range.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  They've moved the carriers in close enough to be hit.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  That's one reason Fox Fallen quit.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  He said, why are you doing this?
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Why are you moving us into missile range?
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  Because they want to do Pearl Harbor, folks.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  That's why they came out mainstream news.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  Dick Cheney wanted to have Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  in fake blue patrol boats attack ships to get that party started.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  And then they are going to shut down the Strait of Hormuz.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  They're going to attack Iraq.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  And the Iranians will not back down.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  There's now 70 million of them.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  Their new census has come out, up from 65 million.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  Back when they had primitive weapons, they're much more advanced now.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  In an eight-year war with Saddam Hussein backed by the U.S. and NATO,
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  350,000 Iraqis died, over a million and a half Iranians.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  The Iranians are not the Arabs.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And I'm not saying Arabs can't fight.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  Arabs have courage.
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  They just historically are badly organized, militarily, historically.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  Not the Persians, folks.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  And they will fight to the death.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  And it will start World War III.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  In the end, the globalists would probably win a war with Iran,
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  nuking the daylights out of it and a lot of other things.
[41:42.000 --> 41:48.000]  But Tehran will launch real terror attacks in the United States.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  The globalists have got their infrastructure in for that.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  They'll use that crisis to bring in total control.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  The Iranians have been extremely reserved.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  Five years ago, we reported here, four years ago,
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  Sy Hersh from New Yorker reported, a year and a half ago,
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  the White House put out a public statement on WhiteHouse.gov
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  that the United States was using four Wahhabist groups,
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  another Kurdish group, Al-Qaeda groups.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  One of them headed up by the number three in Al-Qaeda.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  They're Sunni versus the Shiite-backed Iranians to stage terror attacks,
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  attack police stations, blow-up school buses, blow-up dams, blow-up mosques
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  to elicit an Iranian response.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  The Iranians have sued the United States.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  It's been in the, you know, Reuters and foreign press.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  You never hear about it on our news.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  Until a week and a half ago, Israel admitted in Jerusalem Post,
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  to Roths, it was also the one in Telegraph, openly said, we have hit teams,
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  assassinating people in Iran.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  We have hit teams, bombing them and trying to destabilize them
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  in fomenting revolution, an open act of internal war.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  This would be like if the Iranians were blowing stuff up in the U.S.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  and England right now, and we would just lay here and take it.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  And Iran says, you're attacking us, you're trying to destabilize us,
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  and our government says, yes, we are.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Just open crime.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  And people then email me and say, what are you for Iran,
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  or they want to kill you.
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  Hey, all I'm telling you is, when Iran rolled over and said,
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  okay, we won't, we'll have a non-nuclear weapons program,
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  IEA, let the inspectors in more than any other nation on Earth,
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  the U.S. and Israel and England started saber-rattling and said,
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  now we're not going to let you have any technology,
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  and we're going to put sanctions on you.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  And Iran, the Mullahs then threw in Akhmet Dinajid the radical.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  And then Israel says, we're going to strike you with nukes.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  And he says, well, blow your Zionist state off the map.
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  And then it's put out in our news that he said he's going to push Israel
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  into the sea and kill everybody in Israel.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  He did say something close to that, but they massively exaggerated it.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  The point is that this isn't good for the average person living in England,
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  Israel, Saudi Arabia, Germany.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  It doesn't matter.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  But the globalists have the bunkers, the globalists that are in control
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  of Israel, the United States, England, most of the world.
[44:04.000 --> 44:09.000]  They want, as the rank corporation has said, to have a world government in place.
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  And to get that, they've got to have a massive worldwide crisis.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  So a lot of you bought into the rhetoric of let's a new guy run.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  Let's turn him into a parking lot.
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  And you know, through extension, you feel manly saying that.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  You're going to end up being in a world war.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  And they know that through that stress and through the terror attacks,
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  both staged and real, and through all the things that happen,
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  most people may line up and go along with this.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  In the process, you will accept the depression and living in a depression
[44:39.000 --> 44:44.000]  while hundreds of thousands of our boys are killed.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  This is World War III.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  This is planned. This is set up.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  And a lot of you out there are going to lose your sons and daughters in this.
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  And most of you are going to lose your houses and you're going to lose your future.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  And there's not going to be vacations anymore.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  There's not going to be going to Mexico anymore.
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  It's collapsing. It's going to be hellish.
[45:01.000 --> 45:08.000]  Now, read 1984 and decide, is that how you want to live?
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  There is no right side.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  Not Iran, not the globalists. They're all evil.
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  And that's how this works.
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.000]  And if you really want to let the eugenicist who control things,
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  maneuver the people into this, and if you don't stand up and say no,
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  it's going to get very bad. And the left is going to stand down.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  They suddenly love war. They suddenly love torture.
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  They suddenly love the Patriot Act. They suddenly love it all.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  By the way, it's in the news today about home inspections under the new green laws.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  They're going to be in your house, folks.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  This is hell on earth.
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  The people controlling the United States and the world are the very folks that funded Hitler.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  Right out of the Milner Group in England that funded Lenin and Stalin and Mao.
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.000]  David Rockefeller brags in books he's written in the New York Times in my film Endgame
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  that they love Mao Zedong and they put him in power.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  He killed 80 million people according to the Chinese government.
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  Mainstream media says 64 million. I don't know.
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  The point is, they are not playing games, suckers.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  And if you don't stop being suckers, you're in deep trouble.
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.000]  Okay, Susan in Illinois, go ahead.
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  Hi, Alex.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  Hi, Susan.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  Well, I've been awake for about three months.
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  And the first two weeks, I was in shock and cried in selfie trade.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  And now I'm pretty much just mad.
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.000]  But with that, I wanted to remind or tell everybody to go to nationwidechicagoteparty.com.
[46:38.000 --> 46:45.000]  I don't know if you've heard of it, but there's a nationwide tea party happening in about 35 cities, people protesting.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  And I'm really encouraged about that.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  And the second comment I just had was, I was wondering what your take was about the Pope.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  What's the Pope's role in the New World Order?
[46:56.000 --> 47:05.000]  Well, the Catholic Church, and again, I hate to get in here and bash Israel because then it becomes it's about bashing Jews and it's not.
[47:05.000 --> 47:10.000]  Or I hate to bash Iran because then it becomes bashing Iranians and I'm not against Iranians.
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.000]  Or bashing African dictators and it becomes about bashing Africans.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  It's not.
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  I have a lot of Catholic friends.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  Catholics are good, hardworking, great people.
[47:23.000 --> 47:32.000]  And just like when Pat Robertson comes out and says, China's doing what it has to do with forced abortions in China and calls for a New World Order.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  And says, Obama's great.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  And says, global warming's real.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  I'm a Protestant brought up and my family's Protestant.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  I'm not bashing Protestants.
[47:42.000 --> 47:54.000]  But there's no doubt that the Catholic Church under the last Pope, certainly, and now under Rat Singer, Pope Benedict, openly, I mean, I have the videos.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  Yeah, I've seen the videos.
[47:56.000 --> 48:05.000]  But I mean, I have videos of all the world leaders of religion around the obelisk in Vatican Square holding hands doing a ritual.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  And if you believe in Christianity, that's blasphemy.
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.000]  And Pope John Paul II called for a New World Order, World Government.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  The European Union is and I've researched its roots.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  The treaty was signed in Rome.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  It is to be a Holy Roman Empire.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  That's why Blair to be an envoy from the EU converted to Catholicism last year.
[48:28.000 --> 48:36.000]  And it is certainly very, very serious and they're calling for a world ecumenical merger of religion.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  And it's just right out of revelations.
[48:38.000 --> 48:48.000]  And that's why so many millions of Catholics are leaving the Catholic Church and, you know, setting up their own, you know, thing that's, you know, more of a conservative Catholic Church.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  And so, but I'm not here to pass judgment or get into all these religious fights and things.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  Again, I just lay out what the popes are saying, what they're doing.
[48:57.000 --> 49:13.000]  And it is there. I mean, I've got Catholic Church literature that Catholics send me from Illinois and South Texas and New York and just all over the country where it says guns are bad.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  You know, turn your guns in having guns is none of God.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  And that's there on the FEMA payroll too.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  And we've got all these Methodist and Baptist and Southern Baptist preachers.
[49:23.000 --> 49:39.000]  Well, I mean, you saw Catholics, Protestants, everybody at that big thing with Obama where he's conscripting them and he's expanding Bush's faith-based initiatives to pay off the churches and to be, quote, community leaders and to watch their neighborhood.
[49:39.000 --> 49:47.000]  So everybody should ask their preachers or their priest or whatever, their rabbi or their Imam, are you working with the government?
[49:47.000 --> 49:55.000]  But, you know, ask it nicely. Hey, I heard a lot of preachers are working with FEMA for emergency readiness and they get real weird and say, how did you hear about that?
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  They say, oh, no, I just heard I want to help.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  And then the actual suspicious say, hey, I want you to tell me.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  But a lot of times if you act friendly about it, they'll go, oh, yeah, we're preparing to help America.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  So it's very, very creepy and very, very evil.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  And organized religion is basically controlled by the globalist.
[50:13.000 --> 50:20.000]  Alex, are you encouraged about the Tea Party on Friday? It's this Friday, the 27th.
[50:20.000 --> 50:27.000]  You know, I heard something about folks having their own protest demonstrations, like in the Fed and all this other spontaneous stuff and groups.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  And I just think it's wonderful.
[50:29.000 --> 50:37.000]  Just more people doing more, just getting out on the streets and exercising those political muscles is just awesome, Susan.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  I appreciate your call. Sean, Rob, Joshua, Mike and others.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  Continuing with your phone calls. I just love the grab bag. I love the spin the wheel of fortune.
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  And I never know what's coming up next, what interesting questions we're going to get from these great callers.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  So we'll continue with phone calls and then get into Obama's State of the Union, which really was the State of the Union.
[50:55.000 --> 51:24.000]  It was an address to Congress. Get ready for your carbon taxes.
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  I recommend part and body extract to everyone.

[52:01.000 --> 52:08.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:24.000 --> 52:31.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:35.000 --> 52:45.000]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[54:20.000 --> 54:33.000]  Let's go to Sean in California. Sean, you're on the air. Welcome.
[54:50.000 --> 55:00.000]  Well, he's like in charge of the states now and maybe somebody needs to rebind Obama that we're a republic and that he doesn't get to hold the states accountable for what they said.
[55:00.000 --> 55:07.000]  Well, that's right. He's billing the states and also the people. He implied not finishing high schools no longer an option.
[55:07.000 --> 55:13.000]  When he was talking about the economy, it's all about the people caused it with a subprime mortgage. The states caused it.
[55:13.000 --> 55:23.000]  You not finishing high school, which are just little induction centers to prison. You caused it. Not the government with 30 million illegal aliens bankrupting the states with the welfare and the health care.
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  Not the feds taking the state money and sending back 33 cents on the dollar on average with strings attached.
[55:29.000 --> 55:39.000]  Not the federal government paying corporations to move offshore and to outsource. No, it's all your fault. But he'll fix it. He'll hold us accountable.
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's the whole speech. I watched most of it last night. We wrote a bunch of notes because we're down to the very end of the Obama deception.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  We're going to put a few clips in there and it's just unspeakable. The amount of fraud and lies and just sickening.
[55:51.000 --> 56:03.000]  Absolutely. And I implore all the states, all the state governors, don't take the money from the feds. Do not take the money. Just stay away from it because you just be under more control.
[56:03.000 --> 56:11.000]  Well, also what it does, Sean, is he spearheaded with Bush, the banker takeover bill 9.7 trillion now, according to Bloomberg and AP.
[56:11.000 --> 56:19.000]  And they won't say where the money went. And then now, you know, most of the money's going to offshore bank accounts. That's been admitted, even CBS News.
[56:19.000 --> 56:27.000]  So it's all about him. I'm making sure the money's being spent right. I'm the good guy. I'm mad at these CEOs taking these bonuses. We're going to cap their pay.
[56:27.000 --> 56:37.000]  And then you read the order, the executive order, and it actually says they're all exempt. I mean, it's all just cold, blooded fraud.
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  Good to hear from you, Sean. Rob in Canada. Welcome, Rob.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  Hi, Alex.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  Hello, sir.
[56:44.000 --> 56:57.000]  I just wanted to call in. I'm a student of esotericism and these kinds of things. And I just wanted to speak a little bit about modern philosophy to you with regard to some of the ideas.
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  And you are familiar with Leo Strauss?
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  Yes.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Okay. Well, essentially, one of the main...
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  The Chicago School of Business.
[57:04.000 --> 57:15.000]  That's right, yeah. So anyways, I'm looking at this guy. And one of the main forces behind his ideas is the philosopher, Parmentides, if you've heard of him.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  Yes.
[57:16.000 --> 57:24.000]  Who essentially has this idea, or it's a poem that even Plato, one of the former Greek philosopher from long back.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  Yeah, he was a eugenicist, too. That's where the idea all came from.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  Exactly. But I mean, he's an elitist, you know, into the whole idea of aristocracy and the rule.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  They're for killing the subclasses.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  Well, yeah.
[57:36.000 --> 57:43.000]  They just say, kill everybody but the elite, and then we'll just breathe with each other. That's eugenics is 3,000 years old.
[57:43.000 --> 57:53.000]  Well, that's definitely scary stuff. But essentially, the idea that this guy brings out is that there's two different types of truth into reality.
[57:53.000 --> 58:04.000]  The one is essentially public opinion, and the other one is the truth behind that, which is essentially that everything is antagonistic or in some form or another.
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  You know, the world is in strife, and everybody... And this is where this idea of the two poles come in.
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  Yeah, and that's why... I'm going to hold you over to finish your thought when we come back.
[58:13.000 --> 58:22.000]  But that's why Carl Rove told a group of news reporters, Washington Post, New York Times, he said, look, we're history's actors now.
[58:22.000 --> 58:29.000]  We control reality, we'll change reality next week, and then you will accept that reality, and you will watch and be history's spectators.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  We are history's actors.
[58:31.000 --> 58:38.000]  And that's why they say there is no carbon tax as they set it up. There is no satellite tracker box by the mile as they set it up.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  You know, they just are total criminals.
[58:43.000 --> 58:49.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:52.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[58:52.000 --> 58:57.000]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread.
[59:03.000 --> 59:09.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[59:12.000 --> 59:19.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  We are now into our number two, going to be getting into Obama's address to Congress.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Senator Byrne says Obama is involved in a power grab.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  The media will just point out this guy's a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  But we covered this a few weeks ago, and the Washington Post reported the National Security Council is seizing all federal agencies basically under Homeland Security.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  So, I mean, this is dictatorship being set up. Seamless integration from Bush to Obama, so we'll be going over that too.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  We were talking to Sean in California, and Sean was bringing up the philosophers that the neocons follow from the Chicago business school,
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  and Leo Strauss and his ideas. He was publicly an admirer of dictatorships,
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  and they next ascend with another PhD offered out of Harvard, where Kissinger works,
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  and where Obama was his underling along with Brzezinski and others.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  And we've had Dr. Peter Boyle on about that. He's one of the only PhDs to go through that.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  There's only one a year who actually turned against him, and it was open discussions about how they were going to set up world government and enslave everybody.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  So, we've got to have Boyle back on.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  But let's go ahead and go back to Sean, and he can finish his point.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Well, essentially, I guess the only point I really wanted to raise is the fact that the irony of the Straussian position is that these guys seem to think that they are in touch with some kind of secret.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  But the main thing that you have to remember, I think, for everyone, including people who are actually wanting to make a difference in the state of the world,
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  is that knowing a secret is different from actually doing something about the state of reality.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Well, if you read that philosophy, it's a mind game. It's just like when somebody says resistance is futile, you've already lost.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  The public's been trying to go, OK, I've already lost. It's inevitable.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  Notice their talking points from Obama and Pat Robertson saying he loves him and supports him.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  He says God says Obama will bring socialism. It is good. New World Order. It is inevitable. It is inevitable.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  It is inevitable. It is inevitable.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  What does the Borg say? You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  And that mind trick of Rove telling the press, reality is what we tell you it is.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Just like when the military is assaulting a position and they're broadcasting, we're not assaulting.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  We're here to help you as they bayonet you. The loudspeaker is saying we're helping. We're helping. Stand down.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Weak-minded people, it's like a Jedi mind trick. And they will just, oh, OK, you don't need to see his identification.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  What kind of droids are you looking for? It doesn't matter. They still say there's been more editorials written than I've seen lately.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  They're saying Alex Jones is insane. There's no New World Order. None of this is happening.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  It doesn't matter that it's...
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Sorry, I say the problem there is what Strauss would say in mocking you is that the burden on proof lays to you.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Because already, you know, people are born into a situation.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  This is a mind trick. I say you're a sniveling chicken-necked coward. We are going to get the information out with the real reality and get people to assess reality themselves.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  And you are going to be defeated. History shows all tyrants fall. See, it's an elitism.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  I've run into people who are minions of the New World Order and they'll say, oh, they'll laugh at me and go, oh, is that really what you think?
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  As if I'm insecure. As if them laughing at me does anything. It's a con game. These are just con artists.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  That's all they are. They're scum.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  They say all that is necessary is to deny. And also that, you know, like I said before, the burden...
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Well, this is mental illness. The country, the world's collapsing. They're collapsing it so they can rule a pile of dung.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  But in the end, they will fall. They're unhappy, sniveling pieces of trash. They're not in total control and they will be defeated.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  I appreciate your call. They are mentally ill, drinking their own Kool-Aid.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Okay? If they were true men of destiny, they would build up humanity because that is the true higher calling.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  They're not. They're weak. So they use evil to cheat and they cheat themselves in their own progeny.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  They will be routed out.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  At hempusa.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and Canada.

[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy?
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Bin Laden.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  This is his MO.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  Life Change T sets the standard. Have you heard on radio all the new T's with funny names, movie stars, celebrities,
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  endorsing these products, and so on? Have you checked the results?
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three month contracts and all that stuff?
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  Have you checked their results? Oh, that's right, I said that.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Did you check the ingredients and you checked for caffeine?
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Yeah. Life Change T is the real deal. Not a new Yippee-y-yay T.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  But a T, if you drink it daily, it will change your life, and it will clean your body.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  The real name is results. You can pay more and you can have a celebrity smile, or you can get results.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Your call. Or should I say, make the call.

[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  Joshua in Florida, you're on the air, Joshua.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Alex Jones, how are you doing, my friend?
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  It's great to be here fighting tyranny. Great to be alive.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Fantastic. I called you a couple weeks ago about a 9-11 truth event we were having here.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  I wanted to give you a quick update, if I can.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  We had 40 people show up. We gave out about 2,000 DVDs.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  We got a fantastic response from the public.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  It's getting pretty hard to deny our claims at this point in the game.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  And I also wanted to tell you, this is pretty big news.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Myself and about 10 other patriots were able to infiltrate a geopolitical summit at Florida International University
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  and get some good confrontation footage.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  I just want to read you the guest speaker list.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  It was here we had Dr. Francis Spookiyama, Dr. Robert Kagan,
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Parash Khanna, and Dr. Fareed Zakaria.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  What do those names mean to you, Alex?
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Fareed Zakaria. That's the guy that's a Bilderberg minion and a CNN propagandist.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  And again, if the people didn't have power, they wouldn't have their minions at every major university having summits called.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They've been having me at UT for two years called New World Order.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  And we've gone and videotaped these where they go, we need to put people in FEMA camps.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  We need to get rid of the Bill of Rights or Al Qaeda will kill us with mushroom clouds.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And it's all just base propaganda.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Yeah, we got some fantastic footage.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  We were able to ask them some hard questions regarding the PNAC documents and a lot of stuff like that.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  Probably the most interesting thing, some of the actual panelists,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  the professors that were asking questions, one of the professors in particular, Dr. Mark Rosenberg,
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  he talked about his knowledge of a military coup to take place in 2012, and I did some research on him.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  He is actually a member of the Council on Foreign Relations as well.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  You mean a CFR member was there admitting there's a plan for a military coup?
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Absolutely. I want to send you the footage as soon as we get it together so you can put it up.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Well, don't send it to me.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  We're putting it up on YouTube as well, but we wanted to give it to you.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Maybe you could put it up on InfoWars.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Yeah, but it's key for you to build your own organization, your own websites.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Certainly, we might be able to use it in some other way down the line, but don't wait.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Always just get it out and then put your own website up and build your group from that.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  We were working there. There's a group out of the Florida International University called Federal Jack.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  They're very organized. They have their own website, and they've been posting all this stuff.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  We actually found out about it through them.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  You're right there. This networking is key for our intelligence operations against the globalist, our counterintelligence operations.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Fire out any websites. Do you guys have a website?
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  The Miami group is federaljack.com.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  I visit there daily, and they have really good updates, and they keep tabs on what's going on in Miami.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  That's how we were able to find out about this summit.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  What we really want to do, what we're trying to do in the state of Florida, is organize, kind of like have the Paul Revere deal,
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  where if we hear any word that there's going to be some new order scum coming into town, we can get on the phone and go through.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  And that way, everywhere they go, when they're putting on their propaganda, you go and blow their operation by bringing up real issues,
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  and then they'll go out of their script and look guilty and say incriminating things,
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  then you'll educate the faculty, the students, and others that are at these elite functions,
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  and on top of it, then they will have pangs of conscience.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  There was a CFR member, Professor Castle, who now, three years ago, in an internal secret CFR meeting,
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  most of their meetings, they sign nondisclosure letters, but it was so important, he recorded it, and he said,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  okay, you guys say you can bury people alive, pull their fingernails out, crush the child's genitals in front of their parents,
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  which was a real case, is why he was bringing it up, and John Hughes said yes, yes, the president can do whatever he wants,
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  he's basically God, and so we're seeing rebellion against this tyranny, even within their own quarters,
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  because a lot of these people in the CFR, it's now over 4,000 members, are people the globalists wanted to co-opt.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  And, you know, I don't know what Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are doing, involved with the CFR,
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  but I've got it on good intel, from people that know them, from two different sources in Hollywood,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  that they've both seen my films, they've seen what really woke them up first, was American Freedom to Fascism,
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I know somebody that met with them, I'm just going to leave it at that, and that they are aware of what's going on,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  and suddenly she approached the CFR, I don't want to, well this has been public before, somewhat, I'm not blowing any cover,
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I'm sure the CFR knows, but it may even be an infiltration by her, you know, she's in that Robert De Niro directed movie
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  about the rituals and things going on at Skull and Bones, The Good Shepherd,
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  and so, I'm not sure, but she's in all those Illuminati movies, but, well I'm just going to leave it at that,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  we're not sure about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, but give me the names, I've heard that professor's name,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  the Rosenberg name, I want to get him on, please email that to joeyv.infowars.com,
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  and what's Rob's email, we have two producers, Rob what, just come on in and tell me,
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Rob D at InfoWars, RobD at InfoWars.com, and so what's that professor's name again?
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  His name was Dr. Mark Rosenberg, and what was funny is he brought that up, he talked about the 2012 coup,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  and the speaker that he brought that up in regards to was Mr. Parash Khanna,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  and he as well as a Counsel and Foreign Relations Researcher, and he just tried to play it off like it was a joke,
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  so I really think like what you said, maybe there is a little bit of distinction among the CFR members,
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  even at that point it's still compartmentalized I believe.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  Oh no, no, no, it's a pyramidal power structure, mainly so they can spy on influential people,
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and then they have questionnaires for their members, they find out what their political view is,
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  and they're kind of like a Masonic organization, they're kept on the periphery,
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  and then it's the inner boards and inner bodies that wield the real power,
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  appreciate the call, excellent call, excellent points, Joshua.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Let's talk to Mike in Arizona, you're on the air Mike.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Yeah, thanks for everything you're doing for us down here, we're big supporters of you,
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  and we see a lot of stuff happening down here in the city with an invasion of all the Spanish that are coming over here,
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  and that's middle class Spanish, that is, that are coming up over the border,
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  which I've been noticing here at the rest areas.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Oh yeah, it's most of the governors and mayors are now really living in the United States,
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, California, because everything's collapsing.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Yesterday you had a little thing on there on Kerala, about Arcadia,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  well I grew up in that area down there, and you were saying that they were going to be doing some kind of operations down there?
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Yes. And those scumbags down there are targeted farmers that are 60 and 70 in that little town,
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  you know, that's an average age down there.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  Really? Those are retired people down there in that area.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  There's no young people down there.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Well what, you know they say, oh, we're not doing gun confiscation drills,
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  I've been to countless of these events and it says they're going to go door to door and ask if they can search the house
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  and then go through their closets and cupboards, and they're looking for a gun dealer.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  I mean, that's what the sergeant said it was, and you know now there's a-
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  They're going to happen down there, man. That county down there, the people down there are straight up heartland people
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  and they're not going to put up with that down there.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  Well, you know, we learned about it, we learned about it from a guy putting on a YouTube video
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  and playing the local radio station and he lives in the town, you know, by it saying we don't want this,
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  we got calls from people in the town saying they don't want it,
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  and then I tell the news that and they don't believe me, they say no, everyone in the town likes it.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  But in the very article that they wrote attacking me in the town paper,
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  they have the quote, real gun dealer in town who they asked to take part in drill saying,
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  well, I didn't commit to the drill because I had more questions.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Okay, anyway, do you have a name for who he is or?
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  You know, I've actually got, I mean, it's in the news article, I've got to dig it out,
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  I actually talked to him yesterday, he refused to come on.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  I know the sheriff down there in that county in Carroll County, and his name's Doug Bass,
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  and I've been arrested by him a few times down there through the years,
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  and for things that I've done, but besides that point,
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  he doesn't strike me as that type of a person to take money from these scumbags
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  that want to take or plant it down, and we're pissed.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  And we're not going to let this shit happen anymore.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  All right, Mike, I appreciate your call.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  I really appreciate your call there.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Let's talk to Keith in Ohio, Keith around the ear.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  Are you there?
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  Yeah, we're here, buddy.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  Yeah, I was just calling to talk to you about,
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  I was listening to the news the other night, I haven't been able to sleep for days,
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  our economy's crushed here, and what are they worried about is taking our guns.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  That's kind of depressing here.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  I mean, specifically the news was talking about taking your guns?
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Yeah, pretty much.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  I thought they got all this legislation in there to take our guns,
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  and they're not worried about our economy, they're worried about our guns.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Well, yeah, because things won't completely break down,
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  like when the police stood down during the LA riots,
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  and the Koreans were the only people that didn't have their neighborhoods burned down,
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  because they stood up there with their shotguns and rifles,
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  and fired at the looters who were firing at them,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  so the looters ran off in fear.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  The police stood down, and they'll do the same thing like New Orleans.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  They'll let things break down for a few weeks,
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  and then they'll come in on the edge of the town.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  The first place they'll go is the middle class areas.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  They'll knock on your door, they'll take your guns,
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  they're trained for this, it's happening in New Orleans,
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  and then they will just let the looting continue,
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  and then if any citizens try to get out of the city,
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  they'll machine gun them, it's happening in New Orleans, that's on record,
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  and that's the plan, is letting things break down.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  And they can't stand it that we're armed,
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  because they can't do what they did in Russia or Nazi Germany.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  I mean, they just really got a hankering to, you know, gut us,
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  and really go after us, but it's very upsetting for these scumbags that run things.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Well, all I can say is just keep buying them, put them away.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Well, if you don't go out and also use their firearms,
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  you need to go out and train with them to defend yourselves.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  I guess that's evil to defend yourself,
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  but I guess you should be like England,

[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.600]  through my stack a few things I meant to get to in the last few days that I
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:50.640]  haven't I've been so busy we're gonna get into what Barack Obama had to say
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:55.400]  last night continue with your phone calls we have a state senator joining us
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:59.400]  as we continue to cover in a long series we're doing in the next few weeks
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:03.280]  been doing it for the last few weeks on state sovereignty being declared to the
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:08.200]  10th amendment 9th amendment but yesterday I mentioned the fact that
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:11.360]  every few days I see articles about soldiers being cheated soldiers being
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:15.280]  forced to take experimental vaccines that's illegal soldiers not being given
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:20.800]  bonuses or college money they were promised it just goes on and on there's
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:24.200]  no honor among the leadership of the government it's just it's totally
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:29.000]  bankrupt and it will collapse like Mexico soldiers still waiting for tour
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:34.560]  bonuses this is USA today and the Pentagon has not started complying with
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:39.680]  the law requiring the payment of monthly bonuses of up to $500 forced to
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:43.160]  remain on active duty beyond their enlistment period military officials
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:46.840]  said so it's a draft on those that have already served and filled their
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:51.360]  contract and they're cutting the health care for World War two Korean War
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:54.840]  Vietnam vets that's been in the news they've said you know they claim they
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:57.560]  were also gonna pay for people's families health care they're saying no on
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:03.080]  that it's just classic Pentagon spokesman Brian Whitman acknowledged the
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:05.800]  five-month delay in paying the bonuses and said that the Defense Department is
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:10.120]  working on a plan to start paying the almost 13,000 soldiers currently in the
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:18.120]  stop-law system here's another one this is out of AP Yahoo news army charity
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:24.440]  hordes of millions Fort Bliss Texas as soldiers stream home from Iraq and
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:28.040]  Afghanistan the biggest charity inside the US military has been stockpiling
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:32.880]  tens of millions of dollars meant to help put returning fighters back on their
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:38.080]  feet and Associated Press investigation shows as many military families dealt
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:42.840]  with long war deployments and increasing numbers of home foreclosures the army
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:47.320]  emergency relief grew to 345 million behemoth during those years the
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:52.520]  charity packed away 117 million into its own reserves while spending just 64
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:56.360]  million on direct aid according to AP analysis of its tax records and that's
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:02.560]  only one example look the people that run the military they like killing third
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:08.600]  world people they like destroying and dominating and taking over their savage
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:11.560]  and there's this culture of let's kill kill kill let's kill the enemy you know
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:19.720]  kill them all let God sort them out yeah kill you and let God sort you out they
[1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:25.360]  don't care about you they're there to use you they're there to hurt you you
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:30.040]  understand that they will kill you in a minute and claim somebody else did it
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:37.240]  just to get a war going and the sooner you realize that Henry Kissinger and all
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:43.640]  these people were right books calling the military and police dumb animals they
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:54.000]  revel in using you they don't fight they're the controllers and you know
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  there's so many of these military charities that when you study them and
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.440]  look at them they're keeping most of the money for themselves and it's
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:08.920]  disgusting remember United Way and a couple other charities got over three
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:12.240]  billion dollars from 9-11 and then didn't give but less than half of it to
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:14.560]  people and to do it they had to sign away their rights on to suit the
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:20.000]  government to get that money so they took citizens donations and then kept most
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:26.080]  of but then gave the rest with strings attached remember what happened with the
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:29.840]  Red Cross of the Oklahoma City bombing millions of dollars was mailed and the
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:34.320]  Red Cross quote took over sorting the mail and would cash the checks in their
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:38.520]  name even when they were written mainstream news to family members it
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:42.280]  would be written directly to somebody somebody saw in the news directly to
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:46.000]  their PO box directly to their home and the Red Cross didn't just steal the
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.560]  donations they would sit there and take donations that didn't even have their
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:54.480]  name on it that was in the Daily Oklahoma and the Red Cross gave a lot of the
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:29:00.680]  money they got of the billions to gun control groups and I told people on 9-11
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:03.760]  don't give your money the Red Cross United Way you know I've studied
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:06.880]  charities that I found out are pretty good meals on wheels but now they're
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.720]  using that to spy on the old people it's been confirmed and kind of report on
[1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:15.720]  them and you know bringing social welfare the elder care so anything good
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:21.080]  gets taken over most the money there's like 85% of the money you give to
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:25.160]  salvation army ends up getting there though we just offered to donate a
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.240]  bunch of expensive furniture to you know they always advertise they want it to
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:33.920]  the salvation army they wouldn't come get it but I hear the ads every day
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:37.840]  give us your furniture give us your cars give us your refrigerators I said
[1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:46.520]  okay come get all this stuff and they just didn't know so just pretty sick

[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:24.040]  acclimated to the fact that the government openly has put out Pentagon
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:30.760]  plans to forcibly microchip the American people and now it's even been
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:35.160]  mainstream news I have become so acclimated to the fact that the globalist
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:39.840]  by design are collapsing every major nation in the world that Mexico is now
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:46.000]  in civil war that Texas is now under civil emergency the border is under
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:51.920]  martial law we had a state senator on yesterday and a society with a hundred
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:57.360]  million people is collapsing just south of us the stock market is plunging today
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:04.920]  right now continuing to plunge every day most people I know who have college
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:10.520]  degrees were educated are losing their houses most people I know are losing
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:15.800]  their houses in Austin there's no one there to buy them and this is supposedly
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:20.520]  one of the best cities in the country to be California Michigan Florida places
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:25.160]  like that are in freefall right now they're openly building FEMA camps
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.480]  openly saying they're gonna use 20,000 US troops against the American people Army
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:32.200]  War College says they're training to engage the American people they're doing
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.680]  gun confiscation drills everywhere house to house and then newspapers have the
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:42.440]  nerve to claim we're making this up and to say we're fear mongers I mean go watch
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:46.560]  my films I said they would have a contrived economic collapse through the
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:50.120]  derivatives market specifically in the subprime mortgage is what they would
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:57.200]  blame it on and exactly what we said 12 years ago 10 years ago 8 years ago 2
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:39:02.040]  years ago it's all happening we know what's going on this show the guess we
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:05.640]  have the information it's all I do is interview experts of every facet
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.480]  constantly read documents constantly renews constantly re-legislation and I'm
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:16.440]  just pretty much sitting here calmly as Rome burns around me I'm not evacuating
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:23.840]  I'm expanding in the middle of it and if the people would just wake up to how
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.120]  bankrupt and how illegitimate and how criminal and how just overtly tyrannical
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:33.160]  the scum that masquerages the government is and the corporations that
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:38.920]  control it like a puppet a hand puppet you know let's get past Obama he's
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:43.400]  literally the little hand puppet stuck on there a little smiley face and I'm
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:47.320]  like can't look you notice there's an arm beneath him the special interest the
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:52.200]  big banks the lobbyist all his lies going back on everything expanding the
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:59.280]  torture expanding the secret arrest headline Bush Obama backs Bush on no
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:08.640]  rights for detainees Reuters Reuters headline abuse intensifying at camps and
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:15.040]  I talked to quote liberals they just want to feel good and walk around like
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:18.400]  they're everything's fine see they perfectly bring Bush in he tears
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:23.480]  everything up acts like a scumbag then they give you the smart well-spoken you
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:28.120]  know intellectuals sell him the media claims he's God puts halos on him on
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:31.960]  the news I mean it's ridiculous and says he'll fix it I know stuff scary he'll
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:36.720]  fix it people say okay I'll do whatever you say fix it and instead he is in the
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:40.240]  same course same direction of George Bush except Bush had the throttle down
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:46.240]  about 70 percent Obama literally slammed the throttle down all the way in the
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:50.400]  ship of state and that wasn't fast enough so he went in electronically took
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:53.800]  the governor off and now the engine's just blowing fire out the back going
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:58.720]  it's going so fast I mean the skin on our faces is shaking and pulling back
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:04.560]  like we're astronauts reentering orbit as we just plunge like a meteor straight
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:10.400]  into tyranny and there's just people going oh I love him oh he's so good
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:17.520]  Obama Obama meanwhile the Republicans are all how dare him have secret camps
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:24.120]  how dare him expand government how dare him do all these bad things meanwhile
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:33.200]  you were the guy's cheerleading bush going the government's gotta save me
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:40.720]  from Muslim extreme ass how do you like it now how do you like it who you're
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:43.360]  worried about you're worried about the bankers in Washington but you're worried
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:47.000]  about the man in the cave that made Noran stand down and had building 7 fall
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.920]  but nothing hit it who they admit to see I asked it going back to 10 buck to I
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:58.320]  mean it is ridiculous we are being financially economically conquered with
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:01.920]  the military carrying up the rear because the elite can't allow the
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:04.880]  American people to take the government back because then we would prosecute
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:09.320]  these criminals that's the thing people don't get about tyranny the aim is to
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:13.680]  steal and loot and dominate and do you social engineering to suppress the
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:20.640]  public so that the criminal overclass never is brought to justice
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:27.200]  I remember two or three years ago talking to the deli in Arizona Austin and
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:29.840]  you know the well-to-do people that live in million-dollar houses and think
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:32.520]  they're members of the elite because they get called the breakfasts with
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:36.640]  federal senators and they know Bush and have shook his hand and all this they'll
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:39.680]  waddle around and you know pull up on their Harley-Davidson I'm not bashing
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:42.120]  Harley-Davidson's but it just they're always on a Harley they'll pull up some
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:46.280]  50-year-old lawyer go I'm doing just great and yes so what if they did 9-11
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:49.760]  that's yeah you got to get tough to get the oil off I'm like you're doing great
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:52.800]  with the stock market right now aren't you well they're gonna implode that then
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:56.880]  you know it's just attitude yeah it's about oil we're an empire but we rule it
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:00.840]  oh you think you're part of the elite you think you're part of the winning team
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:07.520]  you are nothing to them either the minute they can rob you blind they will and
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:10.640]  they just don't want to kill you to save the little bunny rabbits and the bees
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:15.600]  and the and then the whales they want to kill you because that's what elites do
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:20.800]  you know the Romans went all over Gaul and Germania and what's Austria and
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:28.240]  Germany and France today and they would go in to the areas and kill all the men
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:32.960]  kill most the women and take the good-looking women and the healthy
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:38.000]  children back to Rome and they had handbooks on how to do it handbooks on
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.600]  how to lie to them how to even get them to lay down their arms and they'll use a
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:48.280]  minor infraction to renege on their promise because they wanted the terror
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:53.680]  they wanted to have the people who they were gonna face no they were gonna be
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:44:00.640]  killed see you don't understand that though some of you out there so let me
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:04.440]  tell the police and the military and everybody else something you can
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:08.240]  rationalize all day you can post comments on info wars and present planet
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:11.040]  going yeah I'm in the military and we're gonna put you people in FEMA camps and
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:14.240]  we love it and even post your handle to your Facebook and there you are in your

[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:31.040]  are gonna trigger and give you cancer between the age of 40 and 55 when
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:38.440]  you're no longer a military service and when you're dying of the bio weapons
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:43.880]  and planet in your body I know you're too mentally weak to even admit we were

[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:29.160]  you seen that actually you have stuff like that now it ends up injecting him
[1:45:29.160 --> 1:45:32.880]  with the chemical weapon but it gives you a nice hallucination of pleasure as
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:37.000]  you die and he sees the kaleidoscope things crawling around in his apartment
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:42.320]  this is what they want this is what they get this is what they want this is

[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:11.920]  equivalent of Agent Orange the DU you're gonna breathe it and you're gonna
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:18.040]  love it some of the news you know here's that daily times Harold hit piece
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:21.480]  National Guard unit scales back plans won't train in Arcadia and there's all
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:26.120]  this double-speak in the article but they basically say everybody loves it in
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:28.960]  the town everybody wants it you know it's not gun confiscation they're just
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:31.440]  going door to door to ask if they can search the houses and look in the
[1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:33.840]  covers and they're just gonna set up roadblocks and block in the town but
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:37.200]  everybody in the town loves it and they've got the one guy they asked to
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:45.560]  take part in the drill and he's quoted Tony Vonaheim I believe you pronounce it
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:51.880]  I really feel sorry for the National Guard having to justify their actions Tony
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:55.400]  Vonaheim who'd been asked to play the suspected arms dealer in the drill said
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:00.480]  he didn't commit this is supposedly their star guy and he didn't commit not the
[1:47:00.480 --> 1:47:04.760]  whole towns for it because he wanted more information the guard had planned a
[1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:09.040]  whole town meeting Monday March 2nd explain the exercise that's for
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:15.200]  volunteers to me it was totally innocent said Vonaheim it was a real life
[1:47:15.200 --> 1:47:19.280]  gun dealer yeah they were gonna practice taking over getting in there getting
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:25.880]  those let me come on folks but things got ugly real quick I got calls from
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:29.560]  North Dakota Washington Illinois Ohio it really had me concerned my guts were
[1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:32.600]  torn up I mean I people calling me telling me to evacuate the city I was
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:36.320]  thinking this isn't even funny this is wild I talked to him yesterday and he's
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:40.960]  like look my son was in Afghanistan and you know the military's innocent in
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:45.760]  this and I said sir look at your gut have you heard about him announcing
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:48.640]  they're gonna use 20,000 troops in the US to engage American people he's like
[1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:53.320]  no and I said you have internet I said it's Washington Post Army times he's
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:48:00.640]  like hmm and I said have you gone to YouTube and just Google police
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:03.720]  state 2000 and watch Marines and Army training to confiscate our guns I mean
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:07.680]  it's them saying it on video he said I'll look call me back in a few days and I'll
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:16.800]  look at coming on but I want to find out specifically in fact call him back
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:21.080]  today because I you know I want to hear his side of the story I'm sure he's a
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:23.680]  very nice person you know that you know that's the other issue people say our
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:27.840]  government isn't evil our troops aren't evil they know they're not they're
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:32.680]  compartmentalized and they're given false pretext false ideas in
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:35.960]  compartmentalization kind of a false script of why all this is being done
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:41.000]  but we know the real script this is what we do this is this is what we study
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:47.200]  that's why we can continue to predict the future over and over and over and over
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:53.160]  and over and over and over and over again this is why we have the track record
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:56.440]  this is why three years ago when they announced that Bernanke was going to be
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:01.400]  replacing Alan Greenspan coming up in six months I said you watch they're gonna
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:07.840]  implode things under him and I said subprime mortgage I mean it's I made a
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:12.880]  film about it it's called in game a film released a year and a half ago a film
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:18.520]  shot three years ago put me almost a year to make that I mean it's not
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:25.000]  revelation it's not like God's beaming it down into my head it's what they say
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:29.600]  they're going to do and the military is training to take your guns
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:39.040]  being in the military this is only one little purchase going out this is 84

[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:33.560]  the depression there was fresh evidence of weakening housing market with sales
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:38.680]  of existing homes falling unexpectedly last month the lowest level nearly 12
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:42.360]  years banking regulators plan to scrutinize the final conditions of

[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:16.520]  test will also help regulators decide whether the banks may need additional
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:21.200]  assistance that means federal money going into it and the bank being handed
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:24.880]  over to private other private banks so they can carry out the critical mission
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:29.120]  of boosting lending to customers a key ingredient to the economic turnaround
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:34.080]  oh yes it's the banks and the media badmouthing the economy to drive it
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:38.560]  down so they can carry this out on the housing front the National Association
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:42.640]  of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of existing homes fell 5.3% to an
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:49.000]  annual rate of 4.49 million last month from 4.74 million units in December it
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:53.200]  was the weakest showing since 97 and well below the slight rise in sales
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:56.200]  economists expected
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:03.120]  continuing here's another one from AP mass layoffs increased sharply last month
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:09.520]  as companies cut cost amid worsening recession employers took a large ax to
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:13.120]  their payrolls in January the government said Wednesday and the cuts are
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:16.600]  likely to get worse over the next few months Labor Department reported that
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:22.440]  mass layoffs or job cuts a 50 or more by a single employer increased to 2227 in
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:30.000]  January up almost 50% from the same month last year that's 2227 single
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:36.280]  employers that cut at least 50 jobs you understand so that's 50 times 2227
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:40.280]  January was a bad month labor market companies from a wide range of sectors
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:44.600]  announced tens of thousands of layoffs including Home Depot Inc Boeing company
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:48.680]  Pfizer Inc and Caterpillar Inc not all these cuts were reflected the
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:52.160]  government's mass layoffs report which counts actual firings reported by
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:55.360]  layoff workers seeing unemployment benefits nearly layoffs announced in
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:58.240]  January will take place over time meaning that the department's match layoff
[1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:08.040]  figures will likely keep increasing so meanwhile Iran is that a Reuters says
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:12.800]  no slowdown in its nuclear work which the IEA and the UN says completely
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:18.000]  peaceful Israel responds by saying they may attack them so that's what we got

[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:32.440]  continue our series on the states declaring sovereign he is one of the
[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:36.680]  biggest chance we have to beat the globalist well they will stage terror
[2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:41.360]  attacks to poses our saviors and attack the people and now they admit the
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:44.280]  Patriot acts being used in the general public in non-terror related cases
[2:00:44.280 --> 2:00:53.240]  you're all going to be on the terror list this is how it works but he has
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.680]  helped pass the sovereignty bill path set for other states seeking to
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:05.600]  reassert constitutional rights in fact can I get the bill I had it one of my
[2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:13.880]  other folders but I need that Oklahoma resolution all right well that's coming
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:19.840]  up let me go ahead and get into some of the other news that we have here in
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:24.920]  front of us the mail online reports social websites harm children's brains
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:29.560]  chilling warning to parents from top neuroscientist and I've read over these
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:34.160]  findings this just matches the literally is one of the most study things out
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:37.480]  there thousands of other government industry studies internal studies by
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:41.800]  television companies themselves you can just as we've talked about Google the
[2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:52.280]  term TV viewing Alzheimer's or TV viewing brain damage and TV for lowers
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:55.560]  people because of the flicker rate and other issues down into a dreamlike state
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:02:00.280]  of lower cognitive development and the average person watches over four hours
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:05.560]  of TV children even more and so they don't sociologically psychologically they
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:07.800]  don't know how to communicate with people anymore they don't know how to talk to
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:11.840]  people they'll sit two feet away text messaging somebody who's right by them
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:15.560]  and this is accelerating as people literally get sucked into their
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:23.280]  television sets as the analogy they are becoming you know Borg and parents like
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:27.680]  it because they can go off and watch TV themselves or surf the internet and you
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:31.680]  know radio and they've done you can Google these studies because you have to
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:36.080]  listen and then you have and then your mind images everything you're hearing
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:41.360]  if I say yellow duck your your brain just image the yellow duck that made more
[2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:48.280]  neural pathways open up if I say green penguin you are now imaging a green
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:54.960]  penguin same thing with reading reading and listening radio hit the same areas
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:58.480]  of the brain but the study show radio even more increases intelligence
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:06.240]  because you have to image it just from hearing it one way and then with reading
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:11.440]  you're seeing and the some studies say that it's both good for the brain but
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:14.480]  that it just hits different areas but it's it's similar you go read all these
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:20.640]  studies but with flicker rates with TVs and high-def screens especially it's a
[2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:25.280]  flash and your brain's picking up the flash and it's a flashing light that
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:29.360]  hit me a flashing lights make people have seizures and they've coated the
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:35.920]  Pentagon back in the 40s had had even calibrated the televisions and its
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:39.280]  studies these are public on what mesmerize I mean they designed it to
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:45.280]  take control of your mind and so they are hitting you and bombarding you with
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:53.040]  this and there's all these studies out it's just a fact that violent video
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:57.840]  games bring you into an even lower state because you would think that because
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:02.440]  you're concentrating and watching a screen with a flicker rate that would
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:06.800]  actually increase cognitive but it lowers the brain not just into a sleep
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:11.400]  state or a sleepwalking state but playing video games for long periods of
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:18.800]  time will and people die doing this will bring you into a state that is only
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:24.660]  found in people with serious sleep apnea very low oxygen levels but the
[2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:31.040]  oxygen is there but the areas of the brain go into death mode and because the
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:35.120]  people are fully focused or basically like hypnotized they're they're
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.560]  meditating and I mean I'm replaying video games and then that was just donkey
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:41.400]  Kong stuff and I would get so focused because the levels that took such exact
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:46.160]  focusing and you and for hours just I was there in play and I remember like
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:49.120]  stopping the game when somebody came in and I would be like dizzy and in the
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:54.200]  days you were under mind control but now you're not beaten you know stuff with a

[2:08:24.760 --> 2:08:35.120]  senator Randy Brogdon of Oklahoma is our guest he is introduced mirror
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:41.600]  legislation to the house version that representative Charles Key and others
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:46.320]  have gotten to pass the house and you know people keep saying can this work
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:50.800]  will this work it's only hope we've got people like all congressman keys and
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:55.520]  representative keys he can't get anything passed do you know they'll never
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:08:59.320]  get it through the Senate well it's got a very good chance of passing the Senate
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:03.760]  other states are passing this we got Texas to introduce two different
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:07.760]  resolutions the last week your calls I talked to the reps office and had them
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:15.640]  on your call spurred this you're doing it and we just reeducate the public I
[2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:20.360]  guess they never even been educated so we can just educate them but we have to
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:25.240]  educate the public on the fact that the state's created the federal government
[2:09:25.240 --> 2:09:28.080]  federal governments out of control bottom paid for by foreign banks letting
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:31.080]  foreign corporations come in buy off the feds buy off the state
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:34.920]  legislatures take over our roads our infrastructure that's what privatization
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:39.680]  is not real privatization and so here's the headline Oklahoma house passes
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:43.080]  sovereignty bill passed it for other states seeking to re-estirc constitutional
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:47.080]  rights and see people love a winner as other states pass this and some states
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:50.600]  have completely passed it and the strong language in these bills about no to gun
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:54.120]  confiscation no to FEMA camps no to hand in our roads over to foreign
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:00.600]  corporations no to handing our ports over no to the banks taking over I mean
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.040]  it's happening it's happening we have to have the states as the leaders as our
[2:10:04.040 --> 2:10:10.800]  representatives take on the feds who we created through the states so I'm just
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:13.960]  very very excited about this and I appreciate him joining us as Senator
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:18.360]  Randy Brogdon sir thank you for what you're doing tell us exactly what's
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:22.400]  going on and how the listeners can help get this pass of the Oklahoma Senate so
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:28.200]  it's a fully fully in place for the state Oklahoma well I appreciate you
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:33.240]  having me on and I'm always excited when I have an opportunity to spread the
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:37.880]  good word of freedom and liberty and sovereignty and I have been welcomed in
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:41.800]  the state of Texas many times over the last several months talking on
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:45.600]  sovereignty and freedom issues as a matter of fact I think I've been down
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:50.400]  there about nine times in different parts of the state discussing issues just
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:54.880]  like this and the NAFTA superhighway the TTC 35 sovereignty freedom the 10th
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:58.840]  amendment so let me tell you what we're doing here in the state of Oklahoma we
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:04.120]  as a legislative body have decided that we are going to reclaim our state's
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.680]  rights and you hit the nail on the head there would not be a federal government
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:13.320]  had the states collectively not created the federal government the federal
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:17.720]  government Congress has forgotten about that and most state legislatures around
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:23.800]  this nation have forgotten about it but you know true we are part of the United
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:30.800]  States system but just because we are a part of the United States does not mean
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:36.120]  that as a state or as a people we are subjects to the to the federal government
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:42.000]  that is not what it's all about Congress has very limited rights enumerated
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:48.400]  powers that we the people have given Congress the responsibility to do today
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:52.600]  Congress is the biggest this Congress is the biggest bunch of overreachers and
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:58.520]  underachievers I have ever seen in my entire life it is what what what this
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:03.600]  Congress is involved with is devastating to us as a nation it is
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:07.960]  devastating to us as a free people if I could just add and get your take on the
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:12.160]  president's not state of the union addressed to Congress a 10 minute
[2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:14.960]  standing ovation as everything's collapsing and falling apart
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:18.760]  Obama bad-mouthing the states and saying we're going to make sure you don't
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:22.720]  waste the money when they take our state money and then send it back with
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:27.600]  strings attacks a tiny portion and Obama's the guy who helped engineer the
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:31.120]  banker bailout the very people that changed the laws in the 90s are now
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:35.560]  running his administration that set all this up and they're just so proud of
[2:12:35.560 --> 2:12:38.960]  themselves they're just so I mean you know both the Republicans and the
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:43.280]  Democrats it was a sickening spectacle your take on that state senator well it
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:48.200]  was probably one of the most soft morgue speeches I've ever heard in my life if
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:52.880]  you compare it to the Constitution if you compare it to the founders of this
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:59.680]  great nation and we I watched as much of it as I could and I saw Republicans
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:04.640]  standing and cheering talking about putting limits on how much private
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:11.520]  industry can make and so our Republicans in Congress have so fallen off the wagon
[2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:16.520]  or they they've drank the Kool-Aid I don't know what goes on in Washington but
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:19.880]  here's what I am convinced of I've been serving in the state Senate for the last
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:26.360]  six years I am convinced without any shadow of a doubt we can take our nation
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:32.200]  back but it will be done at the state level state by state by state we must
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:37.680]  regain our sovereignty we must re implement the freedom and the liberty
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:43.120]  that our founding fathers gave us and our 10th Amendment resolution SJR 10 and
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:48.880]  House Bill 103 uses some pretty strong words we are ordering the federal
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:54.240]  government to cease and assist effective immediately of all mandates that are
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:59.360]  beyond the scope of their constitutionally delegated powers and I dare
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:06.460]  say 90% plus of what Congress is involved with today falls outside of their
[2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:10.680]  constitutional authority and the enumerated powers that we the people
[2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:14.240]  gave them and I'm telling you what I'm on a charge here in the state of
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:18.160]  Oklahoma to take them back well we're with you we're right behind you and
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:21.760]  right besides you as senator very excited and just really will you love
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:27.360]  your spirit the things you're talking about and if you do compare the federal
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:30.600]  government today to the founding fathers how eloquent intelligent their grasp of
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:34.360]  history what they were doing and you compare it to what's going on now I
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:38.960]  mean number one they're only going to regulate control regular businesses and
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:44.840]  small companies if you read his $500,000 cap which is to total total government
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:50.280]  control total tyranny communist and fascist do it it it's waivers for all
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:55.520]  the big banks and all his cronies and it says they will selectively enforce who
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:15:00.200]  they put caps on so it's even worse than just having the government put a cap
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:05.600]  because I mean this is incredible to talk about social engineering well
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:11.080]  president Obama has no moral authority to stand and lecture the citizens here
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:15.320]  in the state of Oklahoma or the state of Texas on how to be how to be fiscally
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:19.880]  responsible we have just witnessed something in the in the first 30 days of
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:25.360]  his administration with a very socialistic agenda I mean it is it
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:30.600]  borders on fascism to where government and industry are now going to partner up
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:37.120]  and it will be devastating to the free markets it will collapse our country as
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:41.640]  we know it but I'm telling you what we can change it because the state of
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:45.120]  Oklahoma we're not going to participate in his nonsense I'm not we're not going
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:50.680]  to participate in his debt or his mandates we're going to this is my goal
[2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:54.280]  I don't suspect we have a governor that's going to be very helpful in that
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:16:00.160]  right now so but you know the legislature is making a very strong
[2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:03.080]  statement that we're reclaiming our rights and we're going to order the
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:06.160]  government to get out of our pocket and out of our backyard leave us alone take
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:09.960]  care of the responsibilities that we've given them and nothing more nothing
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:15.920]  less well this is elite corporations they're on record using the presidency
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:20.440]  and the executive in the legislative to hijack industry I mean they love this
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:23.560]  I've got financial times of London articles where they admit the big
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:27.320]  super banks are just using this to buy up banks and other businesses and now
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:30.800]  they're talking about nationalizing other things like oil and industry and
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:35.440]  auto making I mean that's great for the few CEOs that are in the Obama
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:40.360]  administration that's why the Republicans are playing along because they
[2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:43.760]  want you know part of that honeypot too I mean I think this is the greatest
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:47.540]  challenge this nation has ever faced because as our forebears said this
[2:16:47.540 --> 2:16:51.440]  country could not fall from without it will only fall from within well that's
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:57.000]  exactly right and there's there's one thing that will restore this nation and
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:01.840]  it is to what I what I like to refer to back to the future if we're going to
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:04.400]  have a future in this nation we're going to have to go back to our founding
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:09.560]  roots and start living by the principles that the Declaration of
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:14.080]  Independence so clearly spelled out and the protected in the rule of law with
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:18.840]  our Constitution you know Obama has been talking down this this nation ever
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:23.360]  since he or talking down the economy ever since he has come into office it
[2:17:23.360 --> 2:17:28.240]  was it's quite different message what he was sharing out on the campaign trail
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:33.120]  you know he did inspire a lot of people and of course his socialistic agenda I
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:37.200]  hope fails and fails miserably but it looks like it's going to be a stark
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:40.800]  reality here before too long well senator you're right I mean you're right when
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:44.840]  you say he was hope change we'll fix it right away it's not that bad and as soon
[2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:48.880]  as he came in he said you do exactly what I say that's right or a crisis will be
[2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:53.840]  a catastrophe that is economic terrorism that's exactly right and what we
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:58.080]  have seen this week the Bank of America stock fell 36 percent
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:02.480]  Christopher Dodd gets up and does his little whiny boy talk and we have
[2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:09.280]  Republicans falling in lockstep with him and the monetary system is obviously
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:14.280]  been in trouble for you know ever since we adopted the Federal Reserve system
[2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:18.040]  but a city group this week fell 22 percent I mean they're almost a penny
[2:18:18.040 --> 2:18:22.760]  stock now well guess who that's going to benefit it's going to benefit the big
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:27.040]  players it's going to benefit the federal government they own now I think 40
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.440]  percent of the stock or this is what they're wanting to do the federal
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:35.760]  government is going to own up to 40 percent of the financial stocks in this
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:42.920]  country you cannot become more of a fascist state than when the federal
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:48.800]  government takes over our banking institutions I mean it is just a
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:53.840]  bizarre situation we have found ourself in well senator senator studying this
[2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:56.800]  what's really happening is under the bank or bailout bill that gave on
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:00.920]  omnipotent power to the Treasury and the Federal Reserve and if you look at it
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:05.960]  it's really the Federal Reserve and offshore banks through the glove or the
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:11.080]  apparatus of government that are taking government control just like big banks
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:13.760]  do third-world countries I want to get your take on that I know you're a very
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:17.200]  busy man we've got a quick break can we come back and get your take on that and
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:20.560]  then get give out the bill number and tell listeners all over the country
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:25.800]  because this will be a domino effect how they can let their voices be heard but
[2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:30.160]  also we have a few affiliates in Oklahoma how folks can call and make sure
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:34.400]  this happens and also call the media and tell them don't you badmouth the state
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:38.080]  senator and others and Charles Key and others you don't have any future
[2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:43.560]  economically fools unless this happens I mean look America is 300 million people
[2:19:43.560 --> 2:19:46.600]  there's six and a half billion why do most of them live as slaves they let
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:51.280]  corruption take over look at Mexico they've got triple the resources we have
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:55.520]  they're collapsing because of corruption free market and liberty is what made this
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:19:58.680]  country so great and and they're killing the goose that lays the golden egg stay
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:05.600]  there senator companies continue to lay off thousands of people unemployment is
[2:20:05.600 --> 2:20:10.160]  the highest it's been in over 30 years statistics prove that in a recession
[2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:14.960]  crime rates go up everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent

[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:20.240]  sir that question asked for the break I've analyzed this about many economists
[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:24.680]  on I want to see if you concur nationalization is bad enough but the
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:28.440]  Federal Reserve is private it's really taking control and vertically
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:33.000]  integrating their competition so they put the debt on us but then they keep the
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:37.920]  profits can you comment on that you bet and the Federal Reserve it was probably
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:42.880]  one of the blackest marks of anything that has ever transpired in our nation's
[2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:46.960]  history most people have no understanding that the Federal Reserve is a
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:52.320]  private group of financiers they literally run the dollar they run our
[2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:57.160]  monetary system that is not the way our founding fathers set it up as a matter
[2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:02.520]  of fact there are many debates and and articles written all even in the
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:09.680]  Federalist papers talking about never having a central monetary or a central
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:15.200]  bank it is the responsibility of the federal government to coin money and
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:20.160]  once again the lackadaisical unconstitutional near the wells in
[2:25:20.160 --> 2:25:24.720]  Congress they relinquish that responsibility handed it over and now
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:30.280]  we have a black market of paper money that could be printed at will our
[2:25:30.280 --> 2:25:36.160]  inflation rate is so high today people have no I mean the the feds tell us our
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:39.560]  inflation rates three or four percent whatever it is I would dare say our
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:44.400]  inflation rate today is probably up around 14 to 15 percent well you've
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:47.800]  done your research that's that's what all the economists we talk to saying it's
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:52.240]  gonna over 20 for those that don't know the the fire and offshore banks are
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:56.040]  collapsing the economy right they can have a fire sale that's exactly right
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:00.320]  I mean they did this and they need to be arrested instead of grandstanding as our
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:05.680]  saviors well and I mentioned before the break Bank of America stock fell 36
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:10.480]  percent this week a city group fell 22% well there's only a few people in this
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:13.960]  world that have an opportunity to go out and buy that stock at this fire sale
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:18.600]  and some of that money can I bet you a dollar to donut will come from China so
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:22.520]  we're in trouble we have still have opportunities and and I wouldn't buy
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:26.920]  people to go to my website it's just my name Randy Brogdon calm and I have
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:30.120]  written extensively about a lot of these issues that we're discussing a lot of
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:35.040]  our legislation is up on the website and I talk about freedom and liberty and
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:40.080]  sovereignty and and I have links to a lot of different publications and so I
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:43.800]  would invite your listeners to go and learn more about what we're trying to
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:48.000]  do here in Oklahoma we've got your we're also summer casting on TV right now
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:53.360]  senator Randy Brogdon's website is Randy Brogdon dot com go there they have
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:57.000]  the bills they have phone numbers they have contacts they have articles he's
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.760]  written it's an excellent website senator I know you've got to go into the
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:06.320]  Senate here in about three minutes tell us how we put pressure are especially
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:10.200]  our Oklahoma listeners but folks around the country on the Senate because you
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:13.600]  told me they might try some chicanery the state police have been trying to come
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:17.680]  in under the federal auspices and try to block things that's what the
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:21.720]  representative key told us right so so in the two or three minutes we've got
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:25.880]  left tell us what we need to do well I think that we're going to get a hearing
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:29.840]  on this bill that this time last year representative key had his bill passed
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:35.360]  off of the House floor 97 to 3 and the Democrat floor leader would not allow at
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:38.840]  the time would not allow me to have a hearing on the Senate floor that was the
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:43.080]  bad news the good news this year for the first time in our nation's are our
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:48.080]  state's history the Republicans took control of the Senate the first time
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:55.320]  since statehood so we have a 26 to 22 majority in the Senate and my bill has
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:00.120]  already passed overwhelmingly in judiciary committee it'll be headed to
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:03.680]  the floor probably Thursday or maybe Monday or Tuesday haven't decided yet
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:09.040]  and I suspect it's going to pass and here again we have two bills alive today
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:13.640]  here in the one House bill and one Senate bill and eventually I'm going to
[2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:18.480]  yield to representative keys bill because he ran the bill last year and I
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:23.120]  was his Senate author so we're trying to keep both bills alive just in case
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:27.720]  there are some shenanigans that take place and make sure that we give the
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:32.520]  citizens of Oklahoma an opportunity to to head down the path of reclaiming our
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:37.840]  sovereignty as a state and I'm telling you what I am encouraged what's
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:41.520]  happening here in Oklahoma my assistant came in just a while ago she said I've
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:45.840]  already had a call from a listener in California so your message this station
[2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:49.840]  and this message of freedom and sovereignty is is obviously making an
[2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:55.720]  impact as as we speak yes sir in closing you know if we had real
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:00.160]  Republicans like you have in Oklahoma and like they have in New Hampshire
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:04.440]  right interviewing people from all these states you guys are great resolution

[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:11.120]  the New World Order and I want you to listen to the information at the first
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:14.280]  of because it's true where this tiny little planet this little mode of dust
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:19.040]  in the universe and it goes over the fact that everybody we've ever loved
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:25.400]  everybody we've ever known will live and die on this planet and all these kings
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:28.920]  and queens came before us all the crazy things they did all the heroes all the
[2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:33.160]  tyrants we were all here and this is our special time to be alive here now and
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:36.680]  we need to think about future generations just like our ancestors live on
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:41.720]  through us we live on through generations that come after us and realize
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:45.560]  that liberty is what everything good flows from and tyranny is what everything
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:49.480]  bad flows from and if the good people don't stand up and say no to evil evil
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:54.520]  will win we don't want that to happen so let's go ahead and go to this video
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:38:04.040]  here it is that's here that's home that's us on it everyone you love everyone
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:10.360]  you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:17.320]  their lives the aggregate or joy and suffering thousands of confident

[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:56.800]  species lived there on the mode of dust suspended in a sunbeam
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:04.760]  think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:10.520]  in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:22.560]  a dot
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:27.760]  throughout history the elite have always fought for world government they've
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:33.600]  always sought to terrorize the people now they're making their final push for
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.640]  world government the worst elements of humanity in power because they're
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:45.640]  ruthless and are willing to do what it takes to get control pre-humanity is
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:52.840]  having war waged upon us by the social engineers the control freaks of the new
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:59.320]  world order they funded Hitler they funded Stalin and Mao Zedong
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:05.480]  Zbigniew Brzezinski funded Pol Pot as he killed three million people and now
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:08.560]  they're attempting to bring down Western Europe and the United States as they
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:13.760]  done all the third world nations it is our turn to fall our turn to be killed
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:21.680]  to be called and those that survive to be enslaved take your destiny in your
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:27.800]  hands and say no to the new world order there is a global meltdown coming it is
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:34.720]  a global depression and one world currency and one world financial system
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:40.560]  is the end game China said last week they want one global currency France said
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:46.800]  yesterday or the day before that they want one world order a new world order
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:52.000]  at the end of this event tonight a proposal for an expanded so-called
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:57.520]  free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of South America it's a plan from the
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:01.560]  business elites the political elites that will cost more American jobs cost
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:07.120]  American sovereignty but it would fulfill the president's father's vision this
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:11.640]  time a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic policy
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:15.840]  effectively surrendering the sovereignty of the United States which is what
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:20.480]  Bilderberg is is into by and large the idea of a one-world community a new
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:24.640]  world order you know they see that this is a government as opposed to a group of
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:29.680]  world leaders or people with influence European leaders have been pressing for
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:35.200]  an overhaul of the whole international financial system and they will continue
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:40.160]  to do so they're calling for an organization of a global summit as soon
[2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:43.480]  as next month
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:54.240]  canister and joseph very much for the transatlantic economic integration plan
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:58.680]  and for that too we need to develop a common market common standards so this
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:03.160]  is indeed a very important agreement
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:20.160]  within the next four years we will see the emergence of a new internet
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:25.560]  beginning the beginning of a new international order new world order of a
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:32.520]  new world order a new world order you're free and freedom is beautiful and you
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:39.840]  know it'll take time to restore chaos the forces shaping this world at this
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:57.200]  moment are so strong and they all tend in one direction
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:13.560]  you are not our guys we do not belong to you
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:19.560]  we stand as free humans have stood for the beginning of time against the strong
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:26.160]  man against the pros against the bullets you're here telling me we will resist the
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:30.440]  new world order we will continue to a world government and if you hear the
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:37.920]  shouting it's a group of demonstrators who come 9-11 was an inside job oh get a
[2:43:37.920 --> 2:43:42.120]  light before having everybody how do we know how do the American people know
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:46.360]  that not 11 what the stage was engineered by you David Walker Miller the
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:51.440]  twillatter Commission to see far and build a very good sir
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:44:03.320]  the inside job how dare you
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:21.100]  never need well enemies will fall he answered in 1984
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:38.600]  the truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies. I'm sick
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:44.120]  of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it till you've got me.
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:48.920]  Alright, great video there. Let's go ahead and play their other video, then we'll come
[2:44:48.920 --> 2:44:52.200]  back and take a few calls and get our next guest on. Let's go ahead and go to this same
[2:44:52.200 --> 2:44:57.440]  director's other resistance video. Now this gets into Barack Obama's brainwashing, it
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:16.600]  is extremely powerful. Let's start rolling this right now. Here it is. Listen carefully.
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:23.520]  In troubling economic times, people look to a leader for hope.
[2:45:23.520 --> 2:45:27.240]  The way we're going to win over the long-term is not just militarily, we've got to win
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:32.640]  over hearts and minds. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order
[2:45:32.640 --> 2:45:36.120]  that I think all of us would like to see.
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:42.040]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:47.160]  objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[2:45:47.160 --> 2:45:57.640]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:02.320]  The Obama fraud. Welcome back to reality.
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:08.160]  In Pakistan, meanwhile, the first apparent U.S. missile strike since Barack Obama became
[2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:12.760]  commander in chief. At least 17 people were killed, and the world is getting an early
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:15.880]  sample of the new administration's war on terror.
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:24.400]  But he can give new impetus to American foreign policy, partly because the reception of him
[2:46:24.400 --> 2:46:31.600]  is so extraordinary around the world. I think his path will be to develop an overall strategy
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:37.200]  for America in this period, when really a new world order can be created. It's a great
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:40.680]  opportunity, and it's a crisis.
[2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:45.920]  President-elect Obama giving new life to the North American Union, a plan by business and
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:50.920]  political elites to tear down the trade barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico,
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:55.680]  and to create a NAFTA superhighway. All of which to be done without the approval of Congress
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:47:00.040]  or the American people. I mean, the old boss is starting to look a lot like the new boss.
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:05.960]  He's President Bush's ninth cousin once removed. Cheney's cousin, Barack Obama, is also Bush's
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:06.960]  eleventh cousin.
[2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:11.800]  One of the things I discovered is that Dick and Barack Obama are eighth cousins. Is that
[2:47:11.800 --> 2:47:13.240]  an amazing thing?
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:18.760]  Even Obama's administration wants to increase spending overseas and increase military spending.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:24.240]  As long as you want to run the world empire at $1 trillion a year, believe me, you cannot
[2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:31.000]  solve this problem. We are determined to take a serious recession and turn it into a depression.
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  We don't change our ways.
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.200]  Ah, now we'll look at Obama's equal staff, Rahm Emanuel, investment banker, serving
[2:47:44.200 --> 2:47:50.000]  Israel's defense forces, senior advisor Bill Clinton. Rule number one, never allow crisis
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  to go to waste. They are big opportunities and big things. It's a quote.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  And now his youth squads. The idea of universal citizen service, you have to participate.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:10.200]  Citizenship is not an entitlement program. It comes with responsibilities. Everybody
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:14.880]  somewhere between the ages of 18 and 25 will serve three months of basic training and understanding
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:16.600]  in a kind of civil defense.
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:18.000]  So is this compulsory then?
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:24.920]  Well, you have to, in a sense, it's a requirement of everybody, 18 to 25, three months. Because
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:28.480]  I think anytime somebody serves their country in some capacity, we're going to be stronger
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:29.480]  for it.
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:34.000]  Georgia Republican Congressman Paul Brown says he fears President-elect Obama could establish
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:39.120]  a Marxist dictatorship. Brown said in an interview Monday quote, it may sound a bit crazy and
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:44.200]  off base, but he's the one who's proposed this national security force. Brown is referring
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:48.160]  to a July speech by Mr. Obama, which he called for a civilian force to relieve the military
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:52.320]  and some of its national security burden. That's exactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.800]  and that's exactly what the Soviet Union did. He's showing me signs of being Marxist. You
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:01.240]  have to remember that Adolf Hitler was elected in a democratic Germany and quote, was called
[2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:02.240]  Brown.
[2:49:02.240 --> 2:49:07.800]  Zabigno Brzezinski, foreign policy advisor, founder of our lateral commission. Foreign
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:11.760]  policy advisor, Jimmy Carter, member of the Bergeri Post-Associate Henry Kissinger, intel
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:14.960]  advisor, Demetrios Corporations.
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:18.680]  As America becomes an increasingly multicultural society, we'll find it more difficult to
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:23.200]  fashion consensus on foreign policy issues, except in the circumstances of a truly massive
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:26.520]  and widespread, perceived external threat.
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:32.360]  We wage a variety of conflicts against the Soviet Union, but we always strove to maximize
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:37.480]  the number of supporters in order to isolate the opponent. I am very much pleased about
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  that.
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:43.200]  I think Obama is clearly more effective and has the upper hand.
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:49.000]  If we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and President Musharraf
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.960]  will not act, we will.
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:53.440]  The verbal reaction was swift.
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:50:00.040]  Pakistan, being a sovereign country, will never allow any other country to send troops
[2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:02.360]  to its territory for any purpose.
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:09.520]  To Dr. Brzezinski, he has proven to be an outstanding friend and somebody who I've learned
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:10.520]  an immense amount from.
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:17.840]  Now, that by January 2013, the end of your first term, more than five years from now,
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:20.000]  there will be no U.S. troops in Iran.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:24.240]  I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation is going to be three or
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:25.240]  four years after.
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:31.240]  And I have to say, Obama is the most inspiring man, he's chosen all the judges, our civic
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:36.840]  cheerleaders, to participate and make this one big global community.
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:42.840]  This man was born for this, and he was born to lead us, and I just feel so inspired.
[2:50:42.840 --> 2:50:56.840]  I feel like I am living a dream, I feel like I am, I'm a bit emotional, I feel like I'm
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:50:57.840]  experiencing...
[2:50:57.840 --> 2:51:01.960]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to finish this up and take alls.
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:06.920]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[2:51:06.920 --> 2:51:10.880]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make
[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:12.720]  it to your dinner table?

[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:06.640]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:07.640]  this country.
[2:52:07.640 --> 2:52:11.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:12.440]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:13.440]  This is his M.O.
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:17.040]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:17.040 --> 2:52:21.680]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:21.680 --> 2:52:24.280]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:28.760]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:28.760 --> 2:52:30.920]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:30.920 --> 2:52:34.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:34.480 --> 2:52:40.080]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:44.240]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,

[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:06.640]  down in the pits of hell, and all these poor suckers aren't going to be able to admit
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:11.240]  they've been suckered and when they stage the terror attacks, they're going to have
[2:55:11.240 --> 2:55:15.360]  the brigades out, folks, and they're going to tell the people, if you'll just give up
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:20.400]  your liberties, we can protect you, and they're going to say, it's your fault, they're already
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:25.480]  singing, Alex, you're blocking what Obama's doing, that's letting all the bad things happen.
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:29.560]  He's getting everything he wants, fools, just like you Bush supporters, this is what
[2:55:29.560 --> 2:55:34.080]  you want, this is what you get, this is what you want, this is what you get.
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:40.320]  Alright, let's go to some phone calls here, appreciate folks holding, just so I can get
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:46.040]  to everybody, let's just move quickly here, let's talk to Steve in Texas, Steve you're
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:59.240]  on the air, here's some dogs back there, definitely with Al-Qaeda, okay Steve, let's move on
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:04.520]  to Glen in Arizona, Glen in Arizona you're on the air, hey Alex how you doing, good
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:13.520]  sir, I got a couple things on my mind, you're thinking sir, you need to be in a dream, watching
[2:56:13.520 --> 2:56:16.800]  television and being happy and taking prozac, are you with Al-Qaeda sir?
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:25.000]  Yes, I have taken the blue one though, good, good, happy to be the first day, good, thank
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:32.720]  you, yeah, I guess your Wikipedia page is correct, I wanted to say thank you for everything
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:39.240]  that you do, I appreciate your music selection too, it tends to express the sentiment quite
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:45.560]  well and I would like to add for what it's worth by Buffalo Springfield, oh yeah there's
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:50.760]  a bunch of music we need to, I'm just so busy having a bowl of mess with it, thank you,
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:57.200]  basically I'm here in Arizona and I've been seeing a progression in the amount of chem
[2:56:57.200 --> 2:57:03.040]  trails and drives and every time I find myself walking outside I look up at the high with
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:08.760]  my four year old and I get extremely mad, those are nutrient trails sir, those are
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:15.080]  vitamins, those are vitamins sir, well that's good, I was worried because my son has breathing
[2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:24.760]  problems and it just, I don't know, well you know, with that said, I just find it hard
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:32.200]  to find very many things to be happy about and joyful about and increasing information
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:39.360]  that's coming out with you sharing with your guests and et cetera, just, I don't know,
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:43.480]  we're trying to take back the globalist command base with the states, these are murdering
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:47.600]  criminals that run it so it's going to be a hard five but we don't have any other choice,
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:51.600]  know this life is not boring, this is the animating contest for freedom and liberty
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:57:55.600]  and it's always a struggle between good and evil sir and the people stood down so evil
[2:57:55.600 --> 2:58:01.680]  took over and so it's up to you, I mean since 47 they've been in total secrecy with unlimited
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:05.760]  funding in the national security state, of course they ship drugs in, of course they
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:09.560]  money laundered, of course they're engaging in eugenics, they think they're God, they
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:15.120]  think we're fools and we're taking action against them.
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:19.400]  Thank you, I appreciate that, so anything in particular for chemtrails, what could I
[2:58:19.400 --> 2:58:25.040]  do to potentially slow this down because it's disgusting, well there's a bunch of programs
[2:58:25.040 --> 2:58:30.000]  under the aerosol, the piles dude spraying program and it's weather modification and
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:35.600]  a lot of other things so we will do more shows on that in the future sir, the government's
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:43.440]  only doing it to help you, remember that they love you, they care about you.
[2:58:43.440 --> 2:58:51.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:55.480]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[2:58:55.480 --> 2:58:59.760]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever, we need to be independent and food
[2:58:59.760 --> 2:59:03.600]  and water is the key, you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own
[2:59:03.600 --> 2:59:07.880]  bread, you'll never have to go to the super-dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:59:07.880 --> 2:59:11.920]  in any emergency if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[2:59:11.920 --> 2:59:16.560]  the final equation but you, you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's
[2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:21.280]  safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost
[2:59:21.280 --> 2:59:28.840]  half the cost of last year's grocery prices, call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com

[2:59:47.040 --> 2:59:54.480]  today the first step is getting storable food.
[2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:59.760]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[3:00:24.480 --> 3:00:29.600]  They talk to us like we're children.
[3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:33.480]  They treat us like children, we're a nation, a world of children, it's time to grow up
[3:00:33.480 --> 3:00:39.760]  and have childhoods in and it meant just how serious the world is or we can keep singing
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:45.960]  our nursery rhymes, watching your sitcoms, being babies, perhaps the government, perhaps
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:51.200]  Obama, perhaps the globalist, perhaps they're your friend, they can take your little shoe
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:57.200]  off, take your little sock off and go, this little piggy went to market, this little piggy
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:04.120]  stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, this little piggy
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:10.040]  went wee wee wee wee wee wee all the way home, perhaps I should do a show like that, people
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:15.880]  say that they want me to be positive, okay, the stock market was way up to day and everything's
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:20.440]  going wonderful, society isn't breaking down, there's not illegitimacy everywhere.
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:25.160]  Cancer isn't exploding, diabetes isn't exploding, they're not about to launch world war three
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.240]  with Iran, the Federal Reserve is federal and taking good care of us and good people
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:36.400]  are in command, everything's wonderful, la la la la, or I could actually be really positive
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:39.120]  and tell you the truth about what's happening, hoping that you'll take action and we can
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:42.160]  stop it together.
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:48.720]  But it's up to you, let's go ahead and talk to this little piggy, Jay in Washington, hello
[3:01:48.720 --> 3:01:59.920]  Jay you're on the air, Jay dropped off, Mark N. Tejas, Mark, hey Alex, hello sir, man I'll
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:05.400]  make it really short, I live in Tyler, Texas and I'd like to thank my friend Jeff for waking
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:10.960]  me up to your show and kind of bringing me to that, back in the last August, been listening
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:15.120]  to you ever since, I got something to say real quick, I was in Dallas last weekend, blew
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:21.560]  my mind when I heard it, it was actually kind of funny, scrolling through the radio stations
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:27.760]  and got on one of these rap channels in the Dallas Fort Worth area and in between songs
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:32.800]  the announcer lady started announcing this event that they're going to have at some local,
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:37.360]  no at the reunion arena, they're going to offer you to come and drop off all your old
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:42.800]  guns for $50 grocery certificates.
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:47.680]  And then they enroll you with the numbers, look if it was in a crime, I know they're
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:50.520]  doing that all over the country but in Texas, how shameful.
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:57.040]  Yeah, yeah, it threw me off, I kind of laughed at first because you know I mean it's actually
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:02:58.600]  happening, it's really going on.
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:02.360]  Well you know why they did that in England and Australia before they banned guns, is
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:07.080]  to create the news image of people handing in guns to police and they say they're doing
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:11.040]  the right thing, turning in guns, citizens owning firearms is improper.
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:18.040]  Yeah, you should have heard the lady shoot you know, she was trying to get out to that
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.440]  I guess radio listeners and she was saying you know yeah think about what it's going
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:26.200]  to do, the crime rate's going to go down, you know if you don't have a gun in your house
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:29.040]  you know your kid can't pick up a gun and shoot his foot off.
[3:03:29.040 --> 3:03:34.040]  Yeah, that's the message is that guns are bad and you say this was a hip hop station?
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:37.040]  Yeah, it was 97.9 the beat in Dallas Fort Worth.
[3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:42.800]  Maybe they should have said turn in your guns, the government before just made the first
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:47.120]  gun laws for black people so the Ku Klux Klan can hang them and shoot them.
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:51.760]  Well they want to hang and shoot everybody now so be good slaves and let's all bring
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:55.880]  our guns down and turn them in so the New World Order can have their way with us because
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:04:01.080]  we love gun control which was started against Native Americans and black people after the
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:05.520]  Civil War, maybe that should have been the message on that show, huh?
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:10.440]  Yeah, but now people aren't ready for the truth and you know they can't handle most
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:11.440]  of it.
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:16.000]  Yeah, well you know I mean it's happening everywhere, they've got country radio stations
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:21.360]  doing it, it's all happening, the message is guns are evil, turn your guns in, not,
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:25.480]  oh you know this is a terrible idea in Chicago where they've taken all the guns in D.C. and
[3:04:25.480 --> 3:04:29.040]  New York, they have the highest crime rates and nobody's safe, maybe she should have
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:34.080]  been saying that, gee we can be like New York and Chicago and D.C. and be hiding behind
[3:04:34.080 --> 3:04:37.840]  our doors at night being raped and killed at numbers four or five times depending on
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:40.600]  the city, the national average.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:48.320]  You know, I mean this is pathetic, this is pathetic, absolutely disgusting and pathetic
[3:04:48.320 --> 3:04:52.880]  and that station should be ashamed of itself, anybody else pushing this type of garbage
[3:04:52.880 --> 3:04:53.880]  should be as well.
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:58.680]  We're going to come back with F. William Engdahl joining us from Deutschland, Deutschland
[3:04:58.680 --> 3:05:02.920]  over in Germany, stay with us.
[3:05:02.920 --> 3:05:05.760]  Hi this is Steve Schenck, eFoods does it again.

[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:07.200]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:06:07.200 --> 3:06:08.200]  against this country.
[3:06:08.200 --> 3:06:12.680]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.680 --> 3:06:13.680]  Bin Laden.

[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:18.080]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.

[3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:25.320]  networks inside the United States.
[3:06:25.320 --> 3:06:29.800]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:06:29.800 --> 3:06:31.960]  in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:35.720]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.720 --> 3:06:41.080]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:44.880]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:47.320]  much, much more, fabled enemies.

[3:09:00.580 --> 3:09:10.180]  All right, F. William Engdahl, we've got time zone scramble in the days over in Germany,
[3:09:10.180 --> 3:09:12.100]  so if you need to leave early, that's fine.
[3:09:12.100 --> 3:09:15.580]  We'll get to your calls as soon as there's coming up, but we're going to go to him right
[3:09:15.580 --> 3:09:16.580]  now.
[3:09:16.580 --> 3:09:21.380]  He's a writer for Asia Times, he's written for Foresight Magazine, Brands Investor,
[3:09:21.380 --> 3:09:26.980]  European Banker and Business, Banker International, he's an expert on, I guess, monetary history,
[3:09:26.980 --> 3:09:27.980]  the economy.
[3:09:27.980 --> 3:09:33.340]  He's a multi-time published author and researcher, and a very interesting fellow, so we always
[3:09:33.340 --> 3:09:38.180]  enjoy having him on for his great insight, separately in his own research, separate from
[3:09:38.180 --> 3:09:39.180]  ours.
[3:09:39.180 --> 3:09:43.540]  He's based on the same realization, it's a global eugenics system, but I want to get
[3:09:43.540 --> 3:09:50.380]  him on about the economy, the banks taking over, and this announcement for a new bank
[3:09:50.380 --> 3:09:54.820]  of the world that will rule every country on the planet, so world government of and
[3:09:54.820 --> 3:09:59.860]  by the bankers, but there's this mass double thing going on where they're openly announcing
[3:09:59.860 --> 3:10:03.740]  everywhere world government ruled by bankers and calling a new world order, but then simultaneously
[3:10:03.740 --> 3:10:06.580]  saying it doesn't exist, you're insane if you talk about it.
[3:10:06.580 --> 3:10:12.300]  So just mass insanity out there by the yuppies who are accepting that, yes, world government's
[3:10:12.300 --> 3:10:15.100]  good, now need it, and it doesn't exist when somebody criticizes it.
[3:10:15.100 --> 3:10:18.060]  That way they can't even have an intellectual discussion, they go, yes, I know they're announcing
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:22.580]  world government, but you're insane, it doesn't exist, but I am for the world government.
[3:10:22.580 --> 3:10:25.500]  I mean, that's the general public.
[3:10:25.500 --> 3:10:27.860]  So F. William Engdahl, thank you for coming on with us today.
[3:10:27.860 --> 3:10:29.500]  Good to be here, Alex.
[3:10:29.500 --> 3:10:34.780]  A lot is going on, I saw you write an article about Eastern Europe collapsing being one
[3:10:34.780 --> 3:10:40.660]  of the big triggers for world oppression, I mean, break it down, what are we facing
[3:10:40.660 --> 3:10:41.660]  here?
[3:10:41.660 --> 3:10:47.020]  Well, this is unlike anything we've faced in history.
[3:10:47.020 --> 3:10:52.380]  The United States started out as the epicenter of the storm, I called it two years ago in
[3:10:52.380 --> 3:10:57.780]  a series I wrote the financial tsunami, but it's gone beyond even that at this point.
[3:10:57.780 --> 3:11:04.100]  And what you have in Eastern Europe, you had after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in
[3:11:04.100 --> 3:11:09.700]  the early 90s, you had the creation of a number of independent states or republics, they
[3:11:09.700 --> 3:11:13.980]  called it, in the Baltics, Poland, Hungary and so forth.
[3:11:13.980 --> 3:11:17.260]  Many of them joined the European Union over the last few years.
[3:11:17.260 --> 3:11:23.540]  So Western European banks saw a golden opportunity to simply grab up the financial structures
[3:11:23.540 --> 3:11:27.980]  of those Eastern countries, which were very underdeveloped, as you can imagine, 45 years
[3:11:27.980 --> 3:11:29.820]  of communism.
[3:11:29.820 --> 3:11:36.900]  And they began making loans for homes, it's kind of a European version of the subprime
[3:11:36.900 --> 3:11:38.900]  debacle.
[3:11:38.900 --> 3:11:43.660]  And they made the loans, the banks made the loans in foreign currencies.
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:47.900]  For example, Swiss franc, where the interest rate was dramatically lower than it was in
[3:11:47.900 --> 3:11:50.060]  Poland or Hungary.
[3:11:50.060 --> 3:11:57.140]  And as long as the currency stayed stable between Poland, the Slotty and the Swiss franc, you
[3:11:57.140 --> 3:12:00.820]  had no problem in the lower interest rate, you just serviced your monthly payments to
[3:12:00.820 --> 3:12:07.900]  your local bank, which was really an Italian bank operating through your Polish subsidiary.
[3:12:07.900 --> 3:12:14.620]  And everything was hunky dory until this crisis hit about a year ago.
[3:12:14.620 --> 3:12:20.060]  And back fourth quarter of 2008, banks in Western Europe, banks all around the world
[3:12:20.060 --> 3:12:28.500]  began digging into the trenches and repatriating funds to shore up the holes back home in the
[3:12:28.500 --> 3:12:29.780]  balance sheet.
[3:12:29.780 --> 3:12:36.140]  And what that meant was the currencies in Poland and Hungary in these Eastern countries,
[3:12:36.140 --> 3:12:40.460]  they began to fall like a stone, 35%, 40%, in some cases 50%.
[3:12:40.460 --> 3:12:48.780]  And what did that mean for Joe Polish homeowner, who had the Swiss currency mortgage, suddenly
[3:12:48.780 --> 3:12:54.300]  his mortgage monthly payment in real terms had doubled for him.
[3:12:54.300 --> 3:12:56.260]  So this is a ticking time bomb.
[3:12:56.260 --> 3:13:01.460]  Now the IMF stepped in very gingerly early in the game a few months back when they gave
[3:13:01.460 --> 3:13:06.660]  us 14 billion bailout to Ukraine, which is throwing so much money down the drain in my
[3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:07.660]  view.
[3:13:07.660 --> 3:13:14.460]  But they also stepped into the Eastern European economies, Poland and Hungary, to try to stabilize
[3:13:14.460 --> 3:13:15.460]  the currency.
[3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:18.660]  They gave the central banks the currency stabilization fund.
[3:13:18.660 --> 3:13:25.380]  So all that's doing is allowing the foreign investors in those countries to get their
[3:13:25.380 --> 3:13:29.460]  funds out at top dollar and let the thing collapse, in which case they can come back
[3:13:29.460 --> 3:13:32.780]  in and buy it back up at half the price if they want.
[3:13:32.780 --> 3:13:35.860]  Yeah, that's key to this, this international banking bubble when they change the rules
[3:13:35.860 --> 3:13:40.740]  in the 90s, as you know, sir, but for the audience that may not, they loan out fiat currency
[3:13:40.740 --> 3:13:45.340]  backed up by the American people and the people of the world, depending on the nation.
[3:13:45.340 --> 3:13:49.540]  Then the bankers implode it all by destroying confidence, then they use the bailout money
[3:13:49.540 --> 3:13:53.980]  to protect themselves and then they have the capital to go in and buy everything at the
[3:13:53.980 --> 3:13:56.140]  fire sale when everything implodes.
[3:13:56.140 --> 3:14:00.980]  Well, look at, look at the case of Argentina back in back in the 90s when they had that
[3:14:00.980 --> 3:14:03.100]  horrendous debt crisis.
[3:14:03.100 --> 3:14:10.260]  And who did exactly that, the billionaire speculator from Quantum Fund, George Soros,
[3:14:10.260 --> 3:14:17.100]  he came back in and bought land in Argentina, dirt cheap, no pun intended, literally dirt
[3:14:17.100 --> 3:14:22.220]  cheap to the point where as of two or three years ago, he was the largest landowner in
[3:14:22.220 --> 3:14:23.380]  all of Argentina.
[3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:28.900]  And then he goes on TV and badmouths what happened there or is happening here like they're the
[3:14:28.900 --> 3:14:29.900]  saviors.
[3:14:29.900 --> 3:14:33.380]  He goes before Congress and he explains how everything's working.
[3:14:33.380 --> 3:14:34.700]  I mean, this is sick.
[3:14:34.700 --> 3:14:37.340]  And now Brzezinski is saying, oh, there's going to be a revolution.
[3:14:37.340 --> 3:14:38.340]  Oh, it's terrible.
[3:14:38.340 --> 3:14:39.340]  The bankers are bad.
[3:14:39.340 --> 3:14:41.220]  I mean, when he, I mean, this is sick.
[3:14:41.220 --> 3:14:47.380]  Well, Brzezinski was the executive director of the Trilateral Commission of David Rockefeller.
[3:14:47.380 --> 3:14:55.260]  So I'm sure he's not, not exactly crying crocodile tears over the walls of the bankers.
[3:14:55.260 --> 3:14:56.260]  Please continue.
[3:14:56.260 --> 3:14:58.060]  So how do you see this global implosion?
[3:14:58.060 --> 3:15:01.820]  I mean, Japan imploding, China imploding, Eastern Europe imploding.
[3:15:01.820 --> 3:15:05.340]  You think from what I've seen you're writing that Eastern Europe will be the trigger dragging
[3:15:05.340 --> 3:15:06.340]  down the EU?
[3:15:06.340 --> 3:15:07.340]  I mean, what's going to happen?
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:09.900]  It's going to, it's going to get very dicey.
[3:15:09.900 --> 3:15:15.420]  It's, it's kind of a ticking time bomb and either the EU governments, which includes
[3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:20.940]  Germany, France, Italy and the major and Britain as well, are going to have to step in and
[3:15:20.940 --> 3:15:27.260]  do some emergency measures to stabilize these currencies through the European Central Bank.
[3:15:27.260 --> 3:15:29.420]  The problem is they're overstretched internally.
[3:15:29.420 --> 3:15:36.340]  So it's, it's going to be a real stress test of the whole Eurozone construct of the European
[3:15:36.340 --> 3:15:40.700]  Central Bank, the creation of the Euro back in 1999.
[3:15:40.700 --> 3:15:45.500]  No one at this point, they're $1.7 trillion of, of debts involved in Eastern Europe.
[3:15:45.500 --> 3:15:48.660]  Now, of course, not all of that is going to go sour.
[3:15:48.660 --> 3:15:54.900]  But even if 10% of that goes sour, it's $170 billion, that's a billion euros.
[3:15:54.900 --> 3:16:00.180]  That's, that's a huge chunk of capital on top of the bad debts that are already accumulating
[3:16:00.180 --> 3:16:01.180]  in the Western banks.
[3:16:01.180 --> 3:16:07.540]  But we have all these ticking time bombs and now the credit card debt coming to the, the
[3:16:07.540 --> 3:16:10.580]  financial bubble where the people aren't being able to pay for their tuition.
[3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:15.540]  So the college bubble, you have the commercial real estate bubble.
[3:16:15.540 --> 3:16:18.580]  You have the military defense spending bubble.
[3:16:18.580 --> 3:16:22.020]  You have the state spending bubble now with inflation.
[3:16:22.020 --> 3:16:27.460]  I mean, there's, I see no way this isn't going to just accelerate into a supernova
[3:16:27.460 --> 3:16:29.380]  explosion of destruction financially.
[3:16:29.380 --> 3:16:36.300]  Absolutely, let me, let me say one, one very simple thing for, for listeners to, to sort
[3:16:36.300 --> 3:16:42.180]  this out, because I just actually literally today finished the last chapter on my next
[3:16:42.180 --> 3:16:46.580]  book, The Power of Money, Rise and Decline of the American Century.
[3:16:46.580 --> 3:16:51.060]  And in there, if you trace back the history of the money, money interest going back to
[3:16:51.060 --> 3:16:55.340]  the time of the Civil War, even before the First National Bank, the Second National Bank
[3:16:55.340 --> 3:16:57.020]  of the United States.
[3:16:57.020 --> 3:16:59.980]  The, the issue is always the same.
[3:16:59.980 --> 3:17:05.620]  And you saw it again in the remarks of Bernanke in front of the Congress yesterday.
[3:17:05.620 --> 3:17:09.420]  We will not go down the road of nationalizing the banks.
[3:17:09.420 --> 3:17:16.980]  Well, Obama as president to date is rapidly losing his mandate from heaven that he got
[3:17:16.980 --> 3:17:24.780]  from the voters back in November, because he is either terrified or as part of the game,
[3:17:24.780 --> 3:17:26.500]  not touching the power of the banks.
[3:17:26.500 --> 3:17:31.900]  What it boils down to is either you nationalize these banks, put them through the, the washing
[3:17:31.900 --> 3:17:37.980]  machine of a chapter 11, write down all the toxic debt to zero value, zero value on the
[3:17:37.980 --> 3:17:43.020]  books of the United States government, which is a taxpayer, a United States taxpayers government
[3:17:43.020 --> 3:17:44.820]  or should be.
[3:17:44.820 --> 3:17:50.220]  And then you clean out the management that made this mess in the first place wholesale.
[3:17:50.220 --> 3:17:54.820]  These guys start going to prison as they, as they should be, or they, they go into some
[3:17:54.820 --> 3:17:59.820]  kind of redemptive social work to turn them back into normal human beings if that's possible.
[3:17:59.820 --> 3:18:04.540]  Instead, they're going to use the money to leverage a total global takeover for themselves
[3:18:04.540 --> 3:18:07.980]  and the criminals are smiling and posing as the saviors.
[3:18:07.980 --> 3:18:11.420]  And I don't think the public has any idea what's about to happen to them.
[3:18:11.420 --> 3:18:12.420]  Yeah.
[3:18:12.420 --> 3:18:16.620]  It's just the, the issue is so simple, but they make it deliberately confusing.
[3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:18.380]  So you don't know what's at stake here.
[3:18:18.380 --> 3:18:23.700]  You think Bernanke is defending the essence of American patriotism by saying we won't
[3:18:23.700 --> 3:18:24.700]  nationalize.
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:30.300]  But I'll say this, Barack Obama is, uh, bathing every bit as criminally as, uh, uh, Paulson
[3:18:30.300 --> 3:18:35.380]  did and, and, uh, Geithner did when they let, uh, uh, you know, let this mess develop
[3:18:35.380 --> 3:18:38.260]  in the first place last year with the TARP program.
[3:18:38.260 --> 3:18:39.260]  Yeah.
[3:18:39.260 --> 3:18:42.060]  I've been watching, uh, Mrs. Obama's body language.
[3:18:42.060 --> 3:18:43.900]  She looked real happy the last few months.
[3:18:43.900 --> 3:18:45.660]  That lady doesn't look too happy now.
[3:18:45.660 --> 3:18:46.660]  She's finding out.
[3:18:46.660 --> 3:18:53.300]  Well, the United States is going to go through 10 years of hell, as I said in a recent interview.
[3:18:53.300 --> 3:18:58.100]  And uh, it's just, it's going to, from this point on, it's going to get worse 2010.
[3:18:58.100 --> 3:19:02.780]  You have the baby boomer generation cashing in what little pensions they have in stock
[3:19:02.780 --> 3:19:05.720]  funds, mutual funds, 401ks and so forth.
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:10.660]  So that's going to pull more money out of the stock market in, in significant, uh, uh,
[3:19:10.660 --> 3:19:15.900]  volumes and also the bond markets, you're going to have, uh, the real estate market
[3:19:15.900 --> 3:19:21.740]  is tanking, uh, uh, off the charts, uh, home prices are falling and home sales and so
[3:19:21.740 --> 3:19:22.940]  forth.
[3:19:22.940 --> 3:19:26.220]  And it's, it's got a long ways to go before it hits any bottom because who's going to
[3:19:26.220 --> 3:19:28.100]  be able to buy on these conditions?
[3:19:28.100 --> 3:19:33.660]  The banks aren't lending, they're sitting on their money and, uh, it's just, uh, there's
[3:19:33.660 --> 3:19:37.460]  no new thing that's going to come in and jumpstart the U.S. economy.
[3:19:37.460 --> 3:19:41.620]  There's no Asia that's going to come in and invest in dollars.
[3:19:41.620 --> 3:19:43.900]  China is very, very reluctant to throw.
[3:19:43.900 --> 3:19:44.900]  Stay there.
[3:19:44.900 --> 3:19:45.900]  Stay there.
[3:19:45.900 --> 3:19:48.260]  I want to come back and I was interrupting you when you were getting into every bit as
[3:19:48.260 --> 3:19:52.900]  criminal as what we saw under Bush and talk about your new book that's coming out as well.
[3:19:52.900 --> 3:19:57.100]  And have you seen any way out of this other than just identifying these criminals and
[3:19:57.100 --> 3:20:02.780]  hoping somebody arrests them?
[3:20:02.780 --> 3:20:06.500]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[3:20:06.500 --> 3:20:08.820]  problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[3:20:08.820 --> 3:20:12.740]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[3:20:17.220 --> 3:20:19.220]  foods for almost 40 years.

[3:20:39.980 --> 3:20:42.060]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[3:22:19.220 --> 3:22:26.020]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism

[3:24:33.660 --> 3:24:38.900]  Obama had a 10-minute standing ovation before he even began speaking.
[3:24:38.900 --> 3:24:42.500]  I mean it was just amazing to see this.
[3:24:42.500 --> 3:24:43.500]  They're happy.

[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:56.160]  take on that and then how do we avert this
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:24:59.040]  let obama the president has around him right now
[3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:02.400]  to the people who are responsible for the mess of the financial system over
[3:25:02.400 --> 3:25:03.560]  the last
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:07.120]  period since nineteen seventy nine paul voker is this distinguished elder
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:09.920]  statesmen of monitorism that was brought down
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:11.840]  by david rockefeller to
[3:25:11.840 --> 3:25:15.760]  squeeze inflation out of the system in october nineteen seventy nine he put the
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:17.400]  u.s. through the worst
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:20.180]  postwar recession over the next three years to
[3:25:20.180 --> 3:25:23.920]  uh... help his friends in the new wall street bond market and uh... prop up the
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:24.840]  dollar
[3:25:24.840 --> 3:25:27.440]  for his uh... good friend david rockefeller
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:28.680]  uh...
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:32.320]  you have timothy geithner the president of the new york fed as u.s. treasury
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:34.720]  secretary replacing goldman sax
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:35.960]  and repulsion
[3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:37.720]  as treasury secretary
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:42.480]  geithner was in on all of this to the decisions that were made by uh... by the
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:45.880]  paulson bush administration on this mess in the first place
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:49.520]  where they simply thrown away seven hundred billion dollars
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:54.000]  of the taxpayer money no accountability on the t a r p program until now unless
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  there's something new that i haven't seen from the jail and so forth they've
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:00.200]  issued reports that have been ignored by the
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:02.480]  responsible media quote unquote
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:06.640]  uh... there is no accountability going on and there's no
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:09.920]  indication of any change look at larry summers the
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:12.400]  president's chief economic advisor
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:15.640]  what is he got to bring to the table but uh... a career
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:19.440]  running the peso crisis in mexico running the asia crisis for the clinton
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:20.800]  administration
[3:26:20.800 --> 3:26:24.640]  which uh... was directed at ruining the tiger economies of asian redirecting
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:25.360]  their
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:28.840]  capital flows or dollar flows into the u.s. treasury bond market so clinton
[3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:30.000]  could claim
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:33.580]  uh... a treasury surplus in his last year in office
[3:26:33.580 --> 3:26:38.760]  uh... these are the kinds of of manipulators and and monitors madman
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:40.280]  that we have uh...
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:42.720]  that created the problem the first place so
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:44.920]  uh... there's there's nothing
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:45.900]  well
[3:26:45.900 --> 3:26:48.760]  the speech of obama he may have gotten a ten minute standing ovation but the
[3:26:48.760 --> 3:26:49.640]  president
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:52.520]  said nothing in any content that i've read
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:55.520]  uh... that's offering anything more concrete than
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:26:58.200]  uh... we are for change and a certain
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:00.520]  point in time when you're unemployed near
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:05.240]  kids are going hungry that uh... uh... that mantra gets a little bit tiresome
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:09.680]  so uh... we really have to grab this thing in a much more uh... aggressive way
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:12.040]  in
[3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:14.400]  imagine that i were uh...
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:17.800]  the president situation of the first hundred days
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:21.440]  i would announce immediately a bank holiday
[3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:26.000]  i would bring in independent auditors to go through all of the major banks the
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:26.880]  uh...
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:29.480]  not just the nineteen money center banks
[3:27:29.480 --> 3:27:32.600]  that have been identified but all of the major banks
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:35.840]  uh... especially doing business cross-border
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:39.200]  and you think you'd find that they're all a bunch of bernard made off something
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:39.840]  more and more
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:42.720]  oh yeah oh yeah bernie made off was was just the
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:45.280]  the poster child of the system
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:48.720]  uh... what he's done is is just uh...
[3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:52.240]  you know part for the course and that's why there's a secret of all made off
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:54.920]  story has uh... an intelligence uh...
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:27:58.800]  uh... background to it that hasn't has yet to come out that's going to be a very
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:27:59.960]  dirty story and
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:03.040]  somebody blew the whistle on that but uh... we'll know more about that as time
[3:28:03.040 --> 3:28:06.920]  goes on yeah a illegal funding arm for uh... israel
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:10.720]  well uh... money conduit money laundering and so forth that uh...
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:14.040]  and someone and that's that's the reason that he was considered untouchable by
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:16.120]  the securities exchange commission
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:18.880]  he had a certain red flag on his name
[3:28:18.880 --> 3:28:22.600]  so they didn't touch him but uh... all of the details have yet to come out some
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:26.120]  something involved he had foundations in israel that uh... suddenly were left in
[3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:27.160]  the lurch
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:31.200]  uh... all sorts of things and by the way we'd already heard this uh... month and
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:32.320]  a half ago
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:35.200]  but then it came out uh... i know you know this mistering up with some
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:36.560]  solicitors who may not
[3:28:36.560 --> 3:28:40.040]  in uh... security exchange commission testimony before congress
[3:28:40.040 --> 3:28:43.440]  they said we're not going to talk about made off its national security
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:45.920]  they declared presidential prerogative
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:51.200]  and executive privilege not to cover it confirming there's a national security
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:56.840]  you know uh... letter in there that in the so that's really hardcore
[3:28:56.840 --> 3:28:58.400]  well there you have it
[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:02.480]  uh... but but anyway then the made off kind of thing the ponzi scheme is is
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:04.520]  part of the course and on the
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:07.360]  uh... wall street financial system for the last
[3:29:07.360 --> 3:29:09.000]  thirty five years or so
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:12.480]  but the uh... you know that the ponzi game just the pyramid got bigger and
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:15.920]  bigger and bigger and every time it would bust down in green span would
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:20.200]  jump in with the fire holes in pump pump the thing up again with some low
[3:29:20.200 --> 3:29:23.520]  interest rate scheme or another
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:25.840]  scale of this thing is is just
[3:29:25.840 --> 3:29:27.280]  beyond uh...

[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:31.480]  minutes of the show or so the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:39.640]  okay go back into how we bring these people to justice you've gotten to the
[3:33:39.640 --> 3:33:42.640]  point of we need to have an accounting of the Federal Reserve accounting of
[3:33:42.640 --> 3:33:46.720]  these private banks but they're all exempt from the laws or they have their
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:50.120]  own officers in government it's a revolving door between administrations
[3:33:50.120 --> 3:33:55.880]  republicans go in the democrats go back into the private system the
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:33:59.760]  democrats go in and the republicans go back in the private system it just goes
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:03.520]  around and around and around and around and around and around and around and
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:07.480]  now they're conquering the world through this slide of hand fraud continue
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:12.600]  revolving door it's as simple as that people have to say enough is enough
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:18.040]  we're fed up to here if congress doesn't clean out the algae and stables of
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:21.880]  corruption here then we'll elect congressman who will and there are people
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:28.760]  out there who are in that kind of a mood increasingly and for example what has
[3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:34.400]  to happen is that the president of the congress need to nationalize the banks
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:39.240]  the bankrupt banks the brain dead banks like city bank Bank of America etc but
[3:34:39.240 --> 3:34:44.200]  not only that they need to nationalize the Federal Reserve bring that thing
[3:34:44.200 --> 3:34:47.480]  under the power of Congress Congress should never have given it away it was
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:52.680]  a it was a coup d'etat by the money trust back in 1913 when the halls of
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:34:57.160]  Congress were virtually empty before the Christmas recess and in collusion with
[3:34:57.160 --> 3:35:02.320]  Woodrow Wilson JP Morgan and the the bankers cabal pulled off the Federal
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:07.200]  Reserve Act of 1913 that thing has to be nationalized back into public real
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:12.360]  public hands not the power of the private banks who control the Fed interest
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:18.240]  free money you know two presidents have probably been assassinated because they
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:23.680]  introduced interest free money through the US Treasury and not not through other
[3:35:23.680 --> 3:35:27.640]  means through the banks private banks one of them was Abraham Lincoln and the
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:31.400]  other one was probably Jack at Kent John F. Kennedy and they tried to kill
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:37.000]  others like Andrew Jackson yeah well Andrew Jackson to my mind was a heroic
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:41.400]  president a few people understand what what he did single-handedly to fight
[3:35:41.400 --> 3:35:46.680]  the renewal of the charter of the National Bank the United States which
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:50.800]  was owned the name just like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:55.480]  sounds like it's a government bank but it was a private bank owned by private
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:36:00.120]  bankers many of them in London not even in the United States and controlling the
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:05.280]  the gold supply and the money supply of the nation the economy so that's got to
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:11.360]  be brought back in public hands article 1 section 8 of the American Constitution
[3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:16.960]  the founding fathers put the power to coin and regulate money into the hands
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:22.120]  of Congress as as first article of the Constitution that was given away
[3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:28.200]  illegally and and to my mind criminally by by this coup d'etat of the bankers
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:33.400]  and certain colluding congressman well here's another question instead of true
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:37.440]  nationalization of these fraudulent operations we're paying for it they're
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:41.920]  calling it nationalization but they're now the mega banks getting power over
[3:36:41.920 --> 3:36:46.760]  the entire economy and sub banks and insurance companies and masquerading
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:51.400]  behind the cloak of government so instead of nationalization we're having
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:59.000]  piratical horizontally integrated or no vertically integrated consolidation by
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:03.360]  the offshore banks yeah yeah well that's what they're trying to do that was the
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:08.800]  Paulson idea I think they miscalculated we've different on this previously Alex
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:14.040]  but I think they miscalculated on the fallout from the laymen brothers when
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:20.520]  it became incalculable which banks or which institutions would be saved too
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:25.720]  big to fail and which not after that so then the situation really started to get
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:33.120]  the nonlinear quick but I think what they're gonna try to do is regroup create
[3:37:33.120 --> 3:37:38.160]  financial behemoths out of this mess as much as they can but I think the
[3:37:38.160 --> 3:37:45.200]  problems are are so deep that this is is even coming beyond their their means
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:51.360]  to manipulate the the finances I think the in the in the back the woods of the
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:56.080]  places like Bohemia Grove or the trial at our commissioner Bilderberg or
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:01.400]  wherever they meet these days these characters who call themselves the
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:07.520]  guiding elites of the nation are really beginning to think the only option they
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:11.280]  have is the military option but even that they've largely wasted away through
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:07.520]  the last eight years of madness under the Bush
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:30.600]  star war so big the people have to get behind him in the austerity and the implosion
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:30.640]  we've got that
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:07.680]  in, you know, the islands of the Caribbean, and in the Cook Islands, and they're literally
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:11.400]  building bunkers. I mean, what do they think they've done?
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:20.320]  Yeah. A certain place, at a certain point, there's no real place to hide. You know, this
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:25.280]  affects everybody. You can't live on another planet. So...
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:27.960]  So what do they think they've done that they're evacuating?
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:34.960]  Yeah. Yeah. No, I read you. I think they realize that there are going to be some very, very
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:41.040]  angry citizens who are going to wake up and say, wait a minute, how did the head of city
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:48.160]  bank accumulate a billion dollars as president of a bank? How many fraudulent predatory loans
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:52.440]  did he push on people who couldn't even write their own name, but were told they would
[3:39:52.440 --> 3:39:57.520]  get a dream house if they just put an X on a piece of paper, and knowing that that was
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:02.800]  going to default, but they didn't care because it would be securitized through a special
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:08.640]  investment vehicle that was off the bank's books, and you'd get a AAA rating from Moody's
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:13.880]  or Standard & Poor's and pump the thing into some pension fund or some university pension
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:19.280]  fund at Harvard or Yale or who knows where, and spread this toxic waste all around the
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:25.240]  globe. I mean, that's the kind of mentality. I think some of these heads of banks like
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:31.200]  J.P. Morgan Chase and so forth, they believed on a certain level that this was a mathematical
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:38.160]  science when black and shoals back in the 70s came up with this fraudulent options pricing
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:45.000]  model that seemed to be mathematical. They thought we've got the, not the Rosetta stone,
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:54.480]  but the magic mitre stone that turns water into gold, and all we have to do is get these
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:58.880]  rocket scientists in our banking trading floor and we'll figure out schemes and sell
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:04.000]  these derivative products, these credit default swaps and so forth, make a killing, manipulate
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:11.760]  oil prices up or down like banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have done for years,
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:20.600]  and we'll just make money out of thin air. At a certain point, you can't write a derivative
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:25.360]  on the entire global financial system. There's no counterparty to that particular contract,
[3:41:25.360 --> 3:41:26.360]  Mr.
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:31.000]  So in closing it from you studying this F. William Engdahl, what are they trying? I
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:33.880]  mean, we know trying to bring a new world bank, world government out of what they've
[3:41:33.880 --> 3:41:40.200]  created, but it's so destructive that individually they're buying redoubts, armored keeps to
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:46.920]  evacuate to, I mean, it's clear they want to secure the theft and the fraud by using
[3:41:46.920 --> 3:41:51.480]  Northcom and military in the western world, but what's going to happen when the military's
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:57.000]  family is bankrupt and homeless too? I mean, are they bringing us to the Stone Age here?
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:00.560]  Because this doesn't appear to be like other financial implosions of the past.
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:07.920]  Yeah, it doesn't, and it isn't. I've been told by some very senior financial sources
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:14.320]  in Switzerland recently that the view is to let the markets go through pure hell up until
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:25.800]  the time of the April 2 G20 economic summit, and then by that point, terrify nations like
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:30.760]  Russia and China into going along with this new world order that you're talking about.
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:33.800]  I frankly don't think that they're going to buy into that. I don't think that's going
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:41.120]  to happen, and there is no plan B for these guys. They are so used to just ramming their
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:50.400]  way through any obstacle over the past, at least the past 55, 60 years of the post-war
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:56.080]  period, and they just don't have a plan B.
[3:42:56.080 --> 3:43:00.400]  Well, yeah, that's right. Hillary went to China and said, keep buying our treasuries,
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:04.240]  and they said, look, it's worthless crap. Well, what are we going to do? And then they're
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:08.120]  like, Siamese twins, we're all tied together, but it's, I mean...
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:16.520]  Well, China has some options that are viable at this point, but countries like the United
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:22.560]  States, there's no industry left to... China's built up brand spanking new factories. I've
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:27.600]  seen this firsthand. It's quite impressive. The highway infrastructure is state of the
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:28.600]  art.
[3:43:28.600 --> 3:43:29.600]  Trains.
[3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:33.960]  Airplanes and so forth, fast trains. You don't have that in the United States. We've become
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:38.920]  a post-industrial junkie. But our men act tough, though. They strut around like this,
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:42.120]  going, they watch football. I mean, that's a product, isn't it?
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:44.240]  That counts for a lot at the end of the day.
[3:43:44.240 --> 3:43:49.600]  Yeah, and our women act in dress and behave like whores, and the family's falling apart.
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:53.240]  I mean, isn't that tough? I mean, that's tough. Man, we're tough.
[3:43:53.240 --> 3:44:03.280]  Yeah, yeah, these are the tragic victims of this madness, but I just don't see it happening
[3:44:03.280 --> 3:44:09.080]  in this grand, beautiful scenario way that the rest of the world is going to bow down
[3:44:09.080 --> 3:44:13.040]  and tell the money trust, okay, we'll be your slaves and we'll do anything you tell us if
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:19.080]  you just print some more dollar bills. I think that's why I titled my book, Power of Money,
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:23.760]  Rise and Decline of the American Century. The American Century, the dollar system of
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:28.760]  the Bretton Woods 1944 is over. It's the defaginy that we're going through now.
[3:44:28.760 --> 3:44:37.640]  But the globalist people are affected by that misery. But you know, until they force a cleaning
[3:44:37.640 --> 3:44:42.400]  of the, of the, of the Australian stables of the US Congress and get some honest, decent
[3:44:42.400 --> 3:44:49.000]  people in there who don't let themselves be bribed or corrupted by lobbyists, they're
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:52.280]  going to get the government that the response to that kind of thing.
[3:44:52.280 --> 3:44:58.080]  Well, we don't have any Hercules out there that's going to do it. And you know, in closing,
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:03.440]  when we're looking at this, look at Mexico, triple the resources, the US collapsing, South
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:07.800]  Africa, more resources than we have collapsing. I mean, that's the norm in history is corrupt
[3:45:07.800 --> 3:45:12.640]  thugs get in, they steal everything, everything collapses and they, they move on like locusts.
[3:45:12.640 --> 3:45:17.480]  When you give, give the country's power over to the money, money interest that happened
[3:45:17.480 --> 3:45:24.520]  in the Roman Empire, 400 AD, it happened in every empire in history, the British empire
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:32.680]  and it's happening with the informal American post war system, which they deliberately,
[3:45:32.680 --> 3:45:36.840]  the elites deliberately decided not to call it an empire. It's one of the most effective
[3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:41.880]  deceptions in history, but it's every bit the empire and the people who framed it from
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:47.120]  John Kennan on George Kennan on down, privately called it an empire, but they said, well,
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:52.400]  then we'll be more clever than the British will call it the spreading the torch of liberty,
[3:45:52.400 --> 3:45:58.600]  freedom, democracy, the American way of free enterprise. Well, okay, now you have the American
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:03.540]  way of free enterprise that they're talking about and that's, it's just reached the limits
[3:46:03.540 --> 3:46:04.540]  of growth.
[3:46:04.540 --> 3:46:10.160]  Well, I see the globalist reached the limits of growth. Yeah, the tick weighs 200 pounds,
[3:46:10.160 --> 3:46:14.960]  the host is anemic and weighs 25 pounds. So tiny 25 pound creature with a huge bloated
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:21.000]  tick going, you know, with like TV sets, broadcasting propaganda, the little starving concentration
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:25.320]  camp victim going, I love you. I love you. I'm the government. These men in black uniforms
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:30.080]  are here to help and the women and we're laying on the ground. Yes, I love you.
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:32.760]  That's a great cartoon idea for someone like David D's.
[3:46:32.760 --> 3:46:36.440]  All right. Well, listen, I have only mingle. I want you to give your website out. I'm gonna
[3:46:36.440 --> 3:46:40.720]  come back, take a few final calls in the last seven. We're going to let you go. But I mean,
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:47.000]  I see the Davos folks and others bragging that Oh, America's time is over. Time magazine.
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:52.760]  That's all our fault. We did it. And now we're going to implode and we deserve it. But that
[3:46:52.760 --> 3:46:56.920]  was always the plan. Use us up building the world order and kind of have its pole move
[3:46:56.920 --> 3:47:01.240]  more towards Europe and Russia and China. And they're all new world order, you know, scam
[3:47:01.240 --> 3:47:05.800]  artists too. They're just weren't the, you know, the top guys. So I see a new dark age
[3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:12.520]  in the US collapsing with third world, what was Austria and Germany, you know, on Rome,
[3:47:12.520 --> 3:47:17.880]  Mexico overrunning. It's just, I guess, total collapse and police running around the ski
[3:47:17.880 --> 3:47:18.880]  mask.
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:30.320]  Well, yeah. It's going to be, it's going to be grim. I can't paint a rosy picture about
[3:47:30.320 --> 3:47:31.320]  it.
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:34.080]  All right. Well, give out your website for folks.
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:45.960]  www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:52.440]  Or just Google F William Engdahl. Yeah. And you'll find it. E N G D A H L. Thank you so
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:47:54.520]  much for spending time with us.
[3:47:54.520 --> 3:47:56.360]  Thank you for having me, Alex. I always enjoy.
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:47:59.640]  All right. Thank you. Take care. We're going to come back and jam in and give each caller
[3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:03.680]  one minute. So I'm going to come back and go to your calls in the final segment. That's
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:07.800]  it for the transmission. Wild show today. A lot of information got out. We're not painting
[3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:13.640]  a bad picture. We're just showing you what's happening. We're the folks who told you beforehand.
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:18.360]  And the military and the police and the bureaucracy start talking about arresting people and grand
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:23.160]  juries do. We can stop them. We can fix the bleeding. But I know you're into a power trip
[3:48:23.160 --> 3:48:27.880]  and you've just got to be destroyed. And you know, so fine. Just at least know you did
[3:48:27.880 --> 3:48:32.840]  it to yourself. I mean, that's the most important thing here is that is that in the end you

[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:28.280]  Pat in Washington you are on the air in these exciting times. Welcome Pat. Good to have you
[3:54:28.280 --> 3:54:33.960]  on the show. Hello Alex. You're a hard guy to get a hold of. I wanted to call in thank
[3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:39.840]  you for your tireless research and your insight, your determination in waking us all up. It's
[3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:43.440]  a shutter to think we're... Well it's like being in a water chamber with a water rising.
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:48.040]  I mean I don't need to be commended for trying to get the hell out of here. I'm just very
[3:54:48.040 --> 3:54:53.040]  happy that there's somebody on the air that is committed as you are. Anyway I had a whole
[3:54:53.040 --> 3:54:56.720]  bunch of things I wanted to talk about. That was before the last speaker and now I'm on
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:55:04.560]  the banks that Andrew Jackson's farewell speech. People could Google that. It basically spells
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:08.680]  out exactly what's going on right now with the banks. It's totally predictable with a
[3:55:08.680 --> 3:55:15.360]  fiat currency and a private bank. And these guys have been consolidating power and wealth
[3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:21.880]  since the Holy Wars and this last chapter since Rothschild and the Napoleonic Wars.
[3:55:21.880 --> 3:55:32.680]  1815. Yeah, that was a great speech. But let's see. I was wondering if you had any updates
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:41.000]  on Max Kaiser and the comics prediction that he made? Well the mainstream news is saying
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:44.040]  the comics might default but we need to get Max Kaiser back on. I'm supposed to go on
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:48.680]  his BBC show in the next few weeks but we'll do that Pat. Thanks for the call. Call back
[3:55:48.680 --> 3:55:53.640]  again sometime, we'll have you on longer. Jason in Indiana, you're on the air. Yeah,
[3:55:53.640 --> 3:55:59.040]  I was wondering about the pandemic flu and if the government's behind it for like martial
[3:55:59.040 --> 3:56:04.280]  law. Oh yes, they're definitely behind it. Oh I'm sorry. That's one of the little tricks,
[3:56:04.280 --> 3:56:08.240]  little loving things they have ready for us. Well I know they're supposed to meet like
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:13.200]  people at the fairgrounds to get shots and stuff and I know right now that armored trucks
[3:56:13.200 --> 3:56:19.160]  are delivering flu shots right now to our county. Well that's good. Yeah, be sure and
[3:56:19.160 --> 3:56:23.800]  take the injection. I'm going to take the injection. I think I'll eat some sauerkraut
[3:56:23.800 --> 3:56:29.960]  or something I heard about. You're not going to take the injection when they order it?
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:38.720]  Oh no. No, I'm going to ride for the hills. You're not with Al Qaeda. Jason. It's scary.
[3:56:38.720 --> 3:56:45.960]  To hear from you Jason, Lou in mass. Lou, you're on the air. Hey, how you doing Alex?
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:51.840]  Hello Lou. So I just want to give a quick testimony about, I've been listening to you
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:58.880]  for about a year and a half and I know that you think that the history channel is down
[3:56:58.880 --> 3:57:03.800]  on you but the history channel is actually the one that woke me up with basically the
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:09.280]  hippies on you. Oh yeah, listen they're propaganda only backfires on them but don't let them
[3:57:09.280 --> 3:57:19.040]  know the secret. Everybody attacking on me helps. Please don't attack me. Please don't
[3:57:19.040 --> 3:57:23.200]  put me on TV and say horrible things. No, don't do it. No, it's hurting me. No, it's
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:27.640]  people on the internet lying about me. Don't do it. No, no, don't please, not that old.
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:36.400]  Don't help me. I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm too weak. I'm sorry, go ahead. I was in Chantilly
[3:57:36.400 --> 3:57:41.400]  with you. I saw you in Chantilly. I was there doing a lot of filming. I put a YouTube video

[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:53.280]  of you with a double bore and it was awesome. Well done. All right, hang in there brother.
[3:57:53.280 --> 3:57:58.400]  All right, Lou, good to hear from you. I'm trying to cram in everybody like Andres and
[3:57:58.400 --> 3:58:01.920]  Phil. I'm sorry Phil, come back tomorrow in front of the line. Andres, you're our tail
