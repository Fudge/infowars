[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:29.520]  here on the road I'll be coming up live in the second hour today and also filing key breaking
[00:29.520 --> 00:36.400]  video news reports and of course my co-host will be coming up at the bottom of the hour but wow
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.040]  huge developments that you know I'd like to be able to just come up here and say wonderful news
[00:41.040 --> 00:49.280]  ladies and gentlemen Donald Trump you know dominated in Super Tuesday part two in a big way
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.320]  panicking of the system Rubio is is clearly sinking the establishment candidate we have seen
[00:56.320 --> 01:05.520]  a cruise surge overall clearly into second place but the really big issue here is the info wars
[01:05.520 --> 01:12.000]  dot com posted article from the Daily Caller it's also obviously in the Russian and British
[01:12.000 --> 01:19.040]  newspapers check it out for yourself this is no joke the Russian foreign ministry has sent a
[01:19.040 --> 01:26.320]  direct letter to Kim Jong-un and then publicly published it saying it is unpermissible to
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.600]  threaten preemptive nuclear strikes on South Korea or anybody else for those that don't know
[01:33.120 --> 01:43.200]  Russia for a small area borders North Korea and also on a large border China and even
[01:43.200 --> 01:49.600]  China the Chinese communist government came out last week and had the strongest threats ever
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.440]  towards North Korea who they've kind of controlled since the 1950s Korean War as a set piece
[01:56.400 --> 02:03.200]  there is a nuclear trigger in the region obviously we need to get Joel Scalzen of World Affairs
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.400]  Brief on who continues to warn that this will be the real trigger that the Middle East is
[02:08.400 --> 02:13.440]  is is important but distractionary overall but look you could have Syria as a trigger now you
[02:13.440 --> 02:22.240]  could have North Korea unprecedented to have that demonic fat little soft vampire rat and look I
[02:22.240 --> 02:29.280]  don't usually use names for people but he deserves it he is the ultimate example of trash a third
[02:29.280 --> 02:38.480]  generation hereditary dictator who grew up at a beyond five-star boarding school in Switzerland
[02:38.480 --> 02:48.080]  who is so disconnected from reality he thinks Dennis Rodman is cool who has most of his family
[02:48.080 --> 02:54.000]  executed and it has people killed with mortars and artillery for his entertainment who lives
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  in a complete fantasy land with a bunch of starving scarecrows being forced to worship him
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.880]  as hundreds of thousands starved to death a year this is your state this is your feel the burn
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.640]  world this this is what socialism and communism and collectivism and fascism and all forms of
[03:12.640 --> 03:24.480]  centralization command and control baguette is gangs and thugs and ruled by insider cliques and
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.480]  russia is just so on target over and over again tell them the west you move to clear weapons
[03:30.480 --> 03:35.840]  up against our borders and threaten us and put proxy armies in we're moving to extend and if
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.800]  it looks like you're about to use them on our troops we're going to hit you okay and then
[03:40.800 --> 03:46.960]  tell them turkey if you mass wave attack us with artillery and with a large army you're forming
[03:46.960 --> 03:53.840]  of over a hundred thousand troops and mercenaries out of Saudi Arabia we're going to use a tactical
[03:53.840 --> 03:59.760]  nuke on you now that's classic legal tactics if you're being invaded if you're being hit
[04:00.560 --> 04:08.320]  by a large attack that you can't repulse using tactical nuclear weapon on it the difference is
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.440]  and that's u.s policy as well and it makes sense it's mutually assert destruction basically at a
[04:13.440 --> 04:22.400]  tactical level not just a icbm intercontinental nation against nation level but if you expand on
[04:22.400 --> 04:28.240]  that and this is what's really important north korea is threatening to just nuke the capital of
[04:28.240 --> 04:34.560]  south korea if they don't quote capitulate to a bunch of their demands that's nuclear terrorism
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.320]  that's holding people hostage and it's a lot bigger than all the al-qaeda threats they're
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.320]  constantly hyping to take our freedoms even as the government gets caught shipping the al-qaeda
[04:42.320 --> 04:47.520]  an ISIS threat in itself we'll be back after break to go over all this and a lot more i'm

[08:18.640 --> 08:27.040]  two thousand and sixteen on this wednesday worldwide broadcast and wow we saw another big primary
[08:27.040 --> 08:36.720]  night last night and donald trump again dominated and won so many of the key states we're going to
[08:36.720 --> 08:43.120]  be walking through all that today we have him winning hawaii the coveted michigan and mississippi
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.800]  but those are not winner take all and that's been the republican strategy we told you about
[08:48.800 --> 08:53.120]  almost three weeks ago now was in the washington post yesterday the republican establishment
[08:53.120 --> 09:02.560]  does intend to steal the election at the primary level once they get into the republican national
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.040]  convention before it ever gets into the general election i don't think they're going to be successful
[09:07.040 --> 09:10.960]  because it's it's so much momentum is getting behind trump but they're throwing everything
[09:10.960 --> 09:19.200]  they've got uh eddie right now so trump has 558 delegates ted cruz is clearly second place now
[09:19.200 --> 09:27.840]  359 rubio the big news obviously on the republican side is that rubio is now clearly out of the race
[09:27.840 --> 09:33.120]  even most mainline analyst agrees that's another establishment darling falling and of course ksik
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.760]  at 54 uh clearly never really in the race but they're trying to prop him up as well now
[09:39.760 --> 09:48.800]  donald trump has come out and called for unity in a speech uh last night uh and so it's important
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.760]  that we basically play uh some of his uh victory speech and what he was calling for here's some
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.640]  of those highlights thank you very much girl thank you let's take a listen to the winner tonight
[10:00.640 --> 10:06.720]  in michigan and i don't think i've ever had so many horrible horrible things said about me in one week
[10:06.720 --> 10:15.840]  38 million dollars worth of horrible lies but that's okay it shows you how brilliant the public is
[10:16.560 --> 10:22.400]  because they knew they were lies and it it was just uh really amazing to watch i think what this
[10:22.400 --> 10:28.880]  shows really more than anything else is that advertising is not as important it really isn't
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.880]  as important as competence because there has never been more money spent on hitting somebody
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.520]  than was spent on me and between that and people saying things and you know lindsay graham goes and
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.160]  he's a nasty person first of all he's wrong on the military he truly this is why he said i've
[10:46.160 --> 10:49.920]  been doing this for 15 years that's right we've been fighting a war for 15 years with this kind of
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.800]  thinking i mean if you're gonna fight a war win the war let's get back to rebuilding our country
[10:54.800 --> 11:01.440]  okay but marco helped me a lot because he called ted a liar he said you're a liar that's the first
[11:01.440 --> 11:07.440]  time look i know politicians better than anybody they're liars okay they're serious liars more
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.920]  importantly they'll never get you to the promised land ever they'll never get you to the promised
[11:11.920 --> 11:15.920]  land they won't do it because they're controlled by the special interests they're controlled by the
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.760]  people that put up all this money for them to run they control you know how much money was
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.760]  spent in the last week on me and do you know how many times they were asking despite the fact
[11:25.760 --> 11:32.080]  that they're not supposed to be talking to their super PAC Carl fellas let me ask you a question
[11:32.080 --> 11:38.160]  how many times you think marco and ted and all of them were calling their super PAC now let's
[11:38.160 --> 11:45.360]  look at the democrat side bernie scored a big upset victory in michigan hillary clearly is
[11:45.360 --> 11:52.880]  stealing the election all over the country she's been caught from Iowa to places like the situation
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.040]  in new hampshire she says the delegates are mine the super delegates are mine it doesn't matter
[11:57.040 --> 12:04.640]  the party's going to give it to me uh this is just simply amazing that this is happening again so
[12:04.640 --> 12:10.080]  nakedly the democrats stealing and openly the republicans saying they're going to steal it
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.600]  openly but the democrats are all ready doing it and we have a lot of evidence that there is point
[12:15.600 --> 12:20.160]  shaving because it's not winter take all in most these states in the republican primaries as well
[12:20.160 --> 12:26.480]  again so trump doesn't get that key 50 plus percent of the delegates so they so they can
[12:26.480 --> 12:32.960]  challenge the nomination i know you know that but we better get that news out to the general public
[12:32.960 --> 12:39.360]  this is one of the few times where the fact that they can steal elections is now widely known
[12:39.360 --> 12:44.480]  we need to hammer that point home and let the republican precinct chairs delegates super
[12:44.480 --> 12:51.120]  delegates everyone know that if they steal the popular vote from the record numbers of people
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.760]  that have come into the republican party with trump's big 10 approach it's really what it is
[12:55.760 --> 13:02.480]  his populist approach you're going to hold them personally responsible you're going to run against
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.640]  them in office you're going to make it a personal political beef if they engage in this type of
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.360]  activity you're going to get their name in the newspaper the shame of stealing the popular vote
[13:13.360 --> 13:19.520]  from the people that's what this is all about now shifting gears the story is up on info wars.com
[13:19.520 --> 13:26.320]  the story is up on drudge report.com we're going to cover it in a moment russia is threatening to
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.880]  invade north korea we're going to get to that in a moment north korea obviously has been threatening
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.840]  nuclear terror holding the world hostage if they don't submit and give them what they want now
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.000]  is our pentagon saying or anything about that no they hope there's some big conflict at least
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.800]  the presidential level because that's a distraction from iraq obama this is the dangerous military
[13:46.800 --> 13:52.000]  climate we've gotten into but north korea according to my research many other experts like jose calzen
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.480]  is the key trigger for world war three or what the pentagon calls world war four they call the
[13:56.480 --> 14:03.600]  cold war world war world war three separately there is a new report out ladies and gentlemen
[14:03.600 --> 14:11.920]  pentagon admits military spy drones over the usa and that's in usa today again the stories on
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.960]  drudge report.com and info wars.com we need the flashback articles from 10 years ago five years
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.880]  ago three years ago a year ago somebody should write an article of our great reporters ought
[14:22.880 --> 14:29.760]  to be curt demo probably and it should just be info wars drudge proven right about military
[14:29.760 --> 14:34.080]  drones over the us remember all those articles five years ago and three years ago and years ago
[14:34.080 --> 14:41.120]  saying jones is insane curt nemo's insane you know matt drudge is lying just drudge run our stories
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.320]  there are no military drones over the us and they would write these articles
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.680]  in usa today of all places did it uh it was in columns all over the country it was a big push
[14:51.680 --> 14:56.480]  several times you we could pull the articles up saying we were lying about drones and then it was
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.680]  a conspiracy theory kind of relying about the nsa spying on you or obama care you know being a huge
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.000]  ripoff which everybody knows it is now they say it's a conspiracy there are no taxes in it
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.720]  it's a conspiracy you know it doesn't find you and then the supreme court ruled its attacks and
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.800]  it does find you it was in the stake and bill they just hope you don't go read it was in local
[15:18.800 --> 15:26.080]  newspapers in the dakotas and in texas and all over that they had predator drones assigned to
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.400]  homeland security under pentagon control and cia control they have two different fleets watching
[15:32.400 --> 15:38.800]  farmers in colorada and texas in south dakota going after quote cattle wrestlers remember the
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.800]  cattle kept coming over on the property under state law in that state you know you could take
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.520]  them at that point because the neighbors were just letting their cows be on their property
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.120]  you know you can't do that i mean we've taken cows on our ranch and we've had some ours about 20
[15:51.120 --> 15:54.880]  something years ago taken the third time they went over to god's yard now my grandfather didn't
[15:54.880 --> 16:02.480]  like the neighbor too much after that but uh you know still that that's the law he got to keep some
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.520]  of his cows including his prized bull that broke through the fence to go after his cows so they
[16:07.520 --> 16:13.680]  use predator drones on that and then we were just linking to the local articles that's what's crazy
[16:13.680 --> 16:20.080]  we weren't breaking it ourselves it's like the civilian inmate labor camp or the uh emergency
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.360]  centers establishment act that obama put in saying four patriots that they believe an uprising is
[16:25.360 --> 16:31.200]  coming quote reeducation camps just type in army manual admins preparation for internment camps
[16:31.200 --> 16:38.240]  they use the warm reeducation camp how to process our social security numbers i expect when i cover
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.480]  this next article that they'll probably have a media matters article out saying i'm you know
[16:42.480 --> 16:48.160]  saying nuclear war is about to happen no i'm not saying it daily caller is reporting on the russian
[16:48.160 --> 16:54.480]  newspapers and the british newspapers again they just hope you don't check reality russia threatens
[16:54.480 --> 17:00.320]  invasion of north korea if nuclear rhetoric continues the warning was issued in the form
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.680]  of a written statement from the russian foreign ministry because north korea keeps threatening
[17:05.680 --> 17:13.360]  to nuke to nuke the capital of south korea that's got like more than 10 million people in it but
[17:13.360 --> 17:20.480]  ceo that's only like 35 miles from the border if they don't capitulate and just let north korea
[17:20.480 --> 17:27.360]  have their money have their trade routes and just follow up this little goblin like collectivist
[17:27.360 --> 17:33.360]  rat well look at the communism another hereditary dictator ruling over everyone and vampirically
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.640]  literally having sex slaves in a seven-story pleasure palace that his dad built in weird
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.840]  giant pyramid buildings that they can't even put windows in this is what communism and collectivism
[17:43.840 --> 17:50.000]  but don't worry lots of uniforms lots of big hats lots of metals lots of checkpoints lots of spies
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.760]  this is the conquest parasite economy we're fighting against this is a parasite economy a
[17:55.760 --> 18:02.560]  conquest economy versus a renaissance free will truth economy and i see america with social
[18:02.560 --> 18:07.840]  justice warriors and all the political correctness where there's all these losers and nobodies that
[18:07.840 --> 18:13.440]  want to get together and gains literally stupid scum i mean they're just they're everywhere it's
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.080]  it's white black hispanic everybody it's all these victim victimology and then they get around
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.880]  and they lie they get together and they steal they get together and they create all these huge
[18:22.880 --> 18:28.480]  frauds together and they try to get in positions of power to then leech off everyone and this
[18:28.480 --> 18:35.680]  paradigm has happened time and time and time again in history and we are racing towards it
[18:35.680 --> 18:40.160]  but they want us all fighting with each other low level the technocrats that control the future
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.800]  prediction technologies of google and all the super science medical advancements and the super
[18:44.800 --> 18:50.320]  weapons they are breakaway now they're just figuring out how to dumb us down get us in our
[18:50.320 --> 18:56.160]  distraction get us drugged up and just phase out the generation they're the soft kills begun

[24:14.880 --> 24:22.400]  quickly and i had a momentary momentary uh uh loss of what day it is because i'm very upset about
[24:22.400 --> 24:25.520]  the news that we're going to be talking about here we're going to take a look at the lavoy fennecum
[24:25.520 --> 24:31.200]  murder video that's been put out by the government the same day that they say that they are justified
[24:31.200 --> 24:37.680]  and killing him they simultaneously release a video that in my opinion and the opinion of many
[24:37.680 --> 24:41.120]  people we're going to let we're going to take a look at it we're going to comment on it uh
[24:41.120 --> 24:47.040]  want you to see this and hear what we have to say to me this is outright murder and attempted
[24:47.040 --> 24:53.040]  murder and they're doing this right in our face putting this cell phone video out
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.320]  that they had previously confiscated uh there are some indications from some people some of
[24:58.320 --> 25:03.520]  these articles that are talking about law enforcement officers who spoke off the record
[25:03.520 --> 25:08.160]  i know they're good law enforcement officers and i know that some of them are probably behind this
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.800]  so maybe it isn't just an in your face yeah we can kill you anytime we want to type of thing
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.760]  and uh we're going to talk about this we're also going to talk about election results because that
[25:17.760 --> 25:23.840]  is something that is also important we're going to talk about the the militarization of the police
[25:23.840 --> 25:28.800]  and the police state there's a couple of very interesting articles up on the dredge report
[25:28.800 --> 25:34.000]  today the crime you have not committed from bloomberg talking about the pre-crime minority
[25:34.000 --> 25:40.240]  report type of data mining and uh flagging that our government is heavily invested into that's
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.840]  what we were talking about a year ago when we were talking about the jade helms situation
[25:44.480 --> 25:50.000]  we're also going to talk about ed snowden calling out the fbi saying you're lying when you say that
[25:50.000 --> 25:57.520]  you can't unlock the san bernadino iphone he calls it bs uh and he spells it out for you okay
[25:57.520 --> 26:02.880]  we've also had of course uh john mackaffey calling them out on this and saying look you
[26:02.880 --> 26:08.720]  can get in this i can get in it okay it's what john mackaffey said uh you don't need to do this only
[26:08.720 --> 26:15.840]  doing this to establish a legal precedent what do we do we have a government that lies to us and
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.680]  of course this is part of the investigation into levoi finnecombe as well and we're also going to
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.520]  take a look at the election results you know we look at the surprise win and bernie sanders
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.560]  in michigan but when you look at the develop the delegates that are sent out you know even
[26:30.560 --> 26:37.520]  when bernie wins he loses that's by design there's an article up on politico it's like hey you know
[26:37.520 --> 26:44.160]  if we had democrat rules and the republican party we could easily stop donald trump uh maybe the
[26:44.160 --> 26:51.920]  democrats need to start a grassroots effort to make sure that the party elites don't get to trump
[26:51.920 --> 26:58.160]  the uh what the grassroots voters want uh hopefully that won't happen in the gop elections but we need
[26:58.160 --> 27:04.400]  to have a major reform of this people need to see the corruption in both parties we need to have
[27:04.400 --> 27:11.200]  some choices here that are not the unified choices of the party elite at the top you understand
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.880]  that the party elite at the top both have the same agenda on the major ticket items and the
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.800]  major ticket items this year are repeated again it's the trade treaties it's the climate treaties
[27:22.800 --> 27:28.320]  it's the open borders it's the globalist consolidation it takes place first economically
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.800]  but there are also sovereignty issues with this at the very beginning and they will use that economic
[27:32.800 --> 27:39.600]  consolidation to create a political consolidation as well uh before we get to the news i just want
[27:39.600 --> 27:46.000]  to let you know that we do have uh supermail vitality back in stock it's been out of stock for a
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.720]  very long time it is now uh back in stock for a limited time only you know one of the reasons
[27:50.720 --> 27:56.080]  that this stuff goes out of stock is because of auto ship in high demand and you know one of the
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.920]  ways that you can guarantee that it's never going to go out of stock for you is to get into auto
[27:59.920 --> 28:06.080]  ship and that also gives you a 10 discount whenever you buy anything at info wars life.com so you
[28:06.080 --> 28:10.640]  can make sure that you get the products that you want on the time frame that you want when you
[28:10.640 --> 28:16.480]  sign up for auto ship and you get 10 off all the time so you can pick the interval at which you
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.880]  want it shipped and make sure that you always have it so right now we have supermail vitality
[28:20.880 --> 28:25.440]  that is back in stock and one of the ways that you can make sure you don't run out is with auto
[28:25.440 --> 28:30.560]  ship and that's at info wars life.com now let's quickly take a look at what the elites are doing
[28:30.560 --> 28:37.760]  and what they were not able to do. Mitt Romney of course uh did us all a favor by coming out
[28:37.760 --> 28:44.720]  against Donald Trump it seems that whenever the elites go out and unite in opposition to somebody
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.920]  that is the kiss of death for the people they support and it is a big boost for Donald Trump
[28:49.920 --> 28:57.120]  who they do not support uh the never say uh Trump people are uh not helping themselves
[28:57.120 --> 29:02.480]  every time they identify somebody as the establishment candidate that candidate implodes
[29:02.480 --> 29:06.640]  we've seen it time and again and so what we saw with this election that we had last night
[29:06.640 --> 29:13.760]  was Mitt Romney recorded robo calls on the behalf of Marco Roboto and also on behalf
[29:13.760 --> 29:20.720]  of Kasich and Michigan he did it in all four states he did pro rubio calls Mitt Romney what is
[29:20.720 --> 29:26.320]  the matter with Mitt Romney he ran for president for eight years he was rejected by the republicans
[29:26.320 --> 29:30.160]  and he was rejected rejected by everybody when the republicans finally gave up and said all right
[29:30.160 --> 29:36.160]  give him a run at it okay he doesn't get it nobody likes Mitt Romney he lost his home state to Obama
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.000]  one of the only reasons he wanted in the primaries is because he got an endorsement from Donald
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.200]  Trump the guy is an incredible loser to borrow Donald Trump's points and he proved it last
[29:45.200 --> 29:50.640]  night stay with us we'll be right back to talk about this video we're on the march the empires on the
[29:50.640 --> 30:01.600]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network 400 us army soldiers at fort gordon georgia were
[30:01.600 --> 30:06.560]  subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing including a powerpoint presentation
[30:06.560 --> 30:12.320]  instructing the attendees or society attaches privilege to being white and male and heterosexual
[30:12.320 --> 30:17.280]  the slideshow obtained by judicial watch also informed the soldiers quote race privilege gives
[30:17.280 --> 30:21.760]  whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to african americans the white privilege training
[30:21.760 --> 30:26.560]  also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere keeping different kinds of people from
[30:26.560 --> 30:31.760]  being valued accepted and appreciated but we act as if it doesn't exist this alleged privilege
[30:31.760 --> 30:36.800]  creates a yawning divide and income wealth and dignity the slideshow is suggested but obviously
[30:36.800 --> 30:40.560]  this white privilege training course helps perpetrate this racial divide in america by
[30:40.560 --> 30:44.560]  fueling racial tensions this very notion that you can group people into racial groups who have
[30:44.560 --> 30:48.800]  certain privileges as racists in itself because then you're not looking at people by their individual
[30:48.800 --> 30:53.520]  qualities but rather by their skin color which is inherently racist this is kit daniels and check

[33:21.360 --> 33:27.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this wednesday march night 2016 we're
[33:27.600 --> 33:34.160]  going to take a look at this lavoi finnecom murder video we put this up last night uh article on
[33:34.160 --> 33:39.920]  info wars dot com shock cell phone video shows the lavoi finnecom shooting from inside the video
[33:39.920 --> 33:46.880]  this video was released by the deshute county sheriff's office this is the county uh sheriff's
[33:46.880 --> 33:52.000]  office that is doing the investigation uh they do it in a different uh sheriff's uh a different
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.880]  county whenever it uh takes place in in the neighboring county they don't have the same
[33:57.520 --> 34:02.640]  sheriff's office investigate this but let's understand okay this is the fbi this is the state
[34:02.640 --> 34:09.680]  police uh these are people who are essentially investigating themselves okay this is not a
[34:09.680 --> 34:15.680]  jury of impartial citizens looking at this investigation this is the government investigating
[34:15.680 --> 34:22.800]  itself and pronouncing itself justified justified and we're gonna take a look at this because if
[34:22.800 --> 34:29.040]  you saw our comments last night you know that uh when we looked at this and and i every time i look
[34:29.040 --> 34:36.160]  at this it makes me more angry and heartbroken this is murder this is our government shooting
[34:36.160 --> 34:40.800]  people down we've seen this in the inner cities we've seen it with black people we've seen it
[34:40.800 --> 34:45.680]  with white people we've seen it with people in the cities and people in the countryside okay until
[34:45.680 --> 34:50.240]  we all come together black and white cowboy and indian and stop these abuses and i'm you know i
[34:50.240 --> 34:55.200]  say cowboy and indian i mean really when you look at what's going on in arizona with senator mccain
[34:55.200 --> 35:00.320]  turning over this land taking this land that is something that's being used for recreation but it
[35:00.320 --> 35:06.240]  also has significant historical uh aspects to the uh patchy indians that are there they're
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.640]  going to destroy this land on which some cowboys if you want to call them that ranchers or others
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.760]  have uh surface rights to it has multiple uses at this point but it's going to be turned over
[35:15.760 --> 35:22.560]  to a foreign uh corporation to mine it for copper in a way that will destroy it for everyone no
[35:22.560 --> 35:28.720]  recreational use no historical use no religious significance for the indians no surface rights
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.760]  for the americans it'll be a foreign corporation that will mine and destroy this we have to stand
[35:33.760 --> 35:40.240]  up to this that is what's behind this issue that these people were protesting but we also have to
[35:40.240 --> 35:45.440]  stand up to the violence that our government enacts on people of every kind we have to stand
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.720]  together and we have to say that you're not going to you're not going to break us into little groups
[35:50.720 --> 35:56.560]  and pit us against each other like the black lives matter issue okay this is a real blm issue it's a
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.640]  blm bureau of land management is also uh transcending the black lives matter propaganda of
[36:02.640 --> 36:08.640]  george soros and others and we've had videos and reports we'll show you how uh george soros is funding
[36:08.640 --> 36:14.400]  that okay that is an effort to shut it down that is an effort to get us fighting amongst ourselves
[36:14.400 --> 36:20.640]  instead of joining together to stop these kind of murders now what i want you to do when you look
[36:20.640 --> 36:27.280]  at this i don't want you to jump onto social media and start making death threats okay if you see this
[36:27.280 --> 36:31.600]  and you understand what is going on and it makes you angry do not take yourself out of the game
[36:35.200 --> 36:39.920]  if you're outraged we need you educated people
[36:42.880 --> 36:46.800]  don't go out and shoot somebody in uniform either okay you're going to shoot the wrong person
[36:46.800 --> 36:54.080]  you're going to shed innocent blood we don't need to make these killers into heroes we don't need to
[36:54.080 --> 37:03.760]  justify their actions after the fact we've got to educate the public we've got to stop this murder
[37:05.840 --> 37:10.480]  let's take a look at this video i want you to see what happened at the stop and what they did was
[37:10.480 --> 37:15.840]  they took the cell phone video and they superimposed it on this ridiculous video that we've been
[37:15.840 --> 37:22.480]  given by the fbi but the fbi gave us was aerial footage at a very low resolution with no sound
[37:23.040 --> 37:30.880]  and a phony lying narrative from the fbi uh uh shell who was uh presenting this we know when
[37:30.880 --> 37:36.880]  when uh biggs and i saw this and the fbi agent to give you an example of how effective it is i mean
[37:36.880 --> 37:40.800]  we should have known better we looked at this and it's like you know it's a shaky video it's not
[37:40.800 --> 37:48.080]  streaming well we got the fbi saying you know is approaching the the uh uh roadblock the fbi agent
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.640]  says look at this he tried to run down our agent and it's like oh look we could see a guy halfway
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.160]  there because it was a jerky video and then we went back and looked at it's like this guy leapt
[37:56.160 --> 38:01.360]  out in front of him he's swerving off to the side trying to avoid the roadblock that they put up
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.440]  in a course we're going to talk about the legal aspects of that roadblock but he's swerving to
[38:05.440 --> 38:10.000]  the side to miss that roadblock and as he's swerving the guy jumps out in front of his truck
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.120]  and he swerves farther to the left he was not trying to run the guy down everything about this
[38:15.680 --> 38:24.160]  was designed as a propaganda lie by the fbi so now when they say well okay the shooting was justified
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.400]  but we're going to investigate some fbi agents who lied about the fact that they didn't shoot any
[38:28.400 --> 38:36.080]  guns okay look the whole thing was a lie the whole thing was an ambush the whole thing was set up
[38:36.080 --> 38:41.840]  to stop a political protest they were going to talk to 400 people in john day oregon
[38:42.640 --> 38:46.400]  people who understood what the problems were people who were going to try to address this
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.520]  peacefully and i hope they still do i hope they don't let this scare them into silence it has to
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.960]  be addressed these are issues that the sheriff in great county sheriff palmer had stood with the
[38:56.960 --> 39:01.600]  people on he had deputized people to try to deal with it other people in the government shut it
[39:01.600 --> 39:08.480]  down we need more people like sheriff palmer they're good people in government don't start striking
[39:08.480 --> 39:15.520]  out blindly against people let's play this uh you can see we're going to play this in a couple
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.080]  of clips it's very long it's 12 minutes long let's play it where they're stopped and you can hear
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.240]  their confusion their how they're trying to deal with what they don't understand they're not being
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.200]  allowed they were allowed to travel freely back and forth talking to people having political
[39:29.200 --> 39:34.720]  meetings explaining what the problems were the fbi didn't want that because they were having pressure
[39:34.720 --> 39:41.440]  put on them by the state and the federal officials to shut that down and they shut it down they shut
[39:41.440 --> 39:49.280]  it down killed and arrested people let's show the first stop right here shoot me you shoot me i'm
[39:49.280 --> 39:55.200]  going to meet the sheriff the sheriff is waiting for us so you do as you damn well please but i'm

[40:10.080 --> 40:17.200]  through me he knows what they're trying to do i don't care where's ryan i'm going to go meet the
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.840]  sheriff mainstream media says he's taunting them no he's telling them i'm going to go meet the sheriff
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.000]  i'm going to meet the sheriff you can either come with me or you can shoot me right now for
[40:26.640 --> 40:31.120]  well i'm going to ask them if they want to go out what for why are we going out what for
[40:31.840 --> 40:37.120]  what are we getting out are you yeah who are you are you saying who are you haven't identified
[40:37.120 --> 40:45.760]  who are you organ state police okay well i'm going over to meet the sheriff in grand county

[40:52.160 --> 40:57.520]  put the laser right there put the ball through the head and as he's as he's doing this you can
[40:57.520 --> 41:02.080]  see the red dots inside the cabin of the truck they're already training and pointing their guns
[41:02.080 --> 41:07.840]  at that real you want my blood on your hands that's assault folks with a deadly weapon places to go
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.000]  okay now we're going to pick this up and we're going to at one point he says all right we're
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.920]  going to go they they talk about it amongst themselves i say let's just go let's try to get
[41:17.920 --> 41:22.800]  to the sheriff in grant county the sheriff was going to be at that meeting of 400 people he was
[41:22.800 --> 41:29.760]  going to be addressing them so they drive off now i want you to see what happens next before i do
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.680]  that i want to read you something that came from oathkeepers after the fact uh this was something
[41:35.680 --> 41:43.040]  stewart roads uh interviewed greg mcquirter a veteran swat officer an oathkeeper and we've also
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.840]  had a video we look for this video couldn't find it before show time we've had another officer who
[41:47.840 --> 41:55.040]  put a video up and he said you don't set up a roadblock like this because that is in and of itself
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.560]  is the use of deadly force and so in this interview with stewart roads this officer who is another
[42:01.120 --> 42:08.560]  veteran police officer quotes the law here he says a vehicle pursuits this is a portland police
[42:08.560 --> 42:15.040]  department's policy this this is oregon state police policy that he quotes here 630.05 vehicle
[42:15.040 --> 42:20.960]  pursuits barricading barricading is considered deadly physical force subject to directive 10
[42:20.960 --> 42:26.000]  10.10 barricading requires the approval of a supervisor furthermore the barricade must be
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.240]  set up in such a manner as to avoid the fleeing suspect to afford the fleeing suspect ample time
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.880]  to see the barricade to stop his or her vehicle they put it around a curve and you can see this
[42:36.880 --> 42:43.440]  boxing in ramming and roadblocks boxing in and ramming to be used only against violent
[42:43.440 --> 42:49.280]  felons with permission by sworn supervisor monitoring the pursuit not to be used by officers
[42:49.280 --> 42:53.600]  who have not completed prescribed training roadblocks are dangerous and difficult to
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.960]  properly establish no roadblock may be established until both dispatcher and pursuing officer have
[42:58.960 --> 43:05.280]  been notified there are three kinds of roadblocks fixed which a block road to extent that little or
[43:05.280 --> 43:10.080]  no outlet remains a fixed roadblocks are extremely dangerous and are rarely justifiable and that's
[43:10.080 --> 43:17.840]  what we have here that is quoting Oregon state police policy which they violated in this particular
[43:17.840 --> 43:23.280]  situation as the other officer in his analysis of this said they know who these people were
[43:23.840 --> 43:29.520]  they know they're not violent they talk to them for probably 10 minutes they can see them holding
[43:29.520 --> 43:35.520]  their hands out nothing was done that would indicate that they were violent okay they knew who they
[43:35.520 --> 43:42.640]  were they knew where they were going and there was absolutely no reason for them to use deadly
[43:42.640 --> 43:48.560]  force and the blockade itself was deadly force but they didn't just stop there let's roll this
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.440]  video and you can see that as they're pulling up to the roadblock they have they're approaching
[43:53.440 --> 43:58.400]  the roadblock and the police and the FBI start shooting at them as they're approaching the
[43:58.400 --> 44:06.800]  roadblock it got that bad let's show that video okay well i got numbers but i can't call because
[44:06.800 --> 44:12.160]  we have no service okay yeah they set it up there where you've got no service do you have numbers
[44:12.160 --> 44:19.280]  of people here in town you're out there okay they're shooting come right around the video
[44:19.280 --> 44:31.520]  come right around the curve and they do that
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.480]  now as they're saying stay down hold it right there hold it right there
[44:37.920 --> 44:41.600]  okay i was talking you can hear this gunshots you can hear if you watch the video you can
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.920]  hear the gunshots as they're approaching the barricade when you look at that video he says go
[44:45.920 --> 44:49.920]  ahead and shoot me he got out of the car right away because they had already been shooting at him
[44:49.920 --> 44:54.800]  okay he's trying to draw fire away from the people in the car i believe that's what his family and
[44:54.800 --> 45:01.600]  the people who knew him believe he was that kind of guy is that kind of guy he died for your freedoms
[45:02.880 --> 45:09.680]  now as he's getting out of the car with his hands raised you can see them shooting out the windows
[45:09.680 --> 45:15.440]  shooting at him okay i don't know if they shot him at that point they say that all the shots were
[45:15.440 --> 45:22.560]  in his back in his back that's our government our lying back shooting government and we need to change
[45:22.560 --> 45:30.000]  it not start shooting people folks we do not want to become what we fight that's what we talk about
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.840]  with this torture video that's what try to explain to donald trump you do not want to become what you
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.760]  fight and of course he said look i'm not going to torture people if it's against the law he said
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.480]  that on friday then on sunday he gets on with john dickerson and he says well you know we got a set
[45:44.480 --> 45:50.000]  of rules that are hampering us they don't play by the rules and john dickerson said so the rules
[45:50.000 --> 45:56.400]  really are what separate us from them what makes us better than them and he goes oh we have to
[45:56.400 --> 46:02.560]  get to their level we have to win no we cannot think that way we cannot become what we fight
[46:02.560 --> 46:08.880]  that is always the danger of a war and let's understand this is a war of our government
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.680]  against the american people there's no doubt about that but we do not want to become them
[46:13.680 --> 46:20.000]  if we start resorting to murder and vigilanteism we're going to exchange one kind of tyranny for
[46:20.000 --> 46:27.280]  another we need to wake people up the vast majority of people in this country and you have to understand
[46:27.280 --> 46:33.360]  this do not share your anger at this they have to be angry about this they have to understand what's
[46:33.360 --> 46:38.960]  going on black people in the cities are angry about it but they think that it's just them
[46:38.960 --> 46:45.760]  they have to understand show them this tell them you agree with their problems tell them
[46:45.760 --> 46:50.240]  that we need to work with uh ways to shut this down but before we can do anything
[46:51.520 --> 46:57.600]  before we can do anything we have to have a consensus we have to have a larger number of
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.560]  people and that's one of the lessons of this Oregon standoff it's not enough to be right
[47:02.560 --> 47:08.800]  it's not enough to be right you cannot do something like they did in Oregon with just
[47:08.800 --> 47:14.080]  a couple of people it was a bad strategy a bad tactic they thought they had broader support
[47:14.080 --> 47:19.520]  because they had some shill reporter that was lying to them and provoking them to do this stuff
[47:19.520 --> 47:23.680]  they did not have the kind of national support that they thought they thought they could go
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.960]  anywhere and defend people who are being attacked by the government and Oregon is probably the worst
[47:28.960 --> 47:35.760]  place to take your stand one of the most status places that you can go to we have to use the
[47:35.760 --> 47:43.280]  law that they swear to they swear to the constitution the constitution is the beard they use to give
[47:43.280 --> 47:49.520]  them the authority that they have and we have to make it clear that they are the criminals
[47:50.400 --> 47:55.520]  but we have to get the american people to understand this and when we look at the articles
[47:55.520 --> 48:00.320]  that are put out by the washington post by the new york times the way they slant the news
[48:01.280 --> 48:06.480]  you have to understand that we're a long way from getting the people to come together and oppose
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.760]  this across the board that's absolutely amazing let me read you some of the articles let me read
[48:11.760 --> 48:18.240]  you first what the organ live said they said an fbi agent is suspected of lying about firing twice
[48:18.240 --> 48:24.240]  at la voy finnecombe okay they say that two state troopers shot him three times in the back shows an
[48:24.240 --> 48:29.280]  autopsy finnecombe had a trooper in front of him armed with a taser who was thought to be in danger
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.240]  and of course when we analyzed this with that other officer he said here's a car they're using
[48:34.240 --> 48:40.400]  deadly force against which you would typically legally only we just read what the Oregon state
[48:40.400 --> 48:46.080]  police policy is you would only use that against fleeing violent felons okay that's not the situation
[48:46.080 --> 48:53.440]  here they set up deadly force with the roadblock and then he jumps out as if the there's no threat
[48:53.440 --> 48:59.280]  from this vehicle that they have just used deadly force to stop he jumps out and stands behind that
[48:59.280 --> 49:04.400]  vehicle exposing himself to being attacked from the vehicle they were just shooting at the vehicle
[49:04.400 --> 49:10.080]  they just used deadly force to stop and then once they kill la voy finnecombe they retreat back to
[49:10.080 --> 49:16.640]  their uh their covered positions and they continue to fire at the people in the car let's play that
[49:16.640 --> 49:32.240]  video let's keep rolling that video stay down stay down they're saying stay down stay down
[49:32.240 --> 49:44.640]  excuse me are they shooting him did they shoot them oh my god stay down
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.560]  now they retreat to their positions and you'll see that they're that they're hitting them with
[49:58.560 --> 50:02.800]  tear gas they're hitting them they're they're shining bullets there they're shooting at them you
[50:02.800 --> 50:08.880]  can see the tear gas the flash bangs going off as they're shooting at them uh this goes on for a
[50:08.880 --> 50:14.560]  very long time you should watch this video you need to make sure other people watch this video
[50:15.280 --> 50:21.120]  now we can see what's going on like we couldn't when the fbi put that video out initially and they
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.040]  did it that way so that you would not see what's going on now they're trying to get rid of the
[50:25.040 --> 50:31.040]  sheriff in grant county because he called it an ambush folks it was an ambush it violated
[50:31.040 --> 50:37.920]  oregon state policy but now the oregon police say oh it's justified justified we set up the rules
[50:37.920 --> 50:43.920]  we can break the rules just like the gop and the democrats will do when it comes to their
[50:43.920 --> 50:49.280]  conventions we'll talk about that but we're going to talk more about what happened in this murder
[50:49.280 --> 50:57.840]  and attempted murder of the three people in the vehicle stay with us we'll be right back

[54:23.680 --> 54:28.480]  how you justify shooting somebody with their hands up as they're executing a vehicle we've
[54:28.480 --> 54:32.000]  seen this many times in inner cities and the police continually get away with it because
[54:32.000 --> 54:37.920]  they investigate themselves they exonerate themselves the legal system is fundamentally
[54:37.920 --> 54:44.560]  broken doesn't exist we have to reclaim it we have to reclaim it juries there's a lot of things
[54:44.560 --> 54:50.320]  that we can do we do not uh do not start with vigilanteism no matter how much this upsets you
[54:50.320 --> 54:54.480]  and i know that uh many of you are upset about this but most of the people in america have not
[54:54.480 --> 54:59.440]  seen this i've got other comments i want to remind you first uh that we do have supermail

[55:45.200 --> 55:50.240]  again going back to oregon live uh levoie fennecombe's family had put out a statement
[55:51.200 --> 55:54.080]  about a month ago when he was killed said he was executed in cold blood
[55:54.960 --> 55:59.120]  they accuse the police agencies of deliberately misleading the public about what had happened
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.160]  i mean you can look at that video you can look at what the fbi told people about that video that
[56:04.160 --> 56:10.640]  low resolution silent aerial video and then they put their own narrative over it superimposed it to
[56:10.640 --> 56:16.880]  uh to allow cnn and uh the new york times washington post all the mainstream media to come up with
[56:16.880 --> 56:21.120]  their own lying narrative yeah they did try to deceive people and she didn't back off of this
[56:21.120 --> 56:26.320]  she said my husband was murdered and the attorney for emin bundy said i'm going to have to go back
[56:26.320 --> 56:30.720]  and reconsider all the conspiracy theories that i'd previously written off let me read you what
[56:30.720 --> 56:35.920]  stewart roge wrote on this article where he talked to and i read excerpts from the law the uh a
[56:35.920 --> 56:40.960]  veteran swat officer who went on the record and said hey well let's just read the law what is the
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.440]  oregon state police policy and of course they used lethal force before they even started shooting
[56:46.080 --> 56:51.280]  they started shooting at them before they even when they set up the blockade that was lethal force
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.400]  when they approached the lethal force blockade which violated oregon state policy they began
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.520]  shooting at them more use of lethal force against people that were not a threat to them
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.800]  and stewart roge had this comment basically the same thing that we had said before but he says it
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.560]  very well he says it's clear the politicians like the oregon governor the two senators as well as
[57:10.560 --> 57:14.640]  political hacks within the obama administration were pushing for the f behind the oregon state
[57:14.640 --> 57:22.480]  police to stop the virus of finnecombe and the bundy free speech from spreading it was a political
[57:22.480 --> 57:29.520]  decision there was no physical emergency no threat but there was clearly a political emergency
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.920]  and a political threat and in the eyes of the political elite they had to insist on preventing
[57:35.920 --> 57:40.160]  them from reaching that meeting in john day where they were going to speak to 400 people and the
[57:40.160 --> 57:49.040]  sheriff of the county now you know one of the things that really gets the left's panties and a
[57:49.040 --> 57:55.680]  wad is the fact these guys had guns and one of the things that we see in the charges against
[57:55.680 --> 58:01.360]  cliven bundy from the bundy ranch standoff and i got to tell you i was there we saw what happened
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.760]  we were there at the washout we were there a couple of days before that happened reporting on it
[58:05.760 --> 58:12.400]  we had video we watched it i saw it with my own eyes folks and the fbi is lying in this cliven
[58:12.400 --> 58:18.400]  bundy indictment it is a stack of lies calling it a conspiracy saying they're brandishing weapons
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.040]  you know it can't stand for people to exercise their first and second amendments together
[58:23.040 --> 58:28.720]  there that is an assault on the federal government it is an attempt to block whatever they want to
[58:28.720 --> 58:33.280]  do and so that's what they charge you with obstructing a federal officer in their duty
[58:33.280 --> 58:37.120]  brandishing a weapon you can't exercise the first and second amendment together or they
[58:37.120 --> 58:45.360]  will kill or jail you stay with us we'll be right back thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com

[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show we have some videos we have a man on the street
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.800]  uh of course one of the articles on the dredge report today is about white privilege and that's
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:34.080]  been a big selling point of the uh of the left of the southern poverty law center and now we've
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:42.480]  got the military training people and pushing this whole idea of white privilege uh this is
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.560]  the way they divide us this is the way they conquer us and what i've been trying to get people to
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:54.000]  understand is that we need to not be divided black and white we need to understand that a government
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.080]  is either at your feet or their at your throat to paraphrase Winston Churchill what he said about
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.640]  the germans the nazis okay i'm not using good ones law here i mean this is this is literally true
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.560]  our founding fathers said the same thing about the government that's why they tried to subdivide it
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:19.120]  and pit it against each other in so many different ways they tried to divide the states against the
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.880]  federal government they tried to they were so concerned about consolidation and that's what
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:29.120]  we have seen now their biggest concern was a consolidated federal government that dictated
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.800]  everything to everyone and that is what we have now so what they did was they pitted the power of
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.400]  the states against the federal government that they were creating just as we created the united
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:47.360]  nations okay the the sovereign states of the world uh created the united nations and and i don't
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:55.120]  support the united nations okay but nevertheless if you as an analogy the united nations was created
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.560]  by sovereign states and people still understand that they still understand the nation states
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.760]  are starting to lose that distinction because of things that are happening in europe uh they're
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:10.000]  trying to remove the individual national sovereignty and if you stand up for that you are flagged as a
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.360]  racist as a xenophobe okay you are a horrible person if you stand up for national boundaries
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.600]  but understand and they do the same thing here in america right if you talk about
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.280]  the power of the states if you talk about the ninth and tenth amendment they immediately say
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:32.000]  you're a states rights person that makes you a racist okay there are real political issues with
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.200]  a civil war folks wasn't just the people in the south who said that it was a bad idea for the
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.520]  federal government to raise an army and attack the people who were seceding there were abolitionists
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:51.360]  like liceander spooner who said we are creating he adamantly opposed slavery but he said this is
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.800]  even worse in slavery they will enslave us all and that's what we have seen and that's what the
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.000]  design was a design was to pit the power of the federal government against the states and then
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.280]  to subdivide the federal government even more with multiple branches that would work against each
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.000]  other of course now we have the congress which is basically abdicated its power to the executive
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.240]  branch we allow the supreme court to rewrite the constitution at will treating it as if it were a
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:25.360]  living document we're about to create trade treaties that is jeff sessions the senator sessions
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.760]  who looked at this said we are creating living documents that are going to rule us that are
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:35.280]  going to take down our sovereignty that's what will happen if these trade treaties pass that is
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.600]  why they are so adamant that donald trump needs to be stopped he's the only person who is going
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.840]  to oppose that across the board bernie sanders opposes the trade treaties i'll give him that
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.280]  he doesn't because he's against business quite frankly okay that's the problem he has with it
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:56.720]  and i understand he's right both he and donald trump appointed out that nafta has cost jobs
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.880]  okay it's been a very bad deal for us bernie sanders understands that much at least he
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.840]  understands that it has been a bad deal for the american people it's been a good deal
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.600]  for the corporations who wrote this and pushed it through with their politicians so at least
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.840]  he understands that much about it but he doesn't understand the other issues as a matter of fact
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.360]  he's with them when it comes to the climate change treaty he stands with paul ryan and these other
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.880]  people who understand when they pass the climate change treaty in paris it only took them about
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:31.120]  three days for paul ryan and mitch mcconnell to fund it to fund it okay they didn't block it they
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:37.440]  funded it and now they're meeting in secret confabs with all of the elite of silicon valley
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.920]  deciding how they're going to stop donald trump we're going to talk about that in the next hour
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.920]  and we're also going to talk about how these stories from the drudge report the pentagon
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.560]  using military spy drones over the u.s that ties to the bundy standoff we're going to talk about

[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.880]  the situation with lavoi finnecombe as i point out it's murder an attempted murder and i want to
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.320]  tie it to these stories that are on the dredge report today the pentagon admitting that it is
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.080]  deployed military spy drones over the u.s uh we reported that at the time of the bunkerville
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.680]  standoff a lot of people said that we were exaggerating that we were conspiracy theorists
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.600]  okay we're going to talk about that background we're also going to talk about the crime you've
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:04.240]  not yet committed this is all about mastering the human domain it is all part of what jade
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:11.200]  helm was about you have to understand that human domain uh analytics as well as activity based
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.760]  intelligence is something that has uh been the main thrust of the surveillance state and talking
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.640]  about the surveillance state there's a third article up on info on the dredge report snowden
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:29.520]  says the fbi's claim that it can't unlock the sand bernadino iphone is bs it's a total lie folks
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.920]  and they're lying about what happened in oregon as well that is now coming out and this has been
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.360]  exposed by some officers some good people inside who've exposed this i'm amazed that they released
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:47.600]  this video when i first saw it i thought they're just doing this and putting this right in our
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.240]  face and bragging about it and that may be one aspect of it but i think there may be some people
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.520]  who really want to see uh this stopped on the inside i know they're good officers i know they're
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.680]  on their way to a good sheriff that the system in oregon is now trying to take down sheriff palmer
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.800]  in grant county and people who are there need to stand with him let's go back to this shooting
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:15.200]  and what the mainstream press tells us about this i want to compare that to the reality now
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.600]  this is uh organ live reporting on this and we've shown you the video you need to see this video
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.320]  you need to pass this video around people need to look at this and as you're doing this as you're
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.840]  talking to your friends about this you need to show them hey you know see this aerial video
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.880]  that's all the fbi put out initially low res you can't see anything and there's no sound and
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:42.320]  then they gave you a narrative to tell you what you were seeing that is a psi op propaganda
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.520]  technique folks that's what the fbi did now we have this other video which was taken inside with
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.960]  a cell phone by one of the occupants shawna cox you can see what's going on you can hear the
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:59.040]  shots you can see that they're shooting at him as they approached the uh illegal barricade there
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.440]  that violates organ state police policy you can see that they're shooting at him as he gets out of
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:10.880]  the vehicle and what they did was they shot him in the back three times uh the bullet in his lower
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:18.720]  back migrated up and hit several organs including his heart he died at the scene now in terms of what
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.600]  they're talking about with this they say that uh they started counting all the shots in the bullet
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.160]  holes and said wait a minute that doesn't account with all the the uh the testimony that we've got
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.240]  there's something up with this and so they started doing an investigation investigation showed
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.200]  that the fbi and state police jointly planned the operation when they learned through media reports
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.120]  that many of the occupation leaders would be on the road to john day two days later that's exactly
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.440]  what we said that's what stuart roge pointed out this was a political emergency this was a political
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:52.880]  threat it was not a violent threat to anybody it what these were not dangerous felons they were
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:59.200]  only dangerous to the establishment and as i said before when people start to exercise the
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.720]  first and second amendment together they can't handle that you know we had that uh open carry
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:11.040]  rally that was down at the alamo that was organized because the uh san antonio police
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.280]  were harassing people who were exercising their constitutional right to open carry to sling a
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.960]  rifle over their shoulder they did that to make a point they did that because so many people in
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:29.440]  our society now have become terrified of guns i'm old enough to remember when people drove around
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.800]  with guns in the back of their pickup trucks that everybody could see now everyone would call 9 11
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.400]  and they would set up a roadblock and shoot the person to death like the dead little boy finnecom
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.640]  that's really what would happen and uh so to stop that from happening to make the point
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.080]  to get people to not be afraid of seeing guns unless they're attached to a uniform
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.120]  let me let me digress again i remember when my sons were young in the early 90s and i wanted
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.920]  to get them some toy guns and we went to toys or us naively thinking that there would be something
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.720]  there other than some uh uh marketing uh things that were tied to some kind of a show or a movie
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:14.320]  we couldn't find any cowboy guns all we could do was uh if we wanted to and i did not do it i was
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:20.960]  not going to buy my kids a swat team assault uh thing an anti riot thing where they uh wear
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.880]  bulletproof vests and get billy clubs so they can pretend that they're beating each other for
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.240]  protesting i wasn't going to do that to them i mean we found some guns for them to play with uh
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.960]  but you know i grew up with the red right i'm the red rider generation you know out of uh
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.800]  christmas story anyway people are afraid of guns so what we had was this uh this
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.320]  demonstration there a thousand people showed up carrying guns police all over the place watching
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:53.520]  everybody nothing happened until until most of the protesters left when there's only a few protesters
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.480]  left the san antonia police started harassing people again i didn't see them arrest anybody
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.320]  but they come over and start harassing them talking to them getting in their face about it
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.680]  trying to provoke something and as my sons pointed out every time we go to an info wars
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.640]  protester rally the only time we get attacked is when there aren't people there carrying guns
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.040]  and the crowd of protesters that's the only time you don't get the pepper spray in your face
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.800]  that's the only time you don't get the billy club that's the only time that you don't get shot
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:28.000]  and jailed so when you show up lawfully carrying guns that's what happened in bunkerville people
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.160]  were fed up with the blm fed up with their unconstitutional bullying of people in the
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.720]  neighborhood putting a free speech area sign out in the middle of the desert free speech is in an area
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.800]  and so people were fed up with that they stood with their neighbors some of them were carrying
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.840]  guns holstered and for that the government wants to send people to jail for decades
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.640]  decades the bundies for decades said it was a threat to them well let's talk about what's
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.480]  going on now look at the way the new york times puts us out there's a headline police shooting
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:08.000]  of organ occupier declared justified but fbi faces an inquiry they say federal officials
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.760]  had opened an inquiry into the action of fbi agents for not disclosing that they also fired
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:17.200]  shots during the confrontation and they say that finnecombe got out and he was taunting officers
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.480]  well i guess that that justifies killing him then right you can't taunt an officer as a matter of
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:29.040]  fact when they tell you to do something bow down and worship at their feet they tell you to jump
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.480]  just ask them how high okay because otherwise they're justified in shooting you because that could
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.600]  get them scared they might think that you're somebody with a backbone then they talk about
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.960]  of course these are armed protesters i just mentioned that first and second amendment
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.840]  they say neither the shots by the fbi struck mr finnecombe investigators said but he was shot
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.480]  and killed by three rounds fired by the oregon state police all of which struck him in the back
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.400]  now the fbi agents that were shooting and lying about this are guess what the venerable hostage
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.520]  rescue team the same people lawn horyuchu remember randy weaver remember when they
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.040]  spent more money to uh surveil that situation than they spent before they invaded granada
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.640]  well they really did spend more time and money looking at that than they did the invading granada
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:22.480]  and then after they initiate that use of force against randy weaver and his wife we've got
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:30.000]  lawn horyuchu a member of the fbi hostage rescue team really just a sniper and a murderer
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.520]  her shot his wife vicki shot her square in the center of the head he shot her at point
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.400]  blank range for a sniper she was armed with a baby she had a baby in her hand
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:49.360]  slumped to the floor with a baby in her hand now gary spence the great lawyer
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.920]  got a uh got some money for randy weaver but you can never bring that back
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:02.160]  back that's something that should that should uh bother all of us it still bothers me
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.840]  but we got greg bright zing the special agent in charge of the organ officer the one who
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.440]  lied who put out this lying video who gave the lying narrative as he put out a silent low res
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.080]  video said here's what you're seeing here let me tell you what you're seeing okay he declined
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.920]  to say tuesday whether any of the fbi agents involved in the episode had been suspended but
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.680]  listen to this and this is even from the new york times but other law enforcement officials
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.400]  convinced that the two shots had come from the fbi said they were at a loss to explain why agents
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:38.800]  would deny responsibility why would they risk serious consequences because you see shooting
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.920]  at people would not be a problem shooting at unarmed civilians would be a problem but lying
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:50.160]  to the government now that's a problem you see see how this works you understand the system we
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.760]  live under lying to your government officers is a problem you can shoot people just tell us the
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.080]  truth about it not a problem okay and so one of the law enforcement officials who spoke on the
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:07.680]  condition of anonymity said why would they deny firing the shots that's the 64 000 question yeah
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.480]  it really is a question why does our government lie to us why does our government kill us
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.800]  and the voice that it comes to widow says i can hardly believe that a team of qualified law
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.240]  enforcement officers could look at the facts in this case and say that no criminal laws were
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.040]  violated how could they have reached this decision in face of the evidence it clearly shows intent
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:31.520]  intent to kill my husband i don't believe my husband felt he was going to be killed i think
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:38.240]  he had more faith in the government than that but clearly he was mistaken yeah yeah the uh
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:44.960]  yeah le boy fennecombe as little as he thought of the government he didn't think that they would
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.600]  shoot him down i can tell you that there were those of us at the bunny standoff that thought
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:57.360]  they would shoot there was a fox news photographer who didn't want to be with us he wasn't afraid
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.440]  of us okay he wasn't afraid of the reporters he wasn't afraid of the observers the protesters
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:09.680]  okay he was afraid of the blm and so i've got video of him on my phone he's walking toward
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.840]  the blm look i've got a camera lifting his shirt look i'm not armed don't shoot me don't shoot me
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.760]  as they were threatening us okay threatening to shoot us yeah those are the people he was afraid
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.120]  of and he wanted to get over on their side so he wouldn't get shot he wasn't afraid of all these
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.560]  dangerous people that our government is going around the country rounding up so they can throw
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:39.200]  into jail now when we come back we're going to talk about pre-crime we're going to talk about
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.320]  the fbis lies about the iphone and we're going to talk about how the drones entered into the

[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:15.200]  hour before he does i want to tie what i've been talking about with the protests in organ with the
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.240]  murder of the one of the protesters the arrest of the others and the attempted murder of many others
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.960]  by the government we now learn that the uh fbi agents involved lied about shooting at these
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:32.080]  protesters and the question is why would they lie that's what one law enforcement officer who
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.520]  requested to remain anonymous told the new york times said that's the 64 000 question yet is
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:44.000]  and it also is a question as to why that would be a bigger crime than the use of deadly force
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  against people who are not violent who are not felons who are not fleeing a situation like that
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.920]  who are going to a meeting and it was an ambush that was set up there i want to get to that but

[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.720]  don't want them to uh to ship it to take the time to ship it so i usually buy it here and i'm the one
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.280]  who runs out of stock on it so i know how that works out you can save 10 percent you can make
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.480]  sure that you never run out uh go to info wars life dot com sign up for the products that you
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.920]  use there on auto ship but again uh supermail vitality is now back in stock has been out of stock
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:09.760]  for a while as we look at this situation and of course there's a story on the dredge report
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.480]  today the pentagon admits a deployed military spy drones over the u.s this is a usa today report
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.360]  say the pentagon has deployed drones to spy over the u.s territory for non military missions
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:25.200]  over the past decade but the flights have been rare and lawful according to a report oh really
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:32.800]  really okay uh a senior policy analyst for the aclu jay stanley uh said that uh they hadn't found
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:38.000]  any legal violation yet well you know what i think the dragnet spying i think creating a an
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.640]  orwellian police state i think we need if there's not any laws for that there ought to be laws for
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.000]  that folks but they are violating laws left and right and we're talking about the fbi saying uh
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.720]  you know this this guardian article they say they can't unlock the sand bernadino iphone
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:27:00.080]  snowden says it's bs we've been told by uh john mackafee that it is bs we know they're just trying
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:06.080]  to establish a precedent because they're going to violate the fourth amendment one way the other
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:13.840]  they're just trying to give themselves some legal cover they're in cya mode and this is total bs
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:19.280]  okay now this they're going to say here it's important remember american people do find this
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.360]  to be a very very sensitive topic said the aclu lawyer yeah this is kind of uh light words for
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:31.280]  it fbi director robert muhler had testified before congress that the uh bureau employed spy drones to
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:39.120]  aid investigations back in 2013 he said right in a very very minimal way well listen after this
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.880]  happened at the bundy ranch standoff we had this article from curt nemo obama considered using
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:52.080]  military against bundy and the supporters and part of that was drones actually considered
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:57.120]  using them we had multiple reports and i'm sure that it is true uh it was reported at the time
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.720]  from doug hagman that they were using drones as military intelligence as surveillance as they
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.880]  are now admitting that they did he said a military assessment of satellite and drone surveillance
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.760]  imagery of the patriot resistance drones under the control of the u.s military were in use taking
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.320]  real-time photographic images of not just the activity at the ranch but identifying protesters
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.680]  any arms any supplies they might have or be carrying mission accomplished they monitored in
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:28.080]  real time video from the scene and as it was reported at the time at info wars dot com uh going
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.000]  back to a story that was by bill dirts writing for the washington times reported the obama
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.160]  administration considered using military force during the standoff between clive and bundy and
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:43.200]  the blm in nevada in april a 2010 pentagon authorization uh defense support of civil
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.560]  authorities issued in 2010 said u.s military commanders are provided emergency authority
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:55.280]  to use military arms and forces including drones and domestic unrest situations and he points out
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:01.920]  this was a direct uh conflict with a posse comet otis act written in 1878 prohibits the federal
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:07.200]  government from using federal military troops to enforce state laws they modified it they say
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:14.160]  under the ndaa act of 2007 that's not the one where they said well we can use the military to
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.920]  indefinitely detain anybody without charging them or finding them guilty we can just have the
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:25.120]  military arrest people and hold them forever that was the other ndaa then they went further in
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.720]  2010 they said well we this will be permitted under emergency authority without the use of the
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.560]  president even they were wise not to use it but folks we have to understand that when it comes to
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.800]  our freedoms we don't need to get into vigilante mode but we need to be ready to take a bullet
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.640]  we need to be ready to go to jail freedom is worth it stay with us we'll be right back
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:54.560]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:30:04.400]  400 us army soldiers at fort gordon georgia were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:09.920]  including a powerpoint presentation instructing the attendees or society attaches privilege to
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.200]  being white and male and heterosexual the slideshow obtained by judicial watch also informed the
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:20.560]  soldiers quote race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to african americans
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.440]  the white privilege training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere keeping
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.840]  different kinds of people from being valued accepted and appreciated but we act as if it
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.640]  doesn't exist this alleged privilege creates a yawning divide and income wealth and dignity the
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.200]  slideshow is suggested but obviously this white privilege training course helps perpetrate this
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.680]  racial divide in america by fueling racial tensions this very notion that you can group people into
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.000]  racial groups who have certain privileges is racist in itself because then you're not looking at people
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.720]  by their individual qualities but rather by their skin color which is inherently racist this is kit

[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:32.080]  ladies and gentlemen i'm alex jones your host you're co-hosting with david night and i'm
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:35.840]  going to be with you about 15 minutes into the next hour then david will be taking back over
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.360]  it'll also be popping in uh shum in the next 45 minutes with me and then of course we have rob
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:47.440]  do in force nightly news director will be hosting the fourth hour uh now again ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.200]  there's so much happening in the world but we see the globalist agenda taking the gloves off
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:58.400]  and just as yesterday the state department came out and said if you make jokes about anything
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.880]  or if anyone thinks something's offensive including the word you know man or woman it's
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.320]  the standard procedure that you can be uh fired so so this is the new terror we will take the
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.480]  food out of your mouth because we're so liberal and loving we will make you basically go on welfare
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.040]  and then later we can control that and take that away uh if you don't shut up and do what we say
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.360]  and we're going to set the bar so high that no one can follow it and then we'll selectively enforce
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:29.200]  on whoever we want and the bureaucracies of government and corporations and the whole
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:35.200]  psychiatric system and all these guilds will just suck in the the producers that are left
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.640]  and make us all pay tribute to them but that's in the final phase of the end of humans
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:47.440]  then they come in with the elite after humans have been made obsolete by bringing in robotics and
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:53.200]  systems not to empower us but to make us obsolete once you have the autocratic technotronic
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.000]  technocracy in place in their own words you won't have soldiers saying no to illegal orders anymore
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.800]  but before you can bring in that new system you have to destroy the family
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:10.720]  get rid of the rights of passages that men and women and children have you have to
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:18.880]  then go into the military itself if you're going to replace the systems with computers
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:26.400]  and robots and drones and automation you've got to make the army soldiers wear red high heels just
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:33.120]  to know what women feel like no that's to make you accept being jacked with and messed with and
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.280]  then we're going to tell you that you know if for your elementary school students that we're
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:45.120]  going to have talks to the boys and girls about well what sex they want to be or maybe no sex at
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.120]  all again as if the school the government has any place doing that is the end of parenting
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.280]  that they can do the most radical things they could do anything like for for synoculations say well
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:36:00.960]  well the school are now the parents be a favor tip that camera down a little bit thanks they can
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:09.840]  now sit there thank you they can now sit there and say things like your children have now decided
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:16.720]  that they're going to be inoculated they can have their own decisions that's what this is this is
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:22.640]  the end of the age of consent but so the government like pedophiles or crack dealers at the playground
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.440]  can come in and pray on your children because it you know there's not enough pray of adults that
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.640]  are dumbed down they want us to all be like children now they want to actually be able to
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.320]  have the wolves go right in and take control of the children at point like range that's what
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.840]  they're doing this is a total sick predator class that even the mid-level people are compartmentalized
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:47.360]  and by the narrative that it's for everyone's good and for the children and vote for Hillary
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:54.720]  because she's a woman all of this sticky sweet icing covers up the big block of cultural societal
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:02.240]  cyanide that is about a half inch beneath the surface but the icing itself is a slow poison
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.040]  and not a fast acting poison so even if you just lick the the the the the the top layer and don't
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:13.600]  really bite into it you still are stunned and kind of hobble off culturally and then we have to deal
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.200]  with all the culturally dead mindless people running around hysterically looking for fulfillment
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:26.000]  and go into their mecca of hollywood going to their mecca uh system and and begging uh you know
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.040]  for more and more of the same poison as if that would fulfill them that's what we have this story
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.960]  here the day that was covering earlier very important article from judicial watch documents
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:43.120]  reveal us army indoctrinated soldiers on danger of white privilege we reported last year that was
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.320]  going on but more documents on that so you learn how to wear red high heels you learn how to not
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.880]  carry a 60 pound pack with a 30 pound pack so women can be in there and then oh we just can't even
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.200]  have people in combat anymore because we can't have women being killed and then oh we've got to go to
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:05.840]  robots so that's what nanny states about can't have dodgeball can't have tag can't have playgrounds
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:12.160]  now most public schools across the country in elementary do not allow people to run on the
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:17.200]  playground now imagine we told somebody that 50 years ago they would laugh at you well you could
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.480]  break a bone you could skin a knee you could yeah but if you don't let kids go out and climb trees
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:29.360]  and stuff they will turn into totally weak screwed up jellyfish who's then been psychologically
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:33.920]  taught not about science not about culture not about literature not about history not about
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:40.960]  social skills not about the free market but how the i'm a woman or i'm a man or i'm a nerd or i'm
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.200]  black or i'm Hispanic or i'm this group and you and all these faux rights while the Pentagon goes
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:54.080]  yeah we do have drones watching yen but if you launch a half pound paper airplane with a small
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:39:00.960]  engine it's a 200 to 500 thousand dollar fine and how many years in prison in fact david let's
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.200]  in a moment have them pull up the i'm gonna give the exact number because just two weeks ago the law
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:12.320]  finally kicked in uh where it was a scale but the first offense was 200 something thousand dollars
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:19.920]  in long prison sentences oh yeah okay oh yeah so so what were the exact numbers on that day but
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.240]  i'm gonna go back into this news here and come back to you for drones yes for a criminal use of
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:30.800]  drones well here's the thing alex just for not registering it with the f a a it was a 27 thousand
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:37.920]  dollar uh 27 500 dollar fine and they could act they could uh put that against you as a civil
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:41.680]  action so they don't have to prove anything in court they just say hey you didn't you didn't
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:47.600]  register with us instantly bing here's your bill for 27 500 it's asset for virtual seizure no judge
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.680]  no jury no nothing and then what was the 200 thousand one actually launching one yeah if they
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.320]  say that you're uh using it criminally in other words it's let's say you were flying it too close
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.840]  to an airport that would be up to three years in jail and i believe the fine was 250 thousand dollars
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.920]  max but but i mean notice the way they define it in the article and the law though just launching
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:11.680]  one without the uh tail number is criminal yeah absolutely absolutely and so then also selling
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.520]  them they're saying is criminal and then next they're saying so it's just a regulation that they've
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:21.680]  you know blank written to the government just like obama care or tpp they're saying oh we may
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.440]  make the possession of felony yeah so of course they can also you know they can restrict a lot
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  of these drone manufacturers have already restrict these things with geotagging so they won't fly
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.920]  into certain areas and they and they take this all the way down to a half pound plane it's absolutely
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.040]  absurd and this shows where everything's going with the smart house the smart car the smart book
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.080]  the smart phone it's all got tech they can hit a switch and suddenly your iphone or droid then
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.040]  to shoot video at a concert or the police and they admit they're putting up their own cell towers
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:57.600]  not to just grab our data but to communicate with all the devices that have trojans to ensure that
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.880]  we then can't respond so it's another checkmate on free speech built into everything premeditatedly
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.840]  in this global architecture which they admit is real now all out in the open
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:15.760]  so so we've gone from there are no secret societies to yes they run things there are no
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.200]  super mega banks the fellow reserves not private that they now admit it's private
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:25.600]  they now admit on the news that the government basically you know is run by foreign interest
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:32.000]  it is so wild now the normalization process that the establishment is going through
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.880]  just to condition us to all of this army indoctrination of soldiers on the danger of white
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.520]  privilege isn't that just cute and the Pentagon admits military spy drones over USA which has
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.720]  been going on for at least six seven years and now it's massive it was in local papers that
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.000]  homeland security was being loaned to the states to go surveil people building barns on their property
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.360]  that they weren't supposed to under the new rules so our military hardware we paid for
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.800]  isn't there to stop people coming across the border any of that no it's here to watch us
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.120]  and to keep track of us because they know they're bringing in policies and Alex you know what
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:14.000]  concerns me about this even more is what we're about to have happen in the next year so we're
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.680]  going to see regulations from the federal department of transportation uh mandating vehicle to vehicle
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:25.200]  communication devices in our cars and vehicle to infrastructure communication we're talking about
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.560]  this they want to talk about the drones i just mentioned the fact that hey we reported the time
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.720]  of the bunny ranch standoff they were talking about using drones militarily against the people
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.080]  that were there and they sit there and they make the debate where we keep saying we're telling
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.840]  the truth instead of saying hey this is wrong we shouldn't do it so we criticize it they'll
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.600]  have the news say it isn't happening and they'll have the same news say it is happening but it's
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.440]  good that's what George Arwell called crime stop or double think in 1984 now also coming up the next

[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:36.720]  to me what white men can't jump or the fact that white people can't dance i went to a white
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.200]  disco recently and i watched the white people dance y'all y'all can't dance
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:51.200]  or the fact that white privilege can literally keep you from being poor when you're white you
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:58.080]  don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto you don't know what it's like to be poor now we're
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:02.000]  gonna go talk to some people and see how their white privilege is working out for them that as
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.600]  you know that because you have white privilege uh you can't be poor that's what uh bernie sanders
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.400]  was saying i'm saying he's full of shit i've been poor for five years of my life i've been out here
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:18.080]  on the streets five years you don't know what it's like to be poor he's wrong i mean you could be
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:23.600]  poor regardless of who you are if you're white i think you have a special privilege because you're
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:31.520]  white that's some bullshit i mean b u l l s h i t bullshit mr sanders should suck that's true
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:38.160]  you can't be poor and be white so your white privilege hasn't put a home over your head no
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:41.840]  i'm not lying to you mr obama went to his desk and looked at something they took a picture
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.160]  he can have it all it hasn't kept you warm when it was cold no it hasn't kept you cold when it was

[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:14.000]  yeah did he say that yeah but he must admit that if he said it bernie said that yeah but you believe
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.520]  that the hell no white people fucked up all niggas bernie sanders is an asshole when he took color
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.920]  into the mix because if everybody was stripped down and didn't have hair on their body we'd all
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.640]  look the same so bernie sanders you can kiss my i mean i'm taking this button off so where y'all

[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:35.360]  uh or i know he's got tons of news to get into and go over the big issue obviously david is
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:41.280]  russia threatening to send troops into north korea for the folks that don't know russia is very
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:46.320]  very close to north korea and actually has rail lines going into north korea and is able to invade
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:51.520]  north korea north korea is threatening nuclear terror uh and it was bill clinton that gave them
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.920]  the nuclear reactors that they admittedly built the bombs with that was a huge controversy at 96
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:01.840]  and uh through through through 2000 during his second term and i'm making a big deal out of it
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.840]  being called a conspiracy terrorist even though they admitted those reactors should be made for that
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.680]  this is the elite that claim they want world government to stabilize things and they claim
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:14.240]  they're scared of donald trump that he'll start world war three or he's a fascist because he doesn't
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.960]  want war with russia uh so what i'm getting at here is these elite claim they're stabilizing the
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.720]  world with drones and our refrigerators spying on us and breaking up our families and all the gmo
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:30.240]  and the glyphosates and the and the inoculations but really all they're doing is creating more
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  crises because they've set up systems to gain more power out of crises but in their march to get
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.880]  total power which they've almost got they've built a system that's just designed on fraud and is
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.680]  collapsing uh and it's a very very frightening time quite frankly to be alive especially when
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:50.160]  you realize how ignorant the public is uh but uh your brief comment and i'm going to play this uh
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:56.560]  uh part of the montage video uh the most powerful donald trump video yet ever where he is a unifier
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.720]  and a unifier of the people against the establishment and against the insiders that's why they're so
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:08.320]  scared uh your take on it yeah of course alex uh as you pointed out many times uh you know war
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.600]  for profit uh has has been war has been one of the main ways that these families like the ross
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.520]  childs have made their money has been the ways that the banks have made their monies they supported
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:24.640]  uh the nazis uh as well as sending linen in with a train sealed with 10 million dollars in gold bars
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:29.280]  to start the russian revolution so the same time they're supporting uh the communists and starting
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.200]  that russian revolution they're they're also supporting uh the nazis and of course the bush
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.280]  family was involved in that and this is their program i want to talk more about this when we
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.160]  come back i'm gonna go out to break with part of donald trump the unifier here it is got some
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:48.320]  questions for you mr trump you've done great things in your life and i just wonder how do i
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:55.040]  as an average person begin well first of all never think of yourself as average you started off with
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:59.840]  the wrong question because you're not average you've got a lot going i see you're smart i see you're
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.560]  very beautiful what we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.240]  and to make up their own minds about him and they they they find out that he's not the person
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:16.640]  that the media has depicted him to be i support donald trump and everybody knows everybody knows

[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:16.480]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:22.240]  you see they hate donald front because he's an alpha male he's aggressive and he believes in
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:26.640]  humanity and he believes in others and they call that narcissism and that's why the media pushes
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:31.920]  this idea that if you're confident you're strong you like yourself you like others you don't need
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:37.040]  the psychologist you don't need madison avenue you don't need wall street you don't need the image
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:42.160]  makers in hollywood to make you feel insecure so you've got to buy their image their worldview
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.440]  i mean is there some context to the psychological systems that are out there sure and it's just
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:52.320]  wide as the rainbow as the colors the rainbow some of us good some of us bad some of it makes sense
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:57.200]  some of it doesn't they set themselves up as the new priesthood though and they use psychology to
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.360]  dumb the culture down in the media not the average psychologists or psychiatrists but
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:07.680]  the dominant system is about social control as it was in russia as it was in germany as it is here
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:17.840]  today and they hate a donald trump type because see a real narcissist in the classical sense doesn't
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.160]  care about other people doesn't give tips doesn't believe in others and isn't even a real person
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:27.760]  themselves just has this fake image of themselves that they're invincible they're great i have on
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:34.000]  the street before running to people and i have been interviewed by psychology today and they
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.520]  say to you and i've had psychologists walk up and go you're a narcissist and i tell you and they're
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.600]  like oh yeah you claim you have all these listeners you don't have that or you claim that you can
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.800]  change the world you you can't do that and what they're saying is we aren't on the playing field
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.360]  that's what psychology today was asking me so you think you can change the world you think there's
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:56.560]  corrupt forces you think that you can see things that are going on i'm like i can read a bill and
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.360]  hear them lying about it on tv yeah they want you to just give up believe you have no power and so
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:06.800]  it's the spirit of donald trump the fact that he is optimistic he does believe in america
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.800]  he's got his own issues nobody's perfect scares them because they're busy telling us
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:18.320]  families are bad men are bad you know loving god is bad only the state only them words are bad
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.880]  language is bad these people are absolutely out of control so i'm gonna play more of the video
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:28.400]  but it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com uh the the the full video we're put on
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.800]  facebook twitter i want to go viral is this the most powerful donald trump video ever
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:36.800]  and i think it really is and we need to air the whole thing on the night news tonight
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.680]  because it needs to go viral we need commentary on it you know because it really shows what he
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:47.440]  was saying 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago and he's there in power people i always tell
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:51.680]  listeners don't call him tell me how great i am because i know you're just as great as i am if
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.920]  you ever figured out the power you had and wanted to learn about the real world they just want you
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:00.560]  to stay in a rest of development like a little kid in the seventh grade that feels insecure and bullied
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.240]  we don't need any more education from the establishment no dark sarcasm in the classroom
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.600]  and then meanwhile these the these government controllers go home and get beaten within inches
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.560]  of their lives by their fat and psychopathic wives that's an art type of the whole deal
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:21.520]  we want to empower everybody to not have a top-down nanny state david night take us out to break with
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:27.200]  your view on what i was just saying yeah you know alex i'm looking at some of these articles about
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.160]  this is one that was on drudge report the undemocratic democratic party they're talking about how rigged
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:37.280]  this election is and of course we have 538 saying donald trump would be easy to stop if they had
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:43.040]  democrat rules the article that talks about how rigged this process is points out that we've
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:48.800]  got these distinguished members understand what's going on in the democrat party 10 000 voters
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:55.920]  equals one distinguished member that's the kind of of a disparity that we've got here you've got
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.480]  the people who pride themselves on being democrats who pride themselves on being socialists it's
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:07.360]  animal form yeah exactly what we've got here is crony democracy okay you want to talk about crony
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.560]  capitalism because you hate capitalism i understand crony capitalism is not capitalism it's not
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.440]  free market free market is a better term let's understand that and so crony capitalism is
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.840]  gangsterism exactly it's a gangsterism but they like to use that word capitalism because it gives
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:26.960]  it a kind of negative connotation to anything that's capitalism but understand democrats understand
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:32.960]  bernie sanders supporters of what you've got here is crony socialism crony statism you want to put
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:39.680]  everything in the state what it really is exactly statism fascism package is socialism or or i mean
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:44.720]  it's it's all bull david stay there come back let's talk more about that theme and then how we
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:49.680]  shadow the paradigm about the globalist model of full spectrum dominance we're going to define
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:54.800]  what that really is our definition groundbreaking you're creating our own terms our own lenses
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:05:00.800]  outside of the prescribed orthodoxy of hollywood in the last democratic debate we learned that
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:07.040]  there are no poor white people and that hillary clinton single-handedly saved the auto industry
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:14.000]  what will we learn this time around first they wouldn't debate at all then only during nfl playoff

[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:08.640]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:18.080]  when you look at what the entire culture is doing is trying to con people
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:23.840]  and it's designed top-down the globalists admit this plan and just as David Knight briefly chimed
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:29.760]  in last hour when i was going over different subjects the elite fund hitler and they found
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:34.880]  the soviets on record we're gonna get to the Rothschilds the family that famously funded
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:39.680]  napoleon and the british empire and then double crossed the british empire even as they gave them
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:44.400]  the victory over napoleon crashing the stock market claiming napoleon had won this is all
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.120]  part of history it's full spectrum dominance you think of us fighting the russians or fighting
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:57.520]  al-qaeda or fighting whatever meanwhile our elite that took us over took russia over in 1917 and
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:03.440]  installed the communist the russians have thrown them out doesn't mean russia is perfect but that's
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.240]  why they're the most hated by the globalists because they're actually someone independent
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:12.160]  china's made all these deals with the globalists to install communism and to leverage out the rest
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:18.640]  of the world using free market basically human robots hardworking chinese people smart and genius
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:23.120]  you're some of the most competitive in the world under a communist model to leverage out destroy
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:29.680]  the rest of the free world it's a billion plus slaves it's not communism doesn't exist i mean
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.760]  they've had a master plan folks then and then the chinese elite now they're ready to try to double
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:40.160]  cross the angle american establishment this is full spectrum dominance where you ship the narcotics in
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:45.120]  on record have the big banks want the money and then bust the low-level people when they use the
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.800]  drugs put them in the private prison itself owned in part or an old by the big mega bank that actually
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:57.360]  owns and leases the aircraft that fly the drugs in the aircraft that get busted are the cartels and
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:02.240]  smaller groups that don't play ball and i told you that 20 something years ago everybody else
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.560]  has been declassified now they make movies like cicara was that he pronounced it in spanish
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:12.640]  and he's hit man what excellent film so accurate as the end the cia is knocking out the last
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.240]  cartel they don't control and they go you know we run the drugs we we control the cartels and and the
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:25.200]  the fdi agent lady is like what but it's like no now you're smart she goes oh i get it and it's
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:30.720]  like so evil i expect him to come out admit that kidnap kids next and actually torture him to death
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.480]  and just go well we do it to make sure the wrong people don't and that's what brazinski wrote in
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:41.600]  the technotronic era he actually wrote in the technotronic era uh back in the 70s one of the
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:46.240]  first books i read on geopolitics when i was like 12 years old because my dad had talked about it
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:51.440]  on the bookshelf and he said no the elites run the drugs and run the organized crime and run
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:57.200]  all forms of evil and that's how we control it to keep order see they're sick thinking see there's
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:02.720]  i mean they write books on this okay this is a fact but 99 of people in government corporations
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:07.040]  don't know it we're all these goody two shoes controlled by this fake leftist cosmology how
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.880]  do you describe full spectrum dominance and how do we get this paradigm into the general populations
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.520]  understanding david you got about three minutes here and we're going to go to this report where the
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:23.200]  Rothschilds are in trouble but no one knows about it because they've shut it down uh david night
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:27.120]  alex you know full spectrum dominance is unfolding before our very eyes here in this election we had
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:31.760]  these stories that came out yesterday secret meeting tech ceo's and top republicans plot
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:38.080]  to uh to stop trump and we see bloomberg saying paul ryan's house agenda being upended by trump
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:42.480]  they're worried about that what what is his agenda of course his agenda is full spectrum
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.040]  dominance we saw this in the last election with romney and obama both of them were going to push
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:52.080]  through uh obama care they had both signed on that now what we've got two different parties fake
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.880]  choice for carol crickley won't the illusion of choice but no real choice and so now we've got
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:02.640]  these trade treaties we've got the open borders we've got the climate treaty what did paul ryan do
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:06.960]  three days after they passed the climate treaty in paris and and you had some republicans saying
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:11.280]  well we're going to have a say about that well yeah their say was to fully fund it within three days
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.560]  with the omnibus bill okay that's their agenda and so now you see as we as all these people are
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:21.680]  coming together that the silicon valley uh billionaires as well as the geop establishment and you
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:27.360]  got the news cozying up to hillary clinton having you know making friends with her on uh you know
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.240]  fox news maybe they'll add her to fox and friends or whatever but they're also yeah they've been
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.560]  going anti-gun on fox now yeah yeah at the same time they're doing this you know we've got uh
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.760]  rupert murdoch giving her the maximum uh donation personal donation at a party you've got rupert
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.800]  murdoch and roger ailes even the new york times is talking about how they met together and plotted
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:51.760]  with chuck schumer and marco rubio with a gang of eight to push amnesty through and let's expand on that
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:56.640]  let's expand on that because that's so key how they control the libertarian conservative movement
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:01.760]  is everybody wants to be on fox yeah so they have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:07.760]  that aren't employees but are on the payroll as basically correspondence or to provide coverage
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:12.880]  almost every every name you know is paid by them and when they pay you even 50 grand a year but
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.200]  but you still want to be on air to sell your books and you know be a celebrity to your wife or whatever
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:22.080]  or your husband you know so grandma thinks you're cool they call you up and say don't go on alex
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:27.600]  jones' show don't push this don't we're not going to let you on the next few weeks uh you know to
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:32.240]  promote this i mean i know the inside baseball that they don't have those people all paid to
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:36.320]  actually have a bunch of people to cover stuff they've got way more than they need they've got
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.600]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds on payroll who might go on once a month but just so they've got
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.960]  them under contract to control them this is sick it's full spectrum dominance it's mania
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:51.840]  factured consent oh absolutely and when we look at this meeting we've got all these house leaders
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.600]  of course you've got mich mcconnell you got paul ryan you got the new up and coming stars like

[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.040]  government indicted barron david diroth child for embezzling large sums of money from british
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:08.880]  pensioners from 2005 to 2008 and for the violation of inheritance tax laws in june of 2015 paris
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:15.280]  based judge javier bermudez ruled that barron rothschild of the rothschild financial services group
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:21.040]  must face a trial for his crimes that is if they can find him in one of his many mansions
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:27.040]  scattered around france now the french government has opened another investigation into the swiss
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:33.920]  rothschild's unit bloomberg reports the swiss unit of edmund diroth child said it's the subject of
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:39.520]  a french probe regarding a former business relationship managed by a former employee
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:44.640]  edmund diroth child is actively participating in the criminal investigation underway the
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:50.880]  geneva-based bank said in an emailed statement on friday edmund diroth child a private banking
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:59.440]  and asset management firm established in paris in 1953 oversees about 150 billion euros or 164
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:06.160]  billion dollars and is led today by barron benjamin diroth child and his wife arian from a harrette's
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:12.000]  interview six years ago barron benjamin diroth child was quoted as saying the united states is
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:19.920]  finished at least for the moment and i do not believe in god i do not report to him the roth child
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:25.840]  family is so wealthy they don't regularly appear on any forbes list of the world's wealthiest and
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:30.480]  when they do their true wealth is minimized their fortune would embarrassingly dwarf the
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:35.920]  multi-billions of bill gates or warren buffett the rothschild story is precariously embedded in
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:40.880]  the footnotes of world history nathan rothschild became the largest debtor to the bank of england
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:46.880]  until the bank was privatized in 1946 however although the bank of england is state-owned
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:53.040]  97 of the uk's money supply is still privately controlled in the form of interest-bearing loans
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:58.560]  created by the rothschild dominated commercial banks the rothschild's modern manipulation of
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:04.240]  the british economy is clearly evident in this clip demonstrating queen elizabeth's inquiry
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:17.760]  into the downturn of the british economy and after a brief explanation another question this time
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:25.920]  from the juke the queen's question was finally answered by rothschild lackeys four years later
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:30.400]  after the queen personally had to visit the bank of england to get an answer the indictment of a
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:35.760]  rothschild is not simply another dirty banker being brought to justice the imprisonment of
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.840]  part of the controlling interest of civilization could gradually snowball meaning a stop to
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:49.360]  endless wars illegal mass surveillance debt slavery and a luciferian cultural agenda basically
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:55.680]  peace on earth a bit much you say the rothschild's finance both sides of the napoleonic wars the
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:01.520]  american revolution the communist party revolution in russia the little known balfour declaration
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:08.640]  the nazi party the creation of the federal reserve 911 and the wars that followed the rothschild's
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:15.200]  own roiders and the associated press and are the hidden hand controlling all media have you
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:20.720]  heard about this in the mainstream news they either own or have compromised every us and european
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:26.320]  political puppet with an elitist passion for worshiping lucifer and an unyielding obsession
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:33.040]  to decrease the world population by 90 by legal means means the rothschilds are on the verge of
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:39.600]  completely acquiring via the united nations the ultimate advantage listen to this that the
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:51.760]  creditor has over a king or president is that if the ruler gets out of line the banker can finance
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:19:01.120]  his enemy or his rival therefore if you want to stay in the lucrative financing business
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:08.720]  of kings and governments it is wise to have an enemy or a rival waiting in the wings
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:16.400]  to unseat every king or every president to whom you lend money if the king doesn't
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:25.520]  have an enemy you got to be able to create one yes for centuries now there truly has been a global

[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:29.440]  at info wars life.com here's one of the stories that came up and I loved this title on politico
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:38.000]  GOP establishment creeps toward crews yeah we we see now the GOP establishment creeps
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:45.200]  are now moving toward crews the usual suspects folks they say Ted is the only possibility to
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:52.480]  stop trump says a bush loyalist let me tell you something Ted Cruz is a bush loyalist
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:27:00.000]  he and Heidi met inside the bush administration they are phony outsiders they're not they're not
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:05.680]  they're insiders folks they're posing as outsiders okay they're involved with Goldman
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:10.240]  sacks and the banks are running through this agenda he has no problem with these trade treaties
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:15.360]  uh I would seriously doubt that he's got any problems with the open borders they've gone
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:20.640]  back and forth with this but notice who Jeff sessions senator sessions endorsed it was Donald
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:27.120]  trump not Ted Cruz and that is the issue that and these trade treaties and the loss of sovereignty
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:34.560]  I trust senator sessions judgment he is the only one who looked at these treaties Ted Cruz didn't
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:42.720]  Ted Cruz voted for the TPA the trade promotion authority what was that that was a way to make
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:46.720]  sure that these trade treaties would get passed so when you voted for that you were essentially
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:52.480]  voting for these trade treaties you were also voting to subvert the constitutional process
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:58.240]  to ratify treaties and that applies not only to the trade treaties but to the climate treaties as
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:05.920]  well why would they subvert the process for passing a treaty because they want to make
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:10.160]  sure that it passes by all means it's just like when we look at these metrics this this article
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:15.200]  that's on dredge report today the undemocratic democratic party talking about how the system
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:20.080]  is rigged with these super delegates these distinguished members and they point out in
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:25.200]  non-political speak distinguished members who are some of the super delegates are really democrat
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:30.960]  political insiders dc power brokers not everyday voters and as i pointed out with alex jones when
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.440]  you look at some of the states we look at new hampshire bernie sanders one new hampshire
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:42.080]  he got about the same number of votes as hillary clinton did and when you look at the number of
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:48.320]  delegates that he took him it took him 10 000 voters to get a single delegate and so you really
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.320]  can say that 10 000 voters equals one of these distinguished members and they point out in this
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:58.240]  article when you remove elected officials from the super delegate pool at least one and seven
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:06.160]  of the remainders are former or current lobbyists and so when they look at this when 538 which is
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:11.600]  associated with new york times uh democrats when the republicans look at this they what are they
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:16.160]  what are they saying about this they're saying wow you know gee they uh the voters republicans
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:21.200]  and democrats are really upset with us maybe uh we're not giving them what they want uh you know
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:28.800]  hey they're not serving you okay they don't see you as customers they don't care what you want
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:35.520]  these are pigs at a trough okay and they want to just make sure that nobody else muscles end
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:40.800]  that you don't get a piece of the pie so they want to change the rules they want to do anything they
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:46.480]  can to shut you down to keep you under their foot they're not going to do it stay with us we'll be
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:54.400]  right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:04.400]  400 us army soldiers at fort gordon georgia were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:09.920]  including a powerpoint presentation instructing the attendees or society attaches privilege to
[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:15.120]  being white and male and heterosexual the slideshow obtained by judicial watch also informed the
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:20.560]  soldiers quote race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to african americans
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:25.440]  the white privilege training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere keeping
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:30.160]  different kinds of people from being valued accepted and appreciated but we act as if it doesn't
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:35.200]  exist this alleged privilege creates a yawning divide and income wealth and dignity the slideshow
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:39.840]  suggested but obviously this white privilege training course helps perpetrate this racial divide
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:44.320]  in america by fueling racial tensions this very notion that you can group people into racial groups
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:48.160]  you have certain privileges is racist in itself because then you're not looking at people by
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:52.720]  their individual qualities but rather by their skin color which is inherently racist this is kit

[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:34.880]  and apple and facebook and tesla elon musk uh all meeting together with geop establishment saying
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:39.440]  what happened guys you screwed up you know these rules were supposed to keep them out you know
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:43.840]  keep out the rabble the people who aren't part of the secret clubs and the secret societies one of
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:48.960]  them is sneaking in on his own dime you know we set up this system where uh you couldn't afford
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:54.960]  to do this unless we supported you unless we gave you the money we never thought of one of us a
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:00.560]  billionaire would do this come on let's stop this and of course this is what they are trying to stop
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:06.720]  we understand this they're trying to stop the globalist they're trying to stop someone who's
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:10.480]  going to pose them on these treaties a trade treaties a climate treaties and the open borders
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:15.440]  that's the game right now and on that issue i believe we can trust donald trump because he's
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:21.040]  talked about this for 35 years he on his own dime or i should say a hundred thousand dollars
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:26.320]  he took out ads in new york papers new york times talking about and complaining about
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:31.520]  the trade deals and so you may or may not agree with him on a lot of other issues and you know
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:36.720]  when we look at things i look at uh i had somebody that sent me a twitter uh this thing last night
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:42.160]  said you know i agree with you on the trade stuff and everything but i really find it hard to trust
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:49.280]  donald trump i gotta say to you and that's what i said to him on twitter i said don't trust trump
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:56.000]  don't trust anybody you know that's the motto of ted he puts this thing up trust ted trust ted
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:02.640]  okay no don't trust ted don't trust trump don't trust i'm gonna tell you what our founders said
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:10.160]  okay patrick henry the guy who valued liberty above everything okay said guard uh regard with
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:16.800]  suspicion anybody who approaches the precious jewel of liberty okay anybody that is put in a
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.040]  position of this kind of power and they didn't allow anybody to have the kind of power we have
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:26.720]  given to a president today that's part of what has to change and we have to take that power back
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:32.160]  at the state and local level i've got a couple of articles here showing that there's some good news
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:37.200]  on that front a couple of articles from the new americans south carolina house passes a bill
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:42.240]  nullifying new federal firearm restrictions another one wyoming to pass a bill to reform
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:48.720]  civil asset forfeiture let's understand civil asset forfeiture is just outright theft and highway
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:53.280]  robbery because that's usually where it takes places on the highway uh robbing people that's
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:59.120]  something that came from our beloved conservative president ronald reagan civil asset forfeiture
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.000]  saying hey we can we don't have to convict you of a crime to take your property and violation of the
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.080]  constitution we don't have to convict you of anything as a matter of fact we're not even
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:13.920]  going to charge you with anything we're going to charge your car or your airplane or your home
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:20.160]  whatever inanimate object that we would like to take from you we will charge that inanimate
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:24.480]  object with the crime and since that's an inanimate object it doesn't have constitutional
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:30.400]  guarantees that a person has therefore we can steal it from you okay that was what our beloved
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:35.360]  ronald reagan put in place and every democrat and republican president since then has been
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:40.480]  fine with that now we have some state legislatures that are saying no we're not going to allow that
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:46.320]  that's how we take this back we fight at the state and local level we get people to understand what
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.400]  their power is as jurors and we say you're not going to railroad people you're not going to
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:54.000]  send them to jail for these things you're not we don't agree with the penalty even if we agree
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.880]  with the law we don't agree with the way you're doing this we're not going to send these people
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:02.000]  to jail that's the way they stopped alcohol prohibition initially and of course this whole
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:07.920]  drug wars i've mentioned many many times doesn't have any constitutional support for where is the
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:13.120]  constitutional amendment that gives them the authorization to prohibit anything not pot
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:19.120]  not your medical cancer drugs nothing do they have the power to prohibit unless they have a
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.160]  special amendment like they gave themselves that power with alcohol and then took it away
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:29.360]  we have two amendments in the constitution that testify the fact in addition to the ninth and
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:34.160]  tenth amendment we have two more that show in practical application the government has no
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:39.200]  authority for prohibition of any sort but of course they want to take away guns guns which
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:44.480]  are specifically protected now there's been a lot of talk about ted cruz especially saying you know
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:49.680]  donald trump he's going to take your guns he's going to point judges who will take your guns
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:55.600]  he's not a gun guy well i want to read you something that his son said donald trump jr
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:00.480]  this was on bright barton he said between myself and my brother and my father my wife
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:08.240]  we have four of the 1500 concealed carry permits for new york city one of the most difficult
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:13.760]  carry licenses to get anywhere in the world certainly in the us okay now understand that
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:18.800]  think about that think about the fact that ronald reagan many people said hey you know ronald reagan
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:25.360]  he was pro-abortion before he became pro-life he was a member of a union head and so forth and so on
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:29.840]  this guy really a conservative that was the line of attack against ronald reagan when he was running
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:34.880]  and you know quite frankly ronald reagan did betray us on the second amendment as well as on
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:40.240]  these other issues i was just talking about and he joined with the nra of all people to push the
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:46.960]  brady bill that was wrong wait wait did you do that he threw the american people and the constitution
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:55.040]  under the bus in order to do a favor for brady's wife that he felt bad about the fact that brady
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:59.680]  got shot okay so that's a payoff it's like hey i'm sorry here let me throw the constitution will
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.120]  that make you feel better let me throw the constitution on the bus do you feel better
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:07.040]  now sarah brady okay no it's not enough oh you want me to do more i don't know if i can do
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:11.520]  any more but we'll see what we can do all right going back to what he's saying now he points out
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:17.920]  and this is important because you know ronald reagan uh didn't have a concealed carry license
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:23.520]  in california did he when he became uh before he became president he never got a concealed carry
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:28.960]  license donald trump has actually exercised that right he actually has a concealed carry as he points
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:34.320]  out four of the 1500 concealed carry permits in all of new york city with millions of people what is
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:39.520]  it six million people in new york city seven million people and only 1500 concealed carry permits
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:43.600]  and four of them are in the trump immediate family then he points out this is true so it's the same
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.720]  thing about san bernadino paris that we said he says if you recall san bernadino if you recall paris
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:54.000]  he's one only one of those pro second amendment candidates that said the very next day hey california
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.320]  france toughest gun laws in the world if there were bullets going the other way maybe this would
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:03.280]  have been a game changer maybe something different would have happened okay and then he said something
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:09.120]  else which i think really shows they understand the issue he also spoke about how his father donald
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.920]  trump if he becomes president gun laws will change so the concealed carry permits are valid in all
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:19.360]  states and not just select ones he says why can't you get a driver's licenses recognize state to
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:25.360]  state but a concealed weapons permit is not treated the same way there is a process to do that in a
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:30.960]  trump administration because it makes sense and of course it was virginia recently if you remember
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.920]  terry mccullough a clinton operative uh campaign manager whatever you know just a political operative
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:40.640]  who became a governor there okay and his attorney general decided that they were going to unilaterally
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:47.120]  not recognize concealed carry permits for 25 states some of the states that have more stringent
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:54.880]  checks and controls and concurrent or continuous validation of of a people's status than virginia
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:58.720]  did they just said well we're not going to recognize it and there was a huge pushback
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:05.280]  at the state level at the state level you had state legislators in virginia said yo yeah he's
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:11.680]  right if he's so afraid of guns i don't want to scare him by having armed men protect him so
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:16.000]  maybe what we should do is just remove the governor's protective detail and you know what
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:22.400]  they reversed that they said never mind never mind we'll respect the concealed carry permits
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:28.480]  but again i think that uh he's solid on it and when we look at the GOP establishment moving
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:36.800]  towards cruise as this article headline political GOP establishment creeps towards cruise uh he is
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:42.480]  they they cite a bush loyalist saying this is the way we stop donald trump look they came out
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:50.400]  with people that are obviously establishment people people like jeb jeb you're a mess like jeb
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:57.200]  like john casick other people nobody wants them it's a kiss a kiss of death to be associated with
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:03.040]  the establishment mitt romney cuts ads for rubio everywhere what happens he comes in fourth
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:08.640]  pretty much everywhere you can't even break up double digits in some of these states because
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:15.440]  romney is supporting him it's a kiss of death to be part of the establishment so why they do
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:20.320]  you know these guys uh crashed and burned jeb casick other people that were associated with
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:26.080]  the establishment rubio they tried to push him as well and while all these guys are going especially
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:33.680]  with rubio rubio i believe is acting as a stalking horse distracting people while you've got the real
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:39.760]  insider ted cruise and the establishment coalescing around him yeah he threw a lot of bombs at people
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:46.080]  people in the senate hate him why because he climbed over their backs as soon as he got elected
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:51.040]  as senator it's like hey i ain't waiting my turn and he starts you know throwing them under the bus
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:55.920]  criticizing them publicly climbing over their back the minute he got elected senate he wasn't
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:59.920]  interested in being a senator he was interested in being president he immediately started running
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:05.360]  for president he hasn't done a thing he hasn't even come close to finishing a term and he's
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:09.360]  running for president that's why they hate him in the senate they don't hate him because he stands
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:15.440]  for us they hate him because he's a social climber he's climbing over them but now they say oh we
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:20.000]  need to we need to consolidate around him you know maybe he's got uh he's got these goldman sacks
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:26.720]  connections and you know he tried to hide his loan from goldman sacks uh look folks he's a phony
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:33.360]  libertarian he said that snowden was a hero now he says snowden as a trader should be executed okay
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:38.880]  he's a phony constitutionalist he supports the war on drugs he doesn't care about eligibility
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:43.840]  you know if he thinks he's eligible i don't think he's eligible large tribe who's his professor at
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:47.760]  harvard doesn't think he's eligible you know this is a guy who's a northeastern establishment guy
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:53.600]  went to harvard he went to princeton he's a master debate guy at princeton you know you don't he's
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:57.920]  not he's an establishment guy he worked for the bushes that's where he and heidi worked
[02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:02.480]  she works for the council in foreign relations for uh the goldman sacks and everything i mean
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:09.920]  come on she's part of a cfr organization there with robert zealock world trade bank you know the
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:14.960]  world bank and and goldman sacks where they come up with a plan for the north american union
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:18.720]  we have a common border going around the three countries they don't see it as a problem that
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:24.240]  he's from canada he could be the north american union candidate the north american union president
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:30.480]  okay yeah he's born in canada so what doesn't make any difference canada is the same as the us now
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:35.680]  right isn't it it is in their mind you may not understand it but it is in their mind
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:42.320]  and you know if he thinks that he's a constitutionally eligible to run for office and fine explain it
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:47.760]  to us but you see how he operates in the debates when donald trump calls him on and he says hey
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:52.960]  i've argued before the supreme court i know what the constitution says well fine tell us make your
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:59.920]  case make your case tell us why you're not uh tell us why you're eligible as a natural born
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:05.120]  citizen explain to us you know the word is not defined the phrase is not defined in the constitution
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.840]  any more than the word militia is defined in the constitution we understand what the militia was
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:14.960]  how do we know what the militia was well we look at the commentaries it was well understood
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:18.960]  all of the people who were writing it at the time they understood what the militia was it was a term
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.480]  that fell out of favor uh fell out of well fell out of use i should say now it has fallen out of
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:30.480]  favor it's been demonized by the government that's a deliberate thing they've tried to change the
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:36.800]  meaning of the term militia but we know what it means we know what the purpose was it isn't any
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:41.280]  you know it's like well okay what is this phrase being necessary for the security of a free state
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:45.520]  you know militia being this what that doesn't make any sense because my high school teacher told me
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:51.360]  that the militia is the national guard it's like no no militia is not the national guard and so we
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:55.200]  go back and we look at the meaning of the word militia we know what they were talking about at
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:59.680]  the time we can go back and we can look at all of the documents that they were referencing and
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:04.160]  their debate we know what natural born citizen is at the time but of course now the establishment
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:09.360]  is coming towards him and as we pointed out yesterday we have neil bush who is now not only
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:15.280]  endorsing him though on the bush brothers but he's going to be joining his campaign finance team
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:22.320]  let's play a clip to remind you about neil bush's financial expertise here's that clip
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:29.120]  federal banking regulators have finally decided what to do to president bush's son neil for his
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:34.560]  part in a savings and loan debacle neil bush was a director of a Denver based outfit that was part
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:40.160]  of the overall national savings and loan scandal we'd have braver reports on what federal regulators
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:47.600]  concluded the government agency that supervises savings and loans today formally declared that neil
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:53.040]  bush engaged in conflicts of interest while serving as a director of the failed Silverado
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:59.120]  SNL the chief of the office of thrift supervision would not discuss his decision no really can have
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:04.400]  no comment on that but thank you but in an embarrassing blow to bush ryan has ordered the
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:11.200]  president's son to cease and desist from any future unsafe or unsound practices bush had no
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:16.880]  comment today but he has steadfastly disputed charges that he voted to approve loans to his own
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:22.240]  business associates without revealing the ties to other bank directors i believe in the principle
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:27.120]  if you didn't do anything wrong don't admit to it and i didn't do anything wrong still today there
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:32.640]  were charges from democrats that bush's punishment was too lenient there were out a billion dollars in
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.560]  terms of this particular institution it seems to me the least we could say is you're you stay out of
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:40.960]  the business for five years you don't come back into this bush has been ordered to do nothing more
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:47.200]  than obey the law this is a slap on the wrist with a velvet hammer today's action may be the least of
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:53.680]  neil bush's problems still pending against silvarado a 200 million dollar civil suit
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:48:00.320]  and the federal fraud investigation read a braver cbs news washington and there you go neil bush now
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:06.720]  joins the cruise finance team the ultimate irony okay let me go back and review some of this in
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:12.960]  more detail that was a report from 1991 uh from cbs news now here's uh something from mother jones
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:18.800]  this is an article called bush family values and they spell values so the dollar sign okay this all
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:26.320]  revolved around silvarado banking initially from 1985 until 1988 this is a savings and loan in
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:32.480]  denver colorado for those of you who don't remember uh the snl crisis that happened in the late 80s
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:39.280]  early 90s okay that was something that was the biggest uh fraud that we had seen until the mid
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:45.680]  2000s until we came around to george w bush and the federal reserve that did the pump and dump there
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:51.760]  and they put it this way they say neils abysmally unsuccessful oil company was involved there they
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:58.320]  made over 200 million dollars in loans to neil bush and his two partners and their unsuccessful
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:05.200]  oil company silvarado savings and loan was due at least in part to the fact that neils two partners
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:11.600]  welched on 135 million dollars in loans after silvarado failed neil started a new oil company
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:17.920]  apex energy you know he's just keep going uh the small business administration program gave him a
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:26.800]  2.35 million dollar loan that was arranged by an old family friend this is what we call crony
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:34.400]  capitalism boys and girls exhibit a neil bush okay uh the sba the small business administration
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:40.000]  discovered that the companies through which the loan was approved were technically insolvent guess
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:46.640]  what the last time we checked apex's only known asset was an oil lease which the company had
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:53.040]  purchased from neil bush for 150 thousand dollars before he bailed out so let me repeat this okay
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:50:02.160]  he creates this new oil company he sells them a uh oil lease for 150 thousand dollars essentially
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:07.600]  worthless along with these other assets he arranges a loan for two and a half million dollars
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:13.680]  roughly through the sba small business administration and then they find out which he uses family
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:19.760]  connections to make that happen uh let me ask you this any of you out there who would like
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:25.760]  to start your own business be your own boss uh you know set your own hours uh just get directly
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:30.880]  involved in and like you'd like to start a business that's the american dream okay let me ask you
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:33.760]  if you go to the small business administration you think they're going to give you a two and a
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:40.000]  half million dollar loan no no that's crony capitalism how does crony capitalism succeed
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.920]  well you have to have a big government to do that bernie uh so yeah it's not just crony capitalism
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:52.320]  it's not capitalism at all it's gangster uh theft okay and of course so he rolls all this over and
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:57.120]  then they say wait a minute there's nothing at all here now he's going to be ted cruises finance

[02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:00.400]  you know that's what the establishment is moving toward uh this is a clear sign folks of what's
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:07.360]  going on it is a clear sign that they're desperate enough that they are taking the mask off of
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:11.600]  ted cruis a mask that i've been pointing out i think has been there a very long time perhaps
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:16.000]  that's why he has such awkward smiles i don't know i want to tell you tell you something right now

[02:56:54.720 --> 02:57:00.960]  mention before we get to the break here and as i was talking earlier about the news report that came
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:07.520]  out about the drones being used to spy on us understand that they're doing more than that
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:13.280]  with the drones we had a document that listed and i was trying to find this through the show
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.200]  i haven't been able to find it yet it was a document somebody given us from the f a a where
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:21.040]  they listed everybody who had been licensed to have drones at the time and this is before
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:26.240]  they started requiring everybody register their drones with them and it was amazing to see how
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:31.680]  many different agencies and some universities for research purposes had drones but when you look at
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:37.280]  the agencies when you look at what the blm has they had a massive number of drones a lot of
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:44.160]  their their drones were reaper drones and predator drones now they're saying that they're using these
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:51.120]  drones to map out resources and that would be frightening enough if we're going to live in a
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:56.480]  country where the government maps out everything that they claim they own and of course the government
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:00.880]  is not allowed under constitution to own land outside the district of columbia but they assert
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:04.880]  ownership over all this land they're going to map it out to the last detail but they're going to map
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:10.240]  out your land to the last detail and as we're looking at this they try to say well you know it's
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:16.080]  just uh we're just monitoring people we're just looking at people understand that when this is
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:21.360]  really going to get bad and nobody's talking about this it is the vehicle to infrastructure
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:25.120]  communication devices that they're going to be putting in your car with them next year or two
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:30.000]  they're going to be mandating that you buy that they're going to be monitoring every aspect of
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:35.120]  your movement they say hey it's just metadata that's the most important data that's how they
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:44.720]  map the human domain stay with us we'll be right back this is GCN the genesis communications radio
[02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:54.160]  network brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do designs us you worked

[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:13.520]  of brain force right there i popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything

[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:24.480]  why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best
[02:59:24.480 --> 02:59:29.120]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off i haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a
[02:59:29.120 --> 02:59:34.000]  while but i probably could not have done it without brain force i went home about 6 45 this morning

[03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:14.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the front lines of the information
[03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:23.760]  war it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show the fourth hour rob do is going to be joining
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:29.200]  us in the next segment i want to talk a little bit about a couple of articles we didn't have time
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:34.240]  to talk about earlier and of course we have these many of these articles that came up on the drudge
[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:38.960]  report earlier today the bloomberg article with crime you have not yet committed another one from
[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:46.320]  the guardian the fbi quietly changes its privacy rules for accessing nsa data on americans let me
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:53.040]  read you a phrase from this and i want you to let this sink in classified revision revisions were
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:01:02.000]  accepted by the secret us court think about that i'm going to repeat it classified revisions classified
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:11.760]  revisions were accepted by the secret us court what's going on here is that we have a secret
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:22.160]  court a star chamber court that is now secretly changing the law how does it get any worse than
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:30.960]  this this is anathema to democracy it is everything our system of governance was designed to stop
[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:37.200]  the magna card and and the constitution were designed to stop precisely this type of secret
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:42.160]  star chamber government and the amazing thing to me is the path that we have taken to get here
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:46.560]  you understand the back in the 70s we had the church commission in the senate we had the
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:52.160]  pike commission in the house what were they do doing there they were trying to get control
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:56.800]  of this secret government that was rising up the cia was really kind of focused on the church
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:01.840]  commission and we all seen the pictures of the heart attack gun and the other assassination
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.160]  things that the ci was doing it's like wait a minute we don't want a government that secretly
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:11.600]  assassinate political leaders and perhaps its dissidents within its own country okay or even
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:16.560]  government officials within its own the government we don't want that okay meanwhile the pike
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.720]  commission which was in the house was trying to get some information on the nsa and they called the
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:24.720]  director of the nsa in and he at first wouldn't come in and then he comes in they said we'd like
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:30.560]  to see your charter you know ci's got a cia has a charter where's your charter nsa and he said well
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:37.280]  it's classified am i going to show it to you congressman congressman nsa was created by a
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:44.160]  secret executive order by president truman and within a couple of decades they had been doing
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:48.960]  the same kind of stuff that everybody's complaining about now that snowden has uh illustrated to the
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:55.760]  public spying on americans listening to their phone calls doing all the stuff that is prohibited
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:01.040]  by the constitution and so these two commissions came in and said well okay i can't you know i
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:07.840]  can just imagine them sitting there like senator sessions when uh the the guy who's the guy uh
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:15.600]  i want to say panera panetta panera says yeah we would go to the un or we would go to nato to get
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.560]  authority to uh to call for a no fly zone over syria and he goes i can't believe you're saying
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:25.280]  that you're a senator you know what the constitution is they could care less okay so these secret
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:29.920]  organizations nsa says we're not going to show you our charter a secret this is executive order you
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:34.080]  can't see it congressman and so they said all right we're going to create an organization to
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:39.120]  oversee these guys to try to keep them in check we'll call it the faiza we're going to be foreign
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:43.760]  intelligence surveillance act we're going to set up a court and we're going to keep these guys in
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:50.240]  line okay now what are they're doing they're using that court to secretly modify the constitution
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:55.360]  we've reported on this multiple times here it is again from the guardian classified revisions we
[03:03:55.360 --> 03:04:01.120]  can't see them not for the public to see they're changing the constitution and they say you can't
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:07.280]  see it it's a secret meanwhile we have hillary clinton who is putting all of these thousands of
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:14.000]  secret documents on her private server for who knows what reason she would set this thing up why
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  did she hatch this conspiracy to subvert the religion of the national security state the thing
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:24.880]  on which we have to sacrifice our constitution and all of our individual rights for this national
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:32.080]  security state and hillary clinton conspires with others who are now being given immunity to
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:37.760]  investigate this and understand that judge napolitano went on he pointed out hey you give somebody
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:42.080]  immunity that means you're going after somebody higher up he also said yesterday he said she's
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:45.680]  playing word games she says none of these things were marked classified of course they're not marked
[03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:50.320]  classified they're marked confidential or they're marked secret or they're marked top secret they
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:54.080]  don't write classified they write those other things it's a word game just like her husband
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:05:01.600]  stay with us we'll be right back with rob do in the last democratic debate we learned that there are no

[03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:18.880]  application and what are we going to talk about today well there's been some interesting news
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:23.920]  having to deal with sandy hook and donald trump and the connection they're trying i guess they're
[03:09:23.920 --> 03:09:29.600]  going to try to turn donald trump into a sandy hook truther i'm going to show you a video in a
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:36.640]  little bit the is is this the most powerful donald trump video ever and it's a pro trump montage by
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:42.480]  in the fed facebook and let me tell you i'm really hot on this right now last night bigs and ijo bigs
[03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:47.520]  and a few others were at a local bar where we've been competing in a ping pong tournament
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.880]  we're pretty crazy about ping pong here at least some of us at the info war studios
[03:09:52.880 --> 03:09:58.080]  you might have seen i think me and bigz big dressed up as an ices fighter and i was dressed up as
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:05.040]  uncle sam and and and we played some ping pong one time during the money bomb but nevertheless
[03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:12.800]  we did this uh we have this contest and the first time uh we we did it i won i beat a guy wearing a
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:18.400]  kami red shirt and it had like linen and styling everybody had party hats on had a little sickle
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:22.640]  and hammer and i and really enjoyed beating that guy and i was wearing my molan labé t-shirt so it
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:29.920]  was a clash of civilizations there well the same thing happened again this last time the you know
[03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:35.040]  basically we sent the trindies home packing and then they got mad and we had uh arguments at the
[03:10:35.040 --> 03:10:38.880]  end of the night at the bar it was great good fun though it was good good to debate people
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:43.760]  because they were throwing out donald trump's the races he's a bigot i said well why why why you say
[03:10:43.760 --> 03:10:49.760]  that he doesn't want to bring in any muslims well look at the results of the michigan race last night
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:56.640]  where donald trump won in dearborn which is if you've driven around in dearborn it's a muslim town
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:11:01.840]  i mean majority of the muslims i've been there a couple times when uh back in the day went to
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:06.240]  detroit to document the decimation that's going on there we also went to dearborn to document some
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:12.880]  stuff the guys uh recently went back there to film like one of the biggest mosques in i think the
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:19.200]  united states this thing is huge so big muslim population voting for trump that must tell you
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:22.880]  something they obviously don't think he's racist you have a lot of mexican americans voting for

[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:53.120]  i see you're smart i see you're very beautiful what we were able to do today was allow people to
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:58.880]  see his heart for themselves and to make up their own minds about him and they they they find out
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:04.560]  that he's not the person that the media has depicted him to be are you enjoying this i support
[03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:10.560]  donald trump and everybody knows everybody knows family you know donald forever i like donald
[03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:17.760]  wonderful guy i mean and he's miscast by the media you know that he's he's got an enormous ego
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:24.000]  but he's a good guy he's got a big heart by the way he's very good to people he's very kind to people
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:28.800]  he's people don't know that you just have to get that word average out of your vocabulary and you
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:33.120]  have to tell yourself that you're great and you have to believe it if you can say it and don't
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:39.040]  believe it it doesn't matter a kid that worked in the back right i said well hey that was donald
[03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:43.520]  trump this is before he ran this is months ago he goes unbelievable he would come back stay come
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:49.520]  back to the kitchen and give hundred dollars to the staff yeah he would give these guys quietly
[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:54.080]  nobody would know about that the fact is i go down the streets of new york and the people that really
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:12:59.680]  like me are the taxi drivers and the workers etc etc also his children i know his son eric i've met
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:04.320]  him a couple of times he's a great kid they're great they're great kids yeah you know the apple
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:10.880]  doesn't fall far from the tree do i like him yeah i mean he's real that's what we need i like his ideas
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:15.200]  those are real letters those are not corporate letters of those are not letters from these are hand
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:20.720]  written those are not letters from general motors those are letters from people you have that heart
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:26.720]  you have to take care of women's health issues you have to take care of poor people that don't have
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:31.520]  that they're never gonna have a shot and you have to take care of african-american youth who
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:36.560]  have never been in a worse position than they are right now this sounds like political presidential
[03:13:36.560 --> 03:13:39.760]  talk to me and i know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run would you
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:44.720]  would you ever i just probably wouldn't do it i probably wouldn't but i do get tired of seeing
[03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:48.720]  what's happening with this country and if it got so bad i would never want to rule it out totally
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:54.960]  i think donald trump underneath it all isn't just a business guy i think he loves america i really
[03:13:54.960 --> 03:14:00.480]  do i think he cares this country has such potential i love the country i think we can make it better
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:06.800]  than ever before we have to unleash it people have lost their spirit donald trump represents
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:14.160]  truth logic and common sense his incentive and his self-interest is tied to the well-being of
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:18.960]  the country that he's supposed to represent they love me i love them and i'll tell you something
[03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:24.160]  if i get the nomination i'll win the latino vote i will win it because i'm going to create jobs
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:31.280]  i'm his bunny and i vote for mr trump we vote for mr trump get behind the candidate mr
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:37.600]  donald trump that's gonna do something for you that's gonna give you a hand up instead of a hand
[03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:43.520]  out family a lot of things that he said is true wow he's a boy you're aesthetic and you're saying
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:56.480]  that are you sure wow i know what donald trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:15:02.800]  and anger and frustration at a government gone mad i guess i just wanted to find out if there was
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:09.280]  one thing that you wanted people to remember about donald trump what is it never ever give up
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:21.120]  the power of positive thinking and i think that's very much in donald's makeup if i become president
[03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:26.960]  i couldn't care less about my company i want to use that same up here whatever it may be
[03:15:27.520 --> 03:15:33.040]  to make america rich again and to make america great again ladies and gentlemen
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:38.160]  i am officially running
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:49.040]  for president of the united states and we are going to make our country great again
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:54.560]  do not underestimate the power of donald trump or you will be scratching your head wondering
[03:15:54.560 --> 03:16:00.160]  how did he get the republican nomination and we will see the best debate in history
[03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:02.240]  hillary ronald putton donald j
[03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:11.920]  we are here for spain donald trump or the day donald trump has came up with some very strict
[03:16:11.920 --> 03:16:16.800]  immigration laws that will guarantee work in the african-american community i hope
[03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:22.720]  he gets through with his intentions about building the wall well i just want to let everybody know
[03:16:22.720 --> 03:16:28.880]  that not all latinos are blind he knows what money is where it comes from and how to make
[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:33.680]  more of it rather than redistributing other peoples in exchange for their vote and the
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:39.760]  intensity with trump is like nothing i've seen since i was a little kid and reagan was running
[03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:44.560]  and they were saying this is america's last job if we don't get it right this time we're not
[03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:48.960]  going to have a country left folks we're not going to have a country are we seriously trying to figure
[03:16:48.960 --> 03:16:54.480]  out whether or not donald trump would make a good president the man has major major skills that we
[03:16:54.480 --> 03:17:01.760]  can offer this country right now owes 19 trillion dollars and they need somebody like me to straighten
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:11.600]  out that mess honestly i really think voters and americans are looking at this guy saying it's
[03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:17.280]  refreshing to hear somebody not be a wuss not be a politician and really say what they think these
[03:17:17.280 --> 03:17:22.160]  aren't dumb people these are american patriots and they want this country turned around i don't want
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:28.160]  nuance i want bold colors red white and blue america i have seen in the last several decades
[03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:34.640]  absolutely fray and decline when i saw those guys on the boats on their knees i mean that says a
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:42.320]  picture about america that i haven't seen ever before democrats not one or two but many a voting
[03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:47.520]  for donald trump as well as as republicans i've seen this all over the place so i think there's
[03:17:47.520 --> 03:17:53.280]  a big big movement happening and i got to say that uh you know we need him you know this is a
[03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:58.560]  movement folks this is not like even maybe about me i don't want it to be about me this is about
[03:17:58.560 --> 03:18:07.360]  common sense it's about doing the right thing the silent majority is back and we're going to take
[03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:13.840]  the country back i have a big heart i'm going to take care of people i'm going to make sure that
[03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:18.640]  this country comes first we don't come first we don't come ten we take care of everyone else
[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:24.640]  but alone and that's going to change we're going to become rich again we're going to become safe
[03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:32.000]  again and we're going to become strong again nothing is wrong with us we don't have to like
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:39.520]  illegal aliens we don't have to we're americans we want americans first why can't we be first
[03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:50.160]  we are ready for a change we are ready and our troops deserve the best and in the middle east
[03:18:50.160 --> 03:18:57.200]  i guess we spent five trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our bridges our tunnels our roads
[03:18:57.200 --> 03:19:03.360]  our hospitals our airports we could have rebuilt our country we could have rebuilt our military
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:10.640]  we could have taken care of social security we could have taken care of everything we are
[03:19:10.640 --> 03:19:23.440]  going to win so much we're going to have win after win after win you people are going to get sick and tired of winning you're going to say please please president Trump we can't take this much victory

[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:23.520]  and seen the trailer of america the movie that alex jones has a pretty big role in as an evil
[03:24:23.520 --> 03:24:29.840]  senator well i've got sitting next to me not leah macadoo but gary haven the writer and
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:35.040]  producer of america and he just dropped by and so he decided to come in and we're going to spend
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:38.240]  the next half hour with him we're going to take your phone calls i got kevin in florida

[03:24:51.280 --> 03:24:55.440]  i was talking to gary back in the conference room that we have a sort of our green room
[03:24:55.440 --> 03:24:59.280]  and he was talking about some interesting things that are going on with north korea
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:02.800]  i don't know if you've been watching or paying attention to that but there is some
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:08.560]  saber rattling going on amongst all the trump hoopla that's going on in the united states
[03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:13.280]  and uh oh uh before we go to that and start talking about that i want to just give a quick
[03:25:13.280 --> 03:25:18.240]  plug to in the fed facebook group who played that last video or who produced that last video
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:25.280]  that we uh that we just played about donald trump and i think you know you can't deny the crowds
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:30.640]  that donald trump is getting same as bernie sanders he's getting good crowds uh the crowds are
[03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:35.680]  crickets for everybody else ted cruise is getting some crowds but not like donald not like sanders
[03:25:35.680 --> 03:25:40.320]  hillary they get smaller and smaller rubio they get smaller and smaller i mean what do you think
[03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:47.200]  is going on you know trump's uh a mess right but he's his own mess he's not bought and paid for
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:53.920]  by the elite the establishment and in reality is people are waking up they want their country back
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:26:00.800]  and trump is somebody who who gives us hope that we could have a leader that will actually stand for
[03:26:00.800 --> 03:26:07.120]  us and not for the establishment and i think help get government out of the way that's i i see that
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:10.800]  as being the biggest problem people think the government's there to help you they're not they
[03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:15.760]  get in the way of of everything they got in the way in katrina people were trying to send water
[03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:19.840]  to these people and the government's get in the way say no you can't send people water but come on
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:25.920]  it's water you know the government gets in the way of giving people water when they need water
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:32.000]  okay that's the government and that was a george bush administration okay barack obama wasn't any
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:37.520]  better i mean these people they get in the way and the government keeps getting bigger and bigger
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:44.160]  we need smaller government we need we have the technology now to communicate yeah pretty instantaneously
[03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:49.680]  just since i've gotten here the news i mean we are on like if it's two days old it's old we don't
[03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:54.400]  even talk about it anymore whereas before it would be something a week old would still be kind of big
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:59.440]  news no not anymore i mean it's so it's flying so fast and furious if you're connected with one of
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:04.000]  these uh one of these listening devices you know what's you know you might know what's going on
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:08.160]  depending on what it depends on where you get your news from and how many sources you go to

[03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:31.440]  when a year and a half ago yeah year and a half ago uh the movie is called america and we have a
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:37.520]  website america in the movie dot com uh over a million and a half people have seen the trailer
[03:27:37.520 --> 03:27:44.800]  you know when we were writing this movie we had several ways to to uh emulate this emp attack on
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:50.880]  america and what that is is a detonation of a small nuclear device up in the atmosphere and it
[03:27:50.880 --> 03:27:56.720]  sends out gamma rays that will destroy all electronics including the grid water systems and uh
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:02.800]  and and i looked at the most likely way we'd get this attack and and uh you know would it be a
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:07.520]  scud missile with an emp on it from a freighter and all sort of thing but we just happened to
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:13.360]  choose the most likely scenario which is a north korean satellite and guess what February 7th not
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:19.920]  many weeks ago north korea lost a satellite that passes over the us three times a day north korea
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:27.520]  has been developing miniaturized nuclear devices that are low detonation high gamma ray production
[03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:34.080]  specifically emp attack emp weapons essentially so all of this is in the news every week right now
[03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:40.560]  you've got a new story on it today i uh it's it's i'm almost worried that this is going to happen
[03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:46.480]  before my movie comes out uh that might actually give people a chance to to to be warned right
[03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:52.320]  and it comes out when in may right may 13 may 13 theaters across texas and other in southern u.s
[03:28:52.960 --> 03:28:59.840]  directors uh mike norris son of chuck norris i i co-wrote the movie with him and in star in it
[03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:05.520]  and do you have a theatrical degree um it takes a lot of work to put a movie together i know that
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:10.960]  it's funny i've never acted uh this is my second movie but i i i actually found that it was a very
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:16.880]  natural thing for me to do and especially about something you know you're you're uh you're passionate
[03:29:16.880 --> 03:29:21.920]  about right well and i'm going to get into some acting stuff later there's a boat we're the break
[03:29:21.920 --> 03:29:27.520]  is coming upon us uh the daily males attacking donald trump for being being endorsed by reverend
[03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:32.320]  carl gallops who they claim is a sandy hook true through says no one died in the new town shootings
[03:29:33.120 --> 03:29:38.000]  sandy hooks a little weird um but we're going to get more into north korea and we've got a little
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:42.640]  video about north korea because they are threatening to launch preemptive nuclear strikes believe it
[03:29:42.640 --> 03:29:47.840]  people it could be happening there it is rob do info wars dot com you're watching it we're on the
[03:29:47.840 --> 03:30:00.480]  march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network 400 us army soldiers at fort
[03:30:00.480 --> 03:30:05.600]  gordon georgia were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing including a powerpoint
[03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:11.120]  presentation instructing the attendees or society attaches privilege to being white and male and
[03:30:11.120 --> 03:30:16.800]  heterosexual the slideshow obtained by judicial watch also informs the soldiers quote race privilege
[03:30:16.800 --> 03:30:21.200]  gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to african americans the white privilege
[03:30:21.200 --> 03:30:25.600]  training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere keeping different
[03:30:25.600 --> 03:30:30.560]  kinds of people from being valued accepted and appreciated but we act as if it doesn't exist
[03:30:30.560 --> 03:30:35.520]  this alleged privilege creates a yawning divide and income wealth and dignity the slideshow suggests
[03:30:35.520 --> 03:30:39.840]  it but obviously this white privilege training course helps perpetrate this racial divide in
[03:30:39.840 --> 03:30:44.160]  america by fueling racial tensions this very notion that you can group people into racial groups
[03:30:44.160 --> 03:30:48.000]  who have certain privileges as races in itself because then you're not looking at people by
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:52.640]  their individual qualities but rather by their skin color which is inherently racist this is kit

[03:32:14.160 --> 03:32:21.200]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century

[03:33:30.160 --> 03:33:34.480]  i don't know six months now it's been quite an experiment to pick up the fourth hour again alex
[03:33:34.480 --> 03:33:38.720]  used to do four hours and he went back down to three and then you know people were still carrying
[03:33:38.720 --> 03:33:42.480]  they would repeat the first hour they'd keep that four hour spot open so alex so why don't we just
[03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:47.280]  keep producing more content we have the staff we have people that can come in i'm not one of the
[03:33:47.280 --> 03:33:52.560]  main people that sits in and does this mainly is you know david night and anthony does thursdays and
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:58.320]  we have paul joseph watson on mondays but as news breaks as people get assigned to different areas
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:02.640]  you know other people have to step up so i'm going to go to your calls this segment definitely
[03:34:02.640 --> 03:34:10.160]  i think we'll go to uh let's we'll go to austin and oklahoma first so stand by austin and let's
[03:34:10.160 --> 03:34:15.600]  finish up and i'm also going to get to this bernie $1,000 meme contest we had one last week
[03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:22.400]  showing the image of romney bush who's laughing like a little piggly wiggly and rubio all on
[03:34:22.400 --> 03:34:27.840]  a plane together during romney's campaign failed campaign for president in uh 2012
[03:34:28.720 --> 03:34:33.360]  and we had a meme contest for that in the winter was a lady who just started listening to us her
[03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:38.160]  twitter handles can't stump the trump she just started listening to us about six months ago
[03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:42.560]  her late husband was a big fan of alex and so she just started listening to it she's a mom
[03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:46.880]  she's got five kids sounds like a really nice lady i've been chatting her back and forth on twitter
[03:34:46.880 --> 03:34:52.800]  and you know she just decided to enter it and her meme won she got $1,000 so you never know
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:34:56.080]  you could be a winner we're going to go over some of these and look at them in a second
[03:34:56.640 --> 03:35:01.120]  you didn't have to stick to any particular picture any particular video it could be whatever you
[03:35:01.120 --> 03:35:05.360]  want but a lot of people are pouring in about the white privilege thing that he kind of stuck
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:09.920]  his foot in his mouth on that did you see that video where he said white people don't know pull
[03:35:09.920 --> 03:35:15.840]  and they're not pull yeah amazing yeah and then we had to of course we went downtown and there's
[03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:20.400]  lots of poor white people you know there's four white people everywhere in fact they outnumber
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:25.360]  everybody else and being poor and that's another good thing white people are are really good at
[03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:31.520]  being poor did we finish up with north korea did you have anything else to add on that
[03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:37.680]  that just uh why isn't uh in the main wasn't the mainstream media talking about the most
[03:35:37.680 --> 03:35:48.000]  imminent threat to our country a little short fat guy in korea who who has nukes one of which
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:54.720]  is probably passing over our country at 300 miles optimum altitude they say it's tumbling
[03:35:54.720 --> 03:35:58.960]  right now they say tumbling i think we have him did you guys pull up the picture of him on his
[03:35:58.960 --> 03:36:04.400]  secret weapon there i see i see one of those click on any one of those he's got a secret weapon
[03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:10.080]  he's got a unicorn he's charging in yeah a unicorn in a newsy with denith rodman by his side
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:16.560]  denith rodman's incidentally a trump supporter too oh he said you're all he sent out a tweet
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:22.000]  they said something about him and he goes you're all going to get fired just like i did so uh
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:27.680]  that was very interesting hey let's go to austin now let's talk about ted cruz uh being a us citizen
[03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:32.960]  i don't know if they're ever going to settle that i mean do we even settle if if uh barry sataro is
[03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:36.960]  uh and who his real daddy is i don't even know if we're ever going to settle that
[03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:40.000]  we never even saw the real birth certificate but go ahead austin what's on your mind
[03:36:40.960 --> 03:36:46.400]  well actually yeah i was wanting to talk a little bit about that but um just uh i saw a video recently
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:51.600]  of him talking about the 14th amendment i guess it was supposedly it was showing how he contradicts
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:37:00.080]  himself on this issue of uh natural born citizenship and he said actually that he was uh for the
[03:37:00.080 --> 03:37:04.240]  14th amendment and just the fact that if you're born here you're a citizen even though your parents
[03:37:04.240 --> 03:37:09.680]  aren't from here i guess and then the uh he said he supported it and he was upset at people for
[03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:14.320]  trying to change it you know he's talking about he's a constitutionalist and then it went to a
[03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:19.280]  more recent uh interview he had where he says oh yeah we need to get rid of that and then he says
[03:37:19.280 --> 03:37:24.960]  in fact back in 2011 i said the same thing you know so he's actually contradicting himself and
[03:37:24.960 --> 03:37:30.080]  relying on top of it well i think his mom was a registered voter in canada and they claim she was a
[03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:35.200]  america u.s citizen but she was registered to vote in canada so i don't know what that makes you at
[03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:40.960]  that point definitely fudgy if uh if i was a country you would have to be a citizen of that
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:47.840]  country to vote in that country although here it's kind of whatever in some places i think
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:53.040]  california anybody can go in and vote as many times as they want twice on sunday you kind of hit
[03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:59.760]  hit the the head on it his mom was voting in canada she's on the voter registration logs up there
[03:37:59.760 --> 03:38:06.080]  which meant that she had established herself as a canadian citizen his his dad was not an american
[03:38:06.080 --> 03:38:13.600]  citizen um so uh there's plenty of constitutional reason to question his citizenship you know when
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:18.400]  i first heard trump start talking about it i thought oh this is kind of nonsense but as i began to
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:23.760]  study it much like our listener here i came to the same conclusion hey there's some substance here
[03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:30.640]  he really may not be eligible to to to be the president of this country and that would be a
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:35.680]  coup d'etat if he got up to that point he was nominated and then they go wait you're ineligible
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:41.520]  hillary wins you know no debate necessary and i you know now that the bushes have joined up with
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:49.440]  him i don't know what that means that just you know the the the cruise uh uh subject let me
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:53.840]  mention it i know cruise personally i had dinner with him last year about this time okay he was
[03:38:53.840 --> 03:39:02.480]  soliciting my support and and and i vetted him to find that he is the designated opponent he is
[03:39:02.480 --> 03:39:08.960]  an establishment through and through who who is put up is as if we have a choice you know how
[03:39:08.960 --> 03:39:15.040]  that works uh he's a neocon he wants to send our kids to the ukraine he wants to send him to the
[03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:20.400]  syria all to protect money interest we have no business being there he actually said to me the
[03:39:20.400 --> 03:39:26.080]  last thing he says you know i'm not a neocon and i looked at him like well what why do you want to
[03:39:26.080 --> 03:39:30.960]  send our kids to these places i've already pointed out it's just for the money interest right and if
[03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:37.200]  you look at his advisors two of them are former cia directors who uh we now know that he borrowed
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:45.280]  money from gulman sacks and city bank to get a report uh this guy is his deep uh state as anybody
[03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:51.040]  in unfortunately the governor of texas doesn't know that yeah although i've talked to him about it
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:57.440]  uh uh trump is full law i mean uh cruise is full a lot of people but he says he's uh
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:05.440]  he is the designated opponent so that uh they can get one either of their people into uh into
[03:40:05.440 --> 03:40:10.000]  exactly i mean at first i think it was bush they were just assume the media assume we can
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:14.160]  name him era parent everybody will agree with us but then people started asking him questions yeah
[03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:20.080]  and he just he doesn't know anything and then it went to rubio and then the incredible shrinking
[03:40:20.080 --> 03:40:24.720]  candidate just keeps getting smaller and smaller and now you know cruise is definitely i think third
[03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:28.960]  runner up they had that's why they put a ton of people in here to see who fans out see who's gonna
[03:40:28.960 --> 03:40:34.080]  work and you know ben carson i don't think he was establishment um but he just couldn't get
[03:40:34.080 --> 03:40:41.680]  any traction fearina i don't know she was yeah ren paul was the exception i agree and i know ren paul
[03:40:41.680 --> 03:40:47.680]  i took him to haiti uh back in november spent four days with him uh he was doing eye surgeries on
[03:40:47.680 --> 03:40:55.280]  on uh poor Haitians so i had a lot of time to talk with him uh but i told him at the time uh
[03:40:55.280 --> 03:41:00.400]  every evening we'd be in a hotel and i would say look senator you're the guy you've got the voting
[03:41:00.400 --> 03:41:07.200]  record and he could do it too but your campaign sucks yep he has he surrounded himself with people
[03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:12.160]  who aren't winners you know i think that's the bottom line because he is a winner i've met him
[03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:17.840]  personally i went i did an interview with him um out in uh not too far from here over near the lake
[03:41:17.840 --> 03:41:22.720]  at uh he was having a campaign fundraiser for his dad and uh we interviewed him and i'd you know
[03:41:22.720 --> 03:41:26.000]  stand up guy every he did he i said do you have anything you don't want me to ask he's like no
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:28.800]  you can ask me whatever you want so i just fired question after question after question after
[03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:32.720]  question so i couldn't think of anything to ask him anymore and he answered every question
[03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:37.360]  would just be in calm he didn't go well uh he was not trying to dance around the issues he had his
[03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:43.280]  principles centered in his mind and you know he didn't waver from him so it is a shame he is not in
[03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:47.200]  let's go to kevin and florida wants to talk about white privilege you got two white guys here
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:53.360]  tell us how we're privileged please well first of all thank you rob for taking my call on my
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:42:01.040]  uh lifetime lifelong conspiracy theorist like you guys are and uh i wanted to get in yet of the white
[03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:09.120]  privilege uh aspect of it and how like ridiculously nuts it is that the majority of people are buying
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:14.320]  into this you know that just because you're white mostly white males that you're inherently racist
[03:42:14.320 --> 03:42:18.720]  that everything's been handed to you when the majority of people that i know that have anything
[03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:27.440]  are hard workers nine to five guys uh first to come in early last to leave um my concern with
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:33.040]  this is that you have a lot of these ignorant idiots out there that believe this that are gonna
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:39.920]  it's gonna allow uh hillary and bernie supporters to steal this election because as you guys have
[03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:45.680]  pointed out numerous times correctly that i think trump really it's it's him or busted he loses this
[03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:50.880]  there's not gonna be another free election after this i mean with the hardcore socialism that they're
[03:42:50.880 --> 03:42:56.640]  trying to bring in would just give everything and everybody's free stuff with this magical free money
[03:42:56.640 --> 03:43:01.760]  that's enough flow out of thin air because people are too ignorant to realize it comes from hard
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:06.960]  working taxpayers who the majority of them are white um and i wanted to give you guys
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:12.800]  some thoughts on that well i think you're uh you're spot on pretty much on on everything you just said
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:19.600]  and um what i would add to that would be i i don't think bernie's gonna steal any elections
[03:43:19.600 --> 03:43:22.720]  because they're stealing it from him i think they're stealing the nomination from bernie sanders
[03:43:22.720 --> 03:43:28.960]  right now because if you look at the crowds that bernie pulls in they are huge compared to what
[03:43:28.960 --> 03:43:34.720]  hillary pulls in hillary is establishment she started off with a 500 delegate lead you know i
[03:43:34.720 --> 03:43:40.640]  i've tweeted out a picture they hadn't even shown any poll results yet in a couple i think it was
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:46.320]  the saturday primaries and she already had six delegates and it was zero reporting she said i
[03:43:46.320 --> 03:43:51.040]  mean you can't beat that that's that's just math you can't win against and what i would like to see
[03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:56.320]  is the bernie people that are anti-establishment in in a lot of ways i know a lot of them there's
[03:43:56.320 --> 03:44:01.840]  there's probably 20 that think everything's going to be for free and then there's another percentage
[03:44:03.120 --> 03:44:06.800]  that are hardworking people that think the system is rigged and they're like you know what i'm going
[03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:10.720]  with bernie because i like what he's saying 90% of the stuff i don't think there's anybody out
[03:44:10.720 --> 03:44:14.800]  there that agrees with the candidate all the way but i'd like to see those supporters come over
[03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:18.400]  and start supporting donald trump because i think you're going to see what happened to ram paul is
[03:44:18.400 --> 03:44:21.200]  what's going to happen to bernie sanders they're just going to steal it right out from under him
[03:44:21.200 --> 03:44:27.040]  yeah you know kevin uh i left home at 16 put myself through college making a dollar 10 an hour
[03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:32.880]  you may you may be old enough to remember minimum wage at that level i don't think rob just i was
[03:44:32.880 --> 03:44:41.760]  at 425 an hour and uh at mcdonald's by the way and uh i was a millionaire at 25 from working hard
[03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:48.080]  then i was bankrupt at 30 from stupid mistakes within a billionaire at 50 so um i guarantee you
[03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:54.240]  there was no privilege involved uh or luck for that matter the harder i worked the luckier i got
[03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:59.920]  perhaps yeah i would agree and good luck happens when you're prepared and in the timing you know
[03:44:59.920 --> 03:45:03.280]  if you're prepared something's going to come along you're gonna be like hey i'm ready for that
[03:45:03.280 --> 03:45:09.280]  boom i'm in it i'm in it to win it uh now we've got this daily mail article florida pastor who
[03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:13.680]  endorses donald trump is a sandy hook truth or reverend carl gallup's claims no one died in the
[03:45:13.680 --> 03:45:20.000]  new town shootings and grieving parents are hollywood actors and uh i guess he spoke at a trump
[03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:26.880]  rally in pennsycola which had only 10 000 people 10 000 people got off their butt to go see donald
[03:45:26.880 --> 03:45:33.120]  trump and you can't get a room for 300 with hillary or her daughter or anybody else and then i was
[03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:38.320]  reminded of this article when i saw this by paul craig roberts an economist not a guy who i think
[03:45:38.320 --> 03:45:42.960]  steps his foot in anything unless he really knows what it is a numbers guy and he wrote an article
[03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:48.960]  called sandy hook puzzles and he talks about just the myriad of photographs that look like they were
[03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:54.560]  created for this event and he goes through all the evidence and i'm not going to really go through
[03:45:54.560 --> 03:45:59.920]  it here but i encourage you to read that article because it seems like they're taking anything they
[03:45:59.920 --> 03:46:05.680]  can to tie to donald trump they had the guy who got arrested tied with the bundy situation and in
[03:46:05.680 --> 03:46:11.520]  burns uh origan they arrested him and called him a trump campaign head you know he just kept getting
[03:46:11.520 --> 03:46:16.240]  more promotions as bigger entities picked up on it first he was just a you know a guy that worked
[03:46:16.240 --> 03:46:20.240]  on a trump campaign then he became a trump campaign head next he's going to be running
[03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:25.600]  everything for donald and he got arrested and he wasn't even there when the standoff occurred he
[03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:31.600]  arrived afterward so there the media is grasping at straws but i will say this if you watch the video
[03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:40.480]  of robbie parker one of the parents of this sandy hook incident there is video of this guy
[03:46:40.480 --> 03:46:46.880]  and he's laughing and i've been in plays i've watched people get prepared for crying scenes
[03:46:46.880 --> 03:46:51.760]  they did exactly what he did they put their head down they think about some memory that they bring
[03:46:51.760 --> 03:46:56.320]  back in their head that they've had loaded in there they preloaded this while they're rehearsing
[03:46:56.320 --> 03:47:01.280]  so that they can go to it right before they go on stage and it was in our town plays when everybody
[03:47:01.280 --> 03:47:07.440]  died the the girl dies at the end i watched her mother in the play been down take some deep
[03:47:07.440 --> 03:47:13.120]  breaths and boom the tears were flowing and he did that exact same thing in my professional opinion
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:17.680]  i have a theater degree and i've directed several plays movies and there it is right there you can
[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:22.720]  see him smiling i mean that's that to me that's not a guy who just lost somebody but i don't know
[03:47:22.720 --> 03:47:27.680]  that's robbie parker he's one of the parents so there you can see him now he's he's he's gone into
[03:47:27.680 --> 03:47:33.920]  character and now he's ready he's about to start talking so to me that's that smells stinks to high
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:39.600]  heaven we've seen other events that we know are manufactured like boston bombing survivor killed
[03:47:39.600 --> 03:47:44.320]  in dubai car crash and if you look at the pictures of this girl here she's being carried
[03:47:45.760 --> 03:47:48.400]  let me show you this picture she's being carried this is supposedly a tourniquet
[03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:52.400]  does that look like a a knot that's wrapped up to be a tourniquet looks like somebody just
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:57.040]  tied a sash around hey you're ready to go get in there get in the game well now she's died in a
[03:47:57.040 --> 03:48:03.360]  car crash in dubai so uh we'll see her in her next feature maybe so yeah you never know maybe
[03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:08.560]  she was supposed to be a car crash victim so you know that's just interesting how they do all this
[03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:13.760]  going back to your movie pentagon admits using its military drones to spy on americans you actually
[03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:18.800]  i don't know if you want to spoil it but you have some drone situations in your movie right yeah
[03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:27.200]  you know it's uh if the average american doesn't realize that uh that that they're accessed uh i
[03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:33.520]  give you kind of a side example uh if you if you look on certain brands of tv's uh and you look at
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:41.040]  the disclaimer uh you are acknowledging that a camera in the tv can observe you and listen to you
[03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:46.560]  in your bedroom by the way sure uh by purchasing this television and there's a camera right here
[03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:51.360]  this is got one on each side so it doesn't matter where you put it there's a camera right so we you
[03:48:51.360 --> 03:48:57.520]  know we're just we don't want to accept this is so far out of what we would believe our government
[03:48:57.520 --> 03:49:03.840]  would do i uh but that's the world we live in yeah my movie has a scene i'm at my ranch and uh
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:10.960]  we we have been uh attacked by the imp and all the electronics are or are shut down of course
[03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:16.400]  the government has their electronic they have fair day cages everywhere yeah built by us our tax
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:21.040]  paying dollars so i'll look up in the sky and i'm on the phone and i'll say hey look uh the
[03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:26.640]  government sent a nice drone over to do yeah well now they say it's only been 20 times since 2006
[03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:32.240]  in 2015 yeah what you're gonna see in 10 years they're gonna show that part 20 times and then
[03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:38.880]  they're gonna go but since 2016 it's gone up to 600 times yeah you know but they're doing it to keep
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:42.880]  us safe so that's all we have to worry about they're doing it to keep us safe let's go to
[03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:48.080]  wane in kansas wants to talk uh shooting with the illegal uh grim immigration story is this a
[03:49:48.080 --> 03:49:52.640]  something new that happened or an older story uh no actually there's something new that happened
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:49:57.120]  thanks for having me on rob i'm a longtime listener and supporter of the show over the
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:50:02.480]  last couple of days we've had a developing story happen here in kansas city kansas
[03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:07.760]  we had a man gunned down four people two of which were fathers and had kids of their own
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:17.760]  and then ran to missouri they were finally captured i believe late last night um 175 miles away from
[03:50:17.760 --> 03:50:23.840]  where the crime in kck took place and he had killed someone else uh before they caught him in
[03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:31.840]  missouri this guy's name is pablo serrano and he had been um he was here illegally in the united
[03:50:31.840 --> 03:50:38.640]  states he had been captured in 2004 and deported and then sometime later came back in and the funny
[03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:43.840]  thing about the story is well it isn't funny but the thing about the story is is the guy had just
[03:50:43.840 --> 03:50:51.200]  been uh arrested i guess recently and charged with some criminal charges but then released
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:55.120]  instead of being handed over to authorities because the government doesn't want to do
[03:50:55.120 --> 03:50:58.800]  his job deporting people stay right there i'll have you back in the last segment you're watching

[03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:19.120]  it was sheriff paul babu gets how you say his name down in arizona who said president obama's
[03:54:19.120 --> 03:54:24.800]  got us in a stranglehold here at the border we can't do our job we're border patrol agents are
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:32.480]  being put in low areas of of uh where people are migrating across are illegally invading let's be
[03:54:32.480 --> 03:54:39.440]  politically incorrect here they're illegally invading um entering illegally and among other
[03:54:39.440 --> 03:54:44.960]  things it's on drudge report but here we have serrano vitorino is in the country illegally
[03:54:44.960 --> 03:54:50.720]  u.s immigration and our ice officials said in a statement he was deported in april 2004
[03:54:50.720 --> 03:54:55.840]  and illegally re-entered the country on an unknown date i said it would place a detainer
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:55:01.440]  on him well hopefully i i think if you get back in you got to go four more countries down
[03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:08.880]  we get somebody else's problem but that's just me um i'm sure he was here for good intentions
[03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:13.120]  you know murdering four people and cold blood that's they they're charging him a first degree
[03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:21.120]  murder so you know obama has a history now of releasing these people after their convictions
[03:55:21.120 --> 03:55:26.320]  yeah uh i don't know that uh there's going to be justice here at all i think we had a video out
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:31.680]  called the biggest prison obama leads biggest prison break in history see if y'all can find that it
[03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:36.960]  was probably last year sometime um and now they're they're saying the border is just as bad as last
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:43.680]  year getting worse this year so it's not ending and i was having a debate a lively debate last
[03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:50.640]  night in a bar uh with a couple and individuals who i believe are bernie supporters um and you
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:54.720]  know what does trump want to build a wall what does trump want well this is why this is why we
[03:55:54.720 --> 03:55:59.200]  have people come into this country and they don't respect our laws there there's the video obama
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:04.320]  leads worst prison break in history and it's about how he released a bunch of felons who were
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:10.000]  illegal aliens and it was about it i don't remember the number about a hundred thousand yeah it was a
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:16.560]  big number these aren't nice people there's this time i mean we got to do something you can't
[03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:21.280]  just sit around and go well that's racist to say that it's not racist to say we don't want people
[03:56:21.280 --> 03:56:26.320]  who kill people in our country we would like less of those people yeah of course they're flying
[03:56:26.320 --> 03:56:32.320]  them in oh yeah letting them fly with without uh i was about to say tps reports without tsa
[03:56:32.320 --> 03:56:37.120]  credentials or the tsa doesn't check them it's okay you know but if if we go to south podger
[03:56:37.120 --> 03:56:42.000]  island it's not even going into mexico and try to drive back we have to get our butts sniffed by
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:46.320]  the tsa and the border patrol speaking that i'll be at south podger island this next week for
[03:56:46.320 --> 03:56:51.040]  spring break oh wow it's got a lot of traffic down there during spring break once oh good
