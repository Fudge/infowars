[00:00.000 --> 00:27.440]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:27.440 --> 00:46.440]  the Info War.
[00:46.440 --> 00:51.280]  I just talked to Roger Stone minutes ago, he came out of his arraignment pleading not guilty
[00:51.280 --> 00:55.960]  about 20 minutes ago and the paparazzi people were screaming at him so loud he couldn't do
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.360]  the press conference just like they drowned him out back last week when he got out of
[01:03.360 --> 01:05.680]  jail as well.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.520]  So we're going to be talking to him as soon as he's able to get to a safe place, he's
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.080]  getting followed around by a bunch of hateful corporate paparazzi right now, we'll give
[01:14.080 --> 01:20.760]  you the latest on the ongoing giant witch hunt, acting attorney general, Whitaker has come
[01:20.760 --> 01:24.800]  out yesterday, we've got that video coming up for you in the next segment and he said
[01:24.800 --> 01:31.480]  that the investigation is coming to an end but I predict that will only spur new non-Russia
[01:31.480 --> 01:37.760]  related criminal investigations just like you've already seen with Manafort and with Cohen
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.760]  and others.
[01:38.760 --> 01:45.640]  Particularly with Cohen it was the special counsel, the director as they call him, as
[01:45.640 --> 01:53.280]  Whitaker called him, shaking, talking about him yesterday like he's God that broke down
[01:53.280 --> 02:01.600]  the fact that he supposedly is going to be finishing up his work but it was Mueller who
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.720]  went to the New York FBI and had to open the investigation up on Cohen that had nothing
[02:06.720 --> 02:13.920]  to do with Russiagate, had to do of course with not paying for taxicab medallions.
[02:13.920 --> 02:19.160]  So that's what we're down to here and I predict that the witch hunt is far from over, it's
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.840]  just about to metastasize into dozens of other fake investigations and Congress, especially
[02:24.840 --> 02:32.320]  the House, run by the Democrats have come out and they have openly said that.
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.480]  So tomorrow's news today, we're going to go to break here in just a few minutes and we're
[02:36.480 --> 02:39.480]  going to come right back with Roger Stone to give you a statement about what happened
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.880]  inside the courthouse, any restrictions of any of the judge put upon him, what happened
[02:44.880 --> 02:47.880]  when he tried to leave and more.
[02:47.880 --> 02:51.760]  In fact speaking of the devil, we have Roger just now got on the line so we'll go to him
[02:51.760 --> 02:53.400]  right now and hold him over.
[02:53.400 --> 02:58.200]  So Roger thanks for joining us, a lot happening on your whirlwind tour of all the major TV
[02:58.200 --> 03:02.120]  channels but again you were unable to speak today leaving the courthouse.
[03:02.120 --> 03:08.440]  Well first of all this is a world exclusive because no interviews are permitted in the
[03:08.440 --> 03:14.640]  courthouse and while I would like to have made a statement outside to announce that
[03:14.640 --> 03:22.080]  I pled not guilty, I was being shouted down by radical leftists and members of the fake
[03:22.080 --> 03:27.920]  news media and there's no point in trying to speak when you can't be heard by anyone.
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.480]  So I prefer to be heard right here on InfoWars and later on tonight on the Laura Ingraham
[03:33.480 --> 03:37.640]  program and on other media who will stop.
[03:37.640 --> 03:44.960]  Listen I had a great interview with Mancow this morning, by the way Alex sends his regards.
[03:44.960 --> 03:52.360]  This was a routine proceeding at the government table, Jeannie Ray, Hillary Clinton's personal
[03:52.360 --> 03:59.720]  henchwoman, the woman attorney who represented her in the stolen email case and represented
[03:59.720 --> 04:08.760]  the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering case, clear bias, clear conflict of interest, Aaron
[04:08.760 --> 04:16.760]  Zelinski, right hand man to Rod Rosenstein, recommended for his position on the special
[04:16.760 --> 04:23.760]  counsel team by Rosenstein in violation of the Department of Justice regulations that
[04:23.760 --> 04:28.840]  require independence from the Justice Department of the Special Counsel.
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.280]  He's a former counselor at the U.S. State Department under...
[04:32.280 --> 04:35.920]  Stay there Roger, stay there, back in 60 seconds, you'll have the floor to go through this and
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.520]  the good news is even non-Fox channels are starting to have to admit Jeannie Ray that
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.840]  ran the foundation and covered up Hillary and Uranium One is one of the lead prosecutors.
[04:45.840 --> 04:52.080]  I mean this is like having Captain Hook oversee stopping pirate raids or something.
[04:52.080 --> 04:57.000]  It's like having Long John Silver, you know, running your anti-pirate operations or having
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.320]  a giant Fox guard the henhouse.
[04:59.320 --> 05:06.240]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[05:06.240 --> 05:10.680]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can
[05:10.680 --> 05:12.640]  leave you more tired than ever.
[05:12.640 --> 05:18.000]  Turbo Force from InfoWarsLife is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins,
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.240]  amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity and
[05:23.240 --> 05:28.280]  a boost of energy on the go.
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.720]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.
[05:33.720 --> 05:38.160]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock
[05:38.160 --> 05:41.920]  up on whenever you need a boost.
[05:41.920 --> 05:47.280]  Perfect for work, in the car or at home, Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish
[05:47.280 --> 05:48.280]  day.
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.080]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[05:50.080 --> 06:17.920]  Curc up with Turbo Force at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:17.920 --> 06:28.920]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[06:28.920 --> 06:33.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:33.680 --> 06:35.400]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:35.400 --> 06:36.960]  Well so does he.
[06:36.960 --> 06:41.520]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:41.520 --> 06:45.240]  As I've said for many, many years, I don't know how this fight with the globalists is
[06:45.240 --> 06:50.840]  going to end with their evil bastards and they deserve somebody to go head up against them.
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.480]  So I told them once and I told them a thousand times, you want to fight, you better believe
[06:55.480 --> 06:56.480]  you've got one.
[06:56.480 --> 07:00.480]  My only frustration is I can't fight hard enough like I'd like to.
[07:00.480 --> 07:03.320]  Well, tomorrow's news, today.
[07:03.320 --> 07:07.920]  We first wrote the definitive article about iPhones 10 years ago when they first came
[07:07.920 --> 07:14.880]  out that if you knew how to manipulate it, you could turn somebody's microphone on even
[07:14.880 --> 07:16.760]  without them knowing.
[07:16.760 --> 07:17.760]  It's on purpose.
[07:17.760 --> 07:19.360]  Now it's the top story in the country.
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.360]  That's coming up.
[07:20.360 --> 07:23.720]  We'll show you articles where we first wrote about this 10 years ago, specifically on the
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.160]  iPhones, 14 years ago and 13 years ago on computers in general.
[07:28.160 --> 07:29.160]  That's coming up.
[07:29.160 --> 07:31.600]  But first, talk about tomorrow's news.
[07:31.600 --> 07:39.480]  Today, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone is giving us the world exclusive after his arraignment.
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.320]  There were hundreds of cameras and reporters out front just 30 minutes ago when he came
[07:43.320 --> 07:49.920]  out, but he was shouted down from the giant throng of reporters and the huge stand of
[07:49.920 --> 07:52.640]  more than 40 microphones.
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.040]  They screamed, you're a Russian agent, you're going to prison, lock him up.
[07:56.040 --> 07:59.920]  They did not want him to have his free speech to defend himself.
[07:59.920 --> 08:04.320]  And so Owen Schreuer and Roger were ready to make statements, their co-host about the
[08:04.320 --> 08:05.400]  attack on the First Amendment.
[08:05.400 --> 08:09.920]  But that was stopped even worse than what happened when he got out of the jail there
[08:09.920 --> 08:16.760]  in Florida on his own reconnaissance bond last Friday and last Saturday morning.
[08:16.760 --> 08:23.840]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone is here to give us this world exclusive today
[08:23.840 --> 08:28.240]  on what really happened inside and what's coming next.
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.040]  So Roger, thank you for joining us.
[08:30.040 --> 08:33.040]  Alex, this is my very first interview.
[08:33.040 --> 08:36.280]  The interviews are not allowed in the courthouse.
[08:36.280 --> 08:42.560]  I wanted very much to go outside and make a statement, but I was shouted down by crazed
[08:42.560 --> 08:46.840]  electists who, of course, revere the First Amendment.
[08:46.840 --> 08:53.440]  And some members of the media shouting insulting questions before I could say a word, I want
[08:53.440 --> 09:00.840]  to speak someplace where I can actually be heard, not try to speak over people to be
[09:00.840 --> 09:06.960]  heard over there shouting and cursing and spitting and pushing, which is what that mob
[09:06.960 --> 09:08.680]  scene was like.
[09:08.680 --> 09:14.080]  Very grateful to the federal marshals and to the protective services who worked for the
[09:14.080 --> 09:17.880]  government who helped me get safely to a car.
[09:17.880 --> 09:20.720]  We were then held by Paparazzi.
[09:20.720 --> 09:32.720]  Roger, I know you're on the move with Paparazzi following you that you haven't gotten a location
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.280]  to do Skype with us, but let's wait a moment to get to a better location so that we can
[09:38.280 --> 09:39.480]  actually hear what you have to say.
[09:39.480 --> 09:40.600]  Now, go ahead and try again.
[09:40.600 --> 09:43.560]  You were saying that you were thankful to the federal marshals.
[09:43.560 --> 09:44.560]  Yes.
[09:44.560 --> 09:46.440]  I may hopefully act a little better.
[09:46.440 --> 09:47.440]  Yes, it is.
[09:47.440 --> 09:48.440]  Okay.
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.040]  Yes, I was grateful to the federal marshals and the protective services for helping me
[09:54.040 --> 10:01.080]  get safely to a car with my attorneys to believe what was a chaotic scene.
[10:01.080 --> 10:07.240]  I'm also very grateful to the many employers and other Trump supporters, patriots, who
[10:07.240 --> 10:15.880]  showed up in support for me because I pled not guilty today in a very clear voice at
[10:15.880 --> 10:24.600]  the government's prosecution table, fat Jeannie Ray, smirking, she was Hillary Clinton's personal
[10:24.600 --> 10:33.960]  attorney in the stolen email, pardon me, the illegal server, the missing email case.
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.000]  She represented the Clinton Foundation against charges of racketeering.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.080]  This is Hillary Clinton's personal attack dog.
[10:42.080 --> 10:49.040]  Hillary at the table, Aaron Zalinski, formerly special department counselor to Hillary Clinton's
[10:49.040 --> 10:55.960]  State Department, and then top assistant to Rod Rosenstein in the U.S. Attorney's Office
[10:55.960 --> 10:56.960]  in Baltimore.
[10:56.960 --> 11:03.600]  His emails are among the emails that were allegedly hacked and released by WikiLeaks.
[11:03.600 --> 11:10.800]  Both of them have a clear conflict of interest, but they are charter members of the Get Stone
[11:10.800 --> 11:20.360]  strike force and other prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office here in the district.
[11:20.360 --> 11:28.600]  They would not allow my lawyer, Bruce Rogau, one of the leading First Amendment attorneys
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.560]  in the country, one of the leading civil and criminal attorneys, a man who was appeared
[11:33.560 --> 11:40.760]  before the U.S. Supreme Court 11 times, they would not allow him to be heard because his
[11:40.760 --> 11:48.040]  paperwork had not been filed in time to permit him to appear before the court, Pro-Hawk
[11:48.040 --> 11:49.040]  V.J.
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.680]  The government didn't object to his being appearing.
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.320]  They could have waived him in.
[11:55.320 --> 12:02.800]  The magistrate declined, but I was able to represent it, and I plead not guilty.
[12:02.800 --> 12:10.600]  I'm subject to the same travel restrictions and all other restrictions that were imposed
[12:10.600 --> 12:16.880]  by the court in Florida on Friday.
[12:16.880 --> 12:22.560]  There was no suggestion of a gag order, but this would not have been the appropriate time
[12:22.560 --> 12:29.240]  that I suspect it will be coming from Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who essentially ordered
[12:29.240 --> 12:36.920]  torture for Paul Maniforte to torture him and who has rejected every challenge to Robert
[12:36.920 --> 12:38.240]  Mueller's authority.
[12:38.240 --> 12:41.760]  She, at this point, will be the judge in my case.
[12:41.760 --> 12:43.760]  We'll see about that.
[12:43.760 --> 12:45.480]  This is a lynching.
[12:45.480 --> 12:51.920]  This is a legal lynching of me because I appear on InfoWars because I'm friends with Alex
[12:51.920 --> 12:54.880]  Jones because I support Donald Trump.
[12:54.880 --> 13:00.000]  I support him for president, and I still support him because I helped take down the
[13:00.000 --> 13:08.600]  evil queen, the foul-mouthed, short-tempered, self-centered, claptocrat Hilary Clinton.
[13:08.600 --> 13:09.600]  War criminal.
[13:09.600 --> 13:10.600]  War criminal.
[13:10.600 --> 13:11.600]  Venal criminal.
[13:11.600 --> 13:17.720]  Traitor who sold the nation out, and we're going to listen to your crimes, it takes
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.720]  a while.
[13:18.720 --> 13:25.040]  And the irony, of course, is that I'm charged with perjury lying before Congress, which
[13:25.040 --> 13:35.400]  I'm not guilty of, Comey, Brennan, McCabe, Clapper, Hilary herself, Homa Abadi, Cheryl
[13:35.400 --> 13:36.400]  Mills.
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.120]  These people did lie about material matters, about consequential matters.
[13:42.120 --> 13:44.480]  And we've broken that down, so let me ask you this, Roger.
[13:44.480 --> 13:46.400]  Why do they think they can get away with it?
[13:46.400 --> 13:52.320]  I was really an astounding Hannity last night, the way he pretty much teleprompter-free
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.720]  raged through everything, had you on, but that even Chris Christie had to admit, he's
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.200]  a former federal prosecutor, as folks know, that this, the raid on you, this whole thing
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.920]  is a political witch hunt, that the Clintons did commit crimes, that the servers were illegal,
[14:05.920 --> 14:09.480]  that they've all been caught perjuring themselves to Congress.
[14:09.480 --> 14:14.120]  McCabe and Rosenstein all lied and said the president wasn't under espionage investigation
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.160]  as others had told him he was, as we told him he was, turned out they lied to Congress
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.360]  and the president and the judiciary with fake warrants.
[14:21.360 --> 14:23.320]  I mean, we have them.
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.120]  This isn't catching the kid with the hand in the cookie jar.
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.800]  This is catching the kid putting the whole cookie jar in their mouth.
[14:31.800 --> 14:34.400]  I mean, this is red, fricking handed.
[14:34.400 --> 14:40.960]  Well, the problem, of course, is that Donald Trump does not control his own Justice Department.
[14:40.960 --> 14:46.160]  It was announced last week that the Justice Department under Donald Trump intends to refile
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.240]  the Bundy case in Nevada, which is outrageous.
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.360]  They continue to do nothing about Uranium-1.
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.440]  They continue to do nothing about the Rogues Gallery you just mentioned.
[14:57.440 --> 15:03.160]  Christopher Wray, the FBI director who must have approved this over-the-top raid on my
[15:03.160 --> 15:10.880]  home, pays no penalty for his lies to Congress, yet he sends 29 FBI agents and SWAT gear to
[15:10.880 --> 15:20.240]  branching assault weapons, assault rifles, wearing night goggles to rouse me and my 71-year-old
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.240]  wife.
[15:21.240 --> 15:26.640]  Guys, you'll kill me for saying that out of bed when I don't own a firearm despite
[15:26.640 --> 15:28.240]  my strong support for the Justice Department.
[15:28.240 --> 15:29.240]  Roger.
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.400]  Roger Stone is giving us a World Exclusive, again, World Exclusive, linked up on InfoWars.com.
[15:33.400 --> 15:34.400]  Share this link.
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.400]  It will go viral.
[15:35.400 --> 15:38.920]  People need to actually hear from him because it's bigger than Roger, bigger than InfoWars.
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.080]  It's about taking down Trump in this nationalist movement.
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.680]  He was just a reigned, pled not guilty, tried to come out and have a press conference, was
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.080]  shouted down by leftist, waving Russian flags, they could try to frame him further.
[15:50.080 --> 15:53.600]  Took a left dressing up by KKK people and going to the NRA rallies.
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.120]  We'll be back with Roger Stone and what's coming next.
[15:56.120 --> 15:57.120]  Stay with us.
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.920]  A doctor's office visit for a rectile dysfunction on my smartphone?
[16:02.920 --> 16:03.920]  That's crazy.

[17:28.640 --> 17:34.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  the world.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.040]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.040 --> 17:44.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.800]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.800 --> 17:48.800]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.800 --> 17:50.360]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.360 --> 17:56.920]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available

[19:00.160 --> 19:02.480]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[19:02.480 --> 19:04.200]  There is no set stasis.
[19:04.200 --> 19:05.440]  There is no managed system.
[19:05.440 --> 19:07.040]  There is no un-continuum.
[19:07.040 --> 19:12.720]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future, so you support us and get creative

[19:15.680 --> 19:16.880]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.600]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[19:21.600 --> 19:24.440]  and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[19:24.440 --> 19:26.040]  And that's really where this goes.
[19:26.040 --> 19:28.360]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[19:28.360 --> 19:32.040]  And so, if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mal
[19:32.040 --> 19:35.400]  Seaton, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[19:35.400 --> 19:39.760]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[19:39.760 --> 19:40.760]  ready to fight.
[19:40.760 --> 19:43.360]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[19:43.360 --> 19:45.360]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[19:45.360 --> 19:49.000]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master belt.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.200]  I want to go to the next level.
[19:50.200 --> 19:54.800]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[19:54.800 --> 19:57.440]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[19:57.440 --> 19:58.560]  I want life.
[19:58.560 --> 20:27.440]  I want Jesus live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[20:27.440 --> 20:31.160]  It's a world exclusive.
[20:31.160 --> 20:35.600]  It wouldn't be a world exclusive, but the leftist mobs hundreds of them out there overpowered
[20:35.600 --> 20:39.920]  the hundreds of reporters literally when they came out of the federal courthouse and wouldn't
[20:39.920 --> 20:42.080]  let him speak at a press conference.
[20:42.080 --> 20:43.080]  So he's here.
[20:43.080 --> 20:45.760]  Roger Stone, infowars.com talk show host.
[20:45.760 --> 20:49.480]  He hosts the War Room with Owen Schreuer, 3 to 6 p.m. every weekday.
[20:49.480 --> 20:53.480]  A lot of the media keeps calling me saying, why'd you hire Roger?
[20:53.480 --> 20:54.480]  Because he has a lot of contacts.
[20:54.480 --> 20:58.760]  I mean, why was he a consultant and a paid contributor to Fox News for many years?
[20:58.760 --> 21:00.600]  Yes, he was.
[21:00.600 --> 21:04.760]  Because he's interesting because he knows a lot of people and he's a good political
[21:04.760 --> 21:05.760]  correspondent.
[21:05.760 --> 21:09.680]  But again, they demonize all of our speech like it's dirty and bad and the left is not
[21:09.680 --> 21:10.680]  the left.
[21:10.680 --> 21:16.280]  They are the murderers of speech so they can then frame you and you can't defend yourself.
[21:16.280 --> 21:19.280]  They're true cowards, but he's here with the world exclusive.
[21:19.280 --> 21:24.760]  Now Matthew Whitaker seemed sweaty, seemed nervous, seemed shaken yesterday.
[21:24.760 --> 21:35.440]  The interim AG, while Robert Mueller's literal mentor, Mr. Burr, is prepared to be confirmed.
[21:35.440 --> 21:41.660]  This was the beginning of the Bush, HW Bush CIA taking over the FBI dynasty in 1989.
[21:41.660 --> 21:45.000]  This is the guy from the CIA, worked directly under George Robert Walker Bush.
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.760]  This is the guy that brought in Mueller.
[21:46.760 --> 21:50.800]  I mean, this is the legion of doom.
[21:50.800 --> 21:55.520]  And so Trump got tricked into that because Burr put out some memos criticizing Mueller.
[21:55.520 --> 21:56.520]  Total stage deal.
[21:56.520 --> 21:57.520]  Please don't throw him in the briar patch.
[21:57.520 --> 22:01.720]  So I want to get Rogers to take on Whitaker claiming that the investigation is winding
[22:01.720 --> 22:02.720]  down.
[22:02.720 --> 22:06.000]  But then we see all the news saying actually a bunch of new indictments are about to happen.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  Here it is.
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.800]  We briefed on the investigation and, you know, I look forward to Director Mueller delivering
[22:14.800 --> 22:20.640]  the final report, and I really am not going to talk about opening an ongoing investigation
[22:20.640 --> 22:21.640]  otherwise.
[22:21.640 --> 22:25.400]  But, you know, sort of the statements that I made was a private citizen only with publicly
[22:25.400 --> 22:27.600]  available information.
[22:27.600 --> 22:35.760]  And I, you know, I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed,
[22:35.760 --> 22:38.480]  you know, either through the various means we have.
[22:38.480 --> 22:44.260]  But right now, you know, the investigation is, I think, close to being completed.
[22:44.260 --> 22:49.480]  And I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as we can, as possible.
[22:49.480 --> 22:53.800]  If I had to read the body language and the way he speaks compared to what he normally
[22:53.800 --> 22:56.360]  does, very confidently, he's very nervous.
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.080]  He's not sure about what he's saying.
[22:58.080 --> 23:01.040]  They've given him conflicting info, but the president's pissed off, so he's telling him
[23:01.040 --> 23:02.040]  everything's fine.
[23:02.040 --> 23:05.880]  And these 80-plus other fake investigations that were stirred up from Russiagate that
[23:05.880 --> 23:09.120]  have nothing to do with Russiagate are about to be launched and that Mueller's going to
[23:09.120 --> 23:13.880]  put out a report and then trigger a whole bunch of other fake investigations harassing
[23:13.880 --> 23:14.880]  everybody around Trump.
[23:14.880 --> 23:15.880]  What do you think, Rodgerstone?
[23:15.880 --> 23:20.600]  Well, I think they're going to hand off a number of these to the Southern District
[23:20.600 --> 23:25.760]  of New York, which is a nest of left-wing Democrats that have not been replaced.
[23:25.760 --> 23:30.640]  You know, the president has not gotten control of large swaths of his own government.
[23:30.640 --> 23:38.400]  There are contingents within the Justice Department, within the courts, who are part of the resistance.
[23:38.400 --> 23:45.000]  And they know that it has to take me down in order to take Donald Trump down.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.600]  They know that they have to take info wars down because they don't want us to tell the
[23:49.600 --> 23:53.200]  American people what they're up to.
[23:53.200 --> 23:54.200]  It's insidious.
[23:54.200 --> 23:55.200]  It's ruthless.
[23:55.200 --> 24:03.440]  Alex, I'm facing potentially 45 years in jail, I'm 66, which Trevor Noah likes to make
[24:03.440 --> 24:04.440]  fun of.
[24:04.440 --> 24:11.280]  That's not funny at all, and then people saying, well, now Stone knows how black people feel.
[24:11.280 --> 24:12.680]  Let me say something.
[24:12.680 --> 24:18.960]  I've been speaking out against the 1994 crime bill that the Clintons hoisted on Black Americans
[24:18.960 --> 24:20.320]  for 15 years.
[24:20.320 --> 24:26.440]  I have been calling for sentencing reform and I have spoken out against the ethnominias
[24:26.440 --> 24:27.440]  bill.
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.640]  You wrote a book about it three years before Trump actually did it, but notice you and
[24:32.640 --> 24:37.400]  Trump don't get credit, you're the KKK for fighting the real KKK Hillary.
[24:37.400 --> 24:45.000]  I mean, it's extraordinary that these people don't know anything about me.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.160]  You know, Stone is a, I'm a libertarian conservative.
[24:49.160 --> 24:50.160]  Everybody knows that.
[24:50.160 --> 24:55.400]  I've spoken and written, I bolted the party to support Gary Johnson because it was clear
[24:55.400 --> 24:59.040]  to me that Mitt Romney was a phony and a globalist.
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.400]  So they want to put you in a box where you don't belong.
[25:04.400 --> 25:11.200]  I've been speaking out for drug law reform and against the harsh sentencing that black
[25:11.200 --> 25:16.600]  people and African Americans and people of color are subject to under the Clintons.
[25:16.600 --> 25:19.960]  Everybody knows you're a nationalist, you're an anti-communist, but you're quite frankly
[25:19.960 --> 25:26.480]  very liberal when it comes to things that adults do, but you're also pro-life for children
[25:26.480 --> 25:27.480]  at the same time.
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.600]  You want to guard children, protect innocent, but as an adult, you believe consenting adults
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.480]  have a right in this country to do whatever they want.
[25:33.480 --> 25:35.640]  People have a right to criticize it and say it's wrong.
[25:35.640 --> 25:36.640]  Everybody knows that thing.
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.520]  Ms. Cashew is this big devil, but let's focus on the time we have left here.
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.480]  You just heard what Whitaker had to say, seemed very, very nervous, was very, very disconcerting.
[25:45.480 --> 25:50.320]  He called Mueller director Mueller like he's God, this God-like creature.
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.720]  We also, I'm glad as he Tucker Carlson and others now calling him that because that's
[25:53.720 --> 25:54.720]  what it is.
[25:54.720 --> 25:59.280]  It's a total joke with the left fawning at the police state's feet, and then of course
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.960]  you weren't gagged at this magistrate hearing, but you have another hearing coming up Friday,
[26:02.960 --> 26:04.960]  so tell us about that.
[26:04.960 --> 26:07.400]  Well, this is a pre-trial conference.
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.560]  Sooner or later, the government will move to gag me, but if I have a right to remain
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.440]  silent under the Constitution, I also have a right to defend myself, and I make a living
[26:18.440 --> 26:24.700]  writing and speaking here on info wars, writing at the Stone Cold Truth, he ended info wars,
[26:24.700 --> 26:29.320]  I get the daily caller where I am the men's style editor, so they would be depriving me
[26:29.320 --> 26:32.920]  of making a living if I am entirely gagged.
[26:32.920 --> 26:34.880]  So we will oppose that.
[26:34.880 --> 26:41.720]  It's interesting that Paul Manafort's attorney did not oppose the gag order in court.
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.000]  I can't even understand that, but then he didn't mount much of a public defense.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.800]  I have been defending myself and will from day one.
[26:51.800 --> 26:56.280]  It is extraordinary the way I look at it.
[26:56.280 --> 27:03.240]  Alex, I was arrested by CNN on Friday, and they brought a few FBI agents with them.
[27:03.240 --> 27:08.880]  The fact that the producer who was outside my house 15 minutes from 15 feet from my front
[27:08.880 --> 27:16.080]  door filming my arrest was a former assistant to the FBI director, James Comey, and a long
[27:16.080 --> 27:18.680]  time staff member at the FBI.
[27:18.680 --> 27:23.280]  And the CNN saying they weren't tipped off in advance, the street was sealed.
[27:23.280 --> 27:25.720]  There were no other media allowed on the street.
[27:25.720 --> 27:28.760]  It's a crime, it's a crime, and everybody knows it.
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.120]  So Roger, obviously you're going to be back on via Skype on the war room, you're going
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.800]  to be staying in DC a few days.
[27:33.800 --> 27:37.600]  Tell people about other court dates coming up, we're only exclusive info.
[27:37.600 --> 27:40.000]  That's really all we know at this time.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.520]  You know, I'm going to be meeting with my team of lawyers this afternoon to start plotting
[27:44.520 --> 27:45.520]  legal strategy.
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.560]  I need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com to pay for those lawyers.
[27:50.560 --> 27:51.560]  They're very expensive.
[27:51.560 --> 27:59.360]  I'm an unarmed man at this point in terms of the resources to fight the taxpayer-financed
[27:59.360 --> 28:06.920]  platoons, poor platoons of Ivy League left-wing smart-ass lawyers who want to lock me up for
[28:06.920 --> 28:07.920]  the rest of my life.
[28:07.920 --> 28:08.920]  And that's what this is.
[28:08.920 --> 28:09.920]  We're being punished.
[28:09.920 --> 28:13.320]  Info wars is being sued, attacked a lot about you're trying to throw you in prison.
[28:13.320 --> 28:18.160]  We rallied America, the world's now rallying, our listeners rallied America, it's our audience
[28:18.160 --> 28:19.160]  they fear.
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.400]  And if they can get rid of me and dissipate you and others, they think then everybody
[28:22.400 --> 28:25.640]  will just kind of break up and that that wave of resistance won't be there.
[28:25.640 --> 28:28.000]  They are gravely, gravely mistaken.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.200]  Roger, we will talk to you again very, very soon.
[28:31.200 --> 28:35.400]  I know you've got to go, but when you join us again this afternoon, we'll have the HD
[28:35.400 --> 28:38.480]  footage of the thronging, hateful mass out there.
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.160]  There were some supporters as well trying to stop your free speech.
[28:42.160 --> 28:43.160]  Simply amazing.
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.160]  We'll talk to you again soon today.
[28:44.160 --> 28:45.160]  Godspeed.
[28:45.160 --> 28:52.840]  All right, folks, infowars.com, newswars.com, presidentbladded.com, tomorrow's news today.
[28:52.840 --> 28:54.920]  And info wars must have your support.
[28:54.920 --> 28:57.440]  We are absolutely fighting for our lives right now.
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.280]  Thank you for the support.
[28:59.280 --> 29:01.800]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[29:01.800 --> 29:04.360]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[29:04.360 --> 29:08.560]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[29:08.560 --> 29:09.640]  of control.
[29:09.640 --> 29:15.000]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.840]  using prescription drugs.
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.120]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[29:21.120 --> 29:22.120]  me.
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.120]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.640]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[29:28.640 --> 29:31.360]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[29:31.360 --> 29:32.840]  Get sober now.
[29:32.840 --> 29:36.120]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.

[33:46.840 --> 33:51.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:51.400 --> 34:02.800]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are tomorrow's news today, we are next week's news today, we're
[34:06.520 --> 34:09.840]  next year's news today, we're next decade's news today.
[34:09.840 --> 34:14.480]  I'm telling you how Trump should declare national emergency on the border for the last
[34:14.480 --> 34:15.480]  two plus years.
[34:15.480 --> 34:19.840]  I've been saying for four months that it's imminent and I believe it will happen if he
[34:19.840 --> 34:27.760]  does the right thing in the next 20 days after this latest government restart elapses.
[34:27.760 --> 34:32.960]  I said that the government shutdown was the wrong way to go because the Democrats want
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.120]  to plunge the economy and that that would take billions out of the economy every week
[34:37.120 --> 34:44.320]  and would sow insecurity, limbaugh and culture, everybody else, I'm not attacking, but they
[34:44.320 --> 34:51.360]  all went after Trump and said, show her who's boss, shut it down.
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.320]  Why not just circumvent her when you've got the authority with a classic national emergency
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.320]  on the border and just do that and say, see who's the boss lady?
[35:00.320 --> 35:07.680]  Now Trump surrogates her going, wow, this 30-something day shutdown probably cost us $10 billion.
[35:07.680 --> 35:10.880]  That cost double what we wanted on the wall.
[35:10.880 --> 35:16.720]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[35:16.720 --> 35:23.640]  So Trump was right to come out and say, okay, here's DACA, here's everything you want because
[35:23.640 --> 35:26.440]  remember that he did that a year and a half ago, they said, no, we want no borders, no
[35:26.440 --> 35:29.320]  walls, no USA at all.
[35:29.320 --> 35:33.040]  Remember that?
[35:33.040 --> 35:35.280]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[35:35.280 --> 35:41.840]  And so with the real American people, not the fake polls, folks really see through that.
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.200]  That's why in most polls of Hispanics, he's increased 19 to 25 points just in the last
[35:46.200 --> 35:50.880]  six months because people actually hearing who Donald Trump is versus what they say,
[35:50.880 --> 35:52.880]  that he says all Mexicans are criminals.
[35:52.880 --> 35:58.800]  No, he said a lot of people coming up illegally are their worst people, which is true.
[35:58.800 --> 36:03.160]  They're not sitting there doctors or lawyers.
[36:03.160 --> 36:07.360]  And America's putting a fence around Venezuela, they don't want their worst.
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.760]  Would you want five million people from Venezuela just showing up in your country?
[36:11.760 --> 36:16.840]  No, you wouldn't if you had any sanity and your country was more wealthy than them.
[36:16.840 --> 36:24.720]  So you got Camila Harris giving her first speech since she announced yesterday at a
[36:24.720 --> 36:27.920]  armed facility with armed guards and fences around her.
[36:27.920 --> 36:37.080]  This is a war on common sense, a war on reality, because these people all live behind heavily
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.080]  armed guards with fences and walls and checkpoints.
[36:41.080 --> 36:47.480]  And then they say the front door to our country and the back door of our country should not
[36:47.480 --> 36:51.880]  have any order.
[36:51.880 --> 36:53.040]  It's wild.
[36:53.040 --> 36:56.000]  She says, by the way, get rid of private insurance, everything's free.
[36:56.000 --> 37:04.560]  So you're having a race to the far extreme left by Alexandria Cortez and by Harris and
[37:04.560 --> 37:07.360]  by Pocahontas and by Bernie Sanders.
[37:07.360 --> 37:11.280]  And they're showing you who they really are.
[37:11.280 --> 37:18.240]  And just the free healthcare would be the entire federal budget every year and then
[37:18.240 --> 37:19.240]  some.
[37:19.240 --> 37:21.960]  And of course, it'll drive prices up too.
[37:21.960 --> 37:25.360]  Of course, you know who's going to administer the new national healthcare.
[37:25.360 --> 37:26.920]  There won't be insurance anymore.
[37:26.920 --> 37:32.120]  The big insurance companies actually wrote this years ago that once they bankrupted things
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.000]  with the Obamacare, it was meant to totally bankrupt things and make them triple in prices.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.480]  You would then beg for the other solution.
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.120]  Remember Ezekiel Emanuel said this on Fox News and CNN.
[37:42.120 --> 37:43.920]  I played the clip probably 100 times.
[37:43.920 --> 37:45.240]  I bet it's still on YouTube.
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.640]  Let's see if we can find Ezekiel Emanuel admits Obamacare is meant to bankrupt, create single
[37:50.640 --> 37:52.240]  payer.
[37:52.240 --> 37:57.200]  But then you've got four insurance companies, far and owned, against hundreds of others
[37:57.200 --> 38:04.600]  that aren't, who don't want competition and who, ladies and gentlemen, won a monopoly.
[38:04.600 --> 38:10.480]  And then they will administer the government funds that everyone has and the taxes you
[38:10.480 --> 38:11.480]  pay.
[38:11.480 --> 38:16.680]  Oh, you'll still be paying for healthcare, you're going to pay dearly.
[38:16.680 --> 38:17.680]  So it's amazing.
[38:17.680 --> 38:25.000]  It's absolutely amazing to have Ezekiel Emanuel who helped write it with Jonathan Gruber on
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.360]  Fox News saying it's not meant to work.
[38:29.360 --> 38:34.080]  It's going to get rid of the insurance system as we know and bring in single payer.
[38:34.080 --> 38:35.920]  So there you are.
[38:35.920 --> 38:38.200]  And they're doing it and they're pushing it.
[38:38.200 --> 38:44.220]  And I'm not bashing all the Republicans who have been establishing the pastor now acting
[38:44.220 --> 38:49.160]  like they're the super hardcore vanguard of the cutting edge for America criticizing
[38:49.160 --> 38:50.160]  Trump.
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.800]  I'm not just defending Trump because I like to defend Trump.
[38:53.800 --> 38:56.360]  I get attacked when I defend Trump from every side.
[38:56.360 --> 39:02.360]  It's that he shouldn't have done the emergency the way he did it, shutting the government
[39:02.360 --> 39:03.360]  down.
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.520]  That's an emergency that puts the ball in Pelosi's court.
[39:06.520 --> 39:12.280]  A government shutdown is an emergency when you've got the executive power to do the emergency
[39:12.280 --> 39:15.000]  and cut her out of the loop and do whatever you want.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.240]  Oh, sir, the courts will sue you.
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.720]  A president can ignore courts.
[39:22.720 --> 39:25.760]  Only the Congress should be the judge with an impeachment.
[39:25.760 --> 39:28.960]  Most presidents in our past ignored courts.
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.920]  Unless it's the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court, even though all these other night circuits
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.000]  and things have voted against Trump every time, every time it gets to the Supreme Court,
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.040]  it's just a few months, it's unanimous because it's in the law when he banned people from
[39:43.040 --> 39:44.040]  seven countries.
[39:44.040 --> 39:49.520]  I'm going to go to break and come back with the biggest news of the day, though.
[39:49.520 --> 39:58.040]  I'm going to come back and get to the biggest news of the day, ladies and gentlemen, that's
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.600]  so incredibly vital because it's why they want us off the air.
[40:02.600 --> 40:04.040]  It's why they want to shut down.
[40:04.040 --> 40:08.240]  And it's because infor worse credibility is so high.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.560]  We expose the world government.
[40:09.560 --> 40:11.400]  We expose the planetary system.
[40:11.400 --> 40:14.860]  We expose the 1776 reboot resistance.
[40:14.860 --> 40:20.200]  We expose the Panopticon surveillance grid of all the systems spying and tracking in real
[40:20.200 --> 40:22.880]  time and them lying to us about all of it.
[40:22.880 --> 40:26.200]  We told you exactly how the whole thing operated and worked.
[40:26.200 --> 40:28.840]  We did our studies.
[40:28.840 --> 40:43.040]  And now, and now, we have, what happens, guys, sometimes is they talk to me and tell
[40:43.040 --> 40:46.560]  me they have clips and things ready and I don't hear what they say and I kind of hit
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.440]  the cough button and go, hey, tell me what you're saying, and then they're off doing
[40:50.440 --> 40:51.440]  something.
[40:51.440 --> 40:53.840]  So I have to kind of like wait a while to tell you what's coming up and I'm mad.
[40:53.840 --> 40:56.520]  It's just part of me directing the show live on air.
[40:56.520 --> 41:00.040]  That's one of the things that hiccups me and stuff and it just, it's the thing that makes
[41:00.040 --> 41:02.080]  me want to have a heart attack sometimes.
[41:02.080 --> 41:04.040]  But I'm going to refocus here.
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.760]  Just come back with it for you.
[41:07.760 --> 41:17.640]  Now, as I was saying, they want to shut us down because they know we're telling the truth
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.240]  and they know we can stop them and they're a bunch of arrogant bastards that love to
[41:21.240 --> 41:23.840]  brag about the crimes they've committed against you and your family.
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.720]  When we do have the Ezekiel Emanuel clip, I was speaking about, good job getting it.
[41:27.720 --> 41:28.720]  Here it is.
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.400]  People who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth.
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.440]  The grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow and frankly, they
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.200]  wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market.
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.440]  They want the people to go into the exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual
[41:47.440 --> 41:48.440]  market.
[41:48.440 --> 41:51.440]  The whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over
[41:51.440 --> 41:52.440]  time.
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.320]  They wanted to move millions of people into the exchanges.
[41:55.320 --> 42:00.200]  Insurance companies don't like the individual market as it's constructed.
[42:00.200 --> 42:01.520]  They see the future.
[42:01.520 --> 42:03.140]  That individual market is going away.
[42:03.140 --> 42:04.640]  They don't want to invest in it.
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.200]  That's why the president was like, let me finish.
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.840]  So they see the future where you don't have any choice and you pay whatever they want,
[42:11.840 --> 42:16.480]  triple prices, and then now all these different surgeries and different options and things
[42:16.480 --> 42:18.440]  are removed and you don't get them.
[42:18.440 --> 42:24.520]  And then only the ultra rich actually get second tier high quality private clinic healthcare.
[42:24.520 --> 42:25.680]  That's what Europe does.
[42:25.680 --> 42:26.680]  That's what Canada does.
[42:26.680 --> 42:29.000]  And unless you're rich, you can't get access.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.560]  You've got to get permission, by the way, from the state run medical systems in the
[42:32.560 --> 42:36.440]  UK to go get the higher tier private care.
[42:36.440 --> 42:39.400]  So there they are telling you the plan all along.
[42:39.400 --> 42:47.160]  And now here comes the pied pipers of Sanders and Harris and Cortez and all of them saying
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.760]  you're about to get free health care, free college, free everything and the third world's
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.080]  collapsing and racing towards America for their free lunch and a decade into it will
[42:56.080 --> 43:02.200]  be worse than Venezuela and the globals will take the money to Switzerland.

[47:03.600 --> 47:18.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:18.120 --> 47:23.360]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[47:23.360 --> 47:33.880]  I'm a friend of thunder, friend is it any wonder a lot of them strides me.
[47:33.880 --> 47:43.160]  I fought with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in, so he gave us all.
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.160]  Well that's the truth.
[47:45.160 --> 47:50.560]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[47:50.560 --> 47:52.560]  I can spot bad weather.
[47:52.560 --> 47:55.160]  We have some really big developments here.
[47:55.160 --> 48:00.360]  After almost two years, infamy, zeal for carnage inspired vegas shooter.
[48:00.360 --> 48:07.240]  We've got this giant whitewash that injured almost 900 people, killing a whole bunch
[48:07.240 --> 48:08.240]  of others.
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.560]  Now out, I know the inside story of it, I had to sign nondisclosures and things.
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.520]  For the videos I was shown, the things I was shown from around the country, what I was
[48:18.520 --> 48:25.800]  told also by FBI people that were on the scene, that it was an Islamic gun deal gone bad.
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.360]  It turns out that's all true, but now we've got the supposed final report and it is a
[48:30.360 --> 48:32.000]  load of baloney.
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  So that's coming up.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.320]  Now, I've been talking about this for a long, long time, and so regular listeners are going
[48:37.320 --> 48:42.880]  to be, okay, yeah, we know about this, you know about it, why are we covering it?
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.760]  It's because we have all the original documents, all the original articles going back 14 years
[48:47.760 --> 48:53.800]  ago is the first time that we can find, that we documented it.
[48:53.800 --> 48:58.760]  I know I did it earlier than that, actually 20 years ago when I was approached by NSA
[48:58.760 --> 49:01.760]  whistleblowers.
[49:01.760 --> 49:10.040]  Yet book signings and speeches I gave that turned out to be real former NSA people and
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.640]  others and they told me exactly what was already going on.
[49:13.640 --> 49:14.840]  So I talked about it.
[49:14.840 --> 49:21.280]  And I had famous authors on as well who'd written about the NSA and the CIA.
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.520]  So very early, we've been exposing this, but there's an article from September 8, 2006,
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.680]  government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans, then it goes
[49:31.680 --> 49:34.320]  through their actual admissions.
[49:34.320 --> 49:38.280]  So let's move into the biggest news now today.
[49:38.280 --> 49:44.640]  Oh my gosh, big giant world exclusive, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Apple Face
[49:44.640 --> 49:49.360]  Time allows people to call it and just hit two buttons.
[49:49.360 --> 49:54.520]  And even if you don't pick up, it turns on the microphone and the camera inside your
[49:54.520 --> 49:55.520]  house.
[49:55.520 --> 49:58.360]  Folks, they build that in their own purpose.
[49:58.360 --> 50:05.320]  The FBI had the phone company setup systems where they can call you, but even if you don't
[50:05.320 --> 50:12.760]  pick up in the old classic rotary phones and dial phones, landlines, and they just activate
[50:12.760 --> 50:19.960]  a special tone and it makes the phone not pick up.
[50:19.960 --> 50:21.600]  It picks up.
[50:21.600 --> 50:25.120]  So we're just learning about all these back doors.
[50:25.120 --> 50:28.640]  We're just learning and they're throwing it in our face, but I'm going to go over some
[50:28.640 --> 50:30.160]  of the history of this.
[50:30.160 --> 50:33.920]  It's in the terms of service, folks.
[50:33.920 --> 50:35.480]  And it's not just Apple that's doing this.
[50:35.480 --> 50:41.080]  So when Apple says what happens on your iPhone stays in your iPhone, well, fundamentally,
[50:41.080 --> 50:46.040]  that is like saying black is white, white is black, down is up, two plus two equals
[50:46.040 --> 50:49.360]  a million.
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.240]  The architecture has all moved towards cloud where your data is somewhere else and it's
[50:54.240 --> 50:57.000]  constantly getting hacked.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.080]  This has been designed like this.
[50:59.080 --> 51:03.000]  So we'll talk more about it in a moment.
[51:03.000 --> 51:11.680]  Now I'm going to just pull back here because I tend to get on air and get busy covering
[51:11.680 --> 51:19.560]  issues and then make promoting products and selling products kind of a side issue.
[51:19.560 --> 51:23.320]  And as long as I've got enough money coming in to operate the operation, I have a tendency
[51:23.320 --> 51:29.600]  to not build up reserves that we obviously definitely need.
[51:29.600 --> 51:34.080]  But bigger than that, we have products that everyone absolutely needs.
[51:34.080 --> 51:36.120]  We have the best supplements.
[51:36.120 --> 51:40.240]  We have the best water filtration and air filtration.
[51:40.240 --> 51:43.720]  We have the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, widest selection.
[51:43.720 --> 51:49.760]  We have the best shortwave radios and emergency gear and optics and so much more.
[51:49.760 --> 51:53.680]  Whatever is the best quality product out there for the best price, whether it's storeable
[51:53.680 --> 52:00.080]  foods or whether it's fish oil or whether it's next level energy and focus drinks like
[52:00.080 --> 52:02.600]  TurboForce, we have it.
[52:02.600 --> 52:06.800]  And so if you're into supplements, these are the best.
[52:06.800 --> 52:09.240]  If you know that you don't want your kids drinking life a saint and all the crap in the
[52:09.240 --> 52:14.760]  tap water, then for heaven's sakes, get an Alexa Pure Pro or an Alexa Pure System or
[52:14.760 --> 52:15.760]  a Pro Pure System.
[52:15.760 --> 52:19.800]  They're both excellent gravity-fed water filtration systems, very easy to use, they're
[52:19.800 --> 52:21.960]  tens of thousands of gallons a piece.
[52:21.960 --> 52:22.960]  Go there.
[52:22.960 --> 52:23.960]  Go up there.
[52:23.960 --> 52:24.960]  I want to thank those of you that have.
[52:24.960 --> 52:25.960]  It's amazing.
[52:25.960 --> 52:26.960]  Thank you.
[52:26.960 --> 52:29.680]  But this is a fundamental war against you and your family.
[52:29.680 --> 52:32.200]  They are literally trying to break the independent press in this country.
[52:32.200 --> 52:37.440]  I told you when I got banned seven months ago that soon everything questioning the establishment
[52:37.440 --> 52:41.560]  would be banned, then liberals would be banned, and then all you would have on YouTube is
[52:41.560 --> 52:45.280]  basically Netflix, a few hundred providers, maybe a few thousand.
[52:45.280 --> 52:48.800]  They now have announced that and say that it's not going to be YouTube anymore, that
[52:48.800 --> 52:53.000]  everybody's going to be blocked and totally shadow banned.
[52:53.000 --> 53:00.520]  If you question anything, you question war, you question open borders, you question vaccines,
[53:00.520 --> 53:04.560]  you question politicians, only the establishment's going to be hurt.
[53:04.560 --> 53:09.960]  And there's a deal with mainstream media to work as the police dog with the big tech companies
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.000]  to supposedly in this alliance they have.
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.720]  And part of that is so that big media doesn't report all the illegal surveillance and activity
[53:18.720 --> 53:20.320]  that big tech's involved in.
[53:20.320 --> 53:24.480]  So it's a trifecta of corrupt government with corrupt big tech and corrupt dying corporate
[53:24.480 --> 53:30.400]  media all triangulating in on the American people.
[53:30.400 --> 53:35.720]  So now it's oh, ban Alex Jones for fake reasons, make up while we're banning him, say he's
[53:35.720 --> 53:40.520]  a bad guy, silence him so he can't speak back to us.
[53:40.520 --> 53:43.400]  And then it's suddenly everybody.
[53:43.400 --> 53:48.560]  And then it's oh, you can't type that on your phone, you can't go to that website.
[53:48.560 --> 53:53.280]  Microsoft and others are announcing this consortium literally run by elements of the U.S. government
[53:53.280 --> 54:01.280]  and a consortium of private groups under NewsGuard, oh, it's protecting you, NewsGuard.
[54:01.280 --> 54:06.680]  And it's a consortium of all these horrible groups in your phone, live time, watching
[54:06.680 --> 54:11.600]  where you go and what you do and sending you messages and pop-ups.
[54:11.600 --> 54:15.000]  That launches next month.
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  Now do you understand?
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.960]  People are like, well, that's unbelievable.
[54:18.960 --> 54:25.760]  Just like I told you, with the actual internal prospectuses from Apple executives and Google
[54:25.760 --> 54:33.160]  executives and others 14, 15 years ago saying this is the future, I showed my wife this
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.480]  this weekend, we need to come in and do some of this just on air.
[54:37.480 --> 54:40.840]  And I said, watch, let's talk about Louis Vuitton bags, we never talked about Louis Vuitton
[54:40.840 --> 54:44.560]  bags, you don't have Louis Vuitton bags, you don't want Louis Vuitton bags, let's talk
[54:44.560 --> 54:47.680]  about Louis Vuitton bags because they've got microphones listening all the time on
[54:47.680 --> 54:53.000]  the phones and then it will watch pop-up ads on news sites and others we go to in a couple
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  of hours.
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.200]  Once they process, every few hours I've noticed, they process all the keywords you've said,
[54:59.200 --> 55:02.400]  how much you're coughing, how fast you're breathing, if you have a brain tumor, they
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.400]  monitor that, that's in the news today, how many breaths a minute you have, everything.
[55:07.400 --> 55:10.120]  It all goes into big AI computers.
[55:10.120 --> 55:15.840]  And sure enough, two hours later she goes, oh my God, I didn't type in Louis Vuitton,
[55:15.840 --> 55:19.040]  I'm on the New York Times and there's a Louis Vuitton ad and I said, yeah, watch, let me
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.640]  go to just a random newspaper, I go to it, not there, go to the next one, boom, Louis
[55:22.640 --> 55:23.640]  Vuitton.
[55:23.640 --> 55:29.120]  Now, they're admittedly doing it, but you understand, they aren't listening to you in
[55:29.120 --> 55:30.120]  live time.
[55:30.120 --> 55:33.720]  And the way mainstream corporate media does this decades after I tell you is say, oh,
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.560]  our smartphones listening and targeting us with ads, and then of course their own internal
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.320]  documents say they are.
[55:39.320 --> 55:42.040]  But notice that the media is just easing you into it.
[55:42.040 --> 55:47.360]  So here's some of the articles, major iPhone FaceTime bug lets you hear the audio of the
[55:47.360 --> 55:49.320]  person you're calling before they pick up.
[55:49.320 --> 55:52.640]  And even if they don't pick up, it lets you listen.
[55:52.640 --> 55:53.640]  Okay?
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.560]  Well, that's mainstream news, it must be true, it is, FaceTime bug lets iPhone users
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.520]  e-strap in a stumble for Apple, it's not a stumble, people are just now looking for
[56:03.520 --> 56:04.520]  this stuff.
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.040]  Infowars warned of government using microphones to spy on Americans 11 years ago.
[56:10.040 --> 56:17.560]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's article from last year.
[56:17.560 --> 56:21.840]  There's another one where Samsung came out four years ago and said, your smart TV is
[56:21.840 --> 56:24.600]  watching and listening to you and selling it to third parties.
[56:24.600 --> 56:30.120]  So they actually say in the terms of service, so watch what you say.
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.360]  I'm gonna say that again, just like an Alexa, just like a Google assist, just like any of
[56:35.360 --> 56:40.280]  these things you bring into your house, these Trojan horses, they're listening to you and
[56:40.280 --> 56:44.840]  now watching in many cases, they have cameras in live time, calling the police on you, you
[56:44.840 --> 56:45.840]  name it.
[56:45.840 --> 56:49.720]  And they're using all the data and they tell you, watch what you say, but see, I'm the
[56:49.720 --> 56:52.280]  one that first told you about it, so I'm the bad guy.
[56:52.280 --> 56:56.080]  I'm not the guy that was right about all this and next year's news today, no, no, I'm the
[56:56.080 --> 57:00.080]  evil Sandy Hook guy who won't quit bullying kids when I never even did that to begin with.
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.040]  That's how they brand folks that are right, so people don't listen to them.
[57:04.040 --> 57:08.320]  And I know you know that, but the general public doesn't, so everybody needs to get
[57:08.320 --> 57:12.760]  turbo force, everybody needs to get on a roll, highest quality fish oil for your kids, for
[57:12.760 --> 57:14.960]  their brains, their energy, everything.

[57:19.160 --> 57:22.440]  I think fish oil is a better new tropic than, you know, a lot of new tropics out there.

[59:10.240 --> 59:13.640]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[59:13.640 --> 59:18.440]  and the world back from the brink but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[59:18.440 --> 59:21.320]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[59:21.320 --> 59:27.080]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[59:27.080 --> 59:31.840]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way, I've committed
[59:31.840 --> 59:35.960]  to do that, I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen but you've
[59:35.960 --> 59:41.480]  got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual
[59:41.480 --> 59:45.920]  level, I physically will but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at
[59:45.920 --> 01:00:03.880]  infowarsore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:22.000]  So I'm going to give the number out next segment and start taking calls for first time callers
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.960]  on any subject you want to raise, any topic but I've got a few I want to throw out.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.120]  I've got a bunch of clips, a bunch of huge news, the world accelerating in the global
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.880]  crisis, admitted total censorship, total surveillance, worse than I ever even said,
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.200]  just out in the open, it is all coming up, the Super Bowl is talking about a casualist
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.680]  society, this is what big banks are saying they want within just two years, robots replacing
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.240]  humans, they're building a world that makes us obsolete but because I've not been plugging
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.920]  and talking about how to fund the show enough, I'm going to do it right now here on air
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:04.480]  before we go to break, I've been on air 24 years and I shut out to awaken America and
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.840]  the world because I believed that humanity weren't cowards and the humanity wasn't stupid
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.840]  that if folks were shown the facts of what was being constructed by the globalist, by
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:25.000]  the technocrats and that their end game is a anti-God, anti-human satanic world system,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.120]  I believed that good men and women would stand up and rally against it and I don't take
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.800]  all the credit for what's happened with M4 Wars, in fact I take very little of the credit
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.640]  because that goes back to what I just said, I believed there was a focal point laying
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:52.040]  it out with the evidence as only the internet coming into its own 24 years ago could allow
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:58.720]  up until that point in history that people would respond and that the population would
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.920]  start researching themselves and that it would trigger a chain reaction, I never intended
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:10.200]  though to be a hyper dominant leader at the forefront of this, I was always about having
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.120]  other guests and other individuals and groups on who were experts in their field to help
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.280]  inform the public even better than I could, but in the last 10 years M4 Wars became the
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:26.320]  dominant leader globally in rebooting nationalism and renaissance against the globalist post
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:33.640]  industrial neo feudalist system, but the globalist ignored that which was fine with me until
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.080]  about 3 years ago when they decided to use me against Trump and other nationalists by
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:45.280]  misrepresenting who I was and what I'd really said and taking me out of context, that miscalculation
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:53.080]  actually spread anti-New World Order information technology around the world faster and was
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.840]  critical in putting Trump over the top, just as Hillary thought oh he'll be the nominee
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.360]  but I'll beat him easier and that backfired, then she thought I'll say Alex shows us the
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.200]  dark heart and this evil demon and like Godzilla he's so powerful, then that blew up in her
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.600]  face and it only made us more powerful and then they made the decision because of all
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.600]  the chain reactions everywhere where there were fan videos every day with 5, 10 million
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.120]  views apiece and hundreds of millions of views a week on different platforms not even of
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.840]  my own show, but of derivatives of what I was saying and doing, they get the panic button
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.360]  and said we were already looking at total censorship in the next few years, but let's
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.000]  accelerate the plan start with him and then drop the hammer on everybody else and it's
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.880]  here, total surveillance, they're listening, they're watching on your phone, on your TV,
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.160]  it's going into AI computers, the technocracies on an incredible power trip, horrible leftist
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.320]  train to the universities to hate you and your family have been brought into these cults
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.800]  of big tech who are allowed to have access to everything you do, it's in the news today
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:03.040]  that you have a brain tumor, that you're pregnant, that you're depressed, that you have HIV,
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.720]  that you're gay, whatever it is, they're there raping your privacy while calling themselves
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.680]  liberal, they're a fraud.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.280]  So there are a lot of people out there asking for support and there are a lot of mainstream
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.000]  media outlets collapsing, we've stood the test of time, we would get bigger if we weren't
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.840]  since they're not smaller, but the things they've done to this and the things they pulled
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.560]  against info wars, give our audience doesn't realize how critical it is and don't keep
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:34.880]  spreading the word and don't keep sharing articles and videos and don't keep buying
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.880]  the great products you already need anyways, the globalist will be successful in the next
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.400]  year or so shutting down info wars, so I'm shooting up the bat signal here, you really
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.040]  supported some of the years, but the fight's now reaching the critical part of the battle
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.680]  and I need your commitment to get great products you already need but to steadfastly get them

[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:34.200]  You know we play ominous music because the globalists are very, very ominous people and
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.520]  I discovered yesterday that I did a bunch of research last night that made me physically
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.440]  sick to my stomach, like a compulsion to just go out and stop these people.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:53.320]  My body angry at me that I physically wasn't going to confront these individuals and that's
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.880]  Bill Marr when I had Owen Benjamin on yesterday, the well-known comedian who's known Marr
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:06.120]  for over a decade and I was like it's crazy he made pedophilic jokes about the Catholic
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:11.880]  school young men and children from Covington, we have the lawyer in studio tomorrow, he's
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.040]  here today.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:18.760]  And I said it's incredibly pedophilic and he also says he hates them and they started
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:24.120]  a fight a week after everybody knew that it was a hoax and Owen Benjamin said you don't
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.000]  know about him on politically incorrect saying that a 12-year-old having sex with an adult
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.040]  is love, a 35-year-old having sex with a little boy or little girl is love, that's the exact
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:41.040]  Nambla quote and I said no so the crew pulled it up and then we found other clips and then
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:47.800]  he goes oh Benjamin goes you don't know the name of his production company for 25 years
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800]  and I said no what is it?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:56.680]  He said it's kid love, kid love is one of the three handles used by Nambla and I said
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:03.760]  you're joking oh and he said no I'm dead serious, we went to IMDB, we even went to his main website
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:18.760]  and it's the name is kid love, kid love productions folks when I was growing up and I was hearing
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.680]  people that have been in the military as officers and people that have been in FBI and all these
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:28.720]  other places not in pencil pushing and paper pushing areas but real on the ground stuff
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.080]  I always heard and I always thought it was weird not true because I was a kid nobody
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:41.360]  ever tried to sexually touch me that the establishment was obsessed with raping and
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:47.240]  killing children and there was a whole secret government worldwide that entry into the club
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.960]  meant you had to kill children or at least rape them and then as I got older and I'm
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.440]  sitting there having dinner with General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.240]  Development, head of the HAARP program, guy that developed super secret space based weapons
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:07.080]  I mean it doesn't get more influential than him, the top engineer over huge clandestine
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.640]  programs and I've interviewed Stubblebine, head of Black Ops and everybody else and
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:18.440]  they confirmed it all as well, it's Parton even alive, last time I heard he's got Alzheimer's
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:23.720]  and he's a great old guy and Stubblebine died a few years ago but if you're having dinner
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:30.080]  with him it you know, Lubies and Waco because we have a speech there and he's like I'll
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:37.280]  tell you the real problem, there's a bunch of goddamn devil worshippers, pedophiles,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.920]  group above the communists or pedophile devil worshippers, this is like 20 years ago I'm
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.200]  like yes, yes General, yes and you still though kind of think these are just old eccentric
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.000]  guys and I'm sorry I use the Lord's name in vain, I don't mean it in vain, I don't
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.240]  mean it in vain, they're G.D. devils that are going to go to hell, I'm not using it
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:00.000]  in vain, he wasn't either, that offends I'm sorry, I'm giving you the accurate quote
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  and it's just then all these years later it's all true and there is a tenfold increase
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.120]  in the arrest of pedophiles under Trump, not just people that have child porn but little
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.280]  kids and women and sex trafficking, you've got the UN caught trafficking thousands of
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:23.840]  kids out of one country alone and a bunch of them found dead and now you've got Desmond
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.560]  is amazing, one of these quote drag kids who's been doing this since he's five years old
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:35.840]  on TV with people that are axe murderers, literally the guy cuts somebody up with a
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.640]  big sharp object and they're talking about taking ketamine that is an orgy drug and they're
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:47.280]  talking about taking roofies that is an orgy drug and you've got the little kid on TV with
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.280]  drag queens and with convicted murderers, we put those guys back on screen and they've
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.960]  got artwork everywhere about how it's fun to drug kids up, row him and all and it shows
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:06.400]  the little girl jump roping, you find out about who the artist is, it's all that and
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.280]  it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and it's just all out in the
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:22.840]  open and it's being done and Bill Maher's production company is called Kid Love and
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:31.000]  that's one of the code words publicly used is that it's just love, it's I love kids,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.280]  that's what they say, I love kids, it's love and they want the law to be down to age three
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:44.640]  it's what an amble pushes, I'm here to date your son or daughter and it's love and so
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]  what does he say?
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.640]  Bill Maher says it's love, even a 12 year old wants to have sex with a 35 year old,
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:58.440]  the parents have to step down, they have no rights, the person that drugs your kid, tricks
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:03.760]  your kid, whatever, they can come destroy their innocence now, so I want a news to cover
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:10.640]  I want to open the phones up but that video's up on infowars.com, shock video, Bill Maher
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:17.040]  endorses pedophilia with small children and then you find out the production company's
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:23.520]  name that and he's done it a whole bunch of times and it's the litmus test to get into
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:29.920]  the club and there it is, Bill Maher openly endorses pedophilia as love and so all of
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.640]  you at YouTube and all of you at Facebook and Twitter they're trying to censor us and
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.280]  block our videos, the people of America and the world, you're not stopping them, they're
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.880]  going infowars.com and newswars.com right now and they're posting to their own websites,
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.000]  they're sharing it via their own email, they're text messaging it to people that has one of
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.920]  the highest open rates and saying look at this monstrous video of this guy, we've got
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.720]  to protect our children and then you add to that how they're coming after the children,
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:13:01.040]  this is what we've got to do and I remember over and over and over again being brought
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:08.320]  up not to hate anybody, not to look down on anybody and hearing everything that was coming,
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.880]  being told that you know the whole homosexual agenda, all of this is just to then get to
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.840]  sexualized kids and then I saw Jocelyn Elders later say help children masturbate, have the
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:24.520]  teachers you know grab your preschoolers genitals and you know do all this and so it's just
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.240]  you understand they want their hands on your children, they want to put deadly vaccines
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:32.320]  in them, they want to give them deadly GMO, they want to sexualize them if they can't
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:38.240]  abort them in the womb and they can't brain damage them and give them a chemical lobotomy
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.920]  with the vaccine which the insert says it does to a percentage of people, most folks
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.440]  just get an IQ reduction, just like fluoride on average lowers IQ about 15 points, be drinking
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.200]  at one part per million for more than a decade when you're a cop.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:14:01.080]  So that's where all this is and they're coming for everybody and they're destroying the
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:06.400]  existing norms because they've got even more horrible things to come after that because
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.760]  it's always the same, they want to euthanize the old people, they want to abort as many
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.560]  babies as they can and the ones that make it they want to feed on and destroy and slowly
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.560]  suck their souls.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.880]  I want to talk about this, I want to talk about the whole front runner group of Democrats
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.760]  all saying free health care, free college, free everything, just the free health care
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.240]  is the entire budget every year, so it's here.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.240]  What's your take on that?
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.680]  Got a whole bunch of other incredible footage that we're going to be getting to in a bunch
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.160]  of other special reports here today but I want to open the phones up, I told you I'm
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.120]  starting to take calls every day, I'm going to commit to that and I want the crew to push
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.120]  me to do it.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:48.160]  So the number is 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex, the three or four callers I didn't get to
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.800]  yesterday because we ran out of time, you go to the front of the line, so it's first

[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.800]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:39.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:52.560]  Riders on the storm, riders on the storm, into this house we're born, to this world we're
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.160]  thrown, into this world we're thrown.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.720]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls starting at the next segment.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:07.280]  There's so much news here that sometimes it's hard to even get to the news because you don't
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:14.960]  know what to cover first, but I see these studies every day.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.480]  It's been well known forever.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:24.760]  The modern systems were designed to mesmerize children and then to basically give them low
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.360]  attention spans and low IQs.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:36.080]  Study, increase screen time in young children associated with developmental delays.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080]  That's from Fox.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.480]  I love the how they tell you all this, once everybody's totally addicted.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:51.960]  I said a decade ago, there's going to be huge screen time rehab clinics in the future.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:56.960]  Now that's the new big hot trend, again, next decade's news today, but it's not because,
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960]  again, I'm that smart.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.080]  I actually go off what the globalists say and do.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:05.160]  That's my big frustration is that they put out all these fake political ideologies and
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.040]  all these systems and all these control arms, but at the end of the day, they're devil
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:17.600]  worshipers that think they're God who use communism and socialism to domesticate people
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.840]  and control your paradigm so that you never want anything better for yourself so that
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.000]  you're under their control for chicken feet.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.120]  That's what domestication means, like cows in a pen or horses or pigs that you're going
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.520]  to slaughter.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.520]  They control you.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]  They run you.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.400]  They own you.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.280]  The Renaissance in Americana was about getting away from that feudal system.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.960]  That sounds like a horrible system.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.560]  That's how every other country and system ran previous to ours.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.200]  Previous to the Renaissance 500 years ago.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.880]  And so they're just simply bringing back what gives them total control because it's what
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.160]  these inbred elites and inbreeding creates psychotic behavior want.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:05.760]  I mean, you could talk about Ted Bundy all day long, and I want you guys to remind me
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:11.760]  to cover him at the start of the next hour because it'll take some time to get into it
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.680]  because I know the inside baseball about Netflix and the inside baseball about how they operate
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:25.040]  and what they do, but they have a new show out worshiping serial killer Ted Bundy.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:30.400]  And then when people point that out, they go, oh, yes, we're being politically correct.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.960]  Don't lionize him.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960]  Don't say he's sexy.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.480]  But that's all formulaically done.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:46.280]  That's a Netflix's advertising formulae.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.960]  That's why these Sandy Hook lawsuits against me.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.600]  They keep saying show us the marketing documents where you just said Sandy Hook didn't happen
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:24:00.600]  to make money as if we cover news, certain news because it's a marketing angle.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.600]  We cover stuff because I think it's important.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:09.680]  And I was censored and blocked and persecuted all these years for saying things that were
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.560]  unpopular at the time that turned out to be true, that 9-11 was an inside job, that
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.400]  radical elements of our government worked with radical Islam and Saudi Arabia.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:20.440]  That's all admitted now, the stand down, all of it, that we're being surveilled with a
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.680]  benopticonic control grid, tracking everything we do to control us and track us that massive
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.680]  censorship is coming.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:31.600]  That's all admitted or that fluoride and 3G and 4G and 5G and all this fry's your DNA.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.840]  That's all admitted now.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.760]  I'm just not out to get people.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.360]  Most folks figure out this is going on.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.640]  The globalists come to them and say, hey, you figured it all out.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.760]  You should be with us.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.760]  I'm not joining them ever.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.600]  But I tell you this, the general public's basically joining them.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.440]  More and more people just don't care.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:58.560]  Let's play the audio with the video of folks doing a demonstration about phone by phone,
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.040]  tracker by tracker, Trojan horse beside Trojan horse.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.720]  You can call one Apple iPhone on FaceTime and then you hit a couple buttons and then
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:13.520]  even though the person doesn't pick up, it picks up and you hear everything they say
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.680]  and everything they do.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.560]  Folks, that's a back door to where anybody that works at Apple or anybody that knows
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.160]  how this works, the FBI, you name it, can do it.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:30.440]  And I've told everybody this over and over again, but look, hot mic.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]  Whatis.com?
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.120]  And it gets into what these phones and devices are actually called by the FBI.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:42.800]  There's another one, FBI tap cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool without warrants, 2006.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.360]  In 1999, I exposed that OnStar was listening to people and it later turned out was true.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.160]  I was told by insiders.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.680]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.120]  The only way you cannot have this done to you is go into the phone settings itself and
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.760]  turn FaceTime completely off every time you use it.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.120]  And by the way, that's just so the general public can't every time call you and hit two
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.840]  buttons and then listen to everything going on in your house.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.760]  By the way, everybody better do this now because they just publicized how everyone can do
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:16.760]  this.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:26.200]  I remember having John Ronson, a TV producer from England in my house, 20 years ago.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.960]  And he said, why do you have tape covering your webcam?
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.160]  And I said, because the governments and others routinely dial into those and get data.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]  He laughed at me.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.480]  Oh, but decades later, Comey's so smart covering up his and of course, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.160]  Oh, but here it is.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160]  CNN will now tell us.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.560]  Thank you, CNN.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:49.160]  How to turn off FaceTime and avoid Apple's eavesdropping bug, a newly discovered privacy
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:55.080]  bug in Apple's FaceTime software allows users to hide and see the person they're calling
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.680]  without the receipt, even recipient, even picking up the glitch.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:06.600]  Yes, it's a glitch impacts iPhones and iPads running iOS 12.1 and Apple's PC running Mac
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:15.440]  OS Mojave and newly added group FaceTime feature, Apple AAPL confirm it started disabling the
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.200]  group's FaceTime features for all users, but the issue may still impact one on one FaceTime
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.200]  calls.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.160]  Yeah, those backdoors are big until the company rolls out a fix later this week.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.200]  Here's how to disable FaceTime on your Apple device.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.560]  Open the settings on your iPhone or iPad.
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.560]  It's not yours.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560]  It's Apple's.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.800]  Just select FaceTime, toggle off the green button, top of the screen to turn off a Mac.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.560]  Follow these steps.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.400]  Open the FaceTime app, go to the FaceTime, the top of the screen, select the turn off
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.400]  FaceTime.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.900]  And then it goes on.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.800]  So see, don't trust Alex Jones.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.400]  Oh, no.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.520]  He says that your computers and your phones are watching and listening to you.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.840]  I just have all the patents and all the documents going back to the Telecommunications Act of
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:13.960]  1996 where they made it law by 2000 that all devices that have software to communicate
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:20.280]  via audio or video by law are considered the smart devices and have this embedded in them.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.840]  It's the law.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.320]  It's the law.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.320]  And that's why they don't want us here telling you what's coming next.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:33.720]  We're going to come back and take your calls, but the last segment of this show, make me
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.720]  do it, because I'll always forget.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.240]  I'm going to give you a few glimpses into what's coming next.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.920]  Half the kids on your street are going to be dying of cancer.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:41.920]  You're going to be dying of cancer.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.480]  There's going to be hysteria, burning cities.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.720]  People are going to be taking all sorts of new drugs to get over all the pain.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.320]  Suddenly, they're going to turn the 5G on and you're going to start having mass suicide
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]  everywhere.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320]  Get ready.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320]  It's coming.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.320]  They're going to get ready to kill you and your family.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320]  Get ready.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.800]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?

[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.560]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.640]  of control.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:13.000]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.840]  using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.120]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120]  me.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.600]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.400]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.880]  Get sober now.

[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:31.280]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy

[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.440]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.400]  front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:32.960]  So you see articles every day saying screen time makes kids have low IQs, lowers their
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:38.840]  development, makes them stupid, makes them depressed, linked to suicide, linked to obesity.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.000]  Why didn't they tell us that when they were rolling it all out?
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.720]  Well, I've read the literature but I was also invited almost 20 years ago into the UT psychology
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.000]  department where they were testing what became the iPads and iPhones and the rest of it for
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  DARPA.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.720]  And the whole thing was designed with monkeys they had hooked up, with wires in their brain,
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.600]  they were later euthanized, to test flicker rates on how to mesmerize someone.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.600]  You'll notice how a child, especially to walk by a screen now and just look like a zombie,
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.320]  it's because it's an exact wavelength.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.120]  So let me tell you what's coming next.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:21.280]  Every metric, cancer, neurological disorders, every metric is we are seeing exponential
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.280]  levels of death and disease.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:27.640]  This is how you bring down a country, it's how you bring down the West.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.800]  That's where these technologies are being used in a 21st century covert soft kill war
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.560]  by the eugenics based deep state who's allied with China.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.280]  Now China just goes in and kills babies before they're born or after they're born.
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.640]  That's their agreement.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:47.480]  Here it is being done as a population reduction program and just like you turn up the frog,
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.760]  at one level the frog thinks it's in a hot tub, at level 6 or 7 the frog passes out,
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.120]  at level 10 the frog dies.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:04.000]  And that's what they're doing is they're ambient turning up the 5G, they're ambiently
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:11.200]  turning up the flicker rate on the iPads until everyone is in a trance state but unable to
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.960]  even recognize what's happening to them.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:19.520]  Then they have movies like Bird Box and The Kingsman where they tell you there's an evil
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.200]  world government and it's going to use wavelengths on cell phones to make everybody kill each
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.440]  other to depopulate the planet for the greater good.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.160]  That's really the plan and they're testing these systems to increase irritability, to
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:37.800]  increase depression and can literally make you, if you're susceptible to this and get
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.480]  fall into it, commit suicide.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.480]  It's estimated that thousands of people a year die from just sitting at their computers
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.800]  playing video games too long.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.720]  So the scientists always say, oh excessive is linked to suicide, no.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:56.000]  It's all been designed like this.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.720]  So I would recommend most people not let your children really watch any television at this
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.440]  point on any of these high tech screens.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:08.360]  It's bad enough with the older ones and I would suggest that as adults you listen to
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.760]  talk radio and that you turn away from it and don't stare at it too long because everyone
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:19.560]  knows that it causes all sorts of issues with your brain and it's a fact.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.640]  What I'm telling you is an absolute fact just like all the illegal surveillance is
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.040]  going on.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.760]  And so if you look at one in 30 something thousand with autism, one in 58, then you look
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:36.560]  at, you used to, cancer didn't even exist in children and now it's up 10,000 plus percent
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.520]  depending on the type.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.880]  Breast cancer is up thousands of percent.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:47.280]  We're being murdered and the system says, oh don't worry about all the stuff doing that.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.760]  Let's just tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe and that puts out oxygen from the plant that
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:53.760]  cleans the earth.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.320]  If you're one of the scrubbing gases, let's restrict those and then have aluminum dioxide
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:06.360]  blasted into the atmosphere and electromagnetic antenna arrays fry the atmosphere.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.280]  And that's all admitted.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:14.520]  It's mainstream counseling for on relations everywhere that they're manipulating the weather
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520]  on a mass scale.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.800]  But see they have a trend to come out.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.520]  The first was the conspiracy guy for a few years and tell you none of it exists.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.040]  You're flat earthers if you think there's any geomonification going on or any manipulation
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.360]  of the weather.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.680]  That's how they operate.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.680]  Yeah.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:36.760]  And when people see those big, what looks like flying saucers in the air and the big swirls
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.200]  and what looks like a tornado being formed, that's what one antenna array can do.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:48.520]  By the way, in Saudi Arabia, in China, in Russia, in Dubai, it's all over television.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:54.160]  They just show them in one hour, take a blue sky in the desert and form clouds and then
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160]  make it rain.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.960]  We can pull it up on YouTube, showing them do it.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.360]  But when we say, hey, it's going on here, Joe Rogan says, no, it's not.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.640]  I am the commander of all reality.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:10.240]  Anyone that says that it's not happening is insane.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:13.000]  But old fashioned cloud seeding is nothing.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.160]  Again, you can just type into a regular search engine, antenna arrays used to make the desert
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:26.160]  green or counsel on fine relations, counsel on fine relations calls for geoengineering
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.080]  planet to stop global warming.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.120]  And you read the 30 something page report and they admit it's already going on and
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.520]  guess who has the government contract with the Department of Energy to carry it out,
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.920]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:38.920]  Don't believe me.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.920]  Just type in.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:45.280]  Studies how to control hurricanes.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:50.040]  There it is, developing an international framework for geoengineering, CFR, that's just one of
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.540]  hundreds of reports.
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:55.520]  There's an international treaty from 1978 about weather weapons.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:02.240]  We have the former Defense Secretary Michael Cohen saying we have earthquake weapons,
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.000]  we have tectonic weapons, we have, we have weather weapons and other people have weather
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  weapons.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:15.440]  But see, I'm the bad guy, you see, because I told you first about it and we had the meteorologist
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:18.840]  on about it.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.840]  It's incredible.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.000]  Yeah, their Secretary of Defense speaks out about earthquake weapons.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.040]  Just don't believe me.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.040]  Just type it in.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.040]  Just type it in.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.960]  You can actually go watch the video at the Defense Department if they haven't pulled
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.960]  it down.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.960]  So it's our duty to get this out.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.160]  I'll go to your calls next segment.
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.760]  We're going to push our guest back to 15 after if he can't make it, it's fine, because
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.080]  they're only going to take calls and I'm dedicated to taking calls.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:48.560]  But the issue here is we're under globalist attack and they want us off the air because
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.240]  they want to carry this plan out when even most government people are compartmentalized
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.240]  and don't know what's going on.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.000]  And that's why the government's in rebellion against Trump and trying to block him from
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.680]  access to any of these agencies is because this stuff's all compartmentalized under special
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.920]  directors like Rosenstein's sister runs the vaccine damage program and the PR program
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.280]  attacks pair of money billions a year to pay for lies in the news saying vaccines only
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.280]  help.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.280]  They don't hurt.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.400]  She's over lying and saying it's safe and she's over covering it up when your child
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.000]  dies or gets brain damaged.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.200]  We covered that yesterday.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.880]  It's all these key people.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:22.880]  A few thousand per country running the whole show.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.040]  I had Rothkopf on head of the Kissinger Group years ago.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.040]  He tried to hire me and he said, look, you're part of the superclass.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.040]  Alex, you're a major leader.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.520]  They always say that to people to make them feel big.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.520]  Join us.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520]  Join me.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.440]  It's a complete show training.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  It's ridiculous.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:42.600]  It's these people all want to be part of the establishment and they sell out cheap and
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.680]  they're all jokes.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.600]  I will not sell out to death.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  I will not sell out and molest children to be part of the club.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.400]  I will not do it.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.400]  You're disgusting.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.560]  In fact, oh, it's just unbelievable.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560]  We're going to go to break.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560]  Listen.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.880]  I'm just going to tell us or something right now.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.200]  I think our best products, our body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% of cumin oil level
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.480]  that no other company got.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.120]  Nobody else did because everybody else, even so-called high quality groups, they put in
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.360]  a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:26.680]  But if you think turmeric has helped you before, most turmeric is about 5% on the market.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.680]  Really good stuff.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:30.600]  High end stuff is half turmeric.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.680]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcumin oil and then it's got a bunch of other known plants
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.680]  in it that help boost it and accelerate it.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.080]  So you need to understand bodies.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:46.320]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.320]  That's what you're looking for.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.320]  It's got it.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.000]  It's amazing for all the things turmeric does.

[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.680]  It is still half off.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.480]  We didn't end that special because we got another big supply of it and I should have
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.480]  been adding that.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.080]  That's 50% off.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080]  $29.95.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.080]  Really, competitors aren't as good.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.320]  They're like twice that price.

[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.160]  We have honor roll for kids.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.560]  There's concentrated little bit of capillettes, chel capillettes.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:17.040]  We also have for adults the ultimate krill oil that is so pure, so good, and we asked
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.440]  for the ultimate fish oil as well.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.680]  All three of those, everybody, for energy, for healthy life, for brain, for heart.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.680]  These are the best.

[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.400]  the gates.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.840]  I believe it's become our number one best selling product.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:43:00.080]  We need to try turbo force today.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:03.120]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.720]  leave you more tired than ever.

[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:57.080]  Kirk up with turbo force at infowarstore.com.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.120]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:06.360]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.240]  literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.400]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodide in the world, we've
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.160]  gone through two permutations.
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:20.440]  Seaweed based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.240]  to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.080]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine, and brought you X2 that's
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.080]  been incredible.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.440]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:38.160]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.160]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:49.600]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760]  discovery.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:58.360]  X3, now available at infowarstore.com.
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:02.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.760]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.200]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.600]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.120]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:25.640]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.640]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:30.960]  in the rainwater.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.320]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.440]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:48.040]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.400]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:58.120]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:02.200]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.440]  Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.400]  every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:43.200]  Coming up in the middle of the next hour, we have William Gean joining us at Alipak,
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.800]  and he is drafting and calling to challenge Donald Trump, the 2020 GOP primary, and again
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.520]  the strategy is obviously to get Trump, they think, out of his days.
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.080]  We'll see about that.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.080]  So we're going to have that story posted up on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.760]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:07.240]  David Carlos, Nick, David, Michael, Chip, Josh, Douglas, Alex, Anthony, Randy and others.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:10.160]  I'll at least get to those calls here today.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:12.160]  And David's been holding the longest from California.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.160]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.160]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  Good, brother.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:23.440]  It's going to be on your show for the first time, caller, just concerned about the state
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:29.280]  of our country right now, what's happening to yourself, Roger Stone and other journalists
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.280]  from the country.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:39.000]  I've been waking up every morning with this sense of urgency almost that even funding
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.840]  you guys and trying to help you guys out with, you know, your guys, your endeavors you guys
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.800]  are going through, I feel like there's something else that I need to be doing and the rest
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  of us need to be doing.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:57.600]  And it's kind of, I don't really have any sort of outlet besides, you know, you listening
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:03.280]  to you guys and trying to express all this other stuff, you know, what I hear from not
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.720]  just yourself, but people like Clyde Lewis from Zero, everybody else.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:12.680]  And it's just, I don't know, I just, I have this sense of urgency right now, you know?
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:13.920]  You're absolutely right.
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.080]  And it is urgency.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.160]  I mean, Info Wars is like the mothership.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:20.440]  I've got all these employees and all this crew and I've got all my lawsuits I'm fighting
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.000]  that are way more money than Roger's paying.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.880]  It's not some competition here, but I'm kind of fighting a two-front war with Roger because
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:31.400]  Info Wars has become a platform to sit there and promote fundraising for his issues when
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.880]  I gave Roger a job here, which is great, and he's paid.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:38.920]  And then it also becomes this, this, this, this split where we may not get the funds
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.800]  to fund Info Wars because of the 24-7 Roger Stone fundraising because people then split
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.480]  it and say, well, we'll just give him a donation instead of Info Wars.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.120]  I'm going to have a talk with him about that because we can win the battle, lose the war
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:51.840]  here because of that.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.680]  So I hope people do support Roger, but Info Wars has a build.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.880]  Let's not exaggerate.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.240]  At least 10 times what Roger Stones is, okay?
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.280]  And so, and he's bringing in as much money as we're bringing in right now.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.280]  And that's great.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.640]  That's all fine and dandy.
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:10.000]  I have 100 employees.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.440]  I have all the bandwidth bills and all the equipment, and I sent security up here with
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.720]  Roger and reporters up there that cost money.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.600]  And so, I'm not bitching or complaining, I'm going to have to make some decisions around
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.480]  here on a bunch of fronts about layoffs, you know, laying Paul Watson off, laying Roger
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.480]  Stone off.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.480]  People that are paid more around here.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.680]  I mean, I'm just told, I've told them point blank, too.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.560]  I mean, that's where this is headed if we don't get the support and people don't want
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.560]  to support us.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.560]  That's fine.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:36.960]  I'm going to stay committed to this fight as long as I need to and stay as focused
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:38.400]  as I can.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.400]  But I want to say this.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:42.760]  I like Roger, love him to death, been his biggest supporter out there, and gotten targeted
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.280]  because of it.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.880]  But I'm not Roger Stone.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.880]  I'm in full wars.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.280]  I've been on there 23 years, 24 years.
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.000]  We've launched the thing against the globalist, and what I'm saying is I'm sick of just being
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.600]  associated with Donald Trump and Roger Stone.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.920]  He's probably sick of being associated with me, and by that, it's not bad to be associated
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.920]  with Donald Trump.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:06.160]  It's that that's all I become associated with, not being right about screen time, being
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.760]  right about the 3G and 4G and 5G, being right about how you're being spied on, being right
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:12.520]  about the world government, being right about everything.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:17.080]  We're the trailblazers, and I just see myself constantly caught up.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.080]  Take the Sandy Hook thing.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.080]  That is not my identity.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.920]  I've barely ever talked about that.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.320]  Other people question it happened.
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:23.320]  They lied about babies and incubators.
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.480]  They lied about all these wars.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.400]  They lied about all sorts of stage stuff.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:31.000]  They got members of the European Union government questioning whether they're staging deaths
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.520]  of refugees to open the borders.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.400]  That's normal to question government media that lies.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.000]  Later you find out something did happen, and you say, fine, it happened, but then those
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.320]  people make it your whole identity and say that I'm currently doing that to then turn
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:51.360]  me into basically Sandy Hook meets Donald Trump meets Roger Stone, when that becomes
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:56.280]  a distraction and a diversion from the globalists trying to implode our borders, from the globalists
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:00.280]  trying to shut down our industries, from the globalists trying to set up martial law, from
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:06.840]  all the incredible censorship, I'm a diversion, I'm a diversion, I'm a diversion.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:07.840]  My censorship is bad.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:13.480]  I should be supported, but in, in that they only talk about me being censored now everywhere.
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:15.880]  First they demonized me, then they censored me.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:17.880]  That supposedly then made it all okay.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.880]  Okay.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:21.280]  So now they've moved on to everyone else and nobody cares about them.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.280]  It's all about all the scones.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.160]  So that's what I told people day one.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.040]  So this is very, very sophisticated.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.040]  So I'm not criticizing Trump.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.040]  I'm not criticizing Roger.
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:31.480]  I'm not criticizing myself.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:37.560]  I'm saying this is how the globalist engage you, set up these false fights where now we're
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:43.240]  going to spend half our time defending Roger on a fake indictment in a major war for the
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.760]  whole country and our children fighting the pedophiles.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:50.600]  Now everything in info wars will become this stupid case and the stupid judge and stupid
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:55.040]  Mueller instead of just warning people, Hey, read what's in your tap water, read what's
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.040]  in the vaccines.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:57.960]  Hey, find out about the new world order.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960]  Hey, find out about the big picture.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:52:59.960]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.960]  I do.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.960]  I do.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:06.720]  And I, and, and I feel like every single one of us is, is almost, you know, certainly
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.360]  under attack because it's just, it's hard to, to be away from, from pretty much the beef
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.360]  now.
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.520]  And, and unfortunately it's just, it's, it's discouraging, but we almost just got to follow
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:21.520]  like, like, like you do and just, you know, keep, keep pushing, keep moving forward.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.080]  I just wanted to say God bless you.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:24.520]  I pray for, I pray for this country.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:25.520]  I pray for a president.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.520]  I pray for yourself.
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:30.880]  I pray for everybody else that, you know, that may be going through this situation, whatever,
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:36.200]  but I just hope that, well, I'll tell you, David, David, exactly, people don't have money.
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.200]  They can't buy products.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.520]  Hey, that's fine.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.520]  They can spread the word about however you're listening and they can pray for info wars
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:46.480]  and they can pray for America and the world to awaken and for God's spirit to move across
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:47.480]  this land.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.480]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.960]  And I didn't mean to go off into a rant about that.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:56.480]  I just realized the tactics the globalists use where they say Jones set up his media
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:03.000]  operation and his empire, which it's not Jones set up his powerful evil empire on the backs
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  of Sandy Hook.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:11.120]  And it's like not even a, not even a one tenth of one percent of what we've covered.
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:14.680]  It's just, again, and then they use it to put Sandy Hook and school shootings back on
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:18.360]  the news, the lawyers, the Democrats do, and then they use it to demonize me.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.360]  It's a tactic.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  It's sick.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.400]  It's the whole mainstream media that uses school shootings and hypes them up and then
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.840]  causes more of them.
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:27.520]  And now they're using my name to promote it.
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:29.520]  It's dastardly.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:31.560]  It's absolutely evil.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:34.120]  And it's going to be dealt with.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:41.120]  It's just that we need massive support because BuzzFeed makes $300 million a year.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.360]  They have to get another $100 million from George Soros and others to operate.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  And they don't, they're not as effective as we are.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.360]  They're a bunch of liars.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.280]  They have thousands of employees, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.560]  And then the news was like, Jones says he brought in $40 million.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.560]  He made $40 million.
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:59.560]  No, if I bring in $40 million, half of that's product cost.
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.960]  Then you pay all the employees, the crew, the bandwidth, all of it, and lawyers and
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.040]  you lose money.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.880]  That's what we're headed into, exactly what they want.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.560]  BuzzFeed can have $400 million.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:15.320]  That's, that's, that's, that's pure cash.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.160]  That's not stuff they're selling.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:22.440]  That's their actual revenues, $300 million, with another $100 million plopped on top to
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.680]  run around and make up PISC gate stories and make up that Manafort visited Assange at the,
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:31.560]  at all of that's made up, all of that's lies, all of that's crap.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:38.800]  And notice their owner, this big, you know, Neocon leftist, Neolib, is like, oh, we don't
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.800]  need unions.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:40.800]  I'll never lay you off.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:41.800]  We're a family.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:44.520]  He won't even give him any severance pay.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.600]  He even took their bonuses away.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.760]  He even nickled and dimed them when he fired them.
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:54.480]  Those that had a month or two weeks of vacation, they didn't get jacked crap because all the
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.360]  studies show liberals aren't liberals.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  They're monsters.
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:06.560]  Jeff Bezos pays almost no taxes, he's paid money on every item he ships by the US government.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.560]  He's a total pig.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.400]  Google, Facebook, Apple, they run slave factories.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.880]  These people are monsters.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.840]  They show what liberals are nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.280]  All the world's the same numbers, six times more likely to steal.
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.080]  And many, many more times though, more likely to tell you they're giving or they're doing
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.120]  something good, but they don't do it.
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:35.320]  You see, because they're sociopaths, they're psychotics, they're control freaks.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.880]  They put out movies where Ted Bundy's cool and sexy and has a fun love affair on Netflix.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.080]  He wasn't tying 16 year old girls up in basements and torturing 11 hell out of them, biting
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.960]  big chunks out of them.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:52.520]  So see, that's who these people are and they've bred more of them and they've created more
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:56.760]  of them and all of our bowing down and all of our kissing their asses has absolutely
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:01.400]  supercharged them to come after everybody.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.120]  It's a moral decline.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:08.520]  It's a satanic plague that is upon our country and upon our world.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.520]  All right.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:10.520]  I said I go to your calls.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:17.120]  But I went off on a jog there because Info Wars is in the middle of the battle and it's
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.320]  that simple.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.640]  And so now realize, yeah, we've been, hey, we need help, hey, we're in a fight all these
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.920]  years as we've been in one.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.360]  Now we're in the main fight.
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:26.360]  This is it.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:27.840]  Toe to toe with the globalist.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840]  Back in two minutes.
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:34.560]  I'll go to Carlos first talks about tearing society apart with everybody else.
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:35.560]  Stay with us.
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:37.960]  And hey, whatever you do, share that link newswars.com.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.800]  It upsets the globalist.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:50.080]  Share that link with Bill Maher praising pedophilia with 12 year olds.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.000]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.560]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.680]  leave you more tired than ever.

[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:55.520]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:58.640]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:01.320]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.680]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:11.760]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:13.160]  from us as individuals.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:19.040]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.840]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:24.640]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.480]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.280]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:34.200]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:36.200]  to control everyone.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:38.200]  It's The David Knight Show.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:44.520]  I never missed your show, any day, and I mean, I mean, never.

[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:57.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:15.360]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another.
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:16.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:18.200]  Carlos in Texas, thanks for calling in.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.200]  You're on the air.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.200]  Welcome.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.800]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:23.800]  Good, brother.
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:24.800]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:28.600]  First-time caller, long-time listener.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:35.800]  I am from the, I think it's sector six in Texas, I'm from Houston.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:42.080]  Alex, I've been listening to you for a long time, and if I do a plug group quick, I've
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.280]  been using your products for a while.
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:46.840]  Sure, please.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:01:00.200]  I live by the silver bullet, I am all for the silver bullet.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:06.160]  It helped me during these cold winters, I'm a construction worker, so it helps keep me
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:11.280]  nice and healthy while I'm working outside.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:18.600]  I did want to talk to you or talk to everybody or just bring it up, the degradation of our
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:22.360]  society, they're trying to make those genderless.
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:28.120]  My daughter asked me about it the other day, and I come from a Christian background, my
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:29.920]  parents are pastors.
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.280]  I've been in church my whole life, and I explained to my daughter, and we went into scripture
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.280]  about it.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.840]  It's not about us not being greater than the other people or thinking that we're better
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:52.000]  than them, but the Bible tells us clearly that it's immoral to be a homosexual, a homosexual
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.480]  or being genderless in all this totality.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.560]  We are men and women, that's the way we're born.
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.640]  You shouldn't have to apologize for pointing out the sky's blue, it's in Brave New World,
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:10.120]  it's the UN plan, it's in Brave New World Revisited Nonfiction to make us genderless
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.000]  to stop us reproducing.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.160]  So they say, oh you're not moral, let us adults who aren't parents teach your kid about sex,
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.800]  that's called being a pervert.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:22.200]  People need to start filing lawsuits against these school districts and not putting up with
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.640]  being buffaloed by this crap.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:28.240]  So I just tell your daughter point blank, this is a scientific plan to confuse her and mess
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.920]  her up so she never has kids.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:39.920]  I listen to you every single day, you, Owen, I listen to Dave, I listen to all of you guys,
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.240]  I borrow the crap out of my wife with it, I scare my wife sometimes, but like I tell
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:49.760]  her, it's important that we know this so we can teach our children and so we can red
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.400]  fill other people within our sphere.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:57.720]  It's so difficult to talk to people who have closed minds or that actually don't want to
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.080]  know about this stuff.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.480]  It drives me nuts because even within my own family, you know, I was going to have my aunt
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:11.360]  who was going to vote for Beto and Beto 2018 and I'm like, yeah, which means aunt.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:16.880]  I told her aunt, you know, Beto supports abortion and then I sent her a pamphlet of all his
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:22.040]  talking points and she ended up voting for Kid Cruz who is pro-life.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.240]  And they were stealing the election, they were stealing the election for Pito, so it's
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:31.400]  a good thing you did that, but absolutely, every person you reach out to gets around
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.840]  the system and they used to ignore us, they thought we didn't have any power, they thought
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:35.840]  you didn't have any power.
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:39.240]  Now they're trying to censor everybody because they know we've got a good chance of stopping
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.800]  these monsters and we don't have a choice, I mean, like you said, they're coming after
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:44.000]  our children.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.440]  Your daughter, I mean, how old is your daughter?
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.920]  She shouldn't be hearing about this crap.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:54.360]  Oh my gosh, she's 12, but you know, there is a show on, I don't know if it's Nickelodeon
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:04:02.800]  or Disney, it's called Andy Mack and it talks about how there's this little boy in there
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:08.640]  who liked Andy Mack, a love interest in the show, like, and these are all little kids
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:09.640]  and there's little boys.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.600]  No, but that's okay because, I mean, Kid loves the name of Bill Maher's production company,
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:19.200]  he says 12-year-olds having sexual 35 years old is love, there's nothing wrong with Bill
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:24.080]  Maher saying the actual nameless slogan is the name of his production company, everything
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.560]  is okay, don't be hateful, it's just love, Carlos.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:34.240]  I know, I know, but you know what, and this came up, the question, and I talk to my daughter
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:39.640]  all the time about what's right and what's wrong and I'm hoping to instruct her the way
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:46.880]  I was raised, the way I was raised in a Christian home, like, okay, this is right, this is wrong,
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:49.080]  but eventually she's going to get to a point where she's going to have to make her own
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.080]  decisions and hopefully the way I was raised.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.400]  Absolutely, great job Carlos, God bless you, thanks for the support.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:59.080]  Josh and many others, your calls.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:03.760]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key, while coffee, candy, and other sugary

[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:35.080]  Changing war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:53.560]  When we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:07:07.440]  call that border security, that's a human rights abuse, and that's not our America.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:12.560]  Devella Harris, the so-called front-runner in the Democratic field running against Trump
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:18.720]  in 2020, go for the nomination, the Democratic Party, she says that we usually need free
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:24.560]  healthcare, free education, and no borders, while she was behind big iron fences and security,
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.160]  hundreds and hundreds of police officers for her announcement.
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:30.400]  You're like, that kills common sense.
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:33.760]  Every country has to have borders or a son of a nation, especially if you're bordering
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:37.840]  a really dangerous, collapsed third world.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:43.800]  But again, this is the war on logic, and we've got such a giant, dumbed-down mass of people
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:48.360]  in this country now, and the average person that is smart and informed doesn't want to
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:52.640]  get politically involved, so the spread of evil is expanding.
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:56.200]  Okay, let's go ahead and take some more calls here.
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:59.920]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:08.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Connecticut, well, Andy had been holding the longest, David
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.800]  in Connecticut's been holding the longest on socialism.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:11.800]  Go ahead.
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:12.800]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:13.800]  Welcome.
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:14.800]  Can you hear me?
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.800]  I sure can.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:16.800]  All right.
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:23.600]  When it comes to socialism, this is going to be something we're actually going to need
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:26.000]  with this whole technocracy coming up.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.400]  It's unfortunate we've got crazy people in government that we can't trust, but we've
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:39.120]  got machines taking jobs for the past 10 years.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:53.680]  And without, I'd say 20 years from now, 50% of this population is going to lose our jobs.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:56.760]  That's almost the only viable solution.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:01.520]  Well, you're a smart cookie, David, but let's go one step further.
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:08.920]  The globalists admit they're forcing a type of robotics, technocracy system that replaces
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:14.000]  humans and makes us obsolete, and then they're just going to entertain us to death literally
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.640]  with sterilization and things like that to get your welfare money.
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.440]  And of course, that'll sound reasonable, good sterilize the welfare people, but it'll
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:24.280]  never end, the global social score, the total control.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:29.360]  We're entering into a literal brave new world where by law, your children will be inducted
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  to be sterilized.
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  They'll be convinced to do it by brainwashing techniques, and then if you stand in the way,
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:39.240]  you won't get your credit money for the year, but if you allow it, you'll be praised and
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:40.240]  be cool.
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.240]  So this is the most hellish evil system the planet has ever created.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:49.320]  And so they're building a world where humans are obsolete by design, where, oh, it's the
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:53.200]  coolest thing, robots that cook your food at a restaurant, robots that drive you in
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:58.160]  your car, robots that fly your plane, and every study shows taking ourselves out of
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:04.840]  the equation weakens us, you know, like the people floating around on the cruise ship
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.560]  in the movie Wally.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:12.440]  So they're designing it so that by the time we realize we've been taken over, our manhood,
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.840]  our humanity, our womanhood, our resistance is vestigial.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.840]  It's not really there.
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:23.920]  It's a shrunken version of itself because we had already been soft killed by the time
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:26.400]  we figured out the final blow was dropping.
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:27.400]  That's why they want me off the air.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:31.840]  They don't want people to reignite their life force, to reignite their sense of destiny
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.640]  and realize what's happening.
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:43.440]  In an old convalescent home and see what the heck did our kids do to us because they're
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:52.280]  going to give this, they're going to give their freedoms away, and it's scary, but I
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:11:02.160]  appreciate you and your voice, and I'm a daily listener, second time caller, keep the fight
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.160]  going.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:04.160]  Brother, I appreciate you.
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:05.160]  I need to keep waking up.
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:06.160]  Appreciate you, David.
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.000]  But David summed up the whole broadcast today, an artificial system is being built to make
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:16.680]  us obsolete, and then they'll be able to social engineer us however they want because we're
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:17.680]  not going to have jobs.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:23.920]  We're not going to know how to take care of ourselves, grow crops, fix a car, and it'll
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:24.920]  be illegal to fix your car.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:28.560]  It's all going to be special facilities that do it for the environment.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.680]  Everything's being designed to take humans out of their environment.
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:39.040]  This is a giant Petri dish, this is a giant scientific test, and are we going to really
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.040]  do this to our children?
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.880]  We already have, and if we'll put up with, you know, 3 million little boys in the country
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.000]  that can't talk and are wearing diapers when they're 20 years old, we'll put up with 50
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.960]  million, and we're going to, we're going to die, and it'll only be the robots and automation
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.680]  and reclamation that takes care of the processing that half your neighbors have cancer, and
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:04.280]  that they've got money, they can battle it, and everybody's got allergies so bad that
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.520]  nobody can hardly even eat food, and it's because of all the GMO, all the pathogens,
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:14.040]  all the multi-layered binary weapons, and again, the globalists wrote books on how
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:20.280]  they were going to do this, and we're now seeing what the world government's like.
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.960]  We're now understanding, so now you understand, and people like Joe Rogan think his family's
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:28.960]  going to be safe because he goes along with this, and other people are going to be part
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:34.920]  of the system, they're going to be okay, no you're not, and that's the big thing is we
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:41.880]  should, there are millions of people now that serve the cult in the U.S. alone, thousands
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:46.600]  that are actually in control positions, and their religion is hating the population, hating
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:50.280]  children, hating the future, and wanting to be predators, and they'll do whatever they're
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.640]  told, and they have a horrible attitude towards humanity, and then as they successively add
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:59.040]  more pressure to the population, and we become more demonic, that just legitimizes what they're
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:03.520]  doing, because they're the people making us like they are.
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.400]  All the movies about serial killers are cool, and pedophilia is cool, and devil worship
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:14.760]  is cool, it's everywhere now, because they're making their move, folks, speaking of devil
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:18.120]  worship, John in Arizona wants to talk about it, go ahead.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:26.080]  Hey Alex, it's Josh, but I'm so happy to be talking to you, thank you for taking my
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:33.240]  call, and thank you for grabbing the bull by the horns, I mean it must feel amazing
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:46.480]  to see a pseudo healthcare professional doctor touting the party line on Fox News countering
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:51.600]  the measures that you've put into action in terms of raising awareness to vaccination,
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:52.600]  I think it's amazing.
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:58.000]  Well sir, please don't thank me, I'm thanking you for the support, we're all in this together,
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.040]  but if people really knew how real this was, they wouldn't care about being cool or being
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.760]  in Hollywood or being part of the power structure, this is the take down of the planet by the
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.760]  globalist.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:13.920]  Well, you're leading the fight, and nobody's grabbed the bull by the horns as you have,
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:20.480]  so it's amazing, and my thoughts and prayers are with David Knight, and I hope that he
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:30.640]  recovers expediently, and his voice is back on the air soon, so I just want to say that,
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:38.040]  but anyways, Alex, the reason I called, I have a background in physiological sciences,
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:44.760]  and I was listening last week when Jan Irving was on, I think it was last week.
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:51.720]  Right before he disconnected, he mentioned Adrina Chrome, the whole thing was about
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:15:05.000]  devil worship and the globalist and the power of persuasion, you know, that psychotropics
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:14.080]  kind of induced, and a few weeks prior to that, you had a caller, a winner, that was
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.840]  addressing the Podesta emails and devil worship, and I know that you referenced these emails
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:27.320]  a lot, but I think, I'd like to propose an alternative definition for Walnut Sauce,
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:28.320]  because I think it's-

[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:17.560]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:20.440]  and say, we struggled here, we made it.
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:22.040]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:24.360]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:28.040]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mal
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.400]  Seaton, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:35.760]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:36.760]  ready to fight.
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.360]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:41.360]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:44.960]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master belt.
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.160]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:50.760]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:53.400]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.520]  I want life.
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:59.400]  I want Jesus.
[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:25.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:35.560]  Well, William Dean heads up alleypack.us, one of the largest, strongest, and no compromise
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:39.880]  groups spending our sovereignty with now like that one, like 10 years ago, had known a couple
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:40.880]  of years.
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:44.040]  Everything he's talked about and others have probably come true, the UN funding and world
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:46.960]  government trying to collapse our borders.
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:49.080]  It's just gotten crazy.
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:56.200]  And he had a big article that went viral at alleypack.us and at gainreport.com.
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:59.560]  Why I want Ann Coulter to run for president in 2020.
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:03.920]  So here to break down what's behind this idea is William Dean.
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:05.160]  William, good to have you with us.
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:06.160]  Hey, Alex.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:07.840]  It's great to be back after a long time.
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:11.600]  And you know, you've been through a lot since the last time I got to talk to you.
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:15.320]  I just wanted to thank you real quick for hanging in the air and really continue what
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.320]  you're doing.
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:21.120]  You've read more people in the country than anyone else and they can't take you down.
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:25.720]  I think they pulled the plug on you simultaneously because they had tried and tried to try to
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:28.440]  slow you down and you always found a way to keep coming back.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:31.760]  And I know that the key to that's been the strength of the audience that's listening
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:32.760]  today.
[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:33.760]  It's your supporters.
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.760]  They keep Alex Jones.
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.960]  They keep pushing you forward.
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:38.360]  And I hear you calling them to do that more.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:41.920]  And I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate that because I think how you've been able
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:47.360]  to stay in the fight and never surrender on these issues is an inspiration to others
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:51.040]  or should be an inspiration to others, both that you're doing that and some of the techniques
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.760]  that you've used to be able to do that.
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:56.400]  Well, I appreciate you, brother, but we're all in this together and you know the war
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:00.480]  they've been waging on anybody that's for the country existing, anybody that believes
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:01.480]  in sovereignty.
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:06.400]  They are pushing hard against you, against everybody because we started to win the last
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:07.400]  few years.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:11.240]  But it appears, and I agree with you, that the swamp is starting to have Trump bog into
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:12.240]  it.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:14.480]  And I think what you've been saying about only really getting on his butt will get him
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:15.840]  to come out of his malaise.
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:18.440]  So let's talk about your plan to get culture to run.
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:23.320]  Well, one of the things I want people to realize, because I know, as you know, that when I get
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:27.760]  off this show, there'll be a lot of people screaming that I'm fake news and I'll be told
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:32.600]  that I'm some type of liberal plant and I will also be told that I am a never-trumper.
[02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:36.640]  For the record, for those not familiar with me, I voted for Trump.
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.080]  I donated to Trump.
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:39.640]  I volunteered for Trump.
[02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:41.880]  I rallied on overpasses for Trump.
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:43.720]  I attended Trump's inauguration.
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:48.240]  And when I endorsed Trump, which was the first presidential, Ali Pak, we usually endorsed
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:53.040]  congressional candidates and U.S. Senate candidates that we believe support the existing immigration
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:57.640]  laws instead of any form of amnesty that would permanently destroy our borders.
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:02.200]  We never had endorsed in our 15-year history a presidential candidate.
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:07.480]  And the reason I endorsed Donald Trump was because he took the things that I've been
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:11.520]  saying and that you've been saying, combined with putting something, doing something that
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:16.840]  had never been possible before, putting the victims of illegal aid and criminals on stage
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:18.320]  with him.
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:19.320]  I endorsed him.
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:22.960]  And when I did, I blew apart about, you know, the people that sustain your operation.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.080]  Well, I lost about a third of my financial backers when I endorsed Trump.
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:28.520]  And many of them sent me the same messages.
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:29.880]  They're like, William, we trust you.
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:31.160]  We believe what you were saying.
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:32.320]  We just don't trust Trump.
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:37.600]  We don't think that he is sincere about what he's saying and what he's doing.
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:41.960]  We understand that what he's saying and doing is what we want to hear, but they just didn't
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:42.960]  believe it.
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:45.560]  So I took a big hit to support Donald Trump.
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:49.400]  Now, since that time, we've had to drop our endorsement of Donald Trump because he did
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:53.080]  not keep his promise to end DACA amnesty on day one.
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:54.880]  We did not abandon him quickly.
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:58.920]  We spent seven months calling and begging and writing the White House and everything
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:02.720]  we could think of the dude asking to honor his promises.
[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:04.240]  And then we dropped our endorsement.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:09.440]  Since that time, we're now tracking at least 10 critical immigration promises that Donald
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:14.720]  Trump has either unfulfilled or flat out broken or done doing 180 degrees opposite
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:16.520]  from what we ask him to do.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.480]  So as you know, Alex, when you're in a position like me where you're banned from Fox News
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:25.120]  and MSNBC and all the others, and we're still on Facebook and Twitter, but we're shadow
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:29.960]  banned or sandbag, so when I have something to say without my blue checkmark, I'm lucky
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:36.280]  if a couple hundred people hear it, even though 600,000 people have joined our pages.
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:37.960]  We have to feel a little sensational sometimes.
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:40.120]  We have to be very entertaining.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:44.960]  And one of the entertaining, sensational things I've suggested is that Ann Coulter should
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:51.520]  consider running against Donald Trump and the 2020 primary because he is not listening
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:52.520]  to his base.
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:55.680]  He is not honoring his campaign promises on immigration.
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:01.440]  And I think that Ann Coulter, who's as imperfect as any of us, you know, I was not a fan of
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:05.840]  her support for Mitt Romney at one point or her closeness with Chris Christie, who are
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:12.320]  both amnesty supporting globalists, in my opinion, you know, I think Coulter could shake
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:13.320]  him up.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.720]  And, you know, I wouldn't make any money from the ratings, but can you imagine the ratings
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.520]  and the entertainment value on an Ann Coulter-Donald Trump debate?
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:25.320]  This would be something that- Well, it's obviously a great idea, and of course you're
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:26.320]  the guy that had it.
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:27.320]  And I want to be clear.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:32.080]  I was an earlier supporter of Trump, I think on getting this out of the TPP and just saying
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:35.440]  that it's good to have a nation existing and good to defend the Second Amendment.
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.080]  And so many things he's done in a lot of areas are really good and a lot better Supreme Court
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:47.280]  justice than Hillary, but at the same time, when he then lets the FBI run rampant and leaves
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.280]  these Democrats in place, and all these other things that are against his own interest,
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:56.680]  it's good to actually have a shot fired across his bow politically to let him know that his
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.880]  real base is getting very, very unhappy about what's happening.
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.760]  I've talked to big national talk show hosts, multiple ones that are very close friends
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.760]  with Trump.
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:05.760]  He talks to them almost every day.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:08.480]  And, you know, Sean Hannity won't criticize the president.
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:12.400]  He trusts him, and I get that, and I think Hannity does a great job.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:19.160]  And some of the others have found that, you know, Trump only listens to them when they criticize him about what he's doing.
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:24.520]  And so I think, you know, this whole hand-culture idea is a good one overall.
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:26.760]  My issue is I agree with you.
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:32.400]  I agree with you that overall he's not done a bunch of stuff he said he'd do on immigration
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:36.360]  yet that he could have with executive power, like declare an emergency and just do it.
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:41.360]  That said, though, culture criticizes the emergency that I was talking about, but instead says
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:43.840]  keep the government shut down, which hurts the economy.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:47.360]  Why not just bypass Pelosi having power to declare the emergency to the Constitution?
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.240]  So I disagree with culture on some things as well.
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:51.600]  So it doesn't mean I really don't want Trump to win reelection.
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:55.400]  But I think you're saying get culture to start talking about running to get Trump back on
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  the straight and narrow.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.640]  Well, and even if she needs to run, I don't think that it would be harmful for us to have
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:06.960]  a healthy GOP primary based on the issues and hold Trump accountable.
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:12.240]  And there's a wide variation of people who do and do not support what I'm doing right
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:13.240]  now.
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:15.120]  Me personally, I will never vote for Donald Trump again.
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:20.200]  I don't care if he's running against the socialist Oscar Cortez or whatever name is.
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:23.440]  I can't vote for him again because I feel very betrayed.
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:29.160]  So it felt great during the campaign and at the inauguration to hear things that I've
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:34.120]  been saying for years echoing off the walls of the White House and to have some hope that
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:35.760]  that was going to take place.
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.400]  At this point in the battle to save this country from amnesty legislation, I mean, most of
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:43.160]  the country and maybe a lot of people listening right now would be shocked to know that there
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:48.400]  was an amnesty embedded in legislation that failed thanks to the Democrats last week that
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.400]  would have pushed us beyond the point of no return.
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:55.640]  It would have given amnesty to over one million DACA and TPS illegal immigrants.
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:57.640]  And everybody said, oh, it was a temporary thing.
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.040]  Listen, folks, there's nothing temporary about temporary protective statuses.
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:02.040]  Okay.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.040]  I've never seen one canceled in the last 20, 30 years.
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:06.040]  Okay.
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:07.040]  And what Trump tried to do.
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:09.960]  What about the argument he did where he said, okay, on the second amendment, have whatever
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:10.960]  you want.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.840]  They said ban all guns, blow up on their face.
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:15.000]  He did this with DACA and stuff a year and a half ago.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  They said, we want everything.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  No borders.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.720]  And I think he does that as a tactic, knowing that they're not going to be reasonable.
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:25.120]  Well, a lot of people say that and a lot of people say that this is all part of Trump's
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.920]  big game plan and things like that.
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:30.280]  But look, folks, he's the president of the United States and these are things he's saying
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:36.400]  directly from the Oval Office, the president of the United States has endorsed and is supporting
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:39.640]  amnesty bills that would destroy the border forevermore.
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.000]  And they thank God there are enough Americans who have been willing to stand up and push
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.600]  back and fight against those bills to stop them because many people don't want to believe
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  it or don't want to say that.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:48.600]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:52.600]  I mean, first, a full wall down a smaller wall, the wall is secondary to kicking people
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:55.440]  out there illegally.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:59.160]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:03.960]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.920]  at heart and body extract.

[02:31:56.400 --> 02:32:01.680]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:06.000]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.360]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:12.160]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:15.520]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:18.120]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:20.480]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:25.240]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:29.880]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:35.160]  spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to
[02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:38.920]  stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:43.160]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now, and we're still able to operate the
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:46.080]  shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact we're trying to block
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.960]  our commerce, and you're right to the market.
[02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:52.680]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[02:32:52.680 --> 02:33:18.680]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour, we're your support, I'm counting on you.
[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:34.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:37.480]  All right, I've got our guests on by this, and I'm going to continue into the next hour
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:38.480]  a little bit.
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:41.560]  In the next segment with your phone calls, William Gaines here, he's written the article
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:48.920]  why I want inculter to run for president, 2020, it's AliPak.us, it's also up on InfoWars.com,
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:53.280]  and hey, I like the idea of getting other people to run the Republican primary.
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:57.160]  That would certainly make her look more extreme than Trump, and probably get him even more
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:02.280]  votes, maybe inculter to get elected, that would be crazy.
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:06.800]  I know this, the globalists want Trump out because he's actually trying to be president,
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:12.080]  but I understand the lesser of two evil arguments is a fallacy, but William, when you talk about
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:20.440]  Alexandria, Cortez, you talk about Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, you talk about Camilla
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:26.600]  Harris saying no borders, period, and all of this, I mean, I get your point about Trump
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:33.800]  compromising with them, I just couldn't imagine not voting and supporting Trump over somebody
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:39.640]  like Pocahontas.
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:43.720]  All immediately, it takes a while, the nation of America is sort of strong like that.
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:46.720]  We could be mortally wounded already, we could be beyond the point of no return, there's
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:50.920]  a good chance that enough illegal immigrants combined with Muslim refugee resettlement
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:55.720]  programs and others have now already taken us beyond the numeric point of no return,
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:59.760]  and that anyone promising the things that Donald Trump promised us could never be elected
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  president again.
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.320]  Now, I don't know if we're past that invisible point yet or not, but we've got to be close
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:08.360]  to it because everybody saw how close Trump came.
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:14.440]  Well, the bill that Trump endorsed last week would have eventually displaced one million
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:16.280]  Trump voters, okay?
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:20.840]  One million illegal immigrants would have been on a path to eventual citizenship where
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.600]  they would vote Democrat, and we know they vote Democrat because of surveys, polling
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:31.560]  data, what the 1986 amnesty did to turn Republican state of California permanent socialist blue.
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:39.720]  If that bill passes or the current bill being pushed by nepotism, son-in-law, Jared Kushner,
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:43.400]  who if anybody would like to write to Jared Kushner and say, please don't continue supporting
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:48.920]  amnesty deals with Donald Trump, you can write him at, I think it's what, 666 Manhattan
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:54.520]  Avenue is where his real estate empire and offices are located.
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:36:00.520]  Kushner is on point now offering 1.8 million green cards, which means a path to citizenship,
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:01.880]  permanent legal status.
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:05.840]  The DACA, illegal aliens, DACA is an amnesty.
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:11.760]  So when Trump says it's not an amnesty, it's a temporary three-year continuation of DACA,
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  it's an amnesty.
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.960]  And he's not being very straightforward or honest with us.
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:20.000]  And there are a lot of people that have heard so many lies that even when I come along with
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.640]  and representing the people who have been fighting in the trenches to stop amnesty for
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:29.160]  over a decade before Trump became a Johnny-come-lately to these issues, Trump had no credibility
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:30.160]  on these issues.
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.920]  He gained his credibility through the support of people like you and me and Ann Coulter and
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:41.680]  Jeff Sessions and Sheriff Joe Arpaio who were so thankful to have someone champion our causes.
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.680]  But here's the list, the tracking list of where Trump is at on immigration issues based
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:51.120]  on our volunteer researchers at AliPak.us.
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:54.840]  Trump promised that the caravan illegals could not come into the USA.
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:58.560]  We're going to be putting out an article about 48 hours showing that most of the caravan
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:02.160]  illegal aliens have been allowed into the United States and that's why more caravans
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:03.720]  are forming.
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:08.640]  Trump promised a border wall, there's no wall, and now he's talking about partial fencing
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:11.920]  in some places instead of a wall.
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:14.920]  Trump promised to end DACA amnesty on his first day in office.
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:20.200]  He continued the DACA for over a year breaking his promise before any liberal judge, which
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:23.480]  once again, I heard you talking earlier Alex about how the president doesn't have to listen
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:28.000]  to one judge beneath the Supreme Court on these things, I completely agree.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:33.320]  But now that a judge has given him cover on the DACA, he did not end DACA and he seeks
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:38.000]  to make DACA permanent and make it, take it from an unconstitutional Obama directive
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.120]  in memos to a formal law.
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:44.520]  And I can tell you, we did not elect Donald Trump to make DACA permanent.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:48.560]  We elected Donald Trump because he promised us illegal immigrants including DACA dreamers
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:50.760]  had to leave the country.
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:55.040]  Everyone should remember this when he told us this, he said we either have a country or
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:56.040]  we don't.
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:00.680]  He told us the illegals had to leave, he told us he was going to form a deportation force,
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:02.280]  he's doing none of these things.
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:06.480]  He's actually doing something 180 degrees different than that.
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.600]  He promised us recently, red meat just before the midterm elections where a lot of voters
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.320]  like me did not get excited about things, that he was going to end birthright citizenship
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.720]  through an executive order, didn't do it.
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.640]  He told us recently he was going to declare a state of emergency to get the wall built,
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.640]  didn't do it.
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:26.600]  He told us he was sending the military to help deal with the invasion.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:31.160]  They were down there flipping burgers and stringing up some wire and standing back.
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:35.320]  Trump promised to end catch and release of illegal aliens, but catch and release continues
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.600]  and patriots on the ground in Arizona are doing live videos showing the DHS buses, our
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:42.480]  tax money, paying for the gas, paying for the drivers.
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:49.520]  Our tax money is busing illegal aliens into the country and turning them free.
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:56.240]  There's a pattern here that we see Trump shout something out or his administration will do
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:01.040]  something that will catch the ire of the opposition, as you and I often do.
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:06.880]  Trump will say, I'll give you the asylum seeking illegals must be returned to Mexico and next
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:11.040]  week we're going to start sending them back at 20 per day and then the media goes, oh,
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.880]  that horrible racist Donald Trump is going to start sending the asylum seekers back to
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:18.800]  Mexico and then you find out, no, Mexico never agreed to this.
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:22.600]  Nobody's really going back to Mexico, but everybody heard the initial shouting.
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:25.600]  So there's so many people hearing this right now that I think, well, he follows it up and
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:28.120]  says we're going to try to cut funding to Mexico because they're not doing it.
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.800]  But a lot of it is, is that Trump is surrounded by a bunch of people that are from the swamp
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:34.680]  who don't carry out what he says.
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:36.160]  They brag about it.
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:37.160]  Yeah.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:40.840]  He hired a lot of globalists and open borders people and stuck them at DHS and all around
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:44.560]  them and ignored people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the people who got him elected.
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.400]  He didn't put his base in place and, you know, we're over two years in now.
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.800]  So I'm asking people to support what we're doing for several reasons here.
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.600]  Alex, one, if you like the idea of running and culture to try to get Donald Trump to
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.160]  return to his campaign promises, then we like your support.
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:04.320]  If you want to help stop amnesty bills, which will neutralize millions of you listening
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:09.120]  out there and future US elections, if you realize that you cannot compete against two
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:14.200]  to three or four million, I think the, the amnesty bills that Donald Trump endorsed that
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:17.920]  we fought to stop would have given amnesty to four million illegal aliens.
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.480]  So that's four million Trump voters thrown under the bus permanently in future US elections,
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:27.920]  which would give Democrats a permanent monopoly over US elections, government and laws.
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:33.360]  The amnesty legislation that Alipak is fighting to stop will eventually might take five years,
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:39.400]  10 or 15 at max, will give Democrats a permanent monopoly over US elections, government and
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:40.400]  laws.
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:46.920]  And there's no way that you can beat these identity politics, anti-white racist socialist
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:53.000]  agendas with some type of rational appeal that's going to change the outcome of elections
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  anymore.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.960]  They're taking us beyond that point of no return.
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:59.240]  And at this point, that's where Trump is headed and we're trying to stop.
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:04.080]  So if you oppose the amnesty, we need your support, and even if you want to see Donald
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:08.880]  Trump reelected in 2020, we're asking for your support because you need to realize whether
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.600]  I'm here telling you this or not, whether you want to think about this or not.
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:17.040]  There are millions of Americans like me that supported Donald Trump fervently and endorsed
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:21.280]  him and voted for him that won't be back already.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:22.680]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.760]  I mean, here's the bottom line.
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:29.880]  We're getting from these socialist collapsed countries, the very worst dumbest people who
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.880]  want a free handout.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.920]  They admit that on average.
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:37.560]  And so when they do vote, they do almost overwhelming vote Democrat, especially the Islamist being
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:41.640]  brought in who are all under the control of their imams, who they can put in these factories.
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:45.440]  I mean, this is really, really scary, this giant permanent third world population being
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:48.120]  brought in that'll then be voting.
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:50.440]  So I get what you're saying overall.
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:53.520]  And the bigger question is, why is Trump doing this?
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.360]  I mean, I'm all for the wall, but it becomes a distraction from not allowing the amnesty
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:01.560]  because every time you do an amnesty, it just encourages the next group to come.
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:03.480]  And, you know, Ronald Reagan found that out.
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:04.480]  You're absolutely right.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.600]  You know, if most of these folks didn't vote to take the guns and go along with the leftist
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:12.320]  ideology that I wouldn't care if America turned brown.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:15.800]  The problem is they're coming from countries that people believe in socialism by their
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:18.800]  hellholes and it's a very, very sad thing.
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:21.360]  So we'll continue to track this to get you back up in the next few weeks.
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.160]  Welcome to come on The War Room, on The David Knight Show with others, Mr. Gean, and break

[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:31.080]  Okay, we had a guest on for two seconds and went back to your calls now and I asked Josh
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:37.600]  and Arizona to hold because we talked about the WikiLeaks, which talks about children
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:44.720]  in hot tubs and $64,000, $5,000 of hot dogs for Obama and cheese pizza and the kids will
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:49.080]  be ready for your pleasure and Alistair Crowley rituals and blood and semen and it's devil
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:50.080]  worship.
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:56.120]  And it's the Podestas and one Podesta brothers in the Washington Post in 2007 saying I have
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:01.520]  a basement that I watched, you know, deviant movies in and he has pictures of naked kids
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:05.760]  all over his house in sexual poses.
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:07.080]  It's all in plain view of these people.
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:12.360]  They're just put in our face and they want a system where we can't do anything to stop
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:13.360]  them.
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:19.560]  That's like Bill Maher, the name of his production company is KidLove, which is, you know, this
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:22.880]  is an ample slogan, basically, and then he makes jokes about having sex with kids all
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.720]  the time and says it's okay to have sex with, you know, kids that have sex with 35 year
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:29.720]  olds and they're 12.
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:37.960]  It's just incredibly outrageous, evil, pathetic stuff of these soulless demons like Bill Maher.
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:44.960]  But Josh was saying he had a theory dealing with what walnut sauce is and are you to say
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:51.440]  it's the pituitary gland because they confirm that Jimmy Savelle and others would torture
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:55.120]  little kids to death, but if they couldn't get regular ones to kill, if everything was
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.960]  to grab a kid and run over the cars, they could say, oh, there's a police report.
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:02.600]  They get run over, but they would hurry to the morgue and they work with different different
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:07.520]  government control morgues and eat the pituitary gland as quickly as possible and get high
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:08.520]  off of it.
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:09.520]  So yes.
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:10.520]  Is that what you're going to say?
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  Walnut sauce is Josh?
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:21.000]  Well, Alex, uh, yeah, uh, essentially it's a, so if you, if you search engine, uh, adrenal
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:29.880]  cortex transverse, that's a transverse by section of the adrenal cortex, uh, it looks
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.240]  strikingly similar to a walnut.
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:34.240]  Okay.
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:38.480]  And, uh, we all know that the, uh, say that in layman's terms, you're saying to me, turn
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:39.480]  it inside out.
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:48.840]  Well, no, if you just, uh, cut it in half, the color, the, uh, the, the shape, the, uh,
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:52.800]  the convolutions, the, the contouring, what are you saying?
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:56.600]  Somebody that says in his emails, he's an Aleister Crowley rituals, they say, we'll have
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:49:59.360]  the blood, the urine, the breast milk for you.
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:02.600]  Are you saying that somebody like that would actually be eating pituitary glands?
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:09.200]  Uh, do you know the Associated Press that Al Gore, not in case he got shot, he carried
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:15.480]  around a refrigerator full of blood that he didn't just inject.
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:16.480]  He drank it.
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:20.040]  And by the way, it's in the news today, I have an article here where there's these companies
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:22.360]  coming out of everywhere where you get young people's blood.
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:27.080]  Oh, and if the kids volunteer, they have rights now, they can be emancipated, they can go
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:28.080]  give blood when they're 10.
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:31.520]  So California says you can take a vaccine when you're 10 or, you know, another one
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:32.800]  have sex when you're 10.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:34.040]  That's why they want this start.
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:38.400]  So kids can start, you know, again being paid to have their blood taken by these people.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:39.400]  That's in the news today.
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:40.400]  Do you believe it?
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:41.400]  It's vampirism.
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:42.400]  Absolutely.
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:43.400]  I believe it.
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:51.840]  But, uh, but anyways, the, uh, so, uh, John Irving, last week, touched on this with, uh,
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:57.840]  the adrenochrome, the adrenochrome reference, and, uh, that's the, uh, that's the favorite
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:00.880]  cocktail among, uh, devil worshipers.
[02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:07.240]  And, uh, if you look at the Podesta emails, Alex, you'll see that, uh, the walnut sauce
[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:15.360]  was, uh, you know, what was being served during their, uh, sort of, uh, brainstorming session
[02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:18.760]  in terms of Hillary fundraising and, uh, campaigning.
[02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:19.760]  Yes.
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:20.760]  They're going to have a fundraiser.
[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:21.760]  They're going to have walnut sauce.
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:22.760]  Yep.
[02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:23.760]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:25.760]  But adrenochrome is, uh, you know, it's an apron.
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:31.800]  It's, uh, it's a, uh, it's an oxidized, uh, version of adrenaline that you can consume
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:36.640]  and it gets you amped and, uh, listen, I appreciate your call, uh, bottom line, sir.
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:38.240]  These people are into all of that.
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:39.240]  Okay.
[02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:45.440]  And just, you look at John Podesta, he looks like a demonic vampire ghoul, he even has
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:50.760]  vampire teeth and, and he's just, he's, he's the worst people.
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:53.320]  Who do you think Hillary wants to work for?
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:52:00.600]  Ugly, demonic, twisted, stinking people because she's a stinking demonic monster.
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:02.800]  They got one thing on their mind.
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:10.080]  One thing, and you know what that is, and they're coming and coming for everything you
[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:14.640]  got Anthony in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:15.640]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:16.640]  Go ahead.
[02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:17.640]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:18.640]  Hi brother.
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:19.640]  Nice to meet you man.
[02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:20.640]  Nice to meet you.
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:30.640]  So I'm just watching this like amazing Desmond kid and I mean, I just don't know what to
[02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:31.640]  think.
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:36.280]  Oh, how NBC, ABC, CBS has him dancing, half naked everywhere in front of men throwing
[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:37.280]  money at him.
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:41.640]  And he talks about how he uses catamine on TV and looks all drugged out and so, so cute.
[02:52:41.640 --> 02:52:42.640]  Yeah.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:43.640]  Yeah.
[02:52:43.640 --> 02:52:49.640]  Like, I mean, I'm, I'm 25, 25 and I mean, I'm, don't have any kids yet, but like, you
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:53.520]  know, am I going to have to worry about, you know, that happening to my kids?
[02:52:53.520 --> 02:52:54.520]  That's really what I'm worried.
[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:55.520]  Yes.
[02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:58.760]  This is taught in the schools and adults come, uh, men come dress as women and then
[02:52:58.760 --> 02:53:01.680]  talk to your child about the sexual preference they have.
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:05.960]  If anyone else did this to you, uh, you know, at a park, they go to jail, but as long as
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:10.040]  they go, I'm a drag queen, I'm going to talk to your five year old now about being a drag
[02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:11.040]  queen.
[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:12.040]  It's like, oh, please do.
[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:13.040]  How nice.
[02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:16.240]  Oh, and the kid hangs out with a known ax murderer and talks about using drugs with
[02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:17.240]  him on TV.
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:19.240]  It's so good.
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:20.240]  Yeah.
[02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:21.240]  Yeah.
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:28.320]  Like, like, and then they're like telling like how, like, you know, how good parents
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:29.320]  they are.
[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.320]  Meanwhile done.
[02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:31.320]  Neither one of them have any jobs.
[02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:34.880]  Well, of course, the mom and dad don't have a job, but, but there's, but there's son who's
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:37.080]  now a girl since age five.
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:41.320]  He goes and dances at strip clubs, but it's okay.
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:42.320]  Yeah.
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:45.200]  Because his dad looks like Brian Stelter or something.
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:47.280]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:50.320]  They admitted this in the British news and here almost all these kids are autistic.
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:51.320]  So they're victims.
[02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:53.080]  They don't know what's happening to them.
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:55.160]  And this is the sacrament of the left.
[02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:57.160]  This is their religion.
[02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:00.280]  And the only time they have any energy is when they're stealing a child's future.
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:05.400]  They understand when you are satanically controlled under that umbrella, these people have no energy
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:08.560]  or never alive unless they're doing bad.
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:16.040]  And so people like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Adolf Hitler, they were only happy when they
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:17.560]  were doing bad things.
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:19.480]  And they talked about it.
[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:23.200]  And I've interviewed some of the famous psychiatrists, the top psychiatrists, serial killers, and
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:28.120]  they'll talk about that in their books that everything's like depression and demons attacking
[02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:31.240]  them and the nightmares and they're cold and they're alone.
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:37.260]  But if they can just get a kid in the basement and torture them and have them beg for mommy,
[02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:38.760]  they just feel alive.
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:41.120]  It's like it's like this beautiful Beethoven to them.
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:42.120]  You and I would kill ourselves.
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:44.280]  We had to listen to kids be tortured and couldn't help them.
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:46.400]  To them, it's the most beautiful thing in the world.
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.360]  They call it the beautiful music.
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:50.480]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.360]  They just sit in dungeons with kids begging for mommy and they get them out and rape
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:54.360]  them and torture them.
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:58.040]  And then they'll give them drugs to jack them back up and feed them and then dribble them
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:00.160]  back down and then torture them for a few weeks again.
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:04.520]  And then finally, once they've given up, they call using it up.
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:09.720]  They gut them and drink their blood at a big satanic ritual and it's what they do.
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:11.520]  I mean, the Podestas, they never did anything wrong.
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:14.880]  They just find it the Arab Spring and mass murder over there and put al-Qaeda and ISIS
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:17.040]  in charge.
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:18.680]  And so that's who they are.
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:22.560]  And then the whole corporate media covers it up.
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:26.840]  I remember all that damning stuff, the best emails was too powerful.
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.480]  New York City, other states, flying kids in, we'll have seven-year-olds in the hot tub
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:31.480]  ready for you.
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:33.360]  These are pretty well-behaved, but they're still kids.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:39.080]  They'll be there for your entertainment, $65,000 of hot dogs coming in, you know, for the
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:44.480]  pizza party and it goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:49.520]  And what were they going to do when all that had come out?
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:50.520]  What were they going to do?
[02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:57.320]  Well, they just said Newsweek, Associated Press, Reuters, CNN, MSNBC, all point at a
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:01.880]  pizza place and this info that had a basement in it and it was doing all the stuff that
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:06.560]  Podestas and others went to to distract everything onto that, like the senator.
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:11.280]  And so everything became that, that it wasn't going on there, so we could ignore Lolita Express
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:16.320]  and the airplanes and the little kids and the Clintons and all the rape and all the
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:20.360]  UN doing it and Hillary's top people caught smuggling kids in and out of the country.
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:21.360]  It's incredible.
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:24.080]  We're going to go to break, come up with more calls.
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:27.600]  And then Matt Bracken is going to take over here very shortly, but just reaching out to
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.400]  all the listeners, when you call them, tell me how great I am.
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:36.720]  I appreciate you, but it kind of becomes anachronism because you're the reason we're here and
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:41.000]  I hate having to come to you and say, financially support us or we won't be here, but I'm
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:42.920]  literally in your hands.
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:45.920]  Now I'm resisting, we're fighting them hard.
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:50.080]  You know, supporting us that you've got people committed to go to the very end in this fight,
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:52.680]  but I really don't want the globalists to win.
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:59.040]  And we need to be funded massively and it's so easy to do if you just go to MFullWarStore.com
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:05.520]  and get the all new turbo force, get the body's ultimate turmeric formula, get survival shield
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.240]  X3 now with all three types of iodine, with a deep breath crystal source, that's special
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:11.080]  50% off, it's about the end.
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:14.640]  Super Bowl Vitality is the last run of it, so we can't get the Wildcraft at herbs anymore.
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:16.080]  We may be able to reformulate it on the road.
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:17.080]  I don't know.
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:21.080]  The point is, this is the last run of that MFullWarStore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:25.960]  All right, we're going to come right back in just two minutes with more of your calls
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:30.360]  and then Matt Bracken takes over to get into all the things that are happening and so much
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:31.360]  more.
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:32.360]  Stay with us.
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:33.360]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:36.520]  But just remember this, regardless of what happens with Alex Jones or Trump or anybody
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:40.960]  else, you know the truth and you just keep moving forward, you keep warning people, you
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:44.040]  keep exposing these evil monsters, the children are counting on you.
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:50.920]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:57.680]  lead you more tired than ever.

[03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:13.600]  I'm trying to get to the Alex Jones show.

[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:22.360]  Michael in Florida, let's talk about censorship.
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:23.360]  You're on the air.
[03:00:23.360 --> 03:00:24.360]  Go ahead.
[03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:25.360]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:26.360]  I really appreciate you thanking my call.
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:27.360]  Appreciate you.
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:34.280]  I just want to say how much it means to me that the courage you have to do what you do
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:35.280]  every day.
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:42.220]  It helps me get through the day, and I was shocked when you were talking about your phone
[03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:47.080]  taping your phone, the camera on your phone, I did that about a year ago, but it's a little
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:48.080]  consequence.
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:55.240]  I'm running two VPNs and encryption on my phone, and when I'm watching your show, it's
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:00:59.880]  amazing how when you get the key points that I'm sure nobody, the powers that we don't
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:04.000]  want anybody to hear, my phone's censored then.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  It's pretty shocking.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:09.320]  Well, they admit that they are in people's phones in live time, and now they're going
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:14.560]  public, that all the new phones and everything by next year, starting next month, they're
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:19.960]  phasing in with Microsoft, will have all these different agencies and private liberal groups
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:24.280]  through a thing called News Guard in your phone in live time, tracking what you do.
[03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:25.920]  And notice they're introducing it to us.
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.280]  Oh, there's a bug in iPhone where anybody can call you and just hit a button and listen
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:32.280]  to you in your house.
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:33.280]  Yeah.
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:36.600]  Also, you know, these people call themselves socialists.
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:37.600]  They're not socialists.
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:38.600]  They're communists.
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:44.600]  They're different than the same people that were behind the Red Army Faction in Europe.
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:48.280]  I think it's about time to start calling them what they are.
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:53.160]  Well, what I found is, there's people that are just committed to evil, and these different
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:57.560]  evil groups work together, but I mean, who do you think, I mean, I think if we say there's
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:01.560]  one evil group on the planet, then that distracts from all the different evil groups that link
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:05.240]  up, but there are certainly different groups that have proclivity for evil.
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:06.240]  I agree.
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:07.240]  I agree.
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:13.120]  It's, just know when the time comes, these people that are trying to dox you for your
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:15.760]  beliefs, whatever, don't be afraid of them.
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.280]  Just look at you and encourage you have to do what you do every day.
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:25.400]  I see the stress in your face when I'm watching, and just know God puts you where you are for
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:26.400]  a reason.
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:29.080]  Well, I appreciate that, brother, but listen, I can't give up.
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:30.840]  I mean, they're going to destroy me one way or the other.
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:33.880]  I might as well make them fight for it and get as much done as I can to expose them in
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:34.880]  the process.
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:36.800]  I'm actually just tired.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:39.640]  I'm just, you know, tired sometimes, but that's okay.
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:43.160]  I mean, I'm mad that don't do a better job really, because I mean, I know how to beat
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:44.160]  these people.
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:45.440]  And of course, our listeners do too.
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:46.440]  God bless you.
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:47.440]  Thanks, Michael.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:48.440]  Okay.
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:53.920]  Joe in New York, we'll talk about medical slow kill, and then I've got, Andy was talking
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:57.840]  about being involved in the fight for the second A. Yeah, that's the big one.
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:02:58.840]  They're coming out of the guns.
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:01.040]  The Democrats say they have the votes in the house to ban semi-autos.
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:04.480]  They're going to try to pass it and notice they've gone from denying they want to ban
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:07.480]  the second amendment to admitting it, Andy.
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:08.480]  Yeah.
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:09.480]  It's, it's crazy.
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:14.000]  Got to say, Alex, I'm a big fan of the show with store both of my daughters and keep fighting
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  the good fight.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.760]  Before I get to my point, I just want to say real quick, big time hunter, and I'll tell
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:22.640]  you at four o'clock in the morning, nothing gets me ready to go out and hit the woods
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:27.400]  like a drop of secret 12, little brain force plus guys need to try that stuff, get out
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:31.840]  there and support the fight and do yourself some good back to the great product.
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:34.360]  I need to take some of that because I'm a little bit run down with allergies today.
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:36.000]  And I'm always like, wait, my own products are great.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.640]  I can actually take some brain force pluses of secret 12.
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:39.640]  You're absolutely right.
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:40.640]  There you go.
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:46.000]  Well, hey, in my, my home state of Connecticut here, we're facing some very tough economic
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.120]  times, which is causing taxes to go up.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:51.200]  There's businesses and people leaving the state and droves.
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:55.960]  One of the taxes they're introducing or want to hopefully this won't pass is they want
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:01.200]  a 50% tax on your ammunition, no matter what it is.
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.920]  They also forced, I mean, they forced Remington out of business, the same law firm suing
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:08.920]  me, uh, shoot Remington out of business.
[03:04:08.920 --> 03:04:09.920]  Yeah.
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:14.520]  Another one they're trying to pass is to ban all semi-automatic weapons in my state, which
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:18.920]  means anything, well, you know what a semi-automatic is, anything semi-automatic.
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:19.920]  Yeah.
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:20.920]  Anything fully.
[03:04:20.920 --> 03:04:23.720]  Anything you pull the trigger, it shoots, it shoots the bullet.
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:24.720]  Right.
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:26.840]  And that has a detachable magazine.
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:32.280]  Well, brother, they're suing me up in Connecticut and their goal, they admit to quote, shut
[03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:33.280]  me down.
[03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:35.360]  So I'll probably be seeing you up there in Connecticut down the road.
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:38.800]  Andy, thank you to Joe and Douglas and Phillip and Andy, another Andy.
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:39.800]  I apologize.
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:40.800]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:42.120]  I'll put you in the front of the line.
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:44.080]  Matt Bracken in 60 seconds.
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.640]  Thank you all for what you do, folks, understand you are the power that moves the ball in
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:48.640]  the field.
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:49.640]  So tell folks about the broadcast.
[03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:50.640]  Thank you again.
[03:04:50.640 --> 03:05:18.440]  Thank you.
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:27.560]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.
[03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:32.000]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:35.800]  up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:38.760]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home.
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:42.120]  TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:43.960]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:05:43.960 --> 03:06:08.400]  Curc up with TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[03:06:08.400 --> 03:06:14.600]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:16.880]  and do nothing.
[03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:21.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:27.320]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:41.960]  Yeah, you better hide in the cellar with what's coming.
[03:06:41.960 --> 03:06:46.160]  I don't know if you've heard the latest false flag attack.
[03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:51.800]  It appears that some actor I never heard of before today named Jesse Smollett.
[03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:57.600]  This is Matt Bracken by the way, not Alex and not Paul Joseph Watson filling in today.
[03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:04.160]  Anyway, there's a TV show called Empire, I've never seen it, I don't know what it's about.
[03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:10.720]  But there's an actor named Jesse Smollett and I guess he's a black gay guy and he claims
[03:07:10.720 --> 03:07:17.240]  that he was beaten up by some MAGA, some MAGA thugs in Chicago at two o'clock in the morning
[03:07:17.240 --> 03:07:22.920]  last night and he drove himself to the hospital, didn't call the police.
[03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:27.960]  He said that these white racist MAGA guys were wandering around Chicago, I guess it
[03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:29.880]  was negative 20.
[03:07:29.880 --> 03:07:35.160]  This is when Jesse Smollett at two o'clock in the morning was out going to a subway for
[03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:37.800]  his late night snack.
[03:07:37.800 --> 03:07:43.800]  Everybody does that in Chicago when it's minus 20 and the wind chills like minus 50.
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:51.280]  But there he was out on the sidewalk and some MAGA people wearing ski masks beat him up
[03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:55.040]  and threw bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.
[03:07:55.040 --> 03:08:01.440]  Now, obviously this sounds like it's complete BS and you would think that a week after the
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:08.280]  Covington event was exposed as a complete hoax where the media rearranged the facts
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:15.000]  in that initial clip to say that these MAGA hat wearing kids surrounded this poor Native
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:22.000]  American elder who was just harmlessly tapping on his Tom Tom drum and these white racist
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.560]  MAGA kids practically lynched him.
[03:08:24.560 --> 03:08:27.040]  They were almost ready to lynch him.
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:31.760]  Of course, that turned out to be complete BS.
[03:08:31.760 --> 03:08:39.360]  Now this Jesse Smollett is throwing his fuel on the fire claiming that some MAGA people,
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:44.960]  people saying this is for MAGA who were wearing ski masks with bleach and nooses out at two
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:51.520]  o'clock in the morning just happened to spot him and said, you're that gay black guy from
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:57.760]  Empire as if people who were MAGA supporters like me, I would have no idea who this guy
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:00.600]  was or what the TV show was.
[03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:03.960]  But they just happened to spot him and practically lynch him.
[03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:10.560]  Now, if you go to the TMZ story, there's already like something like 4000 comments.
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:15.040]  And when I saw one, I just went to newest comments to see how they're rolling in.
[03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:21.120]  And I saw one that said, you know, you MAGA guys are going to be eradicated soon, which
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:24.640]  sounds an awful lot like a call for genocide.
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:29.200]  So I left the comment, you know, I left the comment saying, hey, boy, there's the left
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:31.800]  calling for genocide again.
[03:09:31.800 --> 03:09:35.440]  And the guy then comes back and says, I'll be in the ground soon.
[03:09:35.440 --> 03:09:42.960]  Now this, this brings up the subject of Covington, which led to yesterday, not one, but three
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:49.520]  different really good articles being written about the subject of the left's push.
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:51.600]  You can call it nothing else now.
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:59.080]  It's the preparatory stage for what would become a genocide of conservative white males.
[03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:04.120]  You've seen this in history, you know, over and over again, before every big socialist
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:09.560]  power grab when they really go full commie, they're going to wreck the economy.
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:14.720]  That's a given, but they're never going to say, whoopsie, it was our fault, our stupid
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:20.200]  socialist programs, you know, our $30 trillion free everything for everybody program blew
[03:10:20.200 --> 03:10:21.720]  up the economy.
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:25.800]  Must be our fault as socialists, hell no, they never do that.
[03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:30.440]  They just say it was the evil enemies of the state.
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:37.240]  In our case, it'll be those Christian white conservative men, they sabotaged our glorious
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:39.040]  socialist program.
[03:10:39.040 --> 03:10:46.640]  They do this every time in Germany, the national socialists that we call the Nazis, they scapegoated
[03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:54.680]  the Jews and in the Soviet Union, it was the slightly better to do farmers that they called
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:11:01.560]  the Kulaks, you know, in communist China, they called them the landlord class.
[03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:08.400]  So this is a way that the socialists, as they gather all the power to themselves, it's really
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:16.080]  a brilliant strategy because they get to unify their base in hatred and anger, very effective.
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:23.600]  They get to shift the blame for their own economic disasters onto their potential rivals, the
[03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:29.680]  people that, you know, years down the road might lead to a counter revolution.
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:35.640]  So you get your base fired up and then you send them out to wipe out your future political
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:39.160]  rivals, just eradicate them.
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:44.680]  Sometimes it's done like in Germany with gas chambers or in the Soviet Union with gulags.
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:51.640]  Sometimes like in Cambodia or Rwanda, it's done just at the local level with machetes,
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:55.640]  you know, with small arms and machetes.
[03:11:55.640 --> 03:12:00.800]  It doesn't require, you know, a huge infrastructure of gas chambers if the state riles up the
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:03.480]  anger to that extent.
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:09.520]  The article that I wrote about this week is up on a website called American Partisan
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:12.480]  that I strongly recommend everybody follow.
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:19.840]  It's military and, but primarily military tactical prepper kind of articles, but my
[03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:25.880]  article is called Covington gives a glimpse of Civil War two.
[03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:31.960]  And over at townhall.com, Kurt Schlichter has an article up the same exact subject.
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:32.960]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:35.520]  All of these came out on Monday.
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:41.720]  And at front page magazine, there's actually an article up yesterday called exterminating
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:47.400]  whitey instead of, you know, killing whitey, instead of kill whitey, it's exterminate whitey.
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:52.160]  So after Covington, it's obvious that people are starting to think about this subject.
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:59.640]  And it's no wonder, you know, the thing that's very foreseeable about the socialists is that
[03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:05.800]  they appeal to the morons, they appeal to people who are not historically astute.
[03:13:05.800 --> 03:13:11.720]  So when they whip up this anger, it hits their base like it's something brand new that never
[03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:12.960]  happened in history.
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:18.240]  Oh my God, we have an enemy that's trying to hold us down, these conservative Christian
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:22.320]  whites, they're responsible for all the evil in the world.
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:24.480]  And we've just got to get rid of them.
[03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:27.800]  They're too dumb to realize you're being played for fools.
[03:13:27.800 --> 03:13:29.600]  This is what they do every time.
[03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:32.080]  This is a perpetual pattern.
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:37.560]  On the other hand, our side, the conservatives, we've studied this.
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:43.520]  We've studied the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, and every socialist revolution
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:45.000]  ever since then.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:51.280]  So this gives us a huge advantage because essentially one team is comprised of morons
[03:13:51.280 --> 03:14:00.480]  like Kamala Harris and AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that are historically illiterate.
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:05.040]  And the other side, not only are we armed to the teeth, you know, and know how to shoot
[03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:08.440]  and know tactics, but we've read their playbook.
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:12.440]  We've read a playbook and they don't even understand that it is their playbook because
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.920]  they're historical illiterates.
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:22.920]  So when it comes to them trying to whip up their base for days of rage, for just taking
[03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:28.960]  it out on every white kid with a red MAGA hat standing around on the Lincoln Memorial
[03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:36.640]  or just blaming people in Chicago at 2 AM, you know, phantoms, imaginary bogus enemies,
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:42.120]  they think that's going to accomplish the mission of leading to such anger that white
[03:14:42.120 --> 03:14:45.080]  conservatives are just pushed out of public life.
[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:49.280]  You know, genocides don't start with the final solution.
[03:14:49.280 --> 03:14:54.680]  Genocides start with first marginalizing your enemies, you know, taking away their ability
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:56.360]  to practice their professions.
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:15:01.320]  You de-license them, you de-platform them, you know, if they had a professorship, you
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:02.320]  get rid of that.
[03:15:02.320 --> 03:15:07.600]  Well, we can see with political correctness how far down that road we've actually already
[03:15:07.600 --> 03:15:09.040]  gone.
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:15.720]  Our universities are 100% left-wing social justice where any conservatives on campus
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:20.720]  are practically, you know, underground, like putting the fish symbol on the wall, like
[03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:23.760]  in an early Christian room.
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:28.640]  So we can see that they've already done a great job of de-platforming conservatives,
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:34.000]  of stigmatizing us, of bullying us into silence.
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:39.440]  And the next stage is going to be calling for their minions to just, you know, punch
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:43.680]  that smirking MAGA kid in the face, which we've already seen.
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:45.240]  We saw that after Covington.
[03:15:45.240 --> 03:15:52.120]  And a week later, now it's some B-list actor claiming that, you know, white racist MAGAs
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:53.120]  beat him up.
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:54.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:58.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:16:00.080]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:03.040]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.040 --> 03:16:06.320]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:08.560]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:09.880]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.880 --> 03:16:12.880]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.880 --> 03:16:15.120]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:23.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:28.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:29.400]  the world.
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:32.400]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:38.360]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:42.160]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:43.160]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:44.720]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:51.240]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:53.240]  at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:56.960]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:19:57.480 --> 03:20:14.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:14.080 --> 03:20:20.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.960 --> 03:20:27.960]  Now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:33.880]  Okay, I'm back, and I apologize for the picture quality before.
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:39.600]  I hope that the Skype connection resolves and it stays a little tighter this time.
[03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:43.840]  But yeah, we're talking about a pretty grim subject, and a lot of people probably don't
[03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:49.920]  want to talk about it, but people think that being Americans, it's going to give us some
[03:20:49.920 --> 03:20:55.760]  kind of perpetual immunity from the kinds of social afflictions that have plagued other
[03:20:55.760 --> 03:20:58.520]  countries in history.
[03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:03.760]  But when you see communists becoming proud about it and admitting it, saying, oh, I'm
[03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:08.800]  a democratic socialist, or nothing's so bad about the communists, I mean, they've got
[03:21:08.800 --> 03:21:09.800]  TV shows.
[03:21:09.800 --> 03:21:13.800]  Van Jones was a communist on television.
[03:21:13.800 --> 03:21:15.960]  It's a very old pattern.
[03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:22.880]  And when you see conservatives basically marginalized and pushed to the outskirts of society as
[03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:32.040]  some kind of lepers by academia, the media, all of the leftists in Congress.
[03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:37.080]  You see the Republicans in Congress, except for the Freedom Caucus and a few others.
[03:21:37.080 --> 03:21:42.520]  They're a bunch of gutless, spineless rhinos.
[03:21:42.520 --> 03:21:49.920]  It does make you start feeling like you've almost got a gold star pinned to your shirt.
[03:21:49.920 --> 03:21:57.880]  The idea now is to make the MAGA hat, make the saying, make America great again, the
[03:21:57.880 --> 03:22:02.840]  equivalent of a Ku Klux Klan hood, or a Nazi uniform.
[03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:09.560]  If you look at the comments under the TMZ thing, you can, the article about Jesse Smollett,
[03:22:09.560 --> 03:22:13.040]  you can see the outlines of the Civil War.
[03:22:13.040 --> 03:22:18.480]  The left is just accepting that it's a true story and saying, basically, we've got to
[03:22:18.480 --> 03:22:20.480]  kill these MAGA people.
[03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:26.880]  So if you believe that we should make America great again, you're now a Nazi and a Klansman.
[03:22:26.880 --> 03:22:31.040]  Not only should you not wear the hat, you should just shut up and disappear.
[03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:35.960]  And if you don't, somebody's going to smash you in the mouth, or as the comment was to
[03:22:35.960 --> 03:22:38.920]  me, put you in the ground.
[03:22:38.920 --> 03:22:42.920]  And I don't think it even matters to them if it's a true story or not.
[03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:48.160]  Because to the left, the truth of a story is, does it further the narrative?
[03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:51.160]  Does it further the mission?
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:59.360]  Communists, and I include progressives, socialists, democratic socialists, all of these to me,
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:00.600]  they're communists.
[03:23:00.600 --> 03:23:06.880]  The left, from the French Revolution through the communist revolutions of the 20th century,
[03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:13.320]  meaning it's very important to understand about them, they believe in Marxism as if
[03:23:13.320 --> 03:23:14.320]  it's a religion.
[03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:19.760]  Now, they'll claim that they're atheists and that they don't believe in God, but their
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:23.240]  God is this cult of socialism.
[03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:30.760]  And in the advancement of their religion, their secular, atheistic, false religion communism,
[03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:34.800]  they believe that the ends justify any means.
[03:23:34.800 --> 03:23:41.880]  This is why they get along so well with Islamists, because they too believe that anything goes
[03:23:41.880 --> 03:23:48.400]  if it advances the global spread of either communism in that camp or Islamism in the
[03:23:48.400 --> 03:23:50.160]  other camp.
[03:23:50.160 --> 03:23:55.760]  And that's why both of them, I believe in something that the Islamists call taqiyyah.
[03:23:55.760 --> 03:24:02.960]  Taqiyyah means that Muslims can lie about their real goals, and it's not a lie, because
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:09.040]  they're just lying to infidels, and if it helps to spread Islam, to temporarily get
[03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:12.880]  people off of their guard to lie to them, then it's a good thing.
[03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:16.720]  Well, communists believe the exact same thing.
[03:24:16.720 --> 03:24:23.560]  So to a communist, it's completely legit to say, I'm not a communist, I'm a Democrat,
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:31.400]  I'm a progressive, I'm a socialist, I don't believe in that real hard communism with the
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:37.960]  gulags and the firing squads, I just want something like Scandinavia.
[03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:44.160]  But in fact, and not many progressives probably understand this, the Scandinavian countries
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:50.000]  in the last 20 years actually rank higher on the freedom indexes than the United States
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:51.080]  of America.
[03:24:51.080 --> 03:24:54.880]  They have less regulation and control of their business than we do.
[03:24:54.880 --> 03:25:01.240]  So if you're looking at any socialist countries today, you have to look at Cuba, Venezuela,
[03:25:01.240 --> 03:25:06.000]  North Korea, these are the examples, and it's where it always leads.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:13.600]  But the socialist bosses, as opposed to their moron minions, the socialist bosses, they
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:20.240]  know the smart ones, they know, and I don't include AOC as one of the smart ones, I think
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:26.360]  she's an idiot true believer, but the smart party bosses, they know that socialism will
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:27.920]  wreck an economy.
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:35.560]  They understand it, and they don't care, because their base, their moron minions are just cannon
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:36.960]  fodder for them.
[03:25:36.960 --> 03:25:44.640]  So the liberal elite, the progressive elite, they look at California, and they see the
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:46.280]  same things that we do.
[03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:52.320]  We see tent cities with tens of thousands of people like living in squalor and San Francisco
[03:25:52.320 --> 03:25:57.000]  and Los Angeles, and they see feces and needles on the sidewalks.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:02.960]  We think, what a disaster, the democrats must be so terribly embarrassed and humiliated,
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:04.060]  but they're not.
[03:26:04.060 --> 03:26:10.520]  They look at California as a brilliant shining example of political victory.
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:16.720]  I call it Calazuela, I didn't coin the term, I've seen it around on the internet, but Calazuela
[03:26:16.720 --> 03:26:22.200]  is taking what used to be called the golden state, and they're turning it into a halfway
[03:26:22.200 --> 03:26:30.800]  house to Venezuela, and not only that, they're using that as the model for the other 49 states
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:34.920]  for how to take complete political control.
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:40.760]  You do it when you're almost, you know, 49-51, Democrat-Republican, you do it by flooding
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:43.560]  the country with illegal aliens.
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:50.400]  In California, when you arrive, they announce with billboards and radio ads, don't worry,
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:53.120]  go to the DMZ and you'll get a driver's license.
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:56.060]  We don't care who you are or where you came from.
[03:26:56.060 --> 03:27:02.120]  When you get your driver's license, they hand you the form for a voter card, and then they
[03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:08.440]  announce, they don't just not have any investigations of voter fraud, they announce that we have
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:15.760]  never had an investigation of voter fraud in California by the state itself, outside
[03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:22.560]  groups have tried, but this is how California went from electing Ronald Reagan and Ed Wilson
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:28.000]  to becoming solid, permanent Democrat one-party state.
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:33.120]  Not only is it one party, they have supermajorities, the Republicans have no power, they've been
[03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:38.320]  gerrymandered into nothing, into having zero power, they're now doing something called
[03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:44.560]  vote harvesting, going door-to-door collecting votes from their minions that are too lazy
[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:46.280]  to go to the polls.
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:51.360]  And this is now the model that's extending to the rest of the country, and this is why
[03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:56.840]  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats refuse to build a border wall.
[03:27:56.840 --> 03:28:03.400]  When they see these caravans coming to walk across a border that has no fence, just in
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:08.920]  some places so-called vehicle barriers, they don't see that as a problem, they see that
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:12.640]  as their roadmap to permanent political victory.
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:19.320]  Okay, we're gonna, when we come back, we'll start taking calls maybe in the next segment,
[03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:30.320]  and the number to call is 877-789-2539, that's 877-789-Alex, and we'll start taking some
[03:28:30.320 --> 03:28:38.440]  calls about, you know, the caravans turning up all of America into Kalazuela and the Covington
[03:28:38.440 --> 03:28:43.080]  and everything else, and we'll be back right after these spots.
[03:29:08.440 --> 03:29:10.560]  That can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:31:11.160 --> 03:31:15.440]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[03:31:15.440 --> 03:31:19.960]  and say, we struggled here, we made it, and that's really where this goes.
[03:31:19.960 --> 03:31:24.400]  God's got a big war for you ready, and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary
[03:31:24.400 --> 03:31:28.600]  Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the
[03:31:28.600 --> 03:31:33.320]  other stuff, because God wants warriors that are smart and ready to build things and are
[03:31:33.320 --> 03:31:34.320]  also ready to fight.
[03:31:34.320 --> 03:31:37.560]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back, and I mean
[03:31:37.560 --> 03:31:39.200]  I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:31:39.200 --> 03:31:44.040]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built, I want to go to the next level,
[03:31:44.040 --> 03:31:49.200]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers, they're cold
[03:31:49.200 --> 03:31:53.960]  and failed and feels like being a tomb, I want life, I want Jesus.

[03:32:57.480 --> 03:33:16.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:16.440 --> 03:33:22.760]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:22.760 --> 03:33:31.600]  Okay, Bracken is back for the next half an hour.
[03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:42.700]  And we will be taking phone calls at 877-789-2539, that's 789-Alex.
[03:33:42.700 --> 03:33:48.800]  And I know this is a subject that is touchy and people are going to say, you know, boy,
[03:33:48.800 --> 03:33:55.000]  you're really going off the deep end, this is very hyperbolic to talk about, you know,
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.960]  the left pushing for genocide in America.
[03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:03.240]  But understand outside of maybe some deep thinkers on their side, they don't see it
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:05.560]  as a plan to commit genocide.
[03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:10.880]  I mean, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kamala Harris, they would look at me and say, you're
[03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:13.540]  completely crazy, we don't plan to do that.
[03:34:13.540 --> 03:34:20.360]  We just plan to push for, you know, a new economic freedom where everybody will be
[03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:25.800]  equal and, you know, the law will be on the side of all, will all be exactly the same.
[03:34:25.800 --> 03:34:29.920]  In other words, we're going to just force America to become communist.
[03:34:29.920 --> 03:34:34.080]  Now, of course, this will wreck the economy.
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:39.560]  And then they'll say, we didn't do it, we had a great plan, we had a five-year plan.
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:46.400]  What happened was those conservative, Christian, mostly white businessmen, they just wouldn't
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:47.400]  cooperate.
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:51.080]  You know, they sabotaged us at every step.
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:53.720]  This is what they did in Venezuela, exactly.
[03:34:53.720 --> 03:34:59.600]  They said, okay, you know, people that are selling products in supermarkets, bakeries,
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:03.120]  you can't sell it more than this, well, then I'm just not going to bake bread.
[03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:07.200]  If you're telling me I can't sell at a profit, I won't bake bread.
[03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:10.480]  When they order the baker, you must open and sell the bread.
[03:35:10.480 --> 03:35:15.600]  I mean, you can imagine, this is like a guaranteed way to absolutely wreck an economy.
[03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:16.600]  But then what do they do?
[03:35:16.600 --> 03:35:21.080]  Do they say, you know what, maybe we ought to loosen up that free market economy and
[03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:24.040]  let the miracle of capitalism run?
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:25.040]  No way.
[03:35:25.040 --> 03:35:30.080]  They charge the bakers and the supermarket owners, you know, with economic treason and
[03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:31.640]  throw them into jail.
[03:35:31.640 --> 03:35:35.840]  They put soldiers in the bakery to bake the bread, sold who don't know anything about
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:41.120]  baking bread, nobody's going to supply the flour because they won't be paid.
[03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:44.880]  And then they just continue to make it worse and worse.
[03:35:44.880 --> 03:35:50.360]  They charge the capitalist business owners with greater and greater crimes.
[03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:55.200]  They throw them into prison and the rest of them will flee the country.
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:57.240]  And that's how it always works.
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:02.160]  So they don't start out in, you know, year one with a plan for genocide.
[03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:08.640]  It's just that their socialist system will be so ruinous to the economy that when they
[03:36:08.640 --> 03:36:14.840]  look for the reasons why the economy was wrecked, they'll always look to the conservative business
[03:36:14.840 --> 03:36:18.000]  people and start throwing them into jail.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:23.720]  Now the difference in our country, unlike, for example, Venezuela and many other countries,
[03:36:23.720 --> 03:36:28.120]  you know, Germany in the 1930s, we've studied this.
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:29.760]  We're aware of this.
[03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:36.400]  So to me, as far as I'm concerned, this is the reason why, you know, tens of millions
[03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:42.320]  of AR-15s have been purchased in the last, you know, 10 or 15 years.
[03:36:42.320 --> 03:36:48.200]  And almost everyone that I've seen, unless it's an absolute newbie, every AR-15 I see
[03:36:48.200 --> 03:36:50.200]  has a scope on top.
[03:36:50.200 --> 03:36:54.160]  And you know, these aren't being purchased by hunters, primarily I don't hunt.
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:59.160]  I mean, once in a while I get invited, but I'm not, I don't consider myself a hunter.
[03:36:59.160 --> 03:37:01.440]  I consider myself a shooter.
[03:37:01.440 --> 03:37:06.240]  And I consider myself a constitutionalist, you know, and an American.
[03:37:06.240 --> 03:37:14.800]  So when the socialists pull their same old play, you know, let's appeal to the morons,
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:20.000]  promise everybody a free lunch, free college, free healthcare, you know, what, free housing,
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:22.080]  they've already got free food.
[03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:26.160]  When that wrecks the economy, they think that they're just going to be able to take out
[03:37:26.160 --> 03:37:31.320]  their enemies, which is us, it's not going to happen because at some point there's going
[03:37:31.320 --> 03:37:34.000]  to be a massive social collision.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:39.520]  And that massive social collision is going to result in, you know, in a brutal civil
[03:37:39.520 --> 03:37:40.520]  war.
[03:37:40.520 --> 03:37:44.520]  I absolutely, you know, don't see any way around this.
[03:37:44.520 --> 03:37:47.120]  I just don't see it.
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:50.200]  I don't know what the Fort Sumter moment would be.
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:54.760]  It could be gun confiscation raids that just start ratcheting up, probably in a state like
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:58.480]  New Jersey or New York or California.
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:03.320]  Already we see these so-called red flag laws being pushed.
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:09.760]  I think in, I read in Florida, they've used the red flag law something like 400 times.
[03:38:09.760 --> 03:38:13.760]  Often the people don't even own guns or they're just kids, you know, it's neighbors snitching
[03:38:13.760 --> 03:38:15.560]  on neighbor.
[03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:17.600]  Somebody made a threat about the school.
[03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:21.720]  So they, they go to the, they go to the house to see if they've got any guns.
[03:38:21.720 --> 03:38:27.000]  But you can see the potential for mischief if you combine these red flag laws with the
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:33.160]  phenomenon of swatting and you add in these, all of these hoax crimes that, that the left
[03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:38.600]  are so fond of doing where they, you know, accuse people of being mega hat wearing, you
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:43.560]  know, racist news tires that turns out to always be a hoax.
[03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:47.560]  Well, it doesn't take a genius to, to figure out that they're going to start swatting
[03:38:47.560 --> 03:38:53.200]  people with the red flag laws to get the SWAT team to roll up to somebody's house that they
[03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:54.920]  think is well armed.
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:38:59.640]  And eventually this is going to lead to a, you know, some kind of a wayco where an entire
[03:38:59.640 --> 03:39:01.640]  family's wiped out.
[03:39:01.640 --> 03:39:07.600]  And I think that the people that actually are agitating for, for the revolutionary conditions,
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:08.880]  they'll welcome this.
[03:39:08.880 --> 03:39:15.040]  It will permit, it'll permit the state to use even greater force against their political
[03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:16.040]  enemies.
[03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:22.080]  And they, they really need at this point, some MAGA actual event as opposed to just
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:23.960]  more and more of these hoaxes.
[03:39:23.960 --> 03:39:28.480]  I think that they were, they were hoping that Las Vegas was going to turn out to be, you
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:34.040]  know, some kind of a right winger, but instead it looks like probably the opposite.
[03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:38.600]  And you know, with this justy small at case, you can just see that they're just trying
[03:39:38.600 --> 03:39:45.200]  so hard to instigate a crisis based on, you know, the white racist boogeyman.
[03:39:45.200 --> 03:39:46.800]  And it's not happening.
[03:39:46.800 --> 03:39:52.360]  So these red flag laws might be a potential flash point because it's very dangerous, you
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:56.840]  know, police start rolling up to houses in the middle of the night to take people's guns
[03:39:56.840 --> 03:39:57.840]  away.
[03:39:57.840 --> 03:40:02.280]  Well, it's been known for a long time that home invaders, what do they do?
[03:40:02.280 --> 03:40:05.280]  They bang on the door and yell police, open up.
[03:40:05.280 --> 03:40:09.600]  I mean, if somebody bangs on your door at three o'clock in the morning yelling police, open
[03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:10.600]  up.
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:13.080]  You're, you know, you're not wide awake.
[03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:14.800]  You're not thinking clearly.
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:20.120]  Some people like Roger Stone, he didn't even have a gun, 29 FBI agents busted into his
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:22.640]  house with, you know, tactical gear.
[03:40:22.640 --> 03:40:27.360]  In that case, it all went real well because he was prepared mentally, I think, to be arrested
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:28.860]  at any time.
[03:40:28.860 --> 03:40:31.040]  And he said he didn't even have a gun.
[03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:35.280]  But I know a lot of other people that have got all kinds of, you know, video surveillance,
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:43.560]  all kinds of intruder alarms so that if anybody is stacking in their yard, you know, if the
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:50.480]  black SWAT team truck is outside and they come across the perimeter, I know people that
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:52.760]  are going to be able to react to that.
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:59.640]  And just hearing FBI open up banging on the door, it could result in a terrible situation.
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:03.880]  And I think that, that there are people on the left that would welcome that event that
[03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:10.160]  are actually trying to instigate this situation just so that they can have a real example
[03:41:10.160 --> 03:41:16.080]  of, you know, crazy right wing gun nuts shooting a bunch of police officers.
[03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:21.480]  Something similar to that happened, I forget, in Louisiana, it was last night, four police
[03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:28.640]  officers were shot just because some heroin dealers, instead of surrendering, they just,
[03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:31.120]  they got into a gun battle right off the bat.
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:36.480]  I guess that the body armor that the police were wearing saved them, but that's not always
[03:41:36.480 --> 03:41:38.000]  going to work.
[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  And you know, we need to hopefully deescalate this and seriously explore these red flag
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.480]  laws, which I think are building up towards a real crisis and a flashpoint, because the
[03:41:48.480 --> 03:41:50.040]  left wants it.
[03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:57.800]  The left is inventing incidents like the Covington event and this, this Jussie Smollett event,
[03:41:57.800 --> 03:42:01.400]  when there aren't real events, they'll invent them.
[03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:06.080]  And to get a real event, they'll instigate it.
[03:42:06.080 --> 03:42:08.920]  We've seen it and we can't fall for these things.
[03:42:08.920 --> 03:42:14.560]  We need to stand strong, like that kid in the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:18.280]  You know, he just was guilty of smirking while standing there.
[03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:24.080]  Now, just standing there is seen as aggressive if you're a conservative white male in this
[03:42:24.080 --> 03:42:25.080]  country.
[03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:34.080]  All right, when we come back, we're going to go right to the phones, 877-789-2539-789-Alex.
[03:42:34.080 --> 03:42:36.840]  When we get back, we'll be taking the calls.
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:46.640]  And we'll see you on the other side of these hotspots.
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:56.080]  Thanks.
[03:42:56.080 --> 03:43:00.760]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key, while coffee, candy and other sugary
[03:43:00.760 --> 03:43:05.520]  products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:44:18.760 --> 03:44:23.800]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[03:44:23.800 --> 03:44:28.920]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:34.760]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[03:44:52.880 --> 03:44:58.520]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[03:44:58.520 --> 03:45:02.760]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.760 --> 03:45:06.920]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:14.040]  lights every day, but thanks to supermailvitality at infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:18.240]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:22.400]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[03:45:22.400 --> 03:45:27.400]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[03:45:27.400 --> 03:45:34.600]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:45:58.160 --> 03:46:03.120]  Years ago, Infowars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[03:46:03.120 --> 03:46:04.120]  yeast.
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:08.080]  Infowars went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had
[03:46:08.080 --> 03:46:11.480]  to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:16.720]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:20.920]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better
[03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:22.880]  product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:22.880 --> 03:46:27.640]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[03:46:27.640 --> 03:46:32.320]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:46:32.320 --> 03:46:36.400]  Explored by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pal d'arco
[03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:41.000]  bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:44.040]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.

[03:46:57.400 --> 03:47:15.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.720 --> 03:47:21.320]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:23.960]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:47:23.960 --> 03:47:30.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:35.560]  Okay I'm back for the next part of the hour and we're going to go straight to the phone
[03:47:35.560 --> 03:47:37.560]  calls now.
[03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:44.520]  I've got a lot of great phone calls stacked up here and let's go to Mike in California.
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:50.120]  He wants to talk about the new AG, I think that would be Mr. Barr, the swamp creature.
[03:47:50.120 --> 03:47:52.120]  Mike, are you there?
[03:47:52.120 --> 03:47:54.120]  Yes, sir.
[03:47:54.120 --> 03:48:01.480]  Thanks for receiving my call.
[03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:08.040]  What my idea about Barr was that he may know where the bodies are buried and I think that
[03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:14.760]  Trump is consciously aware that he's bringing in these gold lists based on his affiliation
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:18.680]  with the John Burke Society.
[03:48:18.680 --> 03:48:26.560]  I really think that he's manipulating the environment of this battlefield and everything
[03:48:26.560 --> 03:48:32.000]  that he's doing is going to really prove out to be helpful, especially when you factor
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:40.240]  in our nationalist allies throughout the world and there's going to come a point where they
[03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:47.160]  share their intel with us and we share our intel with them to bring down the globalist
[03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:51.240]  in their areas and they're going to help us take down the globalist in our neck of the
[03:48:51.240 --> 03:48:52.240]  woods.
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:49:00.520]  So I really feel like his background with the bushes and so forth, they're just exposing
[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:01.520]  theirself.
[03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:04.920]  He's flushing them out and making them.
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:14.480]  Well Mike, I wish I shared your optimism but Barr is a swamp creature from the very beginning.
[03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:22.520]  He's one of these deep selected guys, CIA connections, straight into government.
[03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:24.600]  His wife plays cards with Mueller's wife.
[03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:26.240]  They're on a first name basis.
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:28.160]  They see each other at church.
[03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:34.360]  I don't know how Trump was finagled into picking Barr, probably the same way he was finagled
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:36.480]  into picking Rosenstein.
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:42.080]  The swamp creatures around Trump say, oh, pick this guy because he's in easy confirmation
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:45.880]  and you can't afford a fight over the confirmation.
[03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:49.360]  Trump doesn't know any better and the next thing you know, you've got a Rosenstein.
[03:49:49.360 --> 03:49:54.920]  I think personally Barr is going to turn out to be just as bad as McCabe, Mueller, Strock
[03:49:54.920 --> 03:49:56.480]  or the rest of them.
[03:49:56.480 --> 03:50:02.720]  His first loyalty is going to be to the deep state, the senior executive service.
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:07.760]  These are the guys, doesn't matter Democrat, Republican, that's like a joke to these guys.
[03:50:07.760 --> 03:50:12.040]  These guys are only loyal to their own clique.
[03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:18.640]  They think that they're the guys that are holding up the pillars of heaven and that they've
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:26.120]  got to save the entire New World Order from these populist gay hoos like Trump that are
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:28.280]  like bull in a china shop.
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:35.080]  They literally think that they're doing God's work because us moron peasants are just too
[03:50:35.080 --> 03:50:39.320]  stupid to know what's best for them, that's best for us.
[03:50:39.320 --> 03:50:45.680]  They've got to therefore really steer the ship of state from offstage and Trump is
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:47.080]  risking all of that.
[03:50:47.080 --> 03:50:52.960]  I hope I'm wrong, but everybody thought sessions might do the trick, Huber might, none of these
[03:50:52.960 --> 03:50:53.960]  guys did.
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:55.440]  They're all deep state.
[03:50:55.440 --> 03:50:57.320]  Thanks Mike.
[03:50:57.320 --> 03:51:03.920]  Let's go to Mary in Virginia, what's going to talk about, I hate trying Bill.
[03:51:03.920 --> 03:51:04.920]  Go ahead.
[03:51:04.920 --> 03:51:11.360]  Two things, first, political orientation needs to be added to the hate crime bill.
[03:51:11.360 --> 03:51:20.360]  If someone wearing a MAGA hat is attacked verbally or physically, they get prosecuted.
[03:51:20.360 --> 03:51:24.960]  I don't know if that's going to run straight into First Amendment, I think, because I think
[03:51:24.960 --> 03:51:27.720]  that the entire hate crimes thing is a joke anyway.
[03:51:27.720 --> 03:51:30.920]  If you murder somebody, murderers should get the death penalty.
[03:51:30.920 --> 03:51:37.240]  I don't care if you had lust in your heart or racial anger in your heart, murder is murder.
[03:51:37.240 --> 03:51:42.440]  If you start talking about what somebody's political beliefs were and then that's going
[03:51:42.440 --> 03:51:47.840]  to add or subtract years to your sentence, well, that goes straight against the First
[03:51:47.840 --> 03:51:52.760]  Amendment and I think that wouldn't stand up at all.
[03:51:52.760 --> 03:51:57.160]  I think actually it would lead to more problems than it would solve because anything that
[03:51:57.160 --> 03:52:02.160]  starts out with good intentions, the Democrats, the left, they'll usually take it over like
[03:52:02.160 --> 03:52:05.960]  asset forfeiture from the war on drugs, things like that.
[03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:10.920]  They'll take it over and they'll use that as an excuse to actually stifle free speech
[03:52:10.920 --> 03:52:13.800]  and they always do that.
[03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:14.800]  Thanks Mary.
[03:52:14.800 --> 03:52:20.080]  Casey in Mississippi wants to switch and talk about Venezuela.
[03:52:20.080 --> 03:52:22.080]  Are you still there Casey?
[03:52:22.080 --> 03:52:23.080]  Yes sir.
[03:52:23.080 --> 03:52:24.080]  Yes sir.
[03:52:24.080 --> 03:52:25.080]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:52:25.080 --> 03:52:26.080]  We're familiar with each other.
[03:52:26.080 --> 03:52:29.360]  My name is Eagle Eyes on a variety of platforms.
[03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:32.080]  I've seen some of your memes.
[03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:37.880]  You've got some solid charts and I know that you know certain things that are going on.
[03:52:37.880 --> 03:52:43.200]  What I'd like to address today is organization is what they fear.
[03:52:43.200 --> 03:52:46.880]  We need to rebuild our communities from the ground up, our homes, everything else.
[03:52:46.880 --> 03:52:52.600]  I know people are aware of this but we get lost in the cyclone of information that continuously
[03:52:52.600 --> 03:52:58.200]  rolls but we have to slow that down and be able to focus primarily on our homes because
[03:52:58.200 --> 03:53:01.120]  they are coming with that second amendment push.
[03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:05.880]  They are going to try to take away our protection which they protect themselves with which is
[03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:08.440]  completely nonsense as you know.
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:11.440]  Excuse me, I'm a little bit just up.
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:12.920]  Thanks for taking the call again.
[03:53:12.920 --> 03:53:20.680]  We need to focus on our communities, on our homes, rebuild neighbor to neighbor, grow
[03:53:20.680 --> 03:53:27.600]  your own food, stock up, be prepared, do not turn a blind eye to nonsense.
[03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:30.600]  We have no more time to turn away.
[03:53:30.600 --> 03:53:31.600]  The time is now.
[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:32.600]  Thanks again.
[03:53:32.600 --> 03:53:34.920]  I appreciate your time.
[03:53:34.920 --> 03:53:35.920]  No problem.
[03:53:35.920 --> 03:53:39.560]  That's some good advice about stocking up.
[03:53:39.560 --> 03:53:47.440]  If there is any kind of a major crisis, regional or national, it would be nice to say that
[03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:51.320]  I have 10 years worth of food and I could stay in a bunker but let's face it, that's
[03:53:51.320 --> 03:53:52.320]  not reality.
[03:53:52.320 --> 03:53:57.840]  A more likely situation though is that there could be a period of anarchy and just not
[03:53:57.840 --> 03:54:04.440]  needing to go out to the already looted supermarket during those first few weeks when everybody
[03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:06.040]  is in a total panic.
[03:54:06.040 --> 03:54:13.680]  If you can stay home because you've prepared and you've got the food supplies and the nutraceuticals
[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:19.840]  and stored water or well on your own property that you can run without electricity, your
[03:54:19.840 --> 03:54:22.080]  odds of getting through are going to be a lot greater.
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:28.840]  Sure, I mean, like if it's an extinction level event like the comet that hit the Gulf
[03:54:28.840 --> 03:54:31.960]  of Mexico and wiped out the dinosaurs, nothing's going to help.
[03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:37.400]  But most events are going to be something that if you can just endure for a few weeks,
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:43.160]  months or maybe years, but surviving the first month or two, that's going to be critical.
[03:54:43.160 --> 03:54:48.080]  If the power goes out and it's not just because of a civil war or something like that, every
[03:54:48.080 --> 03:54:51.560]  one of the major powers are developing EMP weapons now.
[03:54:51.560 --> 03:54:56.520]  If you fire an ICDM from Russia to America, we know just where it came from.
[03:54:56.520 --> 03:55:00.680]  But if something pops out of the ocean and takes out our electrical grid, nobody's going
[03:55:00.680 --> 03:55:01.680]  to claim it.
[03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:08.120]  Our country will be wrecked and we won't even know who to retaliate against necessarily.
[03:55:08.120 --> 03:55:13.480]  Let's see, Ricardo in New York, oh boy, Hillary's minions.
[03:55:13.480 --> 03:55:14.480]  Are you there, Ricardo?
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:15.480]  Been waiting a long time.
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:16.480]  Go ahead.
[03:55:16.480 --> 03:55:17.480]  Yes.
[03:55:17.480 --> 03:55:19.480]  Hey, how are you today, Matt?
[03:55:19.480 --> 03:55:21.480]  Good to meet you.
[03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:28.680]  I'm from Syracuse, New York, and we've spent the last May Oral Cycle, my wife who won the
[03:55:28.680 --> 03:55:37.480]  Martin Luther King Unsung Hero Award for community activism in 2012-2013.
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:45.120]  We've been fighting nonstop battle against Hillary Clinton.
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:51.600]  Her mayoral candidate of choice was sent from San Diego, California to come here and enact
[03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:53.600]  a gun.
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:57.800]  I'm sorry, we're losing you, Ricardo.
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:55:58.800]  You want a bad cell?
[03:55:58.800 --> 03:56:02.000]  I think we're going to have to drop that call because we just don't have enough time.
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:07.080]  But yeah, we're all keeping a very close eye on New York.
[03:56:07.080 --> 03:56:08.640]  Thanks a lot.
[03:56:08.640 --> 03:56:12.280]  Alex in Los Angeles has a comment about the assimilation of immigrants.
[03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:13.280]  Go ahead, Alex.
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:15.080]  We only have about a minute left.
[03:56:15.080 --> 03:56:18.080]  Yes, hi.
[03:56:18.080 --> 03:56:24.440]  Alex helped me get introduced to the American culture growing up here as an immigrant from
[03:56:24.440 --> 03:56:29.640]  Armenia, former Soviet Concord State.
[03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:31.560]  I didn't really like America.
[03:56:31.560 --> 03:56:34.560]  I thought Los Angeles was America.
[03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:39.120]  As an immigrant, I was told to be proud of my culture and all this stuff.
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:46.640]  Nothing in the world can make me un-Armenian, but once I found out the beauty and the magnificence
[03:56:46.640 --> 03:56:51.640]  of the American revolutionary culture, I fell in love with it.
[03:56:51.640 --> 03:56:57.080]  We have to remind immigrants to assimilate that it is better.
[03:56:57.080 --> 03:56:58.960]  You have more opportunity.
[03:56:58.960 --> 03:57:04.000]  You need to learn English, not just learn, but I stopped speaking my native language
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:07.920]  for a year once I realized it just to improve English.
[03:57:07.920 --> 03:57:12.960]  It's a really good point, Alex, but we're right at the end of the time now.
[03:57:12.960 --> 03:57:18.120]  I wish that all of our immigrants had your spirit and your attitude, but I don't see
[03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:22.960]  it because I think that the Democrats just want them to come in as voting blocks.
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:26.520]  They don't care if they speak English or not as long as they vote Democrat.
[03:57:26.520 --> 03:57:28.640]  All right, that's it for this week.
[03:57:28.640 --> 03:57:34.280]  I don't have Patreon or anything like that, but I do have lots of books on Amazon.
[03:57:34.280 --> 03:57:40.120]  You can go there and see what I've been writing about for the last decade or so, and I'll
[03:57:40.120 --> 03:57:41.120]  see you next time.
[03:57:41.120 --> 03:58:07.680]  We'll be back in off on InfoWars today.
[03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:35.840]  We'll see you next time.
[03:58:38.200 --> 03:58:48.200]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so
[03:58:48.200 --> 03:58:49.420]  they'd have it during the winter.
[03:58:49.420 --> 03:58:52.300]  And that's what I'm talking about at mfortwars.com.
[03:58:52.300 --> 03:58:59.120]  When the info were select, it's the full spectrum of my Patreon supply along the top.
[03:58:59.120 --> 03:59:04.120]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below
[03:59:04.120 --> 03:59:09.500]  cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do. But I want to be a market
