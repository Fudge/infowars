[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Got a hundred yards, I taped it, I don't care what you say.
[00:10.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, September 8 worldwide
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.000]  The biggest news yet, the entire COVID-19 martial law takeover is about to break.
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.000]  Turns out, Fauci admitted to creating a gain-of-function, quote, Doomsday virus in 2012.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  It's not a document, it's video of him admitting it, and it's coming up in T-minus five minutes.
[00:48.000 --> 01:04.000]  Call everyone you know, tell them to tune in now, we'll bring these murderers now together.
[01:18.000 --> 01:28.000]  This is a 300 blackout, I've never shot it, it's my security guy, Tim's gun, it's got a suppressor.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  And again, it's legal for you to shoot with a suppressor if you're with the person that owns the suppressor.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  And Texas almost passed the law to manufacture them in Texas and make it legal for everybody, but that law did not pass.
[01:38.000 --> 01:48.000]  But the, what is it, the open carry and concealed carry thing passed for just the general public, so while Wild West's second movement moving forward, I've never shot this.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  So we'll see how I do here at, what is this, about 30 yards, 25 yards?
[01:53.000 --> 02:10.000]  I've heard a lot about these, I've never shot one of these.
[02:10.000 --> 02:28.000]  Man, that thing's like a laser beam, well that's a badass gun, and we should move back to 100 yards to see how we do.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  Shane, that is an awesome rifle, you want to sell it?
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  Everybody ask that, I'll make sure they get it.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  So you, what is it?
[02:36.000 --> 02:45.000]  It's a custom, I've had it built, even the, this is made of carbon fiber and I had it built specifically for this gun.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  Killer.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  I mean, I built this thing so long ago, I don't even remember all the parts.
[02:49.000 --> 02:58.000]  I just remember this was called a hammer because this part right here has these cleats on here, you know, it's like you could just bash somebody in the face with it.
[02:58.000 --> 03:11.000]  It's like you could just bash somebody in the face with it, you know, it's like you could just bash somebody in the face with it.
[03:11.000 --> 03:36.000]  Thank you.
[03:36.000 --> 04:02.000]  Thank you.
[04:02.000 --> 04:31.000]  Thank you.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  And no matter how much shooting you do, it's a perishable skill.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  If you wait two or three months, it will all deteriorate.
[04:39.000 --> 04:59.000]  I mean, you'll still remember how to pull the trigger and aim the gun, but the fine motor skills and being a really good shooter is going to go right out the window.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  There are a lot of energy drinks and energy pills on the market.
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.000]  And of course, most of them work because if something doesn't work, people aren't going to reorder it, but they have side effects.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000]  They have chemicals.
[05:09.000 --> 05:17.000]  They have dyes in them that hurt your brain and hurt your cells and hurt your body in the process and leave you burnt out and hung over.
[05:17.000 --> 05:29.000]  Info Wars for Years has consulted top developers and top labs to bring you Brain Force Plus, to bring you Turbo Force and other clean formulas that give you long sustained focused energy.
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  Well, now we are introducing something that is at the next level, multiple years in development.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  It is Brain Force Ultra.
[05:38.000 --> 05:47.000]  It is a liquid in a dropper and it is twice as strong as Brain Force Plus, just in the natural caffeine department.
[05:47.000 --> 05:55.000]  Then it's got a bunch of other powerful herbs and compounds that will take your focus and your clarity to the next level with clean energy.
[05:55.000 --> 06:10.000]  And it funds the Info War, exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this September 8, Wednesday transmission.
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  And this is undoubtedly the most important information we have ever covered on air.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  I'm sure by next week we'll have a day that tops that because the quickening is here.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  Satan has taken the mask off and is really making his move.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Wow.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  Wow.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  I spent a good two hours last night after my wife and children went to sleep.
[07:00.000 --> 07:12.000]  Trying to scan over the 900 pages that the Intercept investigative journal sued and got of Fauci going back over the last decade, but even further 20 years.
[07:12.000 --> 07:23.000]  Specifically saying, I want gain of function. I want to merge these viruses and him in 2015, 16, 17 in hundreds of emails.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  There's 900 pages.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  And there's scans of the email so you can't keyword search.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  It's grueling. I probably read 500 pages last night quickly till my eyes were bleeding.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's about that late at night.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  Vision starts getting blurry, literally.
[07:40.000 --> 07:48.000]  And I found and I've got him printed off stuff that hasn't even hit newspapers.
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  And I've got a bunch of stuff that has hit the newspapers where he specifically says I want you to merge these five viruses and then create a vaccine for it.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  And it's what COVID-19 is.
[07:58.000 --> 08:09.000]  He describes it all the HIV delivery system, the protein spike, the bats, the civets, all the different animals they merged.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  And you can go to zero hedge or m4s.com or the Intercept and just click the links.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  And you can read those documents for yourself.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  And I'll be going over those.
[08:21.000 --> 08:29.000]  But then this morning, I come into the office and I'm reviewing clips.
[08:29.000 --> 08:37.000]  And as soon as I saw the clip on the list that the producers put on there, got a big clipboard of videos here, a lot of which I sent them, a lot of which they recommend to me.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  This is one they recommended to me.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  And I watched it and my jaw actually dropped.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  I realized I don't usually go, oh, my mouth.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  I watched the video.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  And then my brain clicked because I got a good memory.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  And I went, I remember actually that being in the news.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  And there was a controversy over the doomsday virus that they called it ZX.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  And I pulled all those articles.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's illegal to gain a function.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  Mama and Fauci got caught in 2015 doing a chapel in North Carolina.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  So they moved to Wuhan.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  It's in the documents that they were in more than 12 facilities in China alone doing this in Hong Kong, by the way.
[09:19.000 --> 09:33.000]  This is video of Fauci on C-SPAN in 2012 admitting he created a quote, doomsday flu virus that kills the majority of people that get hit with it.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  And you know they've got that in the wings.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  They'll probably release it on us and be our savior on TV while he does it.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  You understand we should have 10 million people peacefully demonstrating in D.C.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  That's what they're scared of right now.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  That's why they provocateur our Trump event to attack the capital and hijacked it.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  That's now come out in court.
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  There should be 10 million people in D.C. demanding the arrest of Bill Gates, Fauci, Klaus Schwab, the Google heads, the Facebook heads.
[09:56.000 --> 10:04.000]  And they all on record, Google and Facebook funded the Wuhan lab and they've been involved in the cover-up and the fact checkers worked at the lab.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  And they're the fact checkers or the head scientist over the gain of function.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  Peter Dazek wrote the Lancet Journal whitewash a year and a half ago saying it didn't come out of Wuhan.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  And then he's even in emails that have come out via lawsuits and FOIA requests saying cover up the fact that I wrote this.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  So the Lancet Journal saying it didn't come out of Wuhan was written by him.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  But all that's just window dressing.
[10:28.000 --> 10:41.000]  Do you understand, we're going to play the clip here in a moment, do you understand that he admittedly created what they call a doomsday virus?
[10:41.000 --> 10:50.000]  They've got a mouse pox virus as well that the Australian government released the program on how to build it.
[10:50.000 --> 11:01.000]  Where even a normal biology department at a community college could make a mouse pox virus that kills 98% of humans.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  I remember that whole story was big news 15 years ago.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  Like why are we creating and putting on the internet how to make something?
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  It'd be like how to how to create plutonium in your backyard and how to make a hydrogen bomb.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  In fact, it's worse than that.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  So this is truly 12 monkey type stuff.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  This is the population cult.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  And this is what they've set up.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  Yeah, there it is, the doomsday variant, all the rest of it.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  So they're already saying the doomsday covered variant could be worse than Delta, Lamba and maybe Cummings scientists say.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Well, they've already tested all this and have it ready.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  This is their martial law takeover plan.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  And if they don't get arrested, well, you're going to have a lot of auto mechanics and farmers and factory workers
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  and lift drivers and FBI agents, children that are going to die.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  Because this is going to hit everybody.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  They're not going to give us vaccines that protect us.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  They're making their move.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  So this is not hypothetical.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  Maze Moore on Twitter found this.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  Now we have all the articles is reminded us of it.
[12:12.000 --> 12:23.000]  This is Fauci in 2012 answering questions with his partners about a new virus they created through gain of function research.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  And this is all being said at the bio defense 2012 meeting.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  And then we have other clips of him admitting they were creating gain of function as well.
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.000]  Then he goes and purchases himself to Congress and says no one's ever done it. It's preposterous and gas lights the public.
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.000]  When I have a stack of mainstream news, the scientists and others I'll show you where he got in trouble for it six years ago.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Major controversy.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  But again, he thinks you're an idiot.
[12:54.000 --> 13:07.000]  And all these conferences that he headed called gain of function conference and he orders in all the emails and documents and grants federal National Institutes of allergies.
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  CDC to the universities to create all this and to make viruses that infect humans from animals.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  That's gain of function.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  That's like saying, you know, well, gain of function is anything Christmasy.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  A wreath of Christmas tree. Well, this is Santa Claus or this is Jesus.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  I mean, this is the Babe Ruth of baseball.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.000]  I mean, this is the worst stuff you can do on a scale of one to 10. It's a 10 and a half.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  It's an 11 to quote spinal tap.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  So here it is. This is not hypothetical.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  This is them talking about a doomsday virus, which Fauci now says is coming.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  You learn to lock down, you learn to do what you're told, you learn to stand your home.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  So when they release it, you can, you can all die and behave yourselves and they can depopulate you.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  And it's going to be beautiful, just like Zardaz or just like moon raker or any of the stuff they put in our face.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  Here it is.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  Bill Schultz, Chemical and Engineering News.
[14:08.000 --> 14:18.000]  Dr. Fusche, I hope I'm not misunderstanding, but you seem to be saying that the virus you created is not particularly lethal in the ferrets.
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.000]  And yet Dr. Kym, you have said to me in a phone interview that this was quote the doomsday virus.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  How are you coming to such different conclusions and what is the public supposed to understand?
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  So, so I'm sure I didn't actually say that that, but I have heard people call that.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  I did not call it the doomsday virus, I should say.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  Ron.
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  Well, so the virus is highly pathogenic in chickens, the virus is pathogenic in ferrets if you put a lot of virus straight down in the lower airways.
[14:50.000 --> 15:00.000]  But it's well recognized by everybody in the flu field that if you take age five and one and stick it up the nose of a ferret, the ferret really only gets the flu, a normal flu.
[15:00.000 --> 15:12.000]  Now, our virus is slightly different, it causes some neurovirulence, but certainly if the ferrets receive virus via aerosol route, we have never seen a severe disease in the ferrets.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  Now, a ferret is not a human.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  And as Mike just pointed out, there are still serious debates about how fatal this virus is in humans.
[15:20.000 --> 15:31.000]  To just clarify a bit, without predicting anything, without talking about any processes that will unfold to the perception of I think most of us.
[15:31.000 --> 15:40.000]  We're going to come back with the rest of this where he says it fouts you with a big giant cold sore on his lip, and he was involved in the group making the doomsday virus.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  By the way, it killed basically 99% of the ferrets.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  But that's what it got in their lungs.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  Yeah, we'll be right back to stay with us. These people are building weapons to kill everybody.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  They're all eugenicists and populationists on record.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  They are mad scientists. It must be stopped now.
[15:56.000 --> 16:05.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  Here's why.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:15.000 --> 16:24.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:24.000 --> 16:32.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:32.000 --> 16:42.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.

[20:21.000 --> 20:27.000]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[20:27.000 --> 20:34.000]  So Fauci Bill Gates, they're all on record wanting to depopulate the planet. So it's Klaus Schwab and they write books about how they're going to use a virus.
[20:34.000 --> 20:49.000]  They have Rockefeller Foundation documents that they're going to use a virus to bring in martial law, clamp down and cut off resources under a carbon regimen that's a dictatorship controlled by your smartphone that tracks everything you do that tells you when you can go places, when you can do things.
[20:49.000 --> 20:58.000]  That's now being implemented in Europe and in the UK and in Australia particularly. So it's not coming. The denials are over. It's here.
[20:58.000 --> 21:14.000]  And a lot of people, people in the media late night comics that are really propagandist for the globalist and corporate leaders and business leaders and religious leaders and academic leaders are totally signing on now out of fear, not just that they want power.
[21:14.000 --> 21:23.000]  They think, well, I'll just join the system and I'll be taking care of. That is the course of mad men and fools that haven't studied history and who have no discernment.
[21:23.000 --> 21:34.000]  I'm going to start to clip over because I played it too late going to break my fault. This is not hypothetical. This is Fauci in 2012 answering questions with his partners about a new virus.
[21:34.000 --> 21:47.000]  He said, well, I'll show you in a moment and they tried to start one. Well, it didn't kill all the ferrets unless it got their lungs, but then it did.
[21:47.000 --> 21:58.000]  And so again, this is them creating gain of function. And this is Fauci who was involved in the research and federal funding of it at the bio defense 2012 conference.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  So the fact is he lied to Congress again. He said, we've never done gain of function, even though it's in the documents here at us.
[22:05.000 --> 22:18.000]  Bill Schultz, Chemical and Engineering News. Dr. Fuchsia, I hope I'm not misunderstanding, but you seem to be saying that the virus you created is not particularly lethal in the ferrets.
[22:18.000 --> 22:28.000]  And yet, Dr. Kym, you have said to me in a phone interview that this was, quote, the doomsday virus. How are you coming to such different conclusions?
[22:28.000 --> 22:38.000]  And what is the public supposed to understand? So I'm sure I didn't actually say that that, but I have heard people call it that. I did not call it the doomsday virus, I should say.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Ron.
[22:40.000 --> 22:49.000]  Well, so the virus is highly pathogenic in tickens. The virus is pathogenic in ferrets if you put a lot of virus straight down in the lower airways.
[22:49.000 --> 22:59.000]  But it's well recognized by everybody in the flu field that if you take age five and one and stick it up the nose of a ferret, the ferret really only gets the flu, a normal flu.
[22:59.000 --> 23:11.000]  Now, our virus is slightly different. It causes somneroferulence, but certainly if the ferrets receive virus via aerosol route, we have never seen a severe disease in the ferrets.
[23:11.000 --> 23:19.000]  Now, a ferret is not a human. And as Mike just pointed out, there's still serious debates about how fatal this virus is in humans.
[23:19.000 --> 23:36.000]  To just clarify a bit, without predicting anything, without talking about any processes that will unfold to the perception of, I think, most of us in the room, there was a perception, however, it got there, that, and we've seen it on television.
[23:36.000 --> 23:45.000]  I've seen schematic diagrams of it on television of a ferret in one cage, sneezing on a ferret in the other cage, that ferret sneezes, and they all die.
[23:45.000 --> 23:55.000]  This is what Ron has just said. I didn't say it. Ron just presented that. That is not what happens when a ferret sneezes on another ferret.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  The ferret gets infected, gets flu-like syndrome, doesn't get sick, recovers, and does not die.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  And I think when you talk about forgetting about any other process, just the perception that's out there. Am I correct, Ron?
[24:07.000 --> 24:16.000]  If anything, our data suggests that this virus spreads poorly. It is aerosol transmitted, and therefore scientifically very, very interesting to study.
[24:16.000 --> 24:23.000]  But whether this virus would, if it would ever escape from a lab, would start spreading, we don't know.
[24:23.000 --> 24:30.000]  So the whole point is not that they were calling it doomsday secretly, and it didn't come out on the news the time I had the articles here I'll show them to you.
[24:30.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's that there was a major debate internally about how dangerous this was and how it violated law, and how it was true gain of function.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  See, they made it. They made it spread worse. They made it more dangerous. That's gain of function.
[24:42.000 --> 24:51.000]  Something getting stronger, Mike Tyson and his peak and say 1989. That's gain of function for when he was 10 years old.
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.000]  It's called gain of function. Hitler in 1940 was stronger than 1933, Hitler. It's called gain of function.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  Cancer going through your body. Gain of function. It's getting stronger. You're getting weaker.
[25:05.000 --> 25:15.000]  So let's first look at the documents yesterday, okay? You can go to the ZeroHeads article, click on it and try to read 900 pages like I did last night.
[25:15.000 --> 25:26.000]  And it's all right here in the document. You can click on the links in the FOIA release, FALTI funded, construction of Chimeric, Coronaviruses, and so on.
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.000]  That's a quote. And it describes all of the five animals combining it with gain of function into one SARS-like coronavirus.
[25:35.000 --> 25:46.000]  And then they're going to say that's on page five, on page 293 of the documents. It's a later document. They admit we have now created it.
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  And here he is with Peter Dazik that ran it. We have video of Dazik saying they combined five viruses in 2019 successfully.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  We're building a vaccine for a new super virus they had built that had never existed. Just like you just heard them admit.
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  And now you've all gotten to experience it. Yes, it was a real virus. Yes, it didn't spread very well.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  Now the Delta spreads a thousand times worse. It's real. I've experienced it. Others have.
[26:11.000 --> 26:19.000]  And it came out of India where the vaccine caused all the other viruses to get killed, except the Delta. And it made it super powerful.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  That's why 99% of infections in the world are Delta. The vaccine did it. That's admitted. It's not debated.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  So when Fauci gets up on TV and says all the hospitals are full, we're going to have to lock down again.
[26:31.000 --> 26:38.000]  We're going to have to decide who gets care. And then Jimmy Kimmel says, oh, don't give care to anybody who hadn't had the shot.
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  Mainline science that is settled says if you've already had it, the immunity is 13 times better.
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  And then if you take a shot for that, whether it's J&J or Pfizer or any of it, it can kill you.
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  But Kimmel doesn't care. He's given talking points for the Democratic Party. And by Schumer, he's admitted it.
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  So does all those shows. They hang out together. Those are talking points that doesn't matter if you have an auto-mine problem.
[27:02.000 --> 27:08.000]  Your doctor says, don't take it. You don't get health care. And now doctors everywhere are saying this as a talking point.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  Violate the Hippocratic Cove, engaging in violations, the Nuremberg Code, where we will not let you leave your house. We won't let you have a job.
[27:15.000 --> 27:25.000]  We won't let you go anywhere. And you don't get medical care. If you don't take what we will give you, the Pfizer shots now down to 39% effectiveness, they say.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  And the shot lowers your immune system. So it's all a load of crap. That's why they always had boosters ready.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  They knew it was never going to work. It's a power grab to track and control you.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  You know, you know that. Here's another one of the documents.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  Wulong Institute of Aurology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[27:45.000 --> 27:52.000]  Dr. Peter Desi, president. And it says, we are working with the Chinese government to create gain of function and viruses that spread from animals to humans.
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  It's all right here. 900 pages of it. I mean, smoking gun.
[27:59.000 --> 28:11.000]  This would be like if a serial killer broke into a live TV station, live on the nightly news with three people and blew their heads off on television.
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  And then put their gun down like the Joker does in the Joker movie and gets arrested by the police.
[28:17.000 --> 28:27.000]  Would he be convicted of killing them? Yes. I mean, it's all the documents, all the money, all the admissions, lying to Congress, open and shut.
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  But the FBI's penetrated and controlled by globalists that want to kill the country, want to bring in bioweapons and hit us.
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  If you're going to hit your country yourself to take over, you got to control the military leadership, which they control.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  They all say America's bad. You got to control the FBI. The top of the FBI hates America. You got to control the courts and they do.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  And so now they're going to just take their time slowly murdering us.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  And a lot of the people that serve the system, they're going to die too.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  But they're order followers, so they won't even save themselves. Unbelievable.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[29:00.000 --> 29:07.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:07.000 --> 29:14.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[29:14.000 --> 29:24.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:29.000 --> 29:40.000]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.

[30:18.000 --> 30:27.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[30:33.000 --> 30:40.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storeable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[31:22.000 --> 31:35.000]  Well, now we are introducing something that is at the next level, multiple years in development. It is Brain Force Ultra.
[31:35.000 --> 31:43.000]  It is a liquid in a dropper, and it is twice as strong as Brain Force Plus just in the natural caffeine department.
[31:43.000 --> 31:51.000]  Then it's got a bunch of other powerful herbs and compounds that will take your focus and your clarity to the next level with clean energy.
[31:51.000 --> 32:17.000]  And it funds the info war, exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[32:21.000 --> 32:41.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[32:41.000 --> 32:51.000]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[32:51.000 --> 32:59.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support info wars. God bless.
[32:59.000 --> 33:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:07.000 --> 33:20.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.000 --> 33:32.000]  I'm being lied about and demonized every day, seven days a week, usually in, let's not exaggerate, 50, 60 publications, programs, TV shows all over the world.
[33:32.000 --> 33:42.000]  Sometimes there's up to a thousand articles attacking me a day, very, very conservatively just trying to psychologically inoculate the public that I'm a bad guy that I'm an evil person.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  So I rarely respond to it.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  But I'm going to respond to it next segment because it's tied into Joe Rogan is tied into singing in.
[33:49.000 --> 33:58.000]  And I talked to Joe, he's really considering suing singing in very seriously right now, because they're lying scum, they're lying criminals, but he's friends with Kimmel.
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  I know Kimmel behind the scenes is a good guy and even used to tell people he likes my show.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  And I know that people that are friends with him.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  And so Kimmel is given a script to read.
[34:07.000 --> 34:16.000]  I want to talk directly to Kimmel next segment about finding his soul because he's now talking about denying health care to people that don't take the experimental shot.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  Even if a doctor says they have a medical reason not to take it, he says deny them health care.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  That's a form of murder.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  And he's the one that talks about his son's heart problem and cried on air.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  Now, thank God he's got plenty of money, but what about poor people so we need Obamacare?
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  Hey, it's socialist countries where you wait for health care, Kimmel.
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.000]  But listen, it's on record that they have a bunch of Democrat think tanks that write talking points that are then written in with his 40 something writers.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  But that's been in the news.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  They like hang out with Schumer is the guy that oversees that group.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  So Kimmel, you better find your soul buddy.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  I'm going to talk about that next segment and show you some of the evidence because he attacked me last night.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  And, you know, he pulled out a gun once started shooting stuff on stage saying, watch out a message from the Illuminati.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  And that was a real message from them to me.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  That wasn't a joke.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  He was told to say that as well.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  He reads off a teleprompter.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  So this is very, very serious.
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  They put really evil stuff out in a comedy format.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  But here's the reality.
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  Dr. Fauci was involved in the cover up of HIV being a bio weapon.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  He was the cover up of real treatments for it and they use treatments to actually kill people, the fake treatments.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  He's run these scams.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  He covered up viruses, cancer viruses, infecting the vaccine stockpiles of the world.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  That was in the news over the years.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  He's in power because he's a little monster who works for Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  And that has come out.
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  So there is a lot to go over and a lot to break down on this subject.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  But I just showed you the evidence.
[35:57.000 --> 36:08.000]  I just last segment showed you emails and documents from the lawsuit of the Intercept investigative journal group.
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.000]  And this is documents with Fauci saying, I want gain of function. I want to merge these bats with these other animals.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  And I want to create gain of function.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  And that's it.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  He lied to Congress.
[36:24.000 --> 36:31.000]  But oh, he's like Clapper saying the NSA has never spied on one single American because he's an establishment type.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  He's supposedly allowed to lie.
[36:33.000 --> 36:41.000]  Well, is he allowed to cook up a bio weapon and then release it so they can be the savior with this deadly vaccine?
[36:41.000 --> 36:51.000]  No, the answer is just because they've got corrupt people in charge of the Justice Department and most the courts doesn't give them a license under any system to release bio weapons on us.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  Just like they had laws saying black people were two thirds human.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  And folks said, hey, that law is wrong.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  We're going to stand up against it.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  It's the same thing.
[37:00.000 --> 37:06.000]  We're not putting up with this and this assault and this attempt to make us all prisoners and say we're not essential.
[37:06.000 --> 37:15.000]  And then to rape our bodies and put your dangerous GMO on us that we know doesn't work the way you say it works, but actually lowers our immunity and turns us into creatures.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  You can control a bunch of bubble people.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  You know about the boy in the bubble?
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Well, they want to make us bubble people.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  That's their real goal.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  We're all birth is done via cesarean.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  And then later in a test tube, I've got articles saying they want that.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  We're mothers don't feed their children milk from their own breast, but formula.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's the industrialization and takeover of the entire human process.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  They say to then end us as a species because we're parasites.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  I see the stack didn't get to it yesterday.
[37:44.000 --> 37:52.000]  Didn't get to it today before because I've been so busy with guests, but I'm going to hit this next hour where they talk about depopulating us and all their own admissions, mainline documents, everything.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  See this big stack?
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  That's coming up next hour.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  But the Jimmy Kimmel thing is next segment.
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  I'm just warming up on that.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  But look at these documents right here for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  Just write this down.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  You can look it up.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  New scientist.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  Lab made coronavirus triggers debate.
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  The creation of a chimeric SARS like virus has scientists discussing the risk of gain of function.
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  That's the the scientist publication 2015.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  It's about Fauci engaged in gain of function.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  Fauci said benefits of quote gain of function outweigh risk of pandemic MSN.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  You see that Kimmel?
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  That's who you're in bed with.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  It's illegal.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  He says he didn't do it though.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  He's all over the news for years running and saying anti function is own words.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And it goes on and on from there.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  Look at this disease X accelerating the development of medical countermeasures for the next pandemic by making viruses that don't naturally.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  Occur five different animals coming together.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  How is that?
[38:57.000 --> 39:07.000]  How do you make something completely exotic out of the middle of nowhere from stuff all over the world never come together and then release it out of the lab and call that protecting us?
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  That's the UN.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  That's the Lancet Journal talking about that.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  Oh, disease X the next pandemic the UN three years ago.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  Oh, it's coming any minute.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  We're going to take control of society.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  Once it does.
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.000]  And look who ran at the UN disease X doctor who discovered Ebola warns of deadly viruses yet to come.
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.000]  Who warns against unknown disease X and now you're seeing that doomsday virus.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  Now, again, the UN is in charge.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  We've let it get in charge illegally of global response to pandemics and emergencies.
[39:38.000 --> 39:47.000]  That's how you get a global government is a world body with world police power regulatory power to shut everything down to say censor that on the internet globally.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  So arrest those people.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  Don't let those doctors speak.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  Don't let people have those treatments.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  And the precedent is then set track everybody to make sure they're not quote spreading it.
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  Now you've got the global tracking system which they admit they set up and as their holy grail.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  You've got all the elements of the world court, the world army, the world police, the world surveillance system, the phones to track you.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  Now chips sewn into all your clothes.
[40:10.000 --> 40:18.000]  Never got to yesterday but more people online I've seen it myself are cutting into their clothes and finding tracker transponders.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Not in case you try to steal something in the store.
[40:21.000 --> 40:29.000]  But because those companies want to sell phones track where you go and what you do as a marketing thing to sell your data.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  And the companies admit they're doing it.
[40:33.000 --> 40:43.000]  You see, and then we've got on video from five years ago on national French TV, the head of the Bilderberg group, the head of the Davos group, Klaus Schwab saying,
[40:43.000 --> 40:51.000]  very soon we will have chips in all the clothing to track you and then it will be chip on the skin.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  So it's not just QR codes.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  Yeah, here's the lady cutting the chip on it wasn't a chip to make sure she'd steal.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  It was shown in to the neck.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  Sown in.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  So there it is.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  I just showed you the documents.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  I just showed you everything.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  And look, I like Rand Paul.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  He's the best thing we got.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  He says thought she should be criminally investigated.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  He needs to say you are a criminal.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  You need to be arrested right now or we need to fire the FBI director and the head of the Justice Department.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  And he needs to read lead a peaceful rally to protest.
[41:23.000 --> 41:31.000]  We need to say no to this or we're green lighting these people creating deadly viruses and then obviously releasing it at the key time.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  To discredit and make Trump look bad and then covering it up.
[41:34.000 --> 41:43.000]  How she said Trump will be challenged by a novel virus in a pandemic guaranteed.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  Michael Moore said something big's coming.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  It'll take out Trump.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  They all knew.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  They all did it.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  And it's their virus and their vaccines that caused the mutant delta variant.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  That's not even debated.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  I tell people is to go really on.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  Yes, see this.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  See the scientists.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  It's admitted they created this.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  And so now we're here.
[42:08.000 --> 42:18.000]  We're going to go to break ladies and gentlemen and come back with the biggest news yet in all of this and tied together to the global partial law plan.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  They've got set up and of course I'm going to expose Jimmy Kimmel and just hope he's got a soul.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  He should quit.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  He should turn the money down.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  He should go public.
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  I mean Colbert is really evil.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  I don't have people that know him.
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  He loves it.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  Kimmel does not like it.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  I don't have people that know him.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  He actually doesn't like it.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  But he's doing it for the money.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  And then you got some of the other talk show hosts are like drug addicts who even know what they're doing.
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  But they're reading off scripts and it's time for Kimmel to find his soul.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  Jimmy life's really short and there is a God.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  You've got children.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  You need to get right with God and turn your back on the devil.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  We're right back.
[42:54.000 --> 43:01.000]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  And that's done by design.
[43:12.000 --> 43:21.000]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the Anglo-American establishment.
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.000]  The founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  Still on the steering committee is Klaus Schwab.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  And he has set up the great reset in global government.
[43:42.000 --> 43:50.000]  And if as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  We don't have a shot. We do expose them. We can beat them easily.
[43:53.000 --> 44:09.000]  In late August, info was saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[44:13.000 --> 44:20.000]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self defense and a relationship with God.

[47:14.000 --> 47:27.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear of pro human liberty. I am your host Alex Jones, very thankful that you've joined us on this live September 8 Wednesday broadcast.
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  Jimmy Kimmel, I don't think he's a bad guy.
[47:36.000 --> 47:45.000]  I know a lot of people that know him, that have worked with him and have even done shows with him, and they say he's a really nice fellow. I think I was told like 10 years ago that he was a listener.
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  And he's made some nice jokes about me in years past.
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.000]  But since Trump got in, all the big late night shows got taken over by the Democratic Party and by the globalists.
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  That's on record that they write talking points, they've talked about it, that are then given to their writers and written into the show.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  That's what will be one funny part and one part that isn't funny.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  You know what Jimmy Kimmel came out and said the terrible thing he did very evil.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  He talked about Nuremberg code violating you talk about corrupt and said if somebody doesn't take the vaccine, now they want to take five a year of a gene therapy that was never approved.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  And by the way, the FDA did not approve it. They just said we've reissued the emergency.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  So that frauds now come out that it's not gone through the approval process.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's got 39% effectiveness. The Pfizer shot and lowers your immunity.
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.000]  There's no real stuff, Jimmy. That's not me reading off a teleprompter. There's no teleprompter in here.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  There's cameras aimed at me and I'm talking and I got my research right here.
[48:40.000 --> 48:49.000]  So I'm my own man, Jimmy, and you should go back to writing your own jokes and actually be a comic again and tell the network and tell the globalists to piss off.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  But that's up to you.
[48:51.000 --> 49:00.000]  So you come out and you say, unvaccinated people shouldn't get ICU beds and has returned to late night after a two month vacation.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  Well, isn't that interesting? So you're now Dr. Kimmel.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  Well, doctors are on record saying if you've already had COVID, you don't want to take the vaccine, you can kill you in an auto immune response.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  And it's 13 times better than the vaccine in an Israeli study, natural immunity.
[49:14.000 --> 49:22.000]  It doesn't matter what the surgeon general lies about and says in his little Starfleet commander outfit, little Admiral outfit, his little Scientology outfit.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  So you've got all that going on.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  And then Kimmel regurgitates that, oh, everybody's taking this horse dewormer and the poison control and hospitals are overflowing.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  Rolling Stone had to fully retract that.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  No one was in the hospital out of millions of calls.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  They got 11 calls about Ivermectin and only nine of those were people that thought they might have gotten sick from it.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  And yeah, you should consult a physician and you shouldn't go out and take horse paste on your own.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  But the studies do show Ivermectin works.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  I'm going to show those to you, Kimmel, because, you know, we're not reading off a teleprompter with stuff written by Chuck E. Schumer on it.
[49:56.000 --> 50:04.000]  At least you're not out dancing like Colbert is with that sexually looking at each other with that creep Schumer, you know, whose protege is Anthony Weiner.
[50:04.000 --> 50:15.000]  And that whole sick situation with Epstein and Gisling Maxwell and that whole sinking Hollywood ship will get to next hour with Rose McGowan coming out saying that Clintons and Oprah are monsters.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  Everybody knows Oprah would pimp women out to Harvey Weinstein. That's all coming out.
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.000]  Oprah I think will probably go where Weinstein went. She likes young ladies more than he does.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  So, oh yeah, that's coming out. That's what she's talking about.
[50:30.000 --> 50:42.000]  So here's Jimmy Kimmel on his sinking Hollywood ship with a third of the ratings he had when he started years ago because people don't like being lectured by the Democrats writing your talking points, putting all this out.
[50:42.000 --> 50:54.000]  He's putting out debunked stories about a horse warmer, debunked stories about that AP admitted okay, 2% of the calls were about the Ivermectin, not 70%.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  The hospitals were totally empty. The doctors that put the story out didn't work there. It was all a lie. That all was debunked last Friday.
[51:00.000 --> 51:13.000]  But here's Kimmel. Here's Kimmel on Tuesday night. One, two, three, four, five days later lying to us because he's not lying. He's a teleprompter reader.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  And then I'm going to show him some of the documents. But first, here's a segment of the show.
[51:16.000 --> 51:26.000]  We had a relaxing Labor Day. It was not a fun Labor Day weekend COVID-wise. The number of new cases is up more than 300% from a year ago.
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.000]  Dr. Fauci said that if hospitals get any more overcrowded, they're going to have to make some very tough choices.
[51:31.000 --> 51:40.000]  Back in five seconds. So Dr. Fauci told us if we got 70% vaccinated, they're up to about 60, we have no more cases than we find.
[51:40.000 --> 51:47.000]  But now we have 300 to 400. Actually, that's a true statement. More people because Delta is very real because the vaccine made it mutate and get stronger.
[51:47.000 --> 51:57.000]  That's how it works, dumbass. Well, they never made a vaccine for a cold virus. That's what this is based on because it kills all the natural ones and it creates a super one.
[51:57.000 --> 52:04.000]  And in chickens, it's called Merrick's disease and creates a super virus that kills 100%. And it's well on its way with more shots doing that.
[52:04.000 --> 52:12.000]  See, that's called science, Jimmy. I know you tell jokes and stuff, but this is the world you want your kids living in. Let's go back to you.
[52:12.000 --> 52:21.000]  We have 100% from a year ago. Dr. Fauci said that if hospitals get any more overcrowded, they're going to have to make some very tough choices about who gets an ICU bed.
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  And that choice doesn't seem so tough to me. Vaccinated person having a heart attack. Yes, come right on in. We'll take care of you.
[52:27.000 --> 52:33.000]  Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo. Rest in peace, wheezy.
[52:33.000 --> 52:42.000]  Is that a little Freudian slip by the Democrats who wrote that? Because in England, they're saying they're going to refuse you if you're not shot. That's what this is going.
[52:42.000 --> 52:53.000]  Oh, you mean all the people having heart attacks and heart swelling, including young people and dying? They admit it does. Oh, you got the shot. You're having a heart attack. Come on in.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  Continue.
[52:54.000 --> 53:03.000]  There you are. Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo. Rest in peace, wheezy.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  Yeah, kill him. They didn't take the shot.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  Hit pause again. Back in five seconds.
[53:09.000 --> 53:21.000]  Kill him. Don't let him have. Oh, you got a car wreck. Your app says, your tracker app says you didn't take the shot. Maybe you have a medical issue. So what? Die. Yeah, kill Americans.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  How sick is this, huh? Continue.
[53:26.000 --> 53:47.000]  We've still got a lot of pandemics out there. People are still taking this ivermectin. The poison control centers have seen this spike in calls from people taking this livestock medicine to fight the coronavirus, but they won't take the vaccine, which is crazy.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  You're a vegan and you're just like, no, I don't want a hamburger. Give me that can of Alpo instead.
[53:52.000 --> 54:06.000]  One of the reasons these sea biscuits are opting for ivermectin is because they don't trust big pharma, which is fine, I guess, except for the fact that ivermectin is made by Merck, which is the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the world.
[54:06.000 --> 54:20.000]  Even Merck is telling people to cut it out. They released a statement saying ivermectin has no scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against COVID. There's no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease.
[54:20.000 --> 54:37.000]  And there's a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies. Listen, if a pharmaceutical company says, please don't take the drug we're selling, you should probably listen to the, or you could just go with a TikTok posted by a disgraced veterinarian instead.
[54:37.000 --> 54:46.000]  Meanwhile, these poor horses are like, hey, I have worms. I need that stuff. There are worms in my butt. Do you understand?
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  I think ivermectin did get a big endorsement over the weekend.
[54:51.000 --> 55:06.000]  Oh, stop there. Back in five seconds. I got to counter each lie here, folks. Did you hear him say, hey, this is another big drug company to Merck? Yeah, I didn't take Merck's Gardasil, which actually killed a bunch of people as a live virus, but I would take a lot of Merck's other drugs and I have because they work.
[55:06.000 --> 55:20.000]  The vaccines have liability protection and have a history of contamination and problems and social control like shooting blacks up for 40 years and telling them it was vaccines when it was syphilis. See, see, Jimmy, I know history.
[55:20.000 --> 55:28.000]  So that's why I've got a concern. It's not that I'm against medicine, not that I'm against technology. It's that I'm against the globalist and Bill Gates continue.
[55:28.000 --> 55:40.000]  I have worms in my butt. Do you understand? Ivermectin did get a big endorsement over the weekend from one of America's top medical minds, none other than Sandy Hook Denier slash Internet lunatic Alex Jones.
[55:40.000 --> 55:50.000]  You know what this is? This is Ivermectin for humans. You want to know about prizes and antiviral and this is inhalable or these are the tablet steroids. So let me show you.
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  I'm going to do this anyways earlier. See this? See this Fauci? See this Bill Gates? I'm going to kill those prions, you bastard murders.
[55:58.000 --> 56:12.000]  I'm going to go to break, come back, play the rest of this and I'm going to show Kimmel on air. Journal of medicine, Journal of Nature saying Ivermectin's a miracle drug, Oxford University, major labs in the U.S.
[56:12.000 --> 56:20.000]  You know what? Dr. Zelinko already broke a story that I was going to break because I have a lot of sources, obviously a lot of high level people.
[56:20.000 --> 56:31.000]  Zelinko confirmed with the doctor that actually advises the Google leadership that they're all taking Ivermectin, and hydroxychloroquine, and corcicline, and none of them are taking the so-called vaccine.
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.000]  Neither is the head of Pfizer. Do that up for next segment. I want to show Jimmy this because I know when he'll end up seeing it.
[56:37.000 --> 56:45.000]  He'll send it to Joe Rogan and he'll send it to him because I care about Jimmy. I want him to save his soul because if he signs on to this evil, believe me son, you're on the wrong side of history.
[56:45.000 --> 56:55.000]  That's coming up. But first, we were so excited about this because it worked so damn well. I took some of this a few months ago and we finally approved it for almost two years of research.
[56:55.000 --> 57:06.000]  This new Rainforest Ultra, it's liquid, it's strong, it's got all these herbs, all these compounds, and a whole bunch of natural forms of really concentrated, clean caffeine and other goodies.
[57:06.000 --> 57:17.000]  And it blew me away when I took three or four drops a few months ago and we finally approved this recipe. I did some yesterday at four, I was super tired, took some, I was bouncing off the walls at 2 a.m.
[57:17.000 --> 57:25.000]  This stuff is incredible. Rainforest Ultra, a limited supply of the first run, it's called a limited edition. If you're thinking about tweaking it, we're not. It's incredible.
[57:25.000 --> 57:39.000]  The problem is we've got a limited supply. At current sales rate, it's going to sell out in five days. Get your Rainforest Plus while you can and experience Rainforest Ultra, the next level of clarity and focus at infowarstore.com.
[57:39.000 --> 57:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:10.000 --> 58:29.000]  Well, now we are introducing something that is at the next level. Multiple years in development. It is Rainforest Ultra. It is a liquid in a dropper and it is twice as strong as Rainforest Plus just in the natural caffeine department.
[58:29.000 --> 58:42.000]  Then it's got a bunch of other powerful herbs and compounds that will take your focus and your clarity to the next level with clean energy and it funds the info war, exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[59:00.000 --> 59:14.000]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[59:14.000 --> 59:27.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[59:27.000 --> 59:44.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits. Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live. Don't forget the Washington Journal with Harrison Smith is excellent informative, amazing guest. Harrison's a really smart guy and a lot of clips and callers.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  That is 8 a.m. Central Info Wars dot com for its last show and then War Room 3 p.m. needs your introduction. Oh, it's Royer. I had a lot of fun on the show here. So I'll just leave it at that.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Now, let's look at these headlines for Jimmy Kimmel here because I know he's going to watch this later. Hey, Jimmy, here's Yahoo News.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Jimmy Kimmel says unvaccinated people shouldn't get ICU beds in his return to late night. You mean deny people medical care, murder people.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  You don't know why they can't take a shot. You don't care. You don't care about all the medical reasons. Just kill them.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Then he goes on to call me the Sandy Hook Denier. You know, they're the ones that constantly say Sandy Hook didn't happen in my name and say that I built my operation off that when I barely ever talked about it.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  No, these people all glommed on to me because we're famous and we're fighting tyranny to connect me to dead kids at Sandy Hook so that nobody even knows that Adam Lanza killed them.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  People think I killed them. So, again, another cheap trick by him. Jimmy Kimmel returns. Blast Alex Jones over Ivermectin endorsement. Choice of beverages.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  And that's the word thing about liberals, especially the trendies that moved to Austin. They don't know my family. Founded Texas. I've had family in Waterloo.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  That's what Austin's called since 1820. I'm not a territorial guy. They just flipped out. It was trending. Jones is drinking Topo Chico.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  I've been drinking Topo Chico for 35 years since I first found it in Austin stores from Mexico. And I like Topo Chico wine.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  And I didn't know you worship it and you think it's yours and it really freaks you out. And now it's on Jimmy Kimmel.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  But that's the type of idiotic stuff these people obsess on. I wish you knew more about Ivermectin and not Topo Chico because, look, Ivermectin, enigmatic, multifaceted, wonder drug continues to surprise and exceed expectations.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Nature.com. Major study. Now is the time to use Ivermectin. Tokyo Medical Association Chairman recommends Ivermectin to all doctors who treat COVID.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  100% success rate over 10,000 patients with their group of doctors with Ivermectin early. Then he gets statistics out of Africa and India where they hand it out and they don't die of COVID.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  And the places that don't use it die. I mean, see Jimmy, but that's just a Japanese scientist. You know, don't listen to him. Judge orders hospital treat dying man who was in a coma on a respirator.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Now he's out of the coma, but another judge has come out and said, well, you can't give him Ivermectin so he'll probably die.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  AP forced to issue correction on fake news about Ivermectin. But that's what Jimmy Kimmel quoted right there.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  AP corrects Ivermectin fake news only 2% poison calls, not 70% of the calls. And it goes on and on Rolling Stone being a stage deal being fake.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  None of it was true. Not one person was sick. Here's all the big studies use of Ivermectin and association with lower mortality and hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  It was already around back then the Ivermectin and COVID 2019 study. Ivermectin wonder reference Japan, the human use perspective. That's from the NIH.gov.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  See that Kim Kim on and on and on study after study after study after study after study after study.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  The NIH and all of it and the media banning doctors that try to talk about it. Total censorship, criminal activity. Let's finish up with Kimmel. Here it is.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  So then Sandy Hook Denier slash Internet lunatic Alex Jones.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  You know what this is? This is Ivermectin for humans. You want a Nobel Prize as an antiviral and this is inhalable or these are the tablet steroids.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  So let me show you. I was going to do this anyways earlier. See this? See this Fauci? You see this Bill Gates? I'm going to kill those prions.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  You bastard murderers. You're going to hit me with a bio weapon. You monster. You want to suppress me? You want to kill me? You son of a bitch. You demon.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  You think I'm easy to kill? You think I'm going to roll over to your crap?
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I've never seen someone that mad drink a Topo Chico before. It kind of came out of nowhere. Who would have guessed he'd wash it down with that?
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  I would have thought maybe some kind of nacho flavored bang energy drink, but nope. Give me a Topo Chico.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  I'm not the only one back at work today. Jill Biden returned to the classroom after more than a year of teaching remotely. Dr. Biden is an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Believe it or not, she's the first lady in history to have a full-time job while living in the White House. Meanwhile, former first lady...
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  There are a lot of energy drinks and energy pills on the market, and of course most of them work because if something doesn't work, people aren't going to reorder it, but they have side effects.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  They have chemicals. They have dyes in them that hurt your brain and hurt your cells and hurt your body in the process and leave you burnt out and hungover.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Info Wars for Years has consulted top developers and top labs to bring you Brain Force Plus, to bring you Turbo Force, and other clean formulas that give you long sustained focused energy.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Well now, we are introducing something that is at the next level. Multiple years in development. It is Brain Force Ultra. It is a liquid in a dropper, and it is twice as strong as Brain Force Plus just in the natural caffeine department.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Then it's got a bunch of other powerful herbs and compounds that will take your focus and your clarity to the next level with clean energy.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  And it funds the Info War, exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Unspeakable Evil.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Fauci admitted to creating Doomsday virus, gain of function weapon.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Let's just add weapon, or bio weapon, in 2012. And I already read that document, showed you the video clips, showed you documents from a four year lawsuit by The Intercept that is just incredible.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  I really like Greenwald. He left The Intercept, but The Intercept still does an incredible job.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  F-O-I-A released Fauci-funded coronavirus, turmeric, coronavirus in Wuhan, but we just played a video of him admitting they created gain of function in 2012 with the quote, Doomsday flu. That video is also up on infowarstore.com. I mean, this is just massive.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  And listen, I'm on Rand Paul because he's the only one that's done anything about this and said you should be criminally investigated. But the FBI has been basically overseeing this since Obama got in.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  I mean, I remember in 2006, Dr. Eric Pionka, the head of the UT biology department, who was on the UT website in his bio, this is in my film Endgame.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  It's in a bunch of other documentaries, pieces I did, dressed up in a druid outfit, talking about Lucifer, and he said, I can't wait till airborne Ebola hits. It will soon reduce the world population by 90%.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  My family and I will die, but that's how we must save the earth.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  And then one of his graduate students attacked us in a news article and a letter to the editor, she was working at a bio weapon lab in California, and she said, Dr. Pionka is too liberal. Who can deny that all humans are parasites and must be exterminated?
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  That's a lady working at a bio weapon lab with a crazy looking eyes on a power trip.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  I said, where is the FBI? Where is the FBI? I said, this guy is over a high level UT biology system where they've got weapons systems, level four lab in Texas on the coast in Galveston.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  I said, I want the FBI over there right now. A day later, two FBI's just went and talked to Pionka because that's what you're supposed to do when you've got a real life 12 monkey person out there doing this nowadays.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  The FBI's investigating me who wouldn't hurt anybody offensively. You attack me, I'll sure as hell attack you. You better believe it, but I'm not an offensive person. And I don't want to kill Fauci, you know, he wants to kill us.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  I don't want to kill Bill Gates, you know, he's killing us. I don't want to kill Klaus Schwab. I just want you to know he's killing you.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  And if you go kill him, it'll turn them into martyrs. I want to kill their name. I want to kill their programs. I want to kill their operations. I want to politically peacefully shut it all down.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  But if they keep putting everybody in camps and putting four shots in us that make us have heart attacks and die and erase our immune system, as all the literature admits they do, at a certain point, I'm not organizing violence.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  I'm not going to carry out violence. I'm simply asking, are we just going to take it? Gandhi did, Jesus did, but they were leaders. Martin Luther King Jr., that was for a point.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  What would have Martin Luther said if white people started just going into black neighborhoods and just killing millions of black people? Would Martin Luther King have said, oh, turn them into that? No.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  He had most of the white people on the side. White people have been trying to get rid of that crap forever. It was a minority of whites and others that were doing that.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And so he knew to take the billy clubs, take the police dogs, take the water cannons so that everybody would see that it was wrong, just like Gandhi did. They were all learning from Christ.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  But when it's all done through propaganda and apps and locking you down and all this, we better fight like hell politically now and peacefully now so it doesn't get to a point that Churchill talked about where you don't even have a chance of winning,
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  but it's better to down your feet than down your knees as a slave where they take your time with you.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Because, look, they've organized rebellions and programmed people that a rebellion is burning police cars and breaking Starbucks windows.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Starbucks has private agreements with the Antifa. The documents have come out where they pre-target. They say, here's where you're allowed to attack.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And those big corporations have sponsorships letting them do it. That's come out so that when the actual war starts, you go knock out Starbucks windows. No, no, no.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  If a physical war starts, if you go kill cops, they want you to. So when things collapse, they'll bring in their outside police.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  The police aren't who you want to kill. The military isn't who you want to kill. You wouldn't even want to go out and face the warriors down, head up.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  That's not what rebels do. That's not what guerrilla warfare is. You go after the leadership and their spies and their operatives so that nobody spies on the Liberty Movement and they know not to do that.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  And you go after the actual leaders. And I'm not saying do that. I'm just simply saying you're all been programmed to hate the police by the media and say they're the enemy and say go out and kill the police so that it's this background noise with the left and even the right
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  so that when things kick off, that's the classic confrontation that happens. That's an idiotic attack. That's an idiotic response. That's moronic.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  You don't want to be seen. You don't want to be known. You like a wolf want to come in and go out.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And that's not what's going to happen. Nobody's going to blow anything up. I'm not going to blow anything up. We need to stop that.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  You don't need to fantasize about war and fantasize about death. I'm simply saying there's only like a thousand kingpins in this whole eugenics operation.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  And so if they start a physical war and all that stuff degrades and falls apart, in the doctrine of victory, you cut the head off the snake.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  And the head is not Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a complete puppet put up there to take all the heat like an old shield while the globalists are stabbing us with a sword.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  They've got a big red shield like we're a dumb bull and the bulls hitting the shield and not hitting them.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  So it's so much fun to attack Biden. The whole media in the left is against him. We've got to get rid of them all.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  So that all the evil that's happening doesn't get blamed on Democrats. It all gets blamed on Joe Biden.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  No, it's the Democratic Party. It's the globalists that control them. It's the neocons like Mitt Romney defending them.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  It's the establishment that is overseeing this destruction of our republic and this takeover because they all think they're going to get life extension technology out of it.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  They're all being promised all this new stuff and these new clone bodies they're going to get.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  That was an old project that Jeffrey Epstein was running and eugenics and in secret birthing programs.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  I told you that over 10 years ago. People found the clips. They tell the archives find those again. I was trying to find them last night.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  And I said they are doing secret cloning programs. They're running eugenics.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Epstein's job is to go corrupt the scientists and get them on board in secret projects.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  And I know for a fact they have produced clones of Oprah Winfrey and Bill Gates and a bunch of these people.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  And those folks don't even know. Man, I look a lot like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Man, I look a lot like Oprah Winfrey.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  I sure look a lot like Bill Gates and they're 15, 20, 30 years old, 10 years old, 5 years old living out their lives in communities with people they think are their parents.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And the parents don't even know who they've got. They're told this is a very gifted child that was in a program.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  And, you know, you're working with... And those people know. They tell anybody, they talk about it. They're dead just like that.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  I had the head of New York emergency management, the deputy head on, about building 7 and how there were bombs in it, the CIA.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  He was dead two weeks after he was on. Of course, we talked to the neighbors. They loaded everything up in vans.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  He did a witness protection program and changed his name, but he was lucky.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  He was one of the very jetties. So, I live in the real world. I live in the real fight against the real order.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And I'll tell you what's really going on. And it's incredible. Or you can believe left-wing fantasies and all the weird garbage they've got, or right-wing fantasies.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  But I'm going to ask the question again and we'll come back with the news.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  What do we get, Rand Paul, and the other few good senators we've got? Because if they come out against the globalists and admit this is a globalist takeover and a great reset and read their quotes on air, everyone will rally behind them.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Bolsonaro conservatively had 10 million people rally in Brazil yesterday. Millions in their capital city will show you that footage when we come back.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  And he's out there saying, it's a new world order, foreign megabanks create communism, destroy your family. They will poison you. They will, they will, you know, they're coming after you.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Don't trust them. New world order. And he quotes it all and they all learn about it and they unify and the military and police are behind them and they're winning.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  They already stabbed him to death. He said, I'm going to have victory or death. We're going to defeat the new world order, global communist, or I'm going to die trying. That's the spirit. I salute Bolsonaro.

[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  And then forwardstore.com. They're great products, plus they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air. So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  Download everything we've done. You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  We are back live on the vaunted Alex Jones show. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Next segment, I'm going to get into the bottom of the rabbit hole, who these people really are and what they're setting up and where it's all going on their own missions of their plan to depopulate you and your family.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  What about some solutions and fighting back right now? But tying into that is just knowing science. Fauci and all these globalists know that the general public does not even have basic understanding of immunity or learned immunity.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  They don't have basic understanding of virology. And so it's very easy to lie to them.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And the fact that they would have the surgeon general and others get up and say that you can't get immunity naturally from COVID or it's not very good is like saying fish don't need water to live.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  Oh, you don't want to get fish near water. They don't live in water or bears don't live in the woods or birds don't fly in the sky or birds don't live in trees or, you know, tigers don't have stripes.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  It's fire engines aren't red. Grass isn't green. Families aren't good. I mean, I've got articles here where the federal government's officially saying that the Constitution and Bill of Rights are racist and bad and have added trigger warnings to them.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  That's a step before they remove them.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  So so this is a this is a takeover. This is an assault on everything you are for a horrible authoritarian corporate system that will make the Communist Chinese look like sweethearts.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  And so they've asked Xi Jinping to kill more people control more people. He's doing a lot of really mean stuff. You know, Xi Jinping came out and said don't we're having three kids now and we're not going to attack the family. We're not going to feminize our men. And yeah, we're not going to take your vaccine that poisons people.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  And Soros is flipping out saying, you know, we need to attack China.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Not because it's a communist state, not because it's taken over Hong Kong or Taiwan. He supports all that. No, but because they're saying no to his operation to kill people because he's a damn devil worshipper. Xi Jinping just wants the Chinese to take over the world.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  An old fashioned, you know, Hitlerian idea.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  So that's where we are. But here's a fact. There are normally hundreds and hundreds of new strains of the coronavirus, the whole SARS type family every year.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  And so all these governments, the Chinese, the US, the Russians, everybody's been doing it. It's very dangerous have been mixing these things together to try to create bio weapons is what they do.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  And the cover is always, oh, we're testing this in case somebody else makes it. So Fauci in the public documents combines five of these. It's old news, but even more has come out just cherries on top.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  And they create things that will kill many more people and that spread way faster. They call it the doomsday virus or disease X.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  Then they come out and say, oh, we've got the delta. Oh, we got the move. Oh, we've got the oh, it's even more deadly. And as they get more vaccines that do knock out more viruses, it only lets the really powerful one survive.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  You know, it's like cockroaches. You can spray cockroaches with any type of poison you can imagine.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  But there's always some that are going to live and then they procreate and then they're totally immune to your poison. And that's why most pesticides don't work anymore.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  Well, viruses and bacteria are the same way. And they know this. And it's why in every animal group they've ever given cold vaccines to within a few years of giving it, you get super viruses that kill, in the case of Merrick's disease, 100% of the chickens.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  And in that doomsday clip we played first hour of Fauci in 2012, talking about a doomsday virus he made admitting gain of function. They try to play it down. But the admission is the gain of function. They talk about birds dying.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  Because they're all talking about what they've done. They're not stupid. So when you give humans five, six, seven, eight, nine shots a year, like they're saying, it's going to create super viruses.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  So COVID-19 was bad if you could catch it. Very hard to catch it. But they didn't mutate it into Delta, which they knew they'd get a mutation like this that spreads way worse. And that's it.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Now 99% plus of the cases worldwide are Delta. And now they're starting booster shots. And now they're going to make one for Delta. And then now you're going to get something even worse and you're going to get Merrick's disease in humans.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And I've had research scientists like Dr. McCullough McCullough in studio agreeing with me on that. That's what this is. They're making us create the doomsday virus. They're creating a Merrick's disease type operation against us.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  So what is the solution? Brazil is the most populous country in South America. It has the most resources. It's the largest country. And I've never been down there.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  I know folks have been there. They're great people. Bolsonaro, I'm not bragging. It shows the success of the show to the listeners.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  We woke up Joe Rogan. You see that now? We woke up Tucker Carlson. You see that now? We woke up Bolsonaro 15 years ago. He began listening to my show.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  I met his son, who's a member of their Congress and probably be president someday. They don't kill him, too. They've established dad and public, as you've seen. And he said, come to Brazil right now and interview my father. I've been so busy, I'm not able to do it.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  But we met him at CPAC last year in D.C., outside D.C. So there it is. That's the power. He was a general. He was involved in intelligence operations. He already knew most of stuff.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  He heard my show about Globalist. He researched it. He understood already a lot of it about the Ironman World Bank. And he got elected into government and then president.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  And now he's got 10 million people in the streets because they know election frauds coming when they're electronic voting machines. And they know the vaccines are tainted.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  And they know the globalists want to keep their country closed. And Brazil is saying no.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  And now they didn't take the vaccine masks. They don't have the big spikes like we do. These are the Sweden and a bunch of other countries. But the countries that do have the highest vaccination rate, like Israel, look at this.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  They're Sweden compared to Israel's on death and illnesses hundreds of times. And now I've got clips coming up in the U.S., in Israel, in the U.K. We even have the West Virginia governor admitting the majority of the deaths are in the vaccinated.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  That's now confirmed. See, first, oh, it'll totally protect you. Well, it won't protect you. You just won't get really sick. Oh, actually, it'll kill you worse.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  And everybody I know that works in hospitals are saying, we're told not to tell people when they've been vaccinated that, oh, you're in here for vaccine sickness, but they basically test positive for COVID.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  And we're told, don't shard it as COVID because they don't want the vaccinated to know you're not sick from COVID. You're sick from the vaccine.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is just incredible. Show some of the Bolsonaro clips with some of the sound. I mean, I know we don't speak Portuguese, but here it is.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  You've got to see the incredible footage. And by the way, I've been asked by people, why do you pay for satellites that hit Europe and Africa and eight areas of Asia?
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Why do you pay for 100,000 watt shortwave WWCR, $11,000 a month, six hours a day broadcast around the world that have much U.S. listeners?
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Because it ain't about money. It's always about minds winning against the globalist, a problem in the future. This show, Bolsonaro's number one son, the son says, you woke my father up.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  You helped launch the whole revolution in Brazil. I've had Nigel Farage on the show say that five times. So I want all of you to know you did that.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  We don't care about getting the Brazilians money. We care about stopping the globalists living together and going to space.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  We want to live with Brazil's children under God with us and all God's children. It's about God, family and country.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  They'll be right back.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative. It hurts. It stinks. It's got pus coming out of it. I go to the doctor. They fix it.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  That's not negative. I'm not living in denial. And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  That's actually a positive thing. And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job. They stole the election. We can't get down about that.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed. They're scared.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers. Look what happened. No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  They're trying to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.

[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at infowars.com.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  In late August, info wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.

[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  This new formula, drop for drop, is the strongest probably out there period.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  Just on the caffeine scale, it's twice as strong as Rain Force Plus.

[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Yeah, that's what happened to the globalists.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  They're not popular, so they're no more Mr. Nice Guy.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  See, you want to be attacked by the newspapers and MSNBC and CNN now.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  That's the key then the people will support you.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  Yeah, they're out of ammo.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  I mean, just 10 years ago, they put up stories against me and it would have a big effect.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  It would hurt us.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  Now, they put up their lies and people have experienced so many lies.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  They just don't believe any of it and none of it's ever true.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  They put out articles all the time that are completely 100% false.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  We call it the Wall Street Journal.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Your market watch article says I lost a lawsuit for writing a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  We didn't write that book.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  I'm not in that book.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  Jim Fetzer wrote that and they just go suicide if you want.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  Then people ask me, well, then why do you believe mainstream news?
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  Well, I know when it's political and I know when it's not.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  I know when it's from another 10 sources and then I read that article and go, okay, that's accurate.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  Most of the people at the New York Times and Washington Post aren't even lying.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  They're usually reporting on something that really isn't political.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  So they'll tell you, you know, this is what the sports team did or this is the Christmas tree this year,
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  sponsored by whatever.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  But when it gets to guns or families or abortion or borders or globalism, you can bet they're lying to you.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  But you know, more and more, they're not just lying.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  They're shifting where they go, yeah, America really is bad.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  We should get rid of the Bill of Rights of Constitution.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  It was written by racist.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Here it is today.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Harmful language trigger warning added to U.S. Constitution at the National Archive website.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  There's discussions of not letting you read it.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Why it's so evil.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  That's how they kill your culture.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  That's how they kill the idea of those freedoms.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  That if people demand those, that's it for their new world order.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Because that Bill of Rights, that Constitution is diametrically opposed to their agenda.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  So how do you get folks to throw away their birthright of guns and private property and mobility and open society?
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Well, you found a group called the Open Society that wages war against open society, George Soros.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  You become the counterfeit.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  That's what they've done.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Now, I said I'd hit this segment, but the next segment is actually a minute longer.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  I'm going to do this next segment.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  The bottom of the pit, Hollywood actress puts Hillary Clinton on notice.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  You represent no flag, no country, no soul.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  You eat hope.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  You twist minds.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  I've been in a hotel room with you and your husband, and here comes the bomb.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  Yep, Rose McGowan got passed around by these people, and she's found her soul and found the truth.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  And she exposed and brought down Weinstein.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  Now she's set her sights on the Clintons, and you know they're going to try to kill her.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  But we're in a different era now.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  You can't kill us all.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  That's what Bolsonaro said to another speech.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  He's already been stabbed with a big old butcher knife through a couple of his organs.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  Tufford and Hell lived through it.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Peerced a bunch of organs.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  He said victory or death a month ago.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  He said we're either going to save this country, defeat the global communist, or I'm going to die crying.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  And that's the spirit that founded Texas.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  That's the spirit that founded America.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Probably grab the clip for next hour or after that.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  It was on Owen's show yesterday.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  They have these weird goon police now at the Texas Alamo, and they turn it to politically correct Texas bashing facility.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  And they make you wear a mask when you're on the property or go into it and are really rude.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  So we need the governor to enforce that over the Alamo.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  They're violating his executive order, and we need these idiots thrown off there.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  They need to move to North Korea.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Yeah, there's the footage.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Bolsonaro just came out and said, Brazilians must not be sissies about coronavirus, and all of us are going to die one day.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  And he's to go further, which I know he's done.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  The Delta variant that's a thousand times more viral and spreads like easy is from the Indian vaccine.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  The Indians admit it.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  They stopped their vaccine.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  It caused this.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  It worked too good.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  It knocked out almost all dozens and dozens of current cold viruses that weren't even COVID-19.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  It knocked it out, but it created a super virus.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  That's why they never did it.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Damn it.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  And there's more reports just came out on Ivermectin.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Ivermectin, South African medics and doctors using unproven drug, BBC, to treat it.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Really, it's used all over Africa.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  It's used all over Asia.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  The Japanese government endorsed it.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  I just showed you all these studies.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  But BBC, the same folks tell you pedophilia is good.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  They tell you don't do it.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Those bad Africans.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Another huge study, The Guardian.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  The Guardian told the truth.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Wow, that's bizarre.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  Huge study supporting Ivermectin as COVID treatment withdrawal over clinical concerns.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Yeah, the UK saying you can't have it.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Israel says you can't have it.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Countries that have Ivermectin, we've shown you the graphs.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  In fact, I sent that to you the other day and I forgot to show it.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Show the African graph of countries that use Ivermectin.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  They have basically no COVID.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  Those that don't, huge COVID.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And it shows the graphs.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  It shows Africa.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  It's the same thing with Israel.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  So all you get to that vaccine, look at Israel and death of disease.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  They just started the booster shot there.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  So you see that spiked even more.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  What happened everywhere else?
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Oh, Sweden doesn't take shots.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Sweden doesn't, you know, Sweden got learned immunity, even to the bio weapon, and they're fine.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  Oh, here's another one.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Despite 95% vaccination rate at Cornell University today has five times more COVID cases than it did this time last year.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  The country has three to four times, but they have five times because they took the shot and it lowers your regular immune system.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And then the new variant, well, you know, what happens?
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  And it goes on and on and on only a few months ago, the Ministry of Health claimed that Pfizer vaccine was 99% effective preventing COVID mortality.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Today, that claim was dangerous misinformation.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  Using the mortality rate, we now know and hypothesize how really effective all these vaccines are.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And you can see the mortality rate off the chart.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  Looks like that actually caused you to die and create negative protection.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  But oh, here it is.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  The vaccine resistant new variant spreads to 49 states as Delta driven summer wave peaks.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  No, it's not Delta driven.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  It's vaccine virus mutation driven.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  That's a fact.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  That's virology.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  So you wear your little diaper mask and you take your little, you take your little shots.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Well, the top story is Fauci in 2012 in video admitted they did gain a function to create a super flu that would be known as a doomsday flu.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  That have gotten the lungs of lab animals killed 95% of them.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Oh, but that's okay.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  There's all the other articles about him admitting gain of function will play some of that next hour when Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the US Bioweapons Law, former top UN war crimes prosecutor and expert on the Nuremberg Code and US law joins us to talk about the documents that came out yesterday.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  The 900 pages were Fauci specifically orders the gain of function and the creation of COVID-19.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And I've got all those documents.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  Guys, I had it at home, but we go to the zero hedge article or our article that had zero hedge with the two links and don't print all 900 pages, but print me a bunch where it says print here and here of the two documents rubs.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  You know what?
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Screw it.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Print.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  We got a big industrial printer.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Print me 900 pages.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Print it all.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Print it all.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  That'll be easier for me to read them on a screen.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  I've been trying to read it at home and I scanned over 500 pages last night.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  So print that sucker.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  All 900 pages for me, please.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  Okay, we're going to break.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  You know, we have got the cavalry has arrived.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  This is a new super product that is so strong and so amazing.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Be very careful and I take the half recommended dose at first, you know, because it's got double the natural caffeine that brain force plus has.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  It's got a whole bunch of herbs and no compounds that just turbo charge the body.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  Arora seed, alpha GPC green coffee bean, a letharo root, your bimate that's got corset and green tea leaves, ginko leaf, ashwagandha root, and so much more.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  It is brain force ultra a limited supply came in.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  It's going to sell out in five, six days.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  The current sales rate, which is a bummer.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  We, we just, it is a small order because we're low on funds, but we're going to put in a big order now, but get it while you can at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Before it's ultra discount out of the gates right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Even more than Trump, Mike Lindell has been out there exposing the fact that the 2020 election was stolen and his symposium was amazing.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  90 plus percent of the information was accurate and was damning and was groundbreaking.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  A few poison pills, a few pieces of this info were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  Folks, I'm surprised the conference even happened.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  They had infiltrators and others that really disrupted it and tried to shut it down because Mike Lindell is over the target.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  And you're over the target when you support his important investigation that is every American's right to do to contest an election if you think that there was issues.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  Look what the Democrats have done over the years.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  And he's continuing his investigations and continuing his work.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  So it's more important than ever to support what he's doing at mypillow.com and to support info wars at the same time with promo code Alex up to 66% off on hundreds of amazing made America products at mypillow.com promo code Alex.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  So check it out today.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational, but we failed.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  And it worked pretty good.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  So I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  It's amazing. It works.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  Well, now we are introducing something that is at the next level.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  Multiple years in development.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  It is brain force ultra.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  It is a liquid in a dropper and it is twice as strong as brain force plus just in the natural caffeine department.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  It's got a bunch of other powerful herbs and compounds that will take your focus and your clarity to the next level with clean energy.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  And it funds the info or exclusively available at info or store dot com.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Thank you.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Thank you.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm, we're here.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  And remember, the way we get out to new people and pass the internet blockade by big tech and big pharma is trying to kill everybody and trying to suppress treatments and the truth.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  Is you telling friends, neighbors, family, perfect strangers, co-workers, hey, you've heard about the demonized Alex Jones.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Well, here's the URL right on the back of a napkin on the back of his paper, you know, on a back of your business card, freeworldnews.tv.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Because that's the current URL we've ever like five months that isn't banned by Twitter and Facebook and where you're able to share the links via that.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  But you can share any of the links on your private email, your text messages, your word of mouth.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  That's king. And that's why they don't want you protesting. They don't want you in the street.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  They've had an Australian, New Zealand and Canada and the UK government leaders, criminals say we don't want to allow demonstrations in the lockdown because people will talk and they'll get disinformation.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  You mean we'll organize against your martial law takeover.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  This is all being done, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  This is all being carried out because you have this criminal out of control psychotic and sociopathic elite that are in control of the major corporations,
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  they're in control of the banks and their Ponzi scheme of thousands of trillions of fake dollars and other currencies is coming down and they need a global great reset to convince you it's your fault and that you're going to have nothing
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  and own nothing and there's going to be a new global currency and digital system tied to your phone, tied to your medical credit app that will then be based on carbon taxes that will track and trace and control everything you do and everywhere you go.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  And that's their admission. So that's being rolled out all over the British Empire. This isn't a British conspiracy, but the British Empire was the most powerful system in the world till the end of World War II.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  It then merged with the United States and we became the global empire of this system and we've had our energy and our wealth transferred out.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  We had over half the wealth in 1950. Now we've got like 20% of it to not empower the world but to put the globalist in charge.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  And so now they've been caught corrupting people with money, with drugs, with payoffs, with pedophilia to get in the globalist club. You've got to engage in the pedophilia even if you don't like it so they quote, can trust you.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  And that's what Jeffrey Epstein did. That's what these other groups did and it's come out in the British intelligence does this elements of the CIA do this. It's all been declassified.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  They put pedophiles in charge all over Afghanistan because that was groups and organizations that again they controlled.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  So here's an article out today. Hollywood actress is the top trending story, but tell every Clinton on notice, you represent no flag, no country, no soul.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  You eat hope. That's a great way of saying it. You twist minds. I have been in a hotel room with you and your husband and here comes the bomb.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  So Rose McGowan brought down Harvey Weinstein.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  Well, it's well known that Oprah Winfrey would, from our sources that have been dead on it's come out now, have sex with these women.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  And you know, Oprah admittedly was a prostitute when she was 12 years old and when you're abused a child, you tend to abuse others.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  She's had men as beards. I don't hate her because she's a lesbian, but I do dislike her because she's a eugenicist.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  She wants world government. She runs weird cults with John of God and weird cults in Africa.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  And it's just bringing in the poisons and the vaccines and all of it. She's the black face on New York.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  She's the only black person allowed in these U.N. Bill Gates depopulation meetings that have been in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, what heroes they are in the Good Club, forming a world government to depopulate.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  For Rose McGowan goes on and says, you're a monster, Oprah. I know what you've done. I'm going to expose you. I've been in a hotel room with the Clintons. I'm going to expose you.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  You're going down. You helped your husband rape women. She tells Hillary Clinton, unfortunately for Hillary, she is Rose McGowan's next target.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  And the Me Too activist and former Charmed actress may be the one person who has the courage to take on the mob boss of the Clinton crime family.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  You are the enemy of what's good, right and moral. You represent no flag, no country, no soul. You eat hope. You twist minds, she tweeted.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  And then she landed an ominous warning for women who, for decades, have stood idly by allowing her husband to prey on women.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  Knowing full well that her sexual predator husband was the ticket to her ultimate dream of becoming president of the United States.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  McGowan concluded her message by saying to Hillary, I've been in a hotel room with you and your husband, and here comes the bomb.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Full article is at infowars.com. Now let's run quick to this stack. I'm going to do a special report, probably this weekend, just on this stack.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  But let me just tell you what's in it. Here's the week publication. The Jeffrey Epstein case is why people believe pizza gate.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  They created pizza gate and had the Wall Street Journal, New York Times CNN say it was a pizza place using 4chan to divert the pizza place.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Instead of the WikiLeaks that had all the admissions of Wiener and Epstein and all of them doing Alistair Crowley rituals, sex rings, kids in hot tubs, all of it.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Okay? So, so, so yeah. But then they use that to divert off of it again. And again, look at Newsom. He's into all this stuff from our intel.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Women are smarter in politics, smarter in civics, they're smarter in economics, women rule. That's just pandering to women.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  They totally exploit and control women. Trudeau, you need to do the counter she session and turn it into a she-covery.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Other parties don't talk about feminism. They don't talk about the impact of women on this crisis. It's just all sophistry. It's all manipulation. It's all pandering.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  Yeah, Gisling Maxwell's prosecutors ordered to disclose names of her alleged sex abuse co-conspirators. And it goes on from there.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  And the judge is ordering all of those names released by the FBI. Of course, maybe because the FBI is just going to remove the names off of there.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  But that's how all these blackmail rings work. Just look at the pathetic scum these people are.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  Here's another one. Let us look to Satanist as last best hope to save abortion in Texas. The Satanist filed cases saying, killing babies is their sacrament, which it is.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  The Democrats now say, Satanist are our last great hope. Oh my gosh, there are party, there are people. Yes, they're really nice.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Satanist challenge Texas abortion law, argue religious freedom to kill babies.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Actually, oh, now it's a baby. Satan works mysterious ways.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  And then it just goes on.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Now, let's move into the larger issues here of what's really going on.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Great reset UN orders 10 year old deadline. So the UN comes out and orders 10 year deadline for Australia to shut down entire coal industry to fight climate change.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  And they're now trying to put us under that agreement as well. And they're over our medicine.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And again, who runs the UN? These same Satanist, these same pedophiles, these same control freaks.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Now they can turn off your energy. They can turn off everything. China says they're not going to follow it. Neither is India.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Local news station refuses to retract Ivermectin fake news. Don't know how that got in the pile.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  Now this is key personal carbon allowances revisited. That's out of nature's journal of sustainability.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  And it says on your phone using the new COVID trackers, tax everybody by the mile, tell them when they can leave their house where they can go, what they can do with the carbon credit system.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  And again, that's being proposed all over the place.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  That's how they lay this out. Then we shift gears into these articles.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Pentagon document lays out plans to battle against zombies. CNN 2014.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Here's another one. Foreign policy. The Pentagon has a plan to stop zombies apocalypse seriously than Amazon has a zombie apocalypse collapse in its terms of service.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  It's active God section. Why is that? Because the Pentagon doesn't train to mow down millions of starving Americans.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  Within 10 days, people become like zombies. They're not literally zombies, but they act like them.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Unless they're extremely moral people, then they can use a commit suicide and mass.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  But that's what the Japanese would do. And I would say that's a good thing.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  But here it'll be a time bomb like army ants going out like the movie, The Road.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  And so to cover up their training to use helicopters and nerve gases and machine guns, once they turn the food and infrastructure off, once it collapses,
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  the Pentagon again calls it a zombie apocalypse. But that's really the agenda 2030 collapse after the virus they're going to release and other viruses they release cause the breakdown of hospitals,
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  the breakdown of society after the globalists turn off the pipelines, turn off the nuclear reactors, turn everything off.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  It then will slowly degrade into a giant depopulation event. And here's the official CDC plan, preparedness for a zombie apocalypse.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  And that's just some of the stack. I'll get more to that when we come back.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  But I think you're starting to get a very good idea about what's going on here.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  They're preparing for mass death and they're triggering the system that is going to bring that into place.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  Alright, more straight ahead with the smoking gun documents on Fauci.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  I would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  Then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  That's right where we're at brother.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, durable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:47.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  You know, I've got a pretty thick skin, but reading 500 pages last night, I scanned over 500 pages of the 900.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  And seeing Fauci describing how to build COVID-19 and building it and then how to cover it up and just knowing that if we don't do something, he's going to get away with it.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  Is surreal to know we've got criminals that are in control of all of the law enforcement agencies at the top and that they're bringing in a system that will destroy them, but they don't care because there's such cowards is just mind blowing.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  But Dr. Francis Boyle is joining us here in a moment. We're going to cover it all.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  I want to make a very important announcement to all the listeners, though.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  I want to make a very important announcement to all the great listeners that are tuning into the broadcast today.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  And it's that I want to thank you for your support in keeping us on air, despite all the attacks, all the demonization, all the death threats and all the behind the scenes dirty tricks.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  We've become stronger in this fight and we couldn't do any of it without you.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  So you are the Info War. You help wake up Bolsonaro. You help wake up Nigel Farage. You help wake up Joe Rogan and you help wake up Tucker Carlson.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  They've all told me that this show woke them up. That means you woke them up.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  That means it's more important than ever to keep this broadcast on air in the face of the enemy.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  It's like a standard, a flag. They want to pull down a signet.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  And I want you to get products that help fund the operation that help you. I want them to blow you away.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  That's why we've got Amazing X2 and the vitamin mineral fusion, both discounted, very close to selling out at infowarstore.com.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  In fact, the vitamin mineral fusion sale is going to end next Monday or Tuesdays when we've got a new sale coming in.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  Because they're all about to sell out, vitamin mineral fusion and, of course, X2.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  But we've got something that just came in that I know is going to be a huge game changer.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  They ordered a limited amount of it, not because we couldn't get the ingredients, but because we've been tied on cash and we've got a lot of products.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  We only buy so much that we didn't know if it would be popular or not.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  But listeners told us we want Rainforest Plus as a liquid.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  Well, my developers talked to a lot of top developers and they said, let's give them what they want.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  Let's make the strongest, clean, herb, compound, caffeine-based system out there with no additives, no crap.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  That is a long, clean, strong burn.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  So we've got a limited edition.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  He even says limited edition to make sure the listeners would like it.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  I know the crew loves it so much that it's not going to be limited edition for long, but it is a limited edition right now.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  And that is Rainforest Ultra.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  This is a very, very exciting product.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  It's got Ashwagandha root, an ancient herb used for over 3,000 years and is favored by many different medical systems and many tribes around the world for its beneficial properties.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  Gorora seed loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  Gorora seed is native.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  The Amazon has been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries for stama and energy clarity and focus, including their rituals.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers, coline, a water soluble, essential nutrient across the brain barrier.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  Green coffee bean, you know, that's the antioxidant, so many things, great energy.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  From the raw seeds of the coffee fruit, green coffee beans have a powerful natural punch and are rich in chlorogenic acid.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  Eluthro root is a celebrated member of the ginseng family and has been used for thousands of years in traditional systems.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  Urbimate leaf, by the way, has Corsetin, that's so good for your immune system, containing natural amounts of caffeine.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Urbimate is also loaded with polythenosolus and Corsetin, also known and also as well as potassium, magnesium, and manganese.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Green tea leaves, naturally rich in EGCG, as well as L-theanine, only the highest quality green tea leaves are included in this formula.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  Ginko leaf, known for its exceptional antioxidant content, ginko comes from the ancient group of plants and has been the focus of both ancient and modern fascination.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  And that's just some of what is in Brain Force Ultra, exclusively available at infowarstore.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139.

[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have had two gigantic earth-shaking events that affect all of us in the last 24 hours.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  First, the intercept of very respected investigative journal sued a year ago and they finally got 900 pages,
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  and I read 500 last night till I fell asleep at 2 a.m.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  And it just made me angry when I was reading it.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  We've got a bunch of those pages today here.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  We've got the 900 pages, and it's unspeakable able.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  Fauci is there admitting to creating COVID-19, to fusing five viruses together that they later admit is COVID-19.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  He admits it's synthetic just like his head of the program Peter Dazik did in 2019 in December.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  We have that video.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  But the media ignored that, but these are the documents.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  So this totally proves what Senator Paul says.
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  It proves what Dr. Francis Boyle said in February on this broadcast and in March and in May.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  You know, right through.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  He's been on every month with us or more.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  I guess it probably made 18, 19 appearances, it looks like, every month since last February.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  He's a very busy professor.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  He is the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  He was also a top U.N. prosecutor, prosecuted many war criminals like Sullivan Milojevic.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  And so he's the guy that can tell you about international law and U.S. law and the Nuremberg Code and the rest of it and applicable U.S. laws of how we can go after Fauci.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  But I have a very sick feeling that because the FBI and Justice Department are so controlled that instead we'll probably see, you know, Donald Trump indicted for some type of tax stuff from 20 years ago in New York.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  Instead of the crimes of the century, gain of function, then a new video surfaced from 2012.
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  That video surfaced every year in the first hour that we'll play again for Dr. Boyle, where he's in a online C-SPAN symposium, a bio weapons symposium called Biodefense 2012.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  And they ask about gain of function.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  They admit they built a virus that spreads faster through ferrets and can infect humans.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  We have all the admissions, we have all the documents, we have specifically making this coronavirus at the Wuhan lab and we have him not being arrested.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  So this is incredible.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  So we're joined by probably the best expert we could possibly have, Dr. Francis Boyle, for the rest of the hour, sir.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  So please, I know you did a show.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  You don't have to repeat yourself a month ago where you laid out the three ways to indict him or go after him.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  Please, give us your take on how big this is and what's currently happening.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  What are the mechanisms by states or by grand juries?
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  I mean, what can we do when someone is literally committing crimes against humanity in front of us?
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Thank you, Dr. Boyle.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  Well, thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  My best to your listening audience.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  I was watching the media today and I did want to address President Biden's address to the nation tomorrow in anticipation of what he's going to say.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  The reports are he is going to expand his frank and shot mandate system that clearly violates the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  It's a Nuremberg crime and a Nuremberg crime against humanity.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  Biden is basically going to be deliberately setting up an apartheid system and they had passes there along the lines of the criminal apartheid regime in South Africa,
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  where you have the whites over here and the blacks over there, et cetera.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  So I did want to say a few words in anticipation.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So we'll get into the will.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  Absolutely. We'll get into the Fauci stuff next segment. Absolutely. That's huge news as well.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  So from your intel, what do you think he's going to announce tomorrow?
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  And obviously, we know the two head scientist over vaccines quit last week in anticipation of what's about to be announced.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Right. Well, we're going to have a third frank and shot.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  If the first two didn't kill you off already, you'll be triple, triple tapped by the third frank and shot.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  And then expanding the mandates as far as he possibly can for the under the control of the United States federal government,
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  and also compelling private employers to compel as many people as possible to take these frank and shots.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  I said once before on your program, I was up against personally, Senator Biden in his capacity as chairman of the Senate for Relations Committee.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  My personal dealings with Biden, he is a total totalitarian along the lines of George Orwell in 1984.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  He has absolutely no respect for the civil rights, civil liberties and human rights of the American people.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  And this dealt with the US UK supplementary extradition treaty of 1986, which he pushed through the Senate for Relations Committee.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  We, Irish organized against that treaty.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  We were supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, because the American Civil Liberties Union and we, Irish, understood that that treaty was a dire threat to the civil rights, civil liberties, human rights of all Americans.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  Remember, we fought a revolution against Britain here in this country, and they tried to impose an extradition treaty on us that they could the Brits could ask for anyone they want and get.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  So, you know, Francis Boyle's created a lot of problems for us over there on our illegal colonial military occupation of Northern Ireland, so we want them.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  I won't go through this at length, but I castrated that treaty, despite Biden, and he fought for it.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  He tried to ram this treaty through at the behest of Britain and Maggie Thatcher. I kid you not.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  So all this talk about him, you know, being an Irishman, you know, he's what we Irish recall, you know, a St. Patrick's Day Irishman, he marches in the parade, and that's it.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  Otherwise, he's a very cunning, deceptive, devious, totalitarian politician behind the scenes.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  And we were able, you know, to beat out that first treaty. And the only reason Biden supported that first totalitarian treaty was that he was going to run for president in 1988, which he lost and wanted to make it appear that well, I'm really tough on on terrorism.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  So what happened is 9 11 2001 came along, and the British figured the climate had changed all over again. So they came back against us a second time with the Maggie Thatcher extradition treaty all over again, and Biden fully supported it.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  And the American Civil Liberties Union fully supported us Irish in stopping that treaty against what Biden was trying to do, because the ACLU and we Irish realize the second treaty would be a dire threat to the civil rights and civil liberties
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  and human rights of all Americans and not just the Irish. And basically, we stopped what Biden was trying to do. And, you know, we fought back, and we got basic protections in there in the ratification for that treaty that protected all Americans.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  And again, Biden supported the second treaty 2006 to support his own presidential election campaign at that time, which he lost. If you're interested the story on our fight against that second extradition treaty, and against Biden, you can find in my book United Ireland,
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  the United Nations and International Law for page limitations I had to delete the battle against the first treaty. But here's a man who sold out his own people, the Irish to our congenital enemies, the British and Maggie Thatcher twice over 20 years, and was fully prepared to
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  all the civil rights, civil liberties and human rights of the American people, which is exactly why the American Civil Liberties Union supported us twice in a row.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  So by the ACLU is supporting force inoculations, they've been bought out by Soros under Francis will has been in these fights up against dictators up against Biden, we can beat him again. We come back, the big announcements by the set to make tomorrow and the gain of function founcy caught red handed is a huge broadcast.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  Stay with us.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  I certainly do. So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at stronger defense dot com. No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known, but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called immune 10 X.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  Crazy, right? Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at stronger defense dot com. That's stronger defense dot com.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.

[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  In late August, info or saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in. Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very, very low cost at infoorstore.com.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com. That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control. So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But there's only two things to do.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  Alex Jones, thank you for joining us.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  This has all been a giant setup of evil.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  And now we have the two top regulators at the FDA quitting and saying, don't give it to children under 16. Don't do the booster shots. And Biden's going to override that tomorrow.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  Other people resigned at the FDA. The head of a panel on the Alzheimer's drug. They unanimously, scientists said, do not approve it. It's dangerous. Biden's approving it.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  Well, this is, this is true Joseph Mengele level stuff. Isn't it Dr. Boyle? I mean, it's just crazy what's going on.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  Right, Alex. This is reminiscent of the experiments that Dr. Mengele carried on against Jewish children at Auschwitz. You can read about that in the medical doctor's case at Nuremberg that led to the Nuremberg code on medical experimentation.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  These are our Nuremberg crimes, Nuremberg crimes against humanity. But before we go on with the discussion, Alex, I wanted to refer back to two points you made before the break.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  First point people have to understand you can fight back against Biden. I fought back against him twice.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  Now, I had the support of every Irish American organization here in the country. So we have to get organized. And second, the support of the ACLU.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  But the first time I beat Biden out hands down. And the second time we fought back, we stopped what he was going to do. And we protected the interests of all American people, their civil rights, civil liberties and human rights.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  Now, as for the ACLU endorsement of the Franken shots, you have to look at what happened there. The fellow who wrote that article in the New York Times, David Cole, I know full well, he's a professor of law at Georgetown Law School.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  Cole is infamous in the legal profession for basically supporting the CIA torture program that was set up by Bush Jr. Yes, I kid you not.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  Cole argued in the New York Times that with respect to the 550 page executive summary put out by an arm of Congress here about this torture scandal, which I read that the CIA got a bum rap.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  Well, that was ridiculous. They did not get a bum rap. That was a congressional investigation 550 page executive summary, based on a 6000 page report that they still won't let us see documenting CIA torture.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  And Cole went out there to run interference for the CIA. I kid you not. So this man is a controlled opposition. And it does appear that as of now, the ACLU has become controlled opposition to.
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  So I just wanted to deal with those two points, Alex. And now I'm happy to go wherever you would like us to go.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  Well, this is a shorter segment, two long segments are coming up. So let's finish up the last next five minutes with.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  Hey, we actually have the European Union regulator saying don't do booster shots. Don't do children. They're being overridden. It looks like Boris Johnson says he's going to override his government, a cabinet level group that says don't do it.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  We've got all the money like something like a third of the FDA board heads, including the two people over the vaccine programs that are pro vaccine, by the way, they've left and quit and said this is wrong and evil.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  That's a pretty big seismic event. And it shows that there's some soul left in the bureaucracy or maybe they just don't want to go to prison for what they know is coming out.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  But I mean, to me, that's a pretty big deal, Dr. Boyle. I don't ever remember seeing regulators across the world standing up and doing the right thing like this.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  Well, actually, you can't. I think they might be afraid of going to prison. You can't trust the FBA FDA at all.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  As we said, months ago, in that interview I gave you over SARS-like cluster circulating back coronavirus posed threat for human emergence that developed COVID-19. The FDA is clearly listed National Center for Toxicological Research, Food and Drug Administration,
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  Jefferson, Arkansas, USA. They are clearly listed as helping to develop this offensive biological warfare weapon with gain of function properties in it known as COVID-19 at the UNC BSL3.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  So of course, you can't trust or believe anything the FDA.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  I totally agree. So why would you have all these insiders breaking with Biden saying you shouldn't do this? It's political. Don't do it and quitting and leaving. And in Europe, regulators standing up and saying it's time to stop.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  Is it because they now realize how bad this is?
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  I think they've known it all along. I think they're fearing criminal prosecution and the reaction of the American people when all of the truth comes out, which it is slowly doing thanks to your program going back to the programs going back to February of 2020.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  The FDA then this totally rotten corrupt and criminal organization that is well known to be a captive agency in the legal profession under the control of the drug industry and Monsanto and the Nazis at Bayern Monsanto, etc.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  They gave their original emergency use authorization to the Franken-Shops in violation of the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation. They know what the Nuremberg Code is all about.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  They knew when they gave it, they were violating the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation. They knew they were committing a Nuremberg crime. They knew they were committing a Nuremberg crime against you.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  And I know as a prosecutor, you don't go, I mean, you do go to Moda, but you're always, hey, the crime's there. Let's just go, let's go have them arrested. We'll talk about how that happens next segment.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  But I always go back to psychology, though, because that is important in crimes. Why did they think they'd get away with this?
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Because I think it's clear that they're starting to not get away with it. The truth is coming out. So I'll ask you the same question I asked you a year ago.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  What's wrong with these big pharma keeps doing things, keeps putting out blood product, factorate with HIV and it knowing it'll kill millions. It's in their minutes. They say, who cares?
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  Keeps doing this craziness over and over again.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Well, it's the arrogance of power and the God complex that, you know, we are God here. We are scientists and you out there are the little bitty people.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  You're the untermention, the under people as the Nazis saw it. And we are the ubermench, the over people as the Nazi saw it.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  That's exactly what Dr. Zelenko said. And anybody that studies it gets down to that. And then surprise, surprise Bill Gates wants to be popped into the world.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle is here with us. We'll show you that book again. It's very historical. I've read it about how he's beaten these bureaucracies before.
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  He also helped, right at the tip of the spear, beat the forced inoculations of experimental anthrac shots of the troops.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  So this guy knows how to beat him. He's trained at Harvard, the same program that Tissinger was.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  And so he's going to talk about the blueprint for victory against this nightmare and we come back.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.

[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  Well, we are all certainly riders on the storm.
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  And the question is, how do we end this globalist power grab by the Rockefeller Foundation, and by Kissinger, and by Bill Gates admitting they're going to use the virus to take control and now doing it?
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  And martial law around the world, and what's coming here, and tightening down the noose on his Kamara with this big announcement.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  You can go to Amazon and many other places and find the many great books written by Dr. Francis Boyle.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  Just search his name. You can pull those up.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  Biowarfare and Terrorism is a definitive book on that as well.
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  United Ireland, Human Rights, International Law, and of course several others there that you can find.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  Now sir, we've only got 27 minutes left. I want to shut up these two long segments and just get into how big it is, what's coming out.
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  I don't want to take credit. I don't want you to take credit, but the truth is you first broke the gain of function, the documents that were already there.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  Now new documents out of the Intercept.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  Now video surfacing of him at conferences with Doomsday viruses he was making and gain of function.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  And just the crimes of this out of the open and in the new documents that came out yesterday through the four-year lawsuit of the Intercept.
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  I know you know about this for listeners joining us. He says combine these five viruses with the SARS virus.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  He describes COVID-19 and we have Peter Dazik on video admitting it.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  So we have open and shut the man running the response to it is the man behind it.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  So get into the current developments and under the law how we move against this monster because this is just insane to see him sit up there when he has been caught red-handed.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  Well, it's just before we get to that I wanted to finish the point of the last segment and specifically with respect to the members of U.S. Armed Forces.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  It was the FDA back in 1990 that authorized the emergency use of the two Gulf War Franken shots at that time which I opposed and tried to stop whatever that led to the Gulf War sickness.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  So the FDA is fully responsible for what happened to U.S. troops back starting in 1990. The Pentagon still lies about the statistics because they know they committed a Nuremberg crime and a Nuremberg crime against humanity against our own troops.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  Out of 500,000 inoculated, 11,000 were killed, 100,000 were disabled and maybe one-third adverse events. The Gulf War sickness also infected healthcare workers and members of the immediate family.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  The FDA did that. They are a rotten, corrupt criminal organization that should be completely put out of business. And now because of this new FDA so-called final approval,
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  Biden and Secretary Austin has ordered all U.S. military forces to take these new Franken shots that are probably going to even be far worse in the consequences.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  And so you're an expert lawyer on these areas so let's talk about this. But I've had doctors on and others and we've gone over with lawyers. They've said it's 100% clear this is a new made-up no-man's land where it's another emergency authorization.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  They had a meeting and decided to call it final approval but said in 2025 we might actually approve it. So another hoax, another lie, another giant fraud saying that this is an approved vaccine.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  And perpetrated by Biden and Secretary of Defense Austin and the FDA. I mean the FDA are total liars as is the CDC and the WHO, you can't believe anything they are telling.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  Yeah, there's Austin right there. He's Biden's man. He's forcing U.S. armed forces to take these Franken shots knowing full well what happened to them with the Gulf War sickness and the healthcare workers that treated them,
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  indicated a biological warfare weapon at work and their family members who also came down with the Gulf War sickness. I still hear from veterans suffering from the Gulf War sickness today, ask me my advice what they can do.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  You can imagine, only imagine what is going to happen when our current military personnel have to take this new round of Franken shots.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  I totally agree, but sir please, just on the giant subject, the total vindication, you were the first to come out with it with all the documents, the details you already had that information in February of last year.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  Now it's all confirmed with these new documents, 900 pages, video servicing and Fauci admitting it. I've never seen such an open and shut case or am I wrong?
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Alex, now we can get into how the American people can fight back. Yes. I wanted to say all of that just as background to this catastrophic existential situation we are facing as Americans including the members of our U.S. armed forces.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  Yes, as I said in our last interview, we are dealing here with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, two causes of action, one for the COVID pandemic and the second for the Franken shots.
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  So let me go through both causes of action here. As for the COVID, excuse me, as for the COVID pandemic, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of human beings with malice or forethought.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  All right, unlawful, I was hired here to teach criminal law, so fine. Unlawful, there we have their gross Fauci, Collins, Menakery, everyone, the Bat Queen, this person from the Harvard Medical School, which is why you can't believe Walensky there from the CDC,
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  this person from the Harvard Medical School, everyone on that SARS-like cluster barrack, everyone on that contract that we've discussed before, it is violating the my biological weapons anti-terrorism act of 1989.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  So we have unlawful killing of human beings, probably right now over a million American excess deaths. And again, they're lying about the true fatalities here, but excess deaths probably over a million.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  With malice or forethought, a term of art. So one of the elements of malice or forethought is manifesting grave indifference to human life. And we have seen with all the documents that have come out, including those you've recently discussed now,
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  that Fauci, Collins, Menakery, this FDA person, the Harvard Medical School person, the Bat Queen went ahead and did this extremely dangerous biological warfare weapons work with grave indifference to human life at a minimum.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  So my opinion is we have an excellent case for murder and conspiracy to commit murder against those people for sure. So what needs to be done then, since the entire federal government, the Department of Injustice, Garland, all the rest of them, the FBI,
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  they're all under the control of Biden. They're going to do Biden's bidding. He's made it clear he's working in cahoots with Fauci so fine. We have to take our case then out to every state's attorney, district attorney,
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  county prosecutor, attorney general, and anyone here in the United States. And the last figure I saw was there were well under over 400 of them. And the people living under their jurisdiction pressured them and saying,
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  look here, we have had people murdered under your jurisdiction by this game of criminals. And we want you to convene a grand jury and present all of this evidence before the grand jury and secure an indictment for murder and conspiracy to commit murder against these individuals.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  Stay right there. We'll come back with that straight ahead. Dr. Francis Boyle lays out the legal blueprint that's very strong to put these criminals behind bars.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  We'll penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment that founded the Bilderberg Group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg Group, didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, shown the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government. And as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  We don't have a shot. We do expose them. We can beat them easily. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  Looking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the U.N. They admit all of this. They plan the lockdowns. They release the viruses.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  They think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan.

[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  And Boyle, our guest is the tip of the spear and the resistance to these globalist depopulation programs that Henry Kissinger's State Department of the Random 200 and others like it that says the policy of the U.S. government is depopulation.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  Well, that's not the U.S. government. That's the psychos playing God that want to be the uber mentioned as he was talking about earlier.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  I'm going to host 15 minutes to the next hour. Another great guest host is coming in ahead of the war room.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  I'm going to hit some big news breaking after Dr. Boyle leaves us, but they're going to declare even more of our liberties gone, but they're not gone.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  We have to stand up for them when Biden makes the speech tomorrow.
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  So you got caught off by the break, Dr. Boyle, with we have a very good case for prosecuting these people.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  We need grand juries to take action. We citizens to beat the drum. We need Congress and Rand Paul to beat the drum.
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  Please continue, sir, with the path towards getting these monsters off our backs.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  Right, Alex. I want to first talk then about a second cause of action on the Franken shots.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  And then I would like to give some more advice to our members of our U.S. armed forces who have been ordered to take these Franken shots by Austin at the behest of Biden, the totalitarian.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  Now, the second cause of action over the Franken shots, you don't do them both together.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  The Franken shots. Let me go back again. Unlawful killing of human beings with malice of author unlawful on the Franken shots.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  It would clearly be a violation of the Nuremberg code of medical experimentation that is a Nuremberg crime and a Nuremberg crime against humanity.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  Killing of human beings. Again, if you are living in a territorial jurisdiction where people have died from the Franken shots, you should go into your state's attorney district attorney, the county prosecutor, the attorney general.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  Okay, you need people who've died under their jurisdiction. And then with malice of author. So here we have two other elements of malice of author thought to deal with the first either intentional killing of human beings.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  The Franken shot people say, well, we didn't intend to kill people. But the second is intention to cause grievous bodily harm to human beings. And clearly, we have them on that, that if you look at the various reports that are grossly underestimated,
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  the European health authority reports that are much better, you will see that these Franken shots have inflicted a grievous bodily harm on human beings massively.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  And they know it, and they knew it, and they are continuing to do it. People are still dying. And now they're coming up with a third booster shot, despite all the evidence.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  In Israel today, they're now on their fourth booster shot. That's the future that we face if we do not stop these criminals. So I believe all the elements are there for convening a grand jury to seek indictments for murder and conspiracy to commit murder
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  against a slowy head of operation warped speed, the chief executive officers of Pfizer, BioNTech, and Johnson and Johnson, those are the Franken shots being used in this country, and also their so called chief scientific officers,
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  their death scientists, for conspiracy and conspiracy to commit murder. And I think the case is there. I think that these prosecutors can make the case for indictments for murder and conspiracy to commit murder against this group of people.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  As for Bill Gates, he has been very careful to stand down in the background. I don't know if he could be tied into conspiracy to commit murder. We're going to leave more evidence against Gates between you and me.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  I understand Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is coming out with a new book, trying to tie Gates into all this. I've listened to his half hour podcast on it. Maybe we're going to get more evidence about Gates.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  I can't say at this time, we need to keep that in mind.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  Well, once we start indicting Fauci and Peter Dazek and the rest of them, then we'll be able to get all the rest of the documents and we know that Gates was funding and then we'll be able to get him.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  Sure, just subpoena Gates to appear before these grand juries and subpoena Duchess take him to take all the documents he has. And if necessary, even though the feds are going to do this in the FBI, the local prosecutors where Gates lives out there in Seattle, the Gates Foundation headquarters,
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  wherever he might be located, they can send out state local police and execute search.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  And let me throw this at you. People like Jim Garrison, he never brought the CIA to justice for killing Kennedy, but in the people's minds, 92% national polls know they killed him.
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  So that's just one prosecutor in New Orleans doing that. And so these prosecutors, they've got the courage because we have no future if they don't.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  If these grand juries and others just do this, it's a major shot across the bow and I expect they'll back off pretty quick, wouldn't they? Have they started getting indicted or investigated in five or six jurisdictions, doctor?
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  Of course they would. That would just be the start of the resistance. That would be, you know, starting a ball rolling down the mountain against Biden and the Frankenshots.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  So and the difference here is that the state prosecutors and state's attorneys, district attorneys, county prosecutors, attorney generals, they're elected by the people, okay, the people in their territorial jurisdiction.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  My experience dealing with people at this level and judges, the state local judges and prosecutors, they are feel accountable, more accountable to the people than federal prosecutors and federal judges because they are elected by the people.
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  They can be reelected by the people. They can be defeated by the people and their salaries are paid by the people.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  So for that reason, I believe that if the people under their territorial jurisdiction got organized and buttonhole them, not just emails, but buttonhole them personally, they, some of them would have the courage to be more responsible.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  Again, go speak at city councils, county commissioners, state houses, go to the meet and greets with state reps, go meet and greets with judges and just say, hey, you've seen the documents, you see what happened.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  Rand Paul can't do this by his own. And we're not saying this to act tough. Dr. Bowles committed to what he's doing. I'm committed because we're driven to do this because we don't want to be slaves.
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  We come from, you know, people and families that love freedom, just like the listeners and viewers do. But obviously, Boyle's been targeted. We don't have time to get into it.
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  I've been targeted for this. So we're not up here calling for their indictment just to act cool. We know this is life and death. We're putting our lives in the line doing this.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  I mean, I'll tell you, I've been told if I don't back off, they got the FBI investigating me. They got other stuff. They said, Jones, one more inch and we're going to get you in.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  And so they might kill me soon. That's okay, because I'm not signed on to killing all these people and the military and all these poison shots.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  Somebody's got to call these people's bluff and we're doing it right now, aren't we, Dr. Boyle?
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  Well, Alex, let me just say a final word. We're running out of time here to our U.S. military personnel.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  Under U.S. military law, you have no obligation to obey an illegal order.
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  And you can read that in Winthrop on military law. I've argued this in court commercials.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  And so this order from Austin at the behest of Trump, you can say if you want to, it's an illegal order.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  It violates the Nuremberg Code that is a Nuremberg crime and is a Nuremberg crime against humanity.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  I am not going to carry out this legal order if you are going to court martial me.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  Well, so be it. I have all the protections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  And again, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, in my opinion, is pretty good for a military system.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  Dr. Boyle, hold on. I don't know if you're teaching class today. We've got a two-minute break.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  I've had so many questions from the military. I'm glad you brought this up.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  They wanted you back on to talk about the process, if it's a written order, how, what the...
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  I know you can't give legal advice, but just from your experience, they're calling me and I don't know.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  I know Biden's like, there's supposedly a path, not to take the shots, but he's hiding it from them and they're playing tricks.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  So, dude, five more minutes. I promise I'll let you get back to your work.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  Two-minute break, we're going to come back. Folks, don't forget, only way this interview gets out is you tell people.
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  It's about to end. It's life-saving. It's so powerful. It's the center of liberty right now in truth.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  Once it's archived today at Band-Aught Video or FreeWorldNews.tv, for your own future for our future.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  This is a war. It's a globalist takeover, a corporate takeover.
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  You've got to take this interview and share it on your email, your text message, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  There's no copyright. Take clips out of it. Use it. None of what I do is copyright. Just get it out there.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  You are the Paul Reverez.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  And it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supply.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  So again, it was half the order we wanted. But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off.
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  So everybody on the fence will get it.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body.
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals and a bunch of key amino acids at infowarstore.com.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  So while supplies last until it runs out, we're selling it for 33% off and it'll be months till more comes in.
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  So get yours today at infowarstore.com.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  Because it's not just a great product, we need those funds to keep operating as well. We're all in a catch-22.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  But we have another great product, hair and beard formula, that's really a great multivitamin mineral system.
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  That's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there. It's just called hair and beard.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  So get that as well for your immune system. It's great for women, great for children.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  But it's designed for men, infowarstore.com.
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality, it's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  One of our crew members five years ago was going to Vietnam for a month-long trip they've been planning for years.
[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  They got the vaccines to go and got deadly ill. The medical doctor told her, if you ever take another vaccine again, you've developed an auto-inresponsive, it'll kill you.
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  No vaccines ever again. Well, Brian Stelter is on the news saying, basically, stop everybody, go after everybody, even if you already have learned immunity.
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  Military service members of natural immunity file a lawsuit against DOD, FDA, HHS over COVID vaccine mandate.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  What if you already have a natural immunity? They say you should never take a vaccine once you have it. You can cause major problems.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  He's got four minutes. He's here with us. Dr. Boyle is a very respected lawyer. He's fought the forced injections in court marshals.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  He helped end a lot of them. So in four minutes we got left, sir. A lot of military, as I said, have called in. They wanted to have you on to give advice.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  Please give them as much info as you can.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  So first, we all know that CNA is a front organization for the CIA, and they work in cahoots with the CDC. As for MSNBC, MS, Microsoft, that's Bill Gates.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  So you can't believe anything they're telling you. What can I say?
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  As for the current members of U.S. Armed Forces, under military law, you have a right to disobey an illegal order that is well established.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  You can find that in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and also in the manual on that Winthrop on military law.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  And indeed, I have successfully defended, helped defend the first go for resistor to the first go for by both senior Jeff Patterson,
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  arguing that the order given to Corporal Patterson when he was at Kanahoe Bay, Hawaii to ship out to Saudi Arabia was illegal and he didn't have to obey it.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  And we got Patterson out of the Marine Corps on that argument. You can read it if you want to, my book, Protesting Power, War, Resistance, and Law,
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  and how we did it in Chapter 4, The Constitutionality of President George H. Bush Senior War Against Iraq on Trial.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  So this strategy has been taken before. So you can't blow your cool. Obviously, if you get an order, you're in the military command there.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  You cannot get upset. You cannot curse anyone out. Obviously, you have to be respectful and you just say, I'm very sorry, sir.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  I cannot obey this order to take the franken shots. It is clearly an illegal order in violation of the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation,
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  which is a Nuremberg crime, and also a Nuremberg crime against humanity in violation of the Nuremberg Charter, Judgment, and Principles.
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  How to argue all that is in my book, That Check. And that, I think, would be the response.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  And then, you know, it would be up to them, your commanding officer, to decide what to do with you.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  My advice would be at this time to a group of you get together and try now to line up civilian attorneys to defend you.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  I don't mean any disrespect to JAG lawyers. I've worked with some of them, and some of them have been very courageous down there at Gitmo, knowingly forfeiting their JAG careers, standing up for Gitmo detainees.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  But the bottom line is JAG lawyers are still in a military chain of command, and in a highly politicized case like this, there's only so much JAG lawyers can do for you.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  So, you know, you're there at a military base, and there are probably around there retired JAG lawyers, retired JAG judges, who are familiar with the military justice system, and can enable you to assert.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  Absolutely. Dr. Boyle, we're out of time. Thank you so much. And again, people can read online. There's a way with written orders to go up, just be polite about it.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  They got somebody saying, no, they're not going to be able to make you do it. Thank you, Dr. Boyle. Amazing interview.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex, again, by pesting you and your listening audience in these dire times that face us all.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  Absolutely. Back at you. We'll be right back.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  Well, now we are introducing something that is at the next level, multiple years in development. It is Brain Force Ultra. It is a liquid in a dropper, and it is twice as strong as Brain Force Plus, just in the natural caffeine department.

[3:05:55.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  I believe that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com. No cures or treatments there. Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.

[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman, host of this fourth hour, and I have another exciting show today, and we have two main feature stories.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  The first story is back to school tyranny when we'll follow up from last week looking at the dark side and we'll specifically be talking about Massachusetts. And secondly, we'll be talking about, do the world's governments have any proof that this virus even exists?
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  And today's guest is an expert on these topics and has been doing a lot of investigative work on them lately. And her name is Ramola Dee. And Ramola Dee is one of the most respected independent science and technology journalists that I know of in the all media space and has done a great service to humanity over the past 18 months in her reporting related to the COVID pandemic.
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Earlier in her career, she was on the faculty at the George Washington University teaching creative writing. She's also worked professionally as a technical writer in various industries and has written a lot of publications.
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  And sometime in the past pre COVID era, she became aware of some sinister plots against humanity such as geoengineering, also having difficulties with issues in the local school system and she began her career as an independent journalist, where she's done great work.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  So Ramola, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  Thank you so much for having me, Dr. Kaufman. I'm truly honored to be here with you, hosting it. And thank you for that great introduction.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  Well, it's my pleasure. And so last week I had Leila Centner, the owner of the Centner Academy in Miami, Florida, who told us about perhaps the world's only school that has zero COVID restrictions.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  And it was a really inspiring and heartwarming story to see how children can actually survive and thrive as they once did in our not so recent past.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  And today you want to tell us a little bit about a very contrary story of what's happening in Massachusetts as we go back to school. So Ramola, why don't you set us up with what's going on and how you came to be interested in the story.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  Okay, well, just a commentary on Leila Centner. I mean, she's doing a fabulous job in Florida and I wish more principals and schools would follow her example. It's absolutely brilliant.
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  Well, as you know, over here in Massachusetts, unfortunately, Dr. Kaufman, something very different is rolling out. And that is the Commissioner of Education.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  This is the Board of Elementary and Secondary School Education has issued an edict or a mandate or whatever one can call it, that every single K through 12 school is required to have its students mask up for eight hours a day, five days a week.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  Starting with the beginning of the school year, which is this week, you know, school starts this Thursday, literally tomorrow, actually, or two days from now.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  Right, Ramola, this is very similar to mandates that we're hearing from around the country, right, that are following last year's similar mandates.
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  And does this also, you know, include private schools in Massachusetts? And I know that you wrote very strongly that essentially that their plan is to turn the schools into field hospitals.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  So can you, you know, tell us a little bit about what distinguishes Massachusetts at the present time?
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  Oh, absolutely. Well, it seems to me just looking at what's going on, Dr. Kaufman, it's not just masking, you know, which of course they are doing.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  And I was just reading that they're planning to do the masking for a certain reason. And that reason is to ensure vaccination for the student body.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  And apparently right now between certain age groups, 15 and above, 16 and above, there's already in Massachusetts something like 68% vaccination, you know, among teenagers.
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  So they are trying to force through more vaccination on the student body, and they're trying to kind of predicate the masking on off ramping is what the commissioner is calling it.
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  So he's promising people that he will get the mask mandate off if a certain amount of vaccination can be achieved in the schools.
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  I see. So blackmail.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  Yeah, it sounds like blackmail. And then on top of that, they're going to be testing. So literally, and this is why I use the terminology that I used in my letter.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  And in my article that I wrote publishing my letter to the commissioner, Dr. Kaufman, I called it looking at what's happening. It seems to me they're trying to turn the schools into prison words, into hospital words, into policing zones,
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  because as soon as the kids get into school from the morning to the evening, they're going to be watched.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  And they're going to be watched for even one single symptom of the supposed famed professed, not proved to exist virus COVID-19.
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  If there's a child that blows their nose in class, they have to go to the school nurse for a full evaluation, correct?
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  That's correct. Exactly. So we're no longer allowed to have normal bodily functions without any scrutiny.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  Exactly. And Charlie Baker, as you point out rightly, is very much, you know, at the head of the show, certainly sort of hiding behind the scenes right now because they've kind of pushed the commissioner of education to the four.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  But of course, the government and the governor is behind all of this, right? It's sort of a state scheme. It's the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that's running this charade that unfortunately is being committed on the bodies and brains and the psyches of our children.
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  Because as you may know, Dr. Kaufman, there have been so many studies out showing how detrimental these masking mandates are both to the physical health of children and also to their psychological health, their psychological and mental well-being, right?
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  Absolutely. And in fact, I'm getting calls now this time of year, as I did last year, asking me to, you know, be an expert witness for cases where they're suing schools and school districts
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  on this matter because of my background in psychiatry. So I've actually researched this issue. And I think, aside from the combined turmoil leading to increased substance abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts,
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  where there's been a major increase among school-aged children, you know, we can't pinpoint those things to be caused by masks alone.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:57.000]  But certainly we know masks is a main contributing factor. But there are three areas in psychological realm that masks have a clear harm.
[3:16:57.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  The first is in language perception because children, as they're learning language, they need to read lips to distinguish certain types of sounds and inflections.
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  The second would be reading emotions because reading emotions in the facial expression requires looking at the mouth and the muscles around the mouth.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:29.000]  And there are specific emotions, in fact, that can't be recognized without that, such as actually discussed and joy, interestingly.
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  So you cannot see the joy or disgust on other people's faces when they're covered with a mask.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:47.000]  And then the third aspect really has to do with social development overall. And part of that is just being able to recognize and identify the, you know, the actual identity of the people that you're interacting with,
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  which can be a very big barrier. I mean, imagine meeting someone while their face is covered with a mask and then only knowing them, seeing them, right?
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:05.000]  Like, you don't really know who that person is. But aside from that, all of these limitations, of course, affect the socialization of children.
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  And this is really the root of all the turmoil and anguish we discussed.
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  So, Ramallah, we're about to hit a break here. But when we come back, I'd like to talk a little bit more about the action people are taking to fight against these mandates in Massachusetts.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  And perhaps there is some hope for our children in the future. So please stay tuned to the Alex Jones show and we'll be right back after these messages.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:56.000]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:14.000]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi free.
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:25.000]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:19:25.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:37.000]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products and they support the info. Thank you.
[3:19:37.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:20:00.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[3:20:00.000 --> 3:20:09.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:20:09.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:27.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:39.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the infowarstore hotline.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  Infowarstore.com is simply the best. Infowarstore.com beats out all the rest.
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the Infowarstore hotline.
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine is the Infowarstore hotline.
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  There are a lot of energy drinks and energy pills on the market and of course most of them work because if something doesn't work, people aren't going to reorder it.
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  But they have side effects, they have chemicals, they have dyes in them that hurt your brain and hurt your cells and hurt your body in the process and leave you burnt out and hung over.
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  Infowarstore Years has consulted top developers and top labs to bring you Brainforce Plus, to bring you Turboforce and other clean formulas that give you long sustained focused energy.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  So now we are introducing something that is at the next level, multiple years in development. It is Brainforce Ultra, it is a liquid in a dropper and it is twice as strong as Brainforce Plus just in the natural caffeine department.
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  It's got a bunch of other powerful herbs and compounds that will take your focus and your clarity to the next level with clean energy and it funds the Infowar exclusively available at Infowarstore.com.
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  Hello everyone, I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman and I came together with Dr. Tom Cowan today to tell you about our new conference, the True Healing Conference.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  This October 9th and 10th and we are super excited because we have this opportunity to focus on the new biology which is really the old biology with some new technological spins on it as well as talking about what truly results in healing.
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  We're going to be covering some really fascinating topics such as water and structured water, bio photons, biofield tuning, the holographic blood and live blood analysis and organ energy.
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  It's going to be really exciting, all these topics to help us understand the true nature of how our bodies work and how we can remain healthy and recover from disease.
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  There is a different way to think about biology, medicine, science than really most of us have ever imagined. These people who have been at the forefront of really what is a human being and what is life, how does biology work and that's the only way to go forward because that is what this whole COVID thing is all about.
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  We need a different way of seeing the world.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  We're talking about ushering in a new paradigm of biology and healing that we can be self-reliant, we can learn and we can actually be really healthy.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  Not chronically ill for our lives, but actually vital and truly alive as we're meant to be.
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  I am extremely excited about this conference. In the last 18 months I've learned more about biology, medicine and in some ways life and pretty much the rest of my life combined. I didn't expect that.
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  All right, Tom.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  All right, I'm very excited. Join us.
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  Hello everyone and welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  And today I have with me Ramola D, Independent Scientific and Technology Journalist and Editor and Publisher of the Everyday Concerned Citizen at concernedcitizen.net. Is that the right address, Ramola?
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  It's everydayconcerned.net.
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  Everydayconcerned.net. My apologies.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  No problem.
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  We're talking about the problems in the Massachusetts school mandates before the break. So why don't you pick us up where we left off, Ramola?
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  Okay. Well, you know, thank you for spelling out all of the dangers to wearing masks that children suffer from. You know, they're unable to see their friends' faces. They can't really determine what the teacher is saying.
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  They can't distinguish emotions, etc. Their reading abilities go down quite a bit. And you know, there are so many other dangers when you read these mass studies and you hear about large numbers of children complaining about feeling less happiness, less desire to go to school, less interest in studies, as well as inability to concentrate, headaches, irritability.
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  I think the German study that was released recently talked about almost 68 to 70% of kids talking about irritability and headaches.
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  That was actually a survey of a large number of students who actually had this requirement talking about their experience. So it's more real-world data within the last year and very, very significant and correlates pretty much with what we'd expect based on the primary research.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  So what about the other requirements? You know, you had mentioned that they're trying to turn this into some kind of hospital ward. They're going to be observing people in special rooms, and then do they have ability to, you know, take the children away without their parents' consent?
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  Well, here's what I heard about at their meeting at the Quincy Public Schools meeting last week, August 26, maybe more than a week at this point. But one of the things that they're planning to do is just monitor the children.
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  So the children are going to be constantly policed for even one symptom, whether it's blowing your nose or sneezing or coughing or whatever. And if they do show even one symptom, they're going to be asked to be tested.
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  Now, testing is a medical intervention. They can't do it without the parents' permission. So the parents are required to sign a form. And you know, this is becoming quite an issue of contention in families all across Massachusetts, you know, between husbands and wives, etc.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  One parent thinking, yeah, it's okay. And the other parent thinking, certainly not. This is child abuse. It's torture. Look at those torture swabs. I mean, I personally call them torture swabs, those long nasal swabs that they thrust up people's noses, you know?
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  Imagine doing this to a child. These are not benign tests. And you know, if you look in the literature, the only time that it's talked about where they use this procedure with really long swabs all the way to the back of the nasal cavity, the posterior wall, is for the purpose of delivering drugs to the brain directly.
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  Because there are branches of one of the cranial nerves there. So we don't know for sure if that's the case. But we do know from some aftermarket research done by Dr. Gotti in Italy that the many of the nasal swabs on the market actually contain nanometallic particles such as silicon and silver.
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:30.000]  And we don't know the purpose of these. But we do know that it's likely that they could go directly into the brain upon using these swabs to administer. The other significant thing is that these are not cotton swabs like a Q-tip that you might use to clean your ears at home.
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:49.000]  It actually has a stiff plastic fibers that are hooked similar to like a one-half of a velcro apparatus. And they are supposed to scrape the mucus membrane at the back of the nose. And, you know, their justification is that that provides a good sample.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  But with all this potential harm, we're talking about a diagnostic test that's never even undergone a basic validation study, which would be the first step required to even consider applying for FDA approval.
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:23.000]  So it's an experimental device. And, you know, even on the package, it says that it should not be used for diagnostic purposes. So we're talking about really imposing not just any healthcare procedure, but an experimental procedure that's invalid upon, you know, unsuspecting children.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:28.000]  So of course, this is, you know, a major point of contention, I would suspect.
[3:30:28.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  Absolutely. And potentially harmful, you know, because if it's going right up to the brain and depositing things over there, that is super scary. And which parent is going to say, that's okay.
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:48.000]  There are thousands of parents in Massachusetts who are really against these masks, against the testing. And those are not the only tests, by the way, it seems like they've got all sorts of new tests now.
[3:30:48.000 --> 3:31:07.000]  They've got antigen tests, and they're promoting something called pool testing. And the FDA has got whole pages on the website on this. And it's all about getting samples from both the teachers and the school children, mixing the stuff, doing some kind of testing on the mess.
[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  And at some universities like Syracuse University, they're actually proposing testing the sewage from the dormitory to see if there's any on the dormitory. Okay. So, you know, obviously this is unprecedented, a mass scale of biological surveillance that we have going on here.
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  And since it is such a huge financial windfall, I mean, we're talking about a billion dollar plus industry just for this experimental testing. And by the way, also, these testing has no liability, just like the therapeutic so-called genetic vaccines.
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:32:05.000]  So this is a windfall, and everyone who is capable, every company is capable of developing and marketing this technology wants to get in. So that's why you have all these different tests. There's essentially, you know, three strategies, the genetic or PCR strategy, the antibody strategy, and then the antigen, which is supposedly testing an actual piece of something.
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  But once again, none of these are validated and all are experimental. So we're about headed to our next break. But I think the main justification for all of these mandates is the presence of a virus.
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  So do any of the world's governments actually have the proof that this virus even exists? And if they don't, how can they possibly justify these policies? So we'll be right back with the answer to that.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:52.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:33:07.000]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter. You got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:33:07.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:26.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:29.000]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  Think about that because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening. But it is happening now.
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's out of vaccines and gene therapy and it doesn't really work. She got to take it every few months. And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID. And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies. Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  This new formula, drop for drop, is the strongest, probably out there period. Just on the caffeine scale, it's twice as strong as Brain Force Plus. And it's from natural high quality organic sources that it's got a bunch of other herbs known for deep clarity and long focus.
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  It is a game changer. It is Brain Force Ultra discounted out of the gates at infowarstore.com. I'll tell you what else is amazing about it. It funds the Info War and are fighting us to globalist a 360 win. Get your Brain Force Ultra right now at infowarstore.com and take your mind to the next level.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on it, for your mind.
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  Hello and welcome back to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show on September 8th, 2021. I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, and I have journalist, independent journalist here, Ramola Dee from the Everyday Concern Citizen at everydayconcern.net.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  And before the break, we were just starting to talk about, do the governments of the world actually have proof that this virus exists? And many of you know I've been one of the major proponents, highlighting that the scientific evidence actually does not show that there is a new virus that could possibly be causing this disease.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  And of course there is some contention because we have articles purporting to quote unquote isolate a new virus. However, we know that this is not really the technique to show there is a new organism in existence.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  So, what several people have done and Ramola Dee is one of the best examples here is to solicit the government about this and say what evidence do you have that this even exists.
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  So Ramola, tell us how you've gone about this and how you decided to take up this cause.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:29.000]  Absolutely. I'd be happy to. And first of all, thank you Dr. Kaufman for actually creating your statement of virus isolation and doing all the work that you've done to educate all of us regarding what virus isolation really is.
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  You know, what does it mean to get a purified isolate of a virus using Coke's postulates, using reverse postulates, which is sort of classic microbiology that all of you experts in microbiology and biology have at your fingertips.
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  So you've been able to educate us. So taking that knowledge and also being inspired by the example of particularly Patrick King, who as you know got something of a win in Alberta, Canada, when the provincial health officer over there has now withdrawn all of the
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  restrictions, mass mandates, whatever mandates they had going, primarily after something that cropped up in a lawsuit against the government from Patrick King, which I think he did that as a counter lawsuit after they sued him or something like that.
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  It has to do with.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  I can tell you it's this is in Alberta, Canada, and what Patrick King did is that he subpoenaed the Minister of Health for the province of Alberta.
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  And requested the material evidence to show the actual existence and causality of a virus and a disease, and they were, of course, unable to provide the evidence.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  And so behind the scenes, there were some policy changes that the timing matched up pretty well with.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  Exactly. And in fact, one of the points that he made was that, well, what exactly holds up your act? You've got the Alberta Health Act.
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  You've got all these COVID restrictions going. But what holds up this act? Where is this virus? And, you know, where is the isolate for the virus?
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  So looking at his language, I came up with the idea of asking the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, because I could tell that they were gearing up for mass mandates, and I was getting very worried.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  This was about a month ago.
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  So I put in at the beginning of August, I put in for a request to a few people.
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  One was the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, one was the Office of the Governor in Massachusetts, also the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services, that is the federal department.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  And I heard back from all of them at this point now, I have gotten all of the information from them and I have reported it.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  And I can tell you that what each one said, the Department of Health and Human Services referred me to the CDC.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  And I'll talk about the CDC in just a minute. The Office of the Governor wrote back first and they said, oh, no, we don't have any records that fall within the scope of your request.
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  And I had specifically asked for information on a purified isolate, OfficeRCOV2 slash COVID-19 virus, as well as an isolate of the Delta variant that provides the basis for all of the COVID mandates and guidances that are being issued from the Massachusetts government.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  Now, Ramon, let me interrupt you for one second because I can tell you that it was never even attempted to even do their corrupted isolation procedure, which really should be called a tissue culture of any variant.
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  So in other words, even though you can find published papers saying isolation of a novel coronavirus, which is not the correct procedure, but they still have at least done it.
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  They haven't even attempted that for any variant whatsoever. So you definitely can't find it. And it's also very important that people know there are no tests for any variants either.
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  So when you go get a test.
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  That's really, really interesting.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  Yes, it cannot distinguish or point out any possible variants because these are also made up constructs.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  That's huge information. I think that does need to be emphasized going forward that Dr. Kaufman, just from a journalistic point of view over here, because you know, think about that.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  Nobody is actually bothered to do a test to isolate this virus. Nobody's done it. No one anywhere, not the CDC, not the WHO, not any single Department of Public Health, no university, nobody whatsoever.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  And that, by the way, is what Christine Massey proved right when she and her team wrote to several departments of health all around the world and they found out that there is no isolate.
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  Frances Leader did the same thing she wrote to the MHRA and she found out they don't have a virus in the vaccine.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  They've got some kind of synthesized genomic sequence that sounds absolutely fabricated.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  That's exactly right. So I'd like to bring up, you know, two things. One is that, you know, the language that you use to make these requests is very important because, and I want to also refer people to my website for the
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  Soviet statement that you mentioned, the statement on virus isolation, because it lays this out in very clear language that anyone can understand.
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  But we're talking about, you know, purifying or isolating the virus directly from its source in nature, which would be a sick person.
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  And Torsten Engelbrecht, the journalist who wrote the book, Virus Mania, he actually emailed the authors of the main papers where they claimed to isolate the virus and asked them, was it purified?
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  And all of them replied in writing that it was either not purified or they didn't even attempt to purify it at any stage, whether directly from a sick person or even after the cell culture.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  And this is documented, by the way, in an article called PCR Tests Are Scientifically Meaningless that is an off-guardian.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  And then I'm so glad that you mentioned Christine Massey because we can't really talk about this issue without bringing Christine up because she has been the world's leading person submitting FOIA requests to governments,
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:44:02.000]  universities, and other agencies around the world. And she's amassed a huge database, I think, at this point. And not one government, agency, or university has been able to show any conclusive proof that this virus really exists.
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  Absolutely. I think her work has been absolutely seminal and critical to this discussion. And in fact, when the CDC wrote back to me, so let me just continue the story over here.
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  So the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, by the way, said they have no responsive records, no responsive documents, and they gave me information on appealing it.
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  Well, I'm not interested in appealing it. I just want the information, obviously. So look, I looked at the CDC. The CDC wrote back a slightly longer letter and what they said was, and this is really interesting,
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  they said the COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And the SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected by the PCR test. And then they sent me links to a couple of articles.
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:45:01.000]  And, you know, these articles, again, talk about the detection of the virus. They had micrographs of somebody's lung tissue, diseased lung tissue.
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:06.000]  But that doesn't talk about an isolate of the virus, you know, to a layperson.
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:23.000]  And in fact, we saw in an article last summer that the same exact images were shown on microscopic slides from kidney biopsies taken before the COVID pandemic even existed. So these images really are meaningless as well.
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:33.000]  Absolutely. And yes, Gary Muller says, indeed, said that, that you can, with a PCR test, you over-amplified enough, you'll find almost anything, right? And that seems to be the case.
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  So the other link that the CDC sent me to was something to do with genomic sequences, you know, a whole database of genomic sequences.
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  And so they're basically suggesting that, look, we've got the genomic sequence of the virus. The virus exists. We're detecting it with this test.
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  And that was the point at which I wrote to you and to a bunch of other doctors. And some of you wrote back and, you know, referred me to your work to the Statement of Viruses Isolation,
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  explained to me how, indeed, mainstream science is considering what a virus is by simply taking a mass of sputum for various people, mixing it with some V-Rose cells, some monkey kidney cells,
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  and then taking a photograph of it or pulling some genomic sequences out of it and calling it a specific virus.
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  So this doesn't make sense to any of us. You know, just common sense. This doesn't sound like an isolate of anything whatsoever.
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  Talking about shadows and partial fingerprints, you know, in the sand and things like that, and they're essentially saying that amounts to an actual thing,
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  where when it's only a rumor of a possible thing.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  Exactly. And well, Dr. Young referred me at this point to Christine Massey's work and, you know, to the language that she used when she asked for a purified isolate.
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:53.000]  And, you know, he talked about the whole methodology of maceration, centrifuging, etc., to get this isolate.
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:47:01.000]  So I took that language and I wrote back to the CDC with this new language. I said, look, a medical microbiologist has helped me clarify my query.
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:03.000]  Here it is. And here's what I'm looking for.
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  Can you bottom line it for us, Ramola? Because, you know, we have, is there any proof out there? Does anyone have any proof?
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  No, the CDC was unable to respond to this.
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  So thank you so much for coming on today and enriching us with all this information.
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  And please don't forget to sign up for the True Healing Conference at True Healing Conference.
