[08:06.080 --> 08:13.360]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[08:13.360 --> 08:23.160]  alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[08:23.160 --> 08:40.240]  within days of Barack Obama being sworn in back in January of this year his
[08:40.240 --> 08:49.360]  surrogates Axel Rodd his chief of staff and others Rahm Emanuel began to come
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.760]  out and say well the president never really said he wouldn't raise taxes on
[08:54.760 --> 09:01.880]  the middle class and of course there are hundreds and hundreds of clips
[09:01.880 --> 09:06.640]  hundreds of clips I mean he pledged sometimes five six seven eight nine
[09:06.640 --> 09:12.040]  ten eleven twelve I mean sometimes he gave dozens of speeches a day and it was
[09:12.040 --> 09:18.320]  a standard line that I pledge I promise you no new taxes unless you make two
[09:18.320 --> 09:22.880]  hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year of course that was a deception as
[09:22.880 --> 09:26.920]  well he made it sound like an individual it was a couple so one hundred and
[09:26.920 --> 09:32.200]  twenty five thousand dollars a year then after they pay taxes somebody make a
[09:32.200 --> 09:37.640]  hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year is really making seventy five
[09:37.640 --> 09:43.480]  eighty thousand dollars a year so what he meant was I promise no new taxes on
[09:43.480 --> 09:50.560]  anybody eighty thousand dollars a year more well now guess what I have the
[09:50.560 --> 09:55.600]  Associated Press I have Reuters I have all these mainstream news articles and
[09:55.600 --> 10:01.080]  video clips of his surrogates all over TV now not just saying oh we never
[10:01.080 --> 10:06.760]  promised to not raise your taxes they're now saying we have to and we're going to
[10:06.760 --> 10:15.760]  and now I'm noticing that Democratic Party surrogates news sites and websites
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.720]  are attacking anyone as a conspiracy theorist I actually have articles in my
[10:20.720 --> 10:26.800]  stack if you come out and say he's a liar they go he never promised he never
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.520]  and I guess the public's gonna go yeah he never promised raise our taxes I mean
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.280]  is there no end to the lying and some of people say well lying is just what we're
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.840]  supposed to expect from government well if you have the attitude that's just the
[10:45.840 --> 10:54.920]  way it is if people just accept the idea that that's the way it is and
[10:54.920 --> 10:58.880]  government lies then that's capitulation to corruption and then it's just over
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.400]  the sky's the limit it's a bottomless pit of corruption it's over and that is
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.360]  the reason the society is getting so corrupt and so bad is that even if
[11:08.360 --> 11:11.600]  people are angry about the system and angry about the government angry about
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.480]  the offshore corporations openly looting us of twenty three point seven
[11:15.480 --> 11:21.560]  trillion in the last ten months in a bipartisan criminal operation a
[11:21.560 --> 11:31.640]  coordinated concerted bipartisan gang raping a heist even if people are angry
[11:31.640 --> 11:37.040]  about it they're hopeless and don't believe that they can affect any change
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.240]  they have no respect for themselves you know the big secret is you have
[11:42.240 --> 11:49.120]  incredible power you could change the destiny of the world all of you doing
[11:49.120 --> 11:53.000]  small things together every day in different ways will bring down the new
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  world order just as assuredly as the sun came up this morning and it's just as
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.800]  assuredly as it's going to set this evening
[12:06.880 --> 12:12.040]  but we have to be careful we can't just attack Barack Obama and make it all
[12:12.040 --> 12:21.760]  about him even though it's fun to see a fraud and an inflated lie being being
[12:21.760 --> 12:28.720]  brought down to size at a primitive level it feels good to count coup on the
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.520]  president to go up in dissing and to go up and feel like we're having a victory
[12:33.520 --> 12:39.400]  as his approval rating goes from 84 points now in many polls to 45 he's
[12:39.400 --> 12:44.200]  dropping several points per week right now a week and a half ago he was 49
[12:44.200 --> 12:56.320]  points he is dropping like a lead weight no one has ever deflated this fast but
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.920]  if we make it all about Obama and make all the lying about Obama and if we
[13:00.920 --> 13:06.480]  blame him for everything the globalist have won they love hanging a George Bush
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.520]  out there to dry to take all the blame they love hanging a Bill Clinton out
[13:10.520 --> 13:14.200]  there to take all the blame they love shoving a Barack Obama out there
[13:14.200 --> 13:21.040]  fooling everybody they get maybe six eight nine ten months max a year to push
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.520]  their agenda through while the public still pacified and dumbfounded and kind
[13:25.520 --> 13:31.520]  of punch drunk distracted by him that's all he's there for he's there to get
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.560]  their agenda through another big step and then he's there to take the blame
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.360]  for the deceit and the lies and the betrayals to further demoralize the
[13:41.360 --> 13:46.680]  people to feel like no matter what they do the politicians always betray us so
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.760]  the population psychologically gives in and capitulates and has their spirit
[13:51.760 --> 13:59.000]  broken and there's the added goodie of Obama that then he gets to create all
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.960]  this race division because there are a bunch of people who tied their egos
[14:02.960 --> 14:08.720]  into Obama and so no matter what he does no matter how many lies he tells no
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.440]  matter how many betrayals he engages in they don't care they are going to
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.760]  support him to the end and they are going to get an even more infantile
[14:18.760 --> 14:27.400]  psychological mindset of just bleeding like a bunch of sheep instead of going
[14:27.400 --> 14:39.440]  Obama Obama Obama instead of doing that over and over again they go
[14:39.440 --> 14:51.480]  and the media plays into that they say yes anyone that doesn't like Obama is
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.200]  a racist he's being criticized why is Obama's approval rating dropping
[14:57.200 --> 15:05.680]  well it's racism to the globalist are all about dashing hopes for a few short
[15:05.680 --> 15:13.440]  minutes the downtrodden the insecure people in the minority community and
[15:13.440 --> 15:18.560]  the insecure guilt-ridden white yuppies they get to feel like oh we have a
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.440]  moment of brotherhood and kenship and hugging but then Obama begins to
[15:23.440 --> 15:27.840]  betray all his promises and people entrench themselves and defend him
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.480]  because they don't want the dream to be a fraud they don't want it to be a lie
[15:33.480 --> 15:40.360]  it's like some old woman who's insecure and but who had a wealthy husband who
[15:40.360 --> 15:47.000]  died the young kashanova comes into town and romances her and rubs her feet and
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.080]  drinks tea with her and dances and makes love to her why she's 60 years old and
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.480]  100 pounds overweight but he loves her and her son and daughters come to her
[15:57.480 --> 16:03.880]  and say mom he's a con artist he just wants your money he's a slick talker
[16:03.880 --> 16:09.280]  he's a long-legged mac daddy mom he just wants you to marry him so he can take
[16:09.280 --> 16:15.280]  everything you've got and she says I that said I'm disowning you your liars
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.640]  and the con artist curls up next to her and says that's right they're just
[16:20.640 --> 16:28.200]  jealous of our love they just want your money and she banishes her son and
[16:28.200 --> 16:36.680]  daughter even though they're successful professionals and don't want her money
[16:36.680 --> 16:43.480]  they're just upset looking at this con artist you know this 30-year-old smooth
[16:43.480 --> 16:51.640]  talking oily voice silver-tongued scammer and then he takes her he divorces
[16:51.640 --> 16:57.520]  her and then he even sets her up and tells the police that you know she's
[16:57.520 --> 17:00.400]  doing things that are criminals so he can lock her out of the house and then
[17:00.400 --> 17:05.000]  he isn't enough to get half of everything he sells the silverware and he he
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.880]  moves in his his boyfriend oh it turns out he didn't like women you know I'm
[17:13.880 --> 17:16.760]  telling you a true story I happen to know about with some people I know but
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.920]  I've seen that story over and over again you all know that story but as she cries
[17:21.920 --> 17:27.280]  and loses everything she still has a picture of him and won't admit he
[17:27.280 --> 17:35.280]  conned her and that's the American people on one side the Bush supporters
[17:35.280 --> 17:39.280]  won't admit they got conned the Obama supporters won't admit they got conned
[17:39.280 --> 17:45.480]  but they will hate each other and in that the system controls them in that
[17:45.480 --> 17:51.160]  the system is able to dominate and continue on but if we point out to the
[17:51.160 --> 18:00.160]  disenfranchised unhappy defeated American people and say look we know you're
[18:00.160 --> 18:05.080]  angry no we know that you feel like there's no hope but don't just blame
[18:05.080 --> 18:10.520]  Obama don't just blame Bush they're just the frontman let's blame the private
[18:10.520 --> 18:15.200]  Federal Reserve David Rockefeller let's blame Lord Rothschild let's blame the
[18:15.200 --> 18:21.320]  Saxe-Coburg gothers let's blame the Barothamans let's blame the less than a
[18:21.320 --> 18:28.040]  hundred families less than 20 big families who own and run the world and
[18:28.040 --> 18:32.640]  are experts at creating monopolies as John D Rockefeller the first said
[18:32.640 --> 18:37.720]  competitions of sin they want the carbon tax to bring in neo feudalism and
[18:37.720 --> 18:42.160]  serfdom they want a micromanage instead of a police state they want to protect
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.080]  their ill-gotten gains and consolidate their gains and neutralize the middle
[18:46.080 --> 18:51.240]  class because that is their ancient enemy from which independent free
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.560]  people rise that don't want to be slaves they want you totally broken
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.920]  financially buying into one of their cultures of death one of their media
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.400]  cultures they put out a whole bunch of different flavors of Kool-Aid and they
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.760]  want you to obsess on the political bread and circus of Republican and
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.240]  Democrat instead of going look let's not make a cult out of bashing Obama or
[19:16.240 --> 19:20.600]  bashing Bush or the next Republican let's create a real political movement of
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.400]  populism to unseat the shadow government and the corrupt eugenicist
[19:25.400 --> 19:30.320]  elite and if you give that message to the military and the police and the FBI
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.440]  and the bureaucrats they know the truth they've seen enough of it they
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.400]  understand that it's what's happening is bad for them in the long run they will
[19:38.400 --> 19:46.020]  join us and we can get the Republic back but yes Obama is gonna jack up scores of
[19:46.020 --> 19:50.880]  new taxes on everybody he's already doing it and now the truth is coming out
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.080]  but we've got to be there to make sure the fake right-wingers don't capture

[21:21.080 --> 21:25.760]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[21:25.760 --> 21:29.920]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[21:29.920 --> 21:35.160]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[21:35.160 --> 21:40.080]  that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[23:07.640 --> 23:10.400]  here's the story the current administration is committed to
[23:10.400 --> 23:14.120]  nationalizing healthcare giving 40 million new people free care now here's
[23:14.120 --> 23:17.440]  the bad news the current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by
[23:17.440 --> 23:21.200]  these new demands for free services and procedures Medicare and Medicaid are
[23:21.200 --> 23:24.800]  already bankrupt many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by
[23:24.800 --> 23:28.760]  the prospective force procedures all this is creating a perfect storm which
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.960]  could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services folks it's time
[23:32.960 --> 23:36.320]  to be prepared for the worst our friends at solutions from science have
[23:36.320 --> 23:39.840]  recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how
[23:39.840 --> 23:43.600]  you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home it's
[23:43.600 --> 23:47.600]  called herbal preparations and natural therapies and it's flat out the best
[23:47.600 --> 23:51.240]  course of its kind I recommend you visit this important new website at make
[23:51.240 --> 23:55.200]  herbal medicines dot com that's make herbal medicines dot com or call toll
[23:55.200 --> 24:00.720]  free 877-327-0365
[24:00.720 --> 24:15.080]  you can run on for a long time
[24:15.080 --> 24:20.480]  run on for a long time run on for a long time
[24:20.480 --> 24:26.600]  sooner or later gotta cut you down it's a psychological game they set out the two
[24:26.600 --> 24:30.200]  political parties in front of us the same thing in England same thing in the
[24:30.200 --> 24:33.200]  different countries of Europe you'll have two dominant parties a few sub
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.400]  parties they fight with each other overpower so there is a real fight going
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.440]  on but they're bought and paid for by the very same private interest and as
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.880]  long as we don't go after the special interest as long as we don't discuss the
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.840]  scientific dictatorship that the globalists openly write giant white
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.840]  papers and textbooks on then everything else is a joke you know talking about did
[24:58.840 --> 25:03.800]  the butler kill Michael Jackson did one of his assistants poison him did the
[25:03.800 --> 25:10.520]  doctor do it that might be interesting at a tabloid level but it doesn't matter
[25:10.520 --> 25:18.160]  to you and your family you know I talked to the police I talked to FBI when I
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.720]  run into them and I warned them I say you know they're really putting poison in
[25:22.720 --> 25:25.440]  your water can I give you a government document they're like no no I don't want
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.120]  to see it they start smiling and I go listen this isn't a game okay just
[25:30.120 --> 25:36.000]  because you were preconditioned and it wasn't going on it is it isn't a game
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.040]  it's real just because you laugh about it doesn't mean it's not true it's because
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.600]  you laugh about Dinecore and Halliburton caught running giant child kidnapping
[25:45.600 --> 25:54.080]  rings it's real Chicago Tribune Associated Press BBC you know the army has
[25:54.080 --> 26:00.160]  set up civilian inmate labor camps all over the United States publicly but how
[26:00.160 --> 26:06.480]  does the media debunk it then they go out and find the kooks the loons the
[26:06.480 --> 26:10.400]  disinformation agents for whatever reason that are putting out wrong
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.760]  information and they focus on them and say look we wanted to see a FEMA camps
[26:14.760 --> 26:20.480]  for real so we looked in this guy's backyard under a toadstool and didn't
[26:20.480 --> 26:26.840]  find one so there it means that'd be like I'm 200 miles away from the Texas
[26:26.840 --> 26:36.880]  coast where I sit roughly okay let's be technical 170 miles I'm a hundred and
[26:36.880 --> 26:42.840]  70 miles from the Texas coast where I sit in Austin Texas and it'd be like if
[26:42.840 --> 26:48.040]  I was Glenn Beck or CNN or some other being a big show that have debunked FEMA
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.920]  camps it'd be like tonight we're gonna investigate and see if the Gulf of
[26:52.920 --> 27:01.920]  Mexico exist and then I walked out front my office and said well we don't see a
[27:01.920 --> 27:07.520]  Gulf of Mexico and then I went and showed some kooks saying but Billy Bob
[27:07.520 --> 27:12.400]  here says the Gulf of Mexico does exist in the Texas shell country we're gonna
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.160]  see if Billy Bob's right and so I drive out to Fredericksburg and I get up on a
[27:16.160 --> 27:21.200]  mountaintop and I look out over the hills and mountains and I say no I don't
[27:21.200 --> 27:29.680]  see an ocean that's a strong man argument there is a Gulf of Mexico I will
[27:29.680 --> 27:37.840]  assure you 175 miles from where I sit south of me it's there and it connects
[27:37.840 --> 27:45.000]  to the Caribbean Sea and Cuba's out there and Roa tans out there and
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.200]  Cozumel's out there and Jamaica's out there and a lot of other gorgeous places
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.640]  are out there and there's a lot of ships and a lot of boats and a lot of fish and
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.400]  a lot of sharks and a lot of whales you know there's sperm whales in the
[27:59.400 --> 28:07.000]  Caribbean a couple other species I'll assure you I mean here's another strong
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.040]  man we're gonna see if whales exist and then you don't go out and see if whales
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.560]  exist you go out and find some cook that says whales are swimming in the Great
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.280]  Lakes well you're gonna find out they're not but that doesn't mean that whales
[28:22.280 --> 28:28.720]  don't exist because whales aren't in Lake Travis outside Austin Texas you know
[28:28.720 --> 28:33.800]  if I can find a cook to say that great white sharks are in Lake Travis or salt
[28:33.800 --> 28:38.240]  water crocodiles are in Lake Travis that doesn't mean just because they're not
[28:38.240 --> 28:42.600]  saltwater crocodiles or great white sharks in Lake Travis just because
[28:42.600 --> 28:46.840]  there's just because that's a lie doesn't then mean that salt water
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.720]  crocodiles and great white sharks don't exist you understand this fundamental
[28:51.720 --> 28:58.480]  childlike device they use against us but because the public are brought up on
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.720]  entertainment and never having responsibility in culture you may have a
[29:03.720 --> 29:08.560]  responsibility to change the grease traps at the hamburger place but people
[29:08.560 --> 29:12.240]  don't have a responsibility to know how the government works to know how
[29:12.240 --> 29:17.120]  society operates and to know how the ruling elite operate I mean even if
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.240]  you're some self-serving yuppie knowing how this system works can make you a
[29:21.240 --> 29:25.720]  lot of money in the stock market and a lot of money in business the globalists
[29:25.720 --> 29:29.840]  pay a lot of money just to have think tanks that do the type of work we do
[29:29.840 --> 29:36.800]  here for them we do this for you now when we come back there's been big new
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.760]  femacant developments in plain view they're gearing up with a giant workforce
[29:41.760 --> 29:50.840]  of National Guard femacant workers now this is real we're about to come we're

[30:11.880 --> 30:15.920]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[30:15.920 --> 30:19.280]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.280 --> 30:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.600 --> 30:26.920]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[30:26.920 --> 30:30.920]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every

[34:00.280 --> 34:04.640]  against the globalist in fact each one of those sites alone will be the biggest
[34:04.640 --> 34:09.520]  alternative anti-new world order site so we have the two biggest very very proud
[34:09.520 --> 34:12.880]  of that and the success we've had in all of you spreading the word about

[34:17.640 --> 34:22.480]  the biggest sites but we happen to have the two biggest info wars dot com is
[34:22.480 --> 34:29.120]  number one present planet dot com is number two and they're both rising in
[34:29.120 --> 34:37.280]  all the major rating systems and services because our track record is
[34:37.280 --> 34:41.280]  unfortunately very accurate I wish I was wrong I wish we were reversing this
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.920]  situation but we're very dangerous to the system because we accurately
[34:46.920 --> 34:52.280]  forecast and foretold their battle plans and operations because we actually
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.080]  go off their white papers and the enemy's past activities in other
[34:56.080 --> 35:01.760]  countries and so we know exactly what they're going to do we just don't know
[35:01.760 --> 35:06.560]  exactly when they're going to do it we know their battle plans we know their
[35:06.560 --> 35:14.000]  tricks we know what's in their bag of tricks the question is what card are

[37:52.080 --> 37:58.520]  want to get to your calls also coming up we have a video up on info wars dot
[37:58.520 --> 38:04.840]  com the TSA is proposing making all airport workers take implantable
[38:04.840 --> 38:15.280]  microchips this is mainstream CBS news reporting this out of San Antonio also a
[38:15.280 --> 38:22.840]  NBC out of San Antonio is also reporting this I told you this is how it works they
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.880]  always oppress the oppressors first that's why they're making cops take
[38:27.880 --> 38:32.080]  GPS in their cars and bus drivers and people like that because if the
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.760]  government has to be oppressed and and and surveilled and treated as if they're
[38:35.760 --> 38:44.960]  guilty until proven innocent or just flat guilty then why not make us live in a
[38:44.960 --> 38:52.240]  system of guilty until proven innocent and I told you my cousin's been in the
[38:52.240 --> 38:58.280]  military I know it's got to be more than 20 years now but back in like 2004 was
[38:58.280 --> 39:04.240]  2004 he shows up my house and he says someone come over and have coffee with
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.960]  you and he comes over and he apologizes and says I'd made funny at family
[39:08.960 --> 39:13.640]  reunions and stuff saying they plan to make us all take chips they called all
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.480]  the officers into a secret meeting over a hundred of us and said in the next
[39:17.480 --> 39:22.640]  couple years get ready we're all gonna have implantable microchips and I said
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.440]  well that's probably a Psyop just to acclimate you for when they do do it as
[39:27.440 --> 39:30.920]  some type of proof that you've had your medical vaccines during some type of
[39:30.920 --> 39:34.760]  stage pandemic because I've studied things that's the only way they're
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.920]  gonna be able to really get this is through the bioscare fear and he said
[39:39.920 --> 39:45.680]  well okay now since then I've seen him at 4th of July and things and he won't
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.720]  really talk to me about it he's a lot nicer to me than he used to be and has a
[39:50.720 --> 39:54.480]  sad look on his face when I bring stuff up to him but he says I'm not gonna talk
[39:54.480 --> 40:00.240]  about it so he he now knows everything that's going on ladies and gentlemen
[40:00.240 --> 40:04.280]  they are telling the military they're getting chips and they have ordered some
[40:04.280 --> 40:09.600]  special forces as of six years ago that I know of to take it and we know the
[40:09.600 --> 40:13.560]  Mexican Attorney General has made his employees take it and some other third
[40:13.560 --> 40:19.680]  world countries have done it this is really happening and so Tommy Thompson
[40:19.680 --> 40:22.920]  head of health and human services gave speeches at hundreds of high schools and
[40:22.920 --> 40:28.480]  colleges while he was held the human services secretary criminally on the
[40:28.480 --> 40:32.920]  payroll of applied digital solutions I mean that's totally illegal on the payroll
[40:32.920 --> 40:37.800]  while he's held the human services had seeing every child needs a chip and see
[40:37.800 --> 40:43.240]  as authority figures they're meant to just come out and say this openly to
[40:43.240 --> 40:47.480]  acclimate everyone even though people won't accept it at first and they're
[40:47.480 --> 40:52.080]  seen as weird when they say it and shocking they're just meant to parrot it
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.740]  and say it take a microchip take a microchip take a microchip for your
[40:55.740 --> 40:58.680]  safety for your safety for your safety move you're not a terrorist
[40:58.680 --> 41:02.940]  think you're not a terrorist proof you're not a terrorist microchip microchip
[41:02.940 --> 41:07.200]  microchip take a microchip take a microchip take a microchip point
[41:07.200 --> 41:10.880]  your safety on your safety for your safety they should give it to all
[41:10.880 --> 41:13.620]  friend patients we should give us all summer patients we should give it to
[41:13.620 --> 41:16.600]  all summer patients we should give it to criminals we should give it to criminals
[41:16.600 --> 41:19.980]  we should give it to criminals we should give it to children we should give it
[41:19.980 --> 41:25.100]  children, don't let them get kidnapped. Don't let them get kidnapped. They just parrot that
[41:25.100 --> 41:32.780]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again until the public
[41:32.780 --> 41:37.480]  just gets sick of hearing about it and totally acclimated. I mean, they are scientifically
[41:37.480 --> 41:42.820]  bombarding you in the Army document, the classified back in early 2000 admitted that
[41:42.820 --> 41:52.900]  they were just going to acclimate in the name of security and in the name of fashion
[41:52.900 --> 42:00.100]  in the name of class in the name of elitism. And what do you see the finest bars in Miami
[42:00.100 --> 42:07.840]  and in London where basically they have the equivalent of bimbos hookers and you pay thousands
[42:07.840 --> 42:12.420]  of dollars have a membership to be able to get up into the VIP area and then you get
[42:12.420 --> 42:16.780]  the girls numbers and then it's wink, wink, you know, the pimps just get the money for
[42:16.780 --> 42:22.580]  you to be a member and then you get to have the girls. That's kind of how these modern
[42:22.580 --> 42:28.300]  kind of legal whorehouses work. But to get into the really good whores, you got to have
[42:28.300 --> 42:34.140]  a chip and it's already happened. Just Google nightclub makes patrons take chip and to get
[42:34.140 --> 42:39.420]  into the area with the young 18 year old girls that are ready to roll, you got to take the
[42:39.420 --> 42:46.180]  chip and these guys go and they take it because they are going after that hot little number
[42:46.180 --> 42:57.100]  or chasing that chasing that lovely lady. Now, is that nuts devilish? So they just parrot
[42:57.100 --> 43:02.620]  it over and over again. And then also, you know, 10 years ago, we come out and say, we
[43:02.620 --> 43:06.660]  don't want the chip. There's this plan to do it. And they'd say, doesn't exist, doesn't
[43:06.660 --> 43:11.140]  exist, doesn't exist, doesn't exist. He's crazy. He's going to parrot that. And then
[43:11.140 --> 43:17.660]  now yeah, it exists for your safety and Reuters headlines, prisoners in California to get chips
[43:17.660 --> 43:22.700]  and then everybody gets mad and lawsuits get filed. And so they withdraw it. But then now
[43:22.700 --> 43:33.260]  in some third world countries like Guatemala, they are chipping prisoners. See, it has begun.
[43:33.260 --> 43:38.300]  Now it's the same thing on FEMA camps. When Glenn back a month and a half before he did
[43:38.300 --> 43:42.620]  his debunking said, I believe FEMA camps are real. We're going to expose it. And then every
[43:42.620 --> 43:48.980]  other night hyped it. I said that he was going to debunk it. And I said how he was going
[43:48.980 --> 43:54.220]  to debunk it. And I even made the call of that he would go up and show the Illinois train
[43:54.220 --> 44:02.540]  station and he did exactly as I said he would because we've debunked that. We know they
[44:02.540 --> 44:08.980]  monitor everything we do. I've talked to some of his producers. They admit it to me. Some
[44:08.980 --> 44:13.380]  of the Fox folks are fans and they're like, Oh yeah, they're listening right now. Want
[44:13.380 --> 44:18.700]  to say hi to the folks at Fox is they need to act like me just enough to make sure we
[44:18.700 --> 44:24.820]  don't revolutionize and shift the paradigm into liberty and freedom and constitutionalism,
[44:24.820 --> 44:29.820]  not fake republicanism as the false counter they're building up to Obama where they're
[44:29.820 --> 44:33.860]  going to screw us again. See, they're out of power now so they can act like they're
[44:33.860 --> 44:41.100]  anti new world order. And I'm not bragging. I'm trying to explain people. I know their
[44:41.100 --> 44:46.980]  game plan. This is all I do. I have dreams at night about this 24 hours a day. I'm on
[44:46.980 --> 45:00.020]  the job. Essentially no 24 seven, seven day work week. I'm here because I know we have
[45:00.020 --> 45:04.020]  a good chance of beating these people and the payoff of liberty and freedom. Our future
[45:04.020 --> 45:10.340]  generations is incalculable. It's worth everything. It's worth our lives. And so I'm putting it
[45:10.340 --> 45:18.900]  on the line and really deeply studying, deeply studying all their different operations. And
[45:18.900 --> 45:22.220]  one cannot really be told about it. One has to start learning about it, get into this
[45:22.220 --> 45:26.820]  information, start researching and then you'll end up knowing what I know. A lot of you do.
[45:26.820 --> 45:30.620]  A lot of you know more than I know in many aspects in different areas that you specialize
[45:30.620 --> 45:35.420]  in studying and you help boost the level of knowledge and info and the establishments
[45:35.420 --> 45:40.580]  disinfo and honeypots and planning disinfo and dissension in our ranks. It isn't working
[45:40.580 --> 45:47.060]  anymore as we pull away from all that and as we develop really immunities to it or resistance
[45:47.060 --> 45:56.900]  to it. Now on the subject of FEMA camps, they come out and they do the straw man. We sent
[45:56.900 --> 46:02.660]  to Glenn Beck in the weeks before packets, registered mail to Fox and we emailed him
[46:02.660 --> 46:07.140]  and I told listeners emailing by the millions, millions of listeners. I'm sure thousands
[46:07.140 --> 46:11.340]  of you did what I asked. We get out his email and we said, send him the civilian inmate
[46:11.340 --> 46:17.020]  labor camp program. Send him these video clips of Congress testifying about the FEMA
[46:17.020 --> 46:22.620]  camps for internment of citizens. Send him the Miami Herald. Send him the Houston Chronicle.
[46:22.620 --> 46:28.300]  Send him the Wall Street Journal. Send him the New York Times. Send him thousands and
[46:28.300 --> 46:42.820]  thousands of documents but he didn't do it. He covered it and said it didn't exist. Now
[46:42.820 --> 46:49.380]  this is 31 E internment resettlement specialist for the National Guard and in the last five
[46:49.380 --> 46:55.460]  years they've trained large portions of the army in military police actions. They've trained
[46:55.460 --> 47:01.460]  the regular army in this. They've never done this before. They admit they've set up FEMA
[47:01.460 --> 47:07.700]  camps. They admit they're preparing and top off exercises and NLE09, four mass roundups,
[47:07.700 --> 47:14.980]  mass arrest, mass force inoculations, CNN, Fox. They all admit the White House admits
[47:14.980 --> 47:19.380]  they're preparing to lock down cities, force inoculations and if we expose what they're
[47:19.380 --> 47:39.220]  doing and show this game plan, they may back off and stop. If we do that and people are
[47:39.220 --> 47:44.260]  and so then their PSYOP will be because they always apply pressure. We resist. They partially
[47:44.260 --> 47:49.780]  back off. Then they apply pressure again. We resist. They back off again but after four
[47:49.780 --> 47:56.860]  or five exercises of the cycles, you've got a constriction of more than 50% of our liberties.
[47:56.860 --> 48:01.420]  There's not much more to give so it gets harder for them as they pressurize our freedom to
[48:01.420 --> 48:09.460]  crush out those last embers of flame. But their wet blanket is the staged flu pandemic.
[48:09.460 --> 48:13.860]  That's the hysteria. That's the fear. I mean they can't just even nuke a city or blow up
[48:13.860 --> 48:17.380]  some more buildings and say, we've got to put you in FEMA camps. You've got to take
[48:17.380 --> 48:21.660]  your liberties. We've got to set up checkpoints and have political police and have everybody
[48:21.660 --> 48:25.860]  categorize as different types of travelers as they're now announcing. Everybody gets
[48:25.860 --> 48:31.520]  a designation now, even if you have no criminal record. They've got to have something where
[48:31.520 --> 48:38.500]  everyone's suspect and that is microbes, the flu. That's their perfect pretext. That's
[48:38.500 --> 48:43.580]  how Hitler actually locked down different minority groups was saying they spread disease and
[48:43.580 --> 48:48.300]  that I have all these German propaganda war films where it showed their political enemies
[48:48.300 --> 48:55.660]  as rats and as fleas and saying they spread disease. See, it's the same system. And so
[48:55.660 --> 49:01.180]  they want to hire tens of thousands of 31 ease internment resettlement specialists and
[49:01.180 --> 49:08.740]  this is all part of the civilian inmate labor camp program from 86 to 97. It was secret
[49:08.740 --> 49:14.860]  12 locations with us citizens on them. There have been operating since the 80s. They declassified
[49:14.860 --> 49:20.900]  them in 97 internment resettlement specialist in the army are primarily responsible for
[49:20.900 --> 49:26.700]  day to day operations in a military confinement correctional facility or detention internment
[49:26.700 --> 49:32.380]  facility. Did you hear that? See, this is homeland security is the receivership arm
[49:32.380 --> 49:37.620]  to break the back of the country, bring in the police state and set the precedent and
[49:37.620 --> 49:40.300]  they'll have the camps. The camps are going to help people. The camps are going to help
[49:40.300 --> 49:45.220]  the homeless. The camps are going to have Sunday night movies. The camps are going to
[49:45.220 --> 49:50.020]  have rock stars come and play for them. And then that will set the precedent that America
[49:50.020 --> 49:57.460]  is now a camp. This is being eased into slavery. This is this is this is domestication internment
[49:57.460 --> 50:04.380]  resettlement specialist provide rehabilitative. That's your education health, welfare and
[50:04.380 --> 50:10.940]  security near welfare. That's CPS taking your kids to US military prisoners within a confinement

[54:19.220 --> 54:26.420]  A lot of people have childlike minds. They don't want to believe they're building FEMA
[54:26.420 --> 54:34.700]  camps all over the country. They are. They admit they are. And they're now starting
[54:34.700 --> 54:39.260]  to sell the public on why we have them and why we need them. Now notice for more than
[54:39.260 --> 54:44.580]  20 years they've been building this infrastructure perfectly integrated for what's beginning
[54:44.580 --> 54:54.420]  to happen right now. Financial collapse and biological pandemics. And right as the program
[54:54.420 --> 55:00.740]  is being completed they now are preparing to use them. Now if anybody's got half a brain
[55:00.740 --> 55:09.460]  out there that proves this is staged. I mean they're not just building this archipelago
[55:09.460 --> 55:16.120]  of FEMA camps and police and military and militarization and police and DHS reports demonizing gun owners
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.860]  and veterans and they staged the 9-11 attacks to build the police state apparatus. Now they
[55:20.860 --> 55:25.660]  flipped it around and say oh guess what Northcom number one mission is fighting the American
[55:25.660 --> 55:34.820]  people and states that try to secede and veterans. Foreign corporations have engaged in a corporate
[55:34.820 --> 55:39.700]  takeover and they've dotted every I they've crossed every T to make sure they can take
[55:39.700 --> 55:46.260]  this country over. You're like okay well I'll just I'll just work for them. They're eugenicist
[55:46.260 --> 55:54.820]  dummy. A lot of you sociopaths go that's fine. I'll just work with them. Oh yeah. Oh these
[55:54.820 --> 56:01.300]  are worse than Nazis. Nazis only wanted to kill certain groups and that was bad enough.
[56:01.300 --> 56:09.620]  These people want to kill everybody and by worse than Nazis I mean worse for you in that
[56:09.620 --> 56:17.900]  they're going after everybody. From the perspective of a German it might have been okay but look
[56:17.900 --> 56:26.380]  how it ended up for them. Her capita Germans ended up getting the worst not just the Russians
[56:26.380 --> 56:31.620]  not just the Jews not just the Americans or the British or the French. 20 plus million
[56:31.620 --> 56:36.980]  conservatively Germans died. That's what the servants got and this was supposedly all for
[56:36.980 --> 56:50.020]  them. Listen to me carefully and let it sink in. There is no more denial. You just Google
[56:50.020 --> 57:00.020]  31 E internment. 31 E internment. I did this. Hundreds, monster.com, help wanted websites,
[57:00.020 --> 57:11.260]  the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the National Guard. Everybody's getting into internment
[57:11.260 --> 57:15.660]  and I understand the full operation. In fact coming up not in the next hour but the hour
[57:15.660 --> 57:21.300]  after that we're going to, I'm going to detail this and get into the flu. I'm going to come
[57:21.300 --> 57:23.820]  back in the next segment, take a few phone calls in a second because we have a guest
[57:23.820 --> 57:29.580]  in studio but training, job training for an internment resettlement specialist requires
[57:29.580 --> 57:37.660]  19 weeks, one day on of one station unit training which includes basic training and advanced
[57:37.660 --> 57:43.260]  individual training. Part of the training is spent in the classroom and part in the field
[57:43.260 --> 57:48.620]  at camps. Some of the skills you learn about, military laws and jurisdictions, level of
[57:48.620 --> 57:57.260]  force procedures, unarmed self defense techniques, police deviance and ethics procedures, interpersonal
[57:57.260 --> 58:03.220]  communication skills, close confinement operations, search and restraint procedures, got to catch
[58:03.220 --> 58:10.580]  the slaves when they run, use of firearms, custody and control procedures. Skills, helpful
[58:10.580 --> 58:15.380]  attributes include an ability to think and react quickly, an ability to remain calm in
[58:15.380 --> 58:20.540]  a stressful situation when you're breaking up people's family, and interest in law enforcement
[58:20.540 --> 58:27.760]  and crime prevention. And see, the people are going to fill the camps as we go into
[58:27.760 --> 58:34.020]  the depression and they're going to fill the camps with the inoculations and then see
[58:34.020 --> 58:42.380]  the precedent set. Well, yeah, we got camps to save everybody.

[1:00:20.340 --> 1:00:27.140]  Alex Jones. Coming up in an hour, I'm going to detail more on the FEMA camps as they hire
[1:00:27.140 --> 1:00:31.620]  tens of thousands of troops and police to man them as they build them all over the nation
[1:00:31.620 --> 1:00:37.180]  publicly as bills move through the Congress to federalize all the local towns and cities
[1:00:37.180 --> 1:00:42.380]  under the control of the local federal FEMA camp. Every major town already has FEMA offices
[1:00:42.380 --> 1:00:48.340]  taking over shut down shopping malls, airports. It's a total takeover. The whole economy is
[1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:54.220]  going to convert over to checkpoints, police, military, spies, secret police, private security
[1:00:54.220 --> 1:00:58.340]  guards, bossing them around. You can be in Dallas. You can be in New York. You can be
[1:00:58.340 --> 1:01:04.580]  in Houston. You can be in LA at a park. They come over and ask you secret police questions.
[1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:14.460]  I mean folks, this is a total psychological conversion over to a Stasi East German system.
[1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:18.780]  Wayne in Georgia. You're on the air. What do you think about them advertising for their
[1:01:18.780 --> 1:01:26.180]  FEMA camp operators for the United States? It's the most disgusting, repulsive thing
[1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:30.500]  I've ever heard in my life, Alex. I thank you for taking my call and I'd like to say
[1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:37.860]  thank you to your crew for all their hard work and I am a little bit nervous and Alex,
[1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:43.580]  you are definitely a hero of mine. I thank God for you and for what you're trying to
[1:01:43.580 --> 1:01:48.540]  do for this country. Well, thank God for you. Your message last
[1:01:48.540 --> 1:01:52.500]  night was very disturbing. I'm a truck driver and I was leaving Memphis, Tennessee, heading
[1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:57.860]  back towards Georgia. And I mean, I literally had to lay my head over steering wheel for
[1:01:57.860 --> 1:02:03.460]  a while and just really thank and pray, God, what am I going to do? And I can't do anything
[1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:09.900]  without his guidance, but there's just so much that you've done and your crew. I can't
[1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:14.940]  thank you enough, Alex. I'm a fellow Texan. Actually, I'm from Amarillo, Texas. And I'm
[1:02:14.940 --> 1:02:23.340]  a very proud Texan. And it's just an honor to talk to you for just a moment. I know you're
[1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:27.980]  busy, man. You've got a lot of people that want to talk to you as well. And for those
[1:02:27.980 --> 1:02:32.820]  that don't believe you, Alex, I first found out about this 15 years ago from a video
[1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:39.300]  that an old man gave me named John Anderson. It was called Iron Mountain. It was about
[1:02:39.300 --> 1:02:44.620]  a video from Iron Mountain, Wisconsin. And that's when I first found out about it. And
[1:02:44.620 --> 1:02:48.220]  everything on there slowly started to come to pass. And then I found out about you through
[1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:53.780]  coast to coast. And you just got bigger and better in my life and my families and everybody
[1:02:53.780 --> 1:03:00.660]  that I know, you've even touched to some people that are very important to me as well.
[1:03:00.660 --> 1:03:04.940]  And for those that don't believe, trust me, stick around, folks, you will believe. Trust
[1:03:04.940 --> 1:03:10.300]  me. Sooner or later, it's going to click. Alex, I'd like to ask you a question about
[1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:15.060]  these inoculations. I mean, we talk a lot about it and all that, but what can we do
[1:03:15.060 --> 1:03:21.060]  as Americans? I mean, is our congressman and center going to pay attention to this? Is
[1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:24.620]  this some kind of executive order or something? I mean, what can we do about this?
[1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:29.260]  Yes, it's an executive order and United Nations Treaty we've signed. And that's why they're
[1:03:29.260 --> 1:03:36.460]  announcing all over the world force inoculations in France and Germany and all over Europe.
[1:03:36.460 --> 1:03:39.860]  They're announcing their, they're, they're telling their captive populations, the little
[1:03:39.860 --> 1:03:46.580]  kids in school, federal workers, state workers, police, nurses and people, they always abuse
[1:03:46.580 --> 1:03:50.780]  their minions first that they've got to take it. That it's the law, but it's an executive
[1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:57.660]  order. So it doesn't have real force of law because it's unconstitutional. And this may
[1:03:57.660 --> 1:04:03.300]  just be another beta test coming up where they apply the pressure and then they get
[1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:07.900]  a large portion to go along with it and then more of the infrastructure set. So it's more
[1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:12.300]  of a bluff. You know, we're fighting them, exposing. It's not the law to take the shots.
[1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:17.660]  So they engage in this big scyop. The problem is they could be getting ready to go for,
[1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:22.900]  you know, shoot the moon, go for everything. And I've never seen such a buildup of their
[1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:28.100]  forces and it appears they're going to go ahead and drop the hammer. But if we scream
[1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:34.300]  bloody murder and get up on the front line, the enemy may back off. But I mean, that's
[1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:40.460]  the thing is I don't think the public realizes this is completely real. This is really happening.
[1:04:40.460 --> 1:04:46.420]  They really want to have a Soviet call of the population and they'll do it. I think
[1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:50.980]  they can get away with it. And so I'm going to bring my guest into Wayne, but I'm going
[1:04:50.980 --> 1:04:55.660]  to let you finish up with the final comment on the other side. They want a hot war. They
[1:04:55.660 --> 1:05:00.620]  want to fully break this country's back and reeducate us.
[1:05:00.620 --> 1:05:04.700]  Hello friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self
[1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:08.660]  sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[1:05:08.660 --> 1:05:12.300]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your
[1:05:12.300 --> 1:05:16.180]  own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of
[1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:20.180]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[1:05:20.180 --> 1:05:24.660]  family in the final equation, but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift

[1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:15.800]  Information War continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:20.840]  Author John Breeding, a psychologist, a friend of mine, is in the studio with us. We're going
[1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:25.440]  to him in just a moment. I know Dwayne, Nelson, Tom, Stan, Matt, everybody's there. We're
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:29.680]  going to get to you in the shower. Dr. Breeding can speak about any subject and he's quite
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:35.800]  well versed in the whole New World Order dehumanizing scientific dictatorship that we are facing
[1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:39.800]  and he's a psychologist so he could speak to some of the techniques they use because
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:47.320]  the establishment brags that 90% of their war, their hegemonic war to consolidate power
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:54.320]  for the ruling oligarchs is psychological. 90% of it is info war, hence infowars.com.
[1:08:54.320 --> 1:08:58.960]  They have lies and twisting and deceit and dissension. We have the truth and we also
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:03.520]  have our righteous anger against them to get fired up and say no. But Dwayne, you were
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:08.880]  asking a question there from George as you drive along in your truck. You were asking
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:16.560]  basically how are they planning to inoculate us or what is the public going to do or what
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:21.880]  I think is in the inoculation? I mean exactly what is your question?
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:28.120]  Just the main message out to us, what all can we do? I mean you said it was in the UN
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:32.160]  stuff and all that. You know that basically our congressmen and senators are basically
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:35.280]  powerless over this. And that's a very...
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:40.480]  Well they're not powerless if they stand up and say no. It's illegitimate. I mean they
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.720]  don't have a right to force you to take something in your body. That's fundamentally, you know,
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:49.440]  the archetypal body snatcher. The bad guy comes and makes you take a drug, makes you
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:53.360]  take a... makes you take a shot. I mean it's so fundamentally...
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:58.200]  Yeah, it really ticks you off, you know. I mean, we don't have the right to go to any
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:03.000]  of these people that's powering over us to say what goes in their body. It's ridiculous
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:09.840]  just like this doggone, this nationalized or socialized medicine. I mean, you know, apparently
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:13.800]  from what I understand my research that I've done on it, I mean they're not even subject
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:17.120]  to that kind of a plan. They could still have their own private health care. Are these
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:22.600]  people crazy? I mean... Well in fact, I mean they're crazy, they're people crazy for believing
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:27.880]  them. Sure, I actually have the bill. And in fact,
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:32.160]  on Info Wars and Prison Planet over the weekend, they posted a bullet point that has links
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:36.360]  to the bill and sub pages. I think it's like 20 bullet points. Look for that health care
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:42.080]  fact sheet and because next hour I'll cover some of that. It sounds great to be loving
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:48.160]  and sweet and good and to give people something free. But that's not how this works. These
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:53.720]  are eugenicists that are running things and so they want to force you and they lie and
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:58.640]  say, oh, we're just going to fund the uninsured. But if you read the bill, it's the takeover
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:02.760]  of health care. It's the rationing of health care. It's telling doctors what they can and
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:07.120]  can't do. But again, Obama lied and said he wasn't going to raise taxes on the middle
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:10.920]  class. Now he's announced, I never said that I am. He said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists.
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:15.320]  Now he's saying he's hiring nothing but lobbyists. He said he was going to end the wars. They
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:21.280]  just had the city lines redrawn and now don't count the basis part of the cities. It's a
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:26.840]  semantical word game. It's like if I said, go ahead.
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:32.120]  I'm sorry. I said to ask you, I didn't want to lose you right quick because I know you
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:38.000]  sometimes cut us short. But now on your, I'm on prison planet dot TV right now. And I was
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.640]  kind of curious, is it possible for that magnificent crew you got to fix it up to where your live
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:49.080]  show archives can be emailed to somebody by MP3 or some other version? That would be
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:53.480]  an awesome tool because I'm having a problem with a lot of people that do contact me by
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:57.360]  email that knows about some of the messages I'm trying to pass on to them that I've got
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:11:58.360]  from you.
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:02.680]  No, I hear you. Listen, I got a guest in studio. I got to go. Let me just, and thank you for
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:10.840]  the call. Let me just make this simple and succinct. We want everyone to rip, to grab
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:17.400]  the videos that we upload every day to prison planet dot TV. We want people to get those
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:32.760]  out to the public, but we cannot give the video away from our site because just supplying
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:40.320]  the website bandwidth and the prison planet dot TV bandwidth is costing me right at $20,000
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:46.880]  a month just, and that's with paying members. And so the paying members are able to pay
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:52.320]  for that bandwidth. Now we have it turned up where you can share your passcode with quite
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:13:04.840]  a few people until it locks you out. And so, uh, but we don't have the funds to be the
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:10.560]  progenitors or be the source of all the video for free. I mean, I have a few times with
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:16.120]  our servers, I have put a video up, take our flu report when they censored it and knocked
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:21.080]  it off YouTube. It had hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube in like two days. So they,
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:25.800]  they erased it. And so I said, okay, we'll offer it for free. And it got like 50 something
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:31.320]  thousand views in a couple of days. And that was a couple thousand dollar bill for me.
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:41.600]  So no, I cannot let the members give it all away for free. But what members can do is
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:54.920]  you can do is you can burn it to disk or copy it to your system and then share it that way.
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:02.120]  But I can't be the source of it and pay to stream it out. Okay. And, and, and almost
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:08.560]  everything that's on prisonplanet.tv is uploaded to the Alex Jones channel at YouTube. And
[1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:13.840]  I now have taken that channel over and actually pay the guy to do it. And so it's there. I'm
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:18.720]  paying to give it to you for free, paying to have it uploaded and done. And so it's there.
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:23.560]  You want to watch it live, watch it in higher quality, watch it all come, you know, incomplete
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:27.440]  because it's only selects that are up on the Alex Jones channel. It's there for you. Okay.
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:31.440]  Now that question is now answered. I'm going to get into the FEMA camps more on the flu
[1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:38.400]  next hour. We have Steve quail. Steve quail is joining us Wednesday for two hours. So is
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.440]  Ron Paul for 30 minutes on the flu situation and on other issues. And I've got a bunch
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:48.320]  of other medical doctors coming on throughout the week about the flu and the hype and all
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:52.040]  these epidemiologists and virologists saying they don't understand why they're seeing
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:57.680]  force inoculations, martial law, quarantine of cities. It makes absolutely no sense.
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:03.280]  This thing is a weak, no big deal flu, but clearly genetically engineered, clearly manufactured.
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:06.680]  So again, this is their perfect cover for whatever they're planning in the fall and
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.800]  winter. All right, enough said for the next 45 minutes. We're joined by Dr. John Breeding
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:15.480]  in studio. He's the author of several books. We carry both of them at info wars.com. The
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:21.440]  wildest cults make the best horses and another book about bringing kids up, which is a lot
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.760]  of great ideas that I've used in my own family. And Dr. Breeding is here to talk about the
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:30.840]  architecture of the psychological dictatorship, the controllers, the Malthusian eugenicist
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:35.440]  view, the drugging, the force inoculations, everything that's happening in society. Dr.
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:36.600]  Breeding, good to have you here.
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:39.040]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:43.760]  You bet it's great to have you and had you I think in almost a year in studio with us.
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:46.840]  You've heard me answering those questions, burning up the time we had, but there's so
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:51.800]  many facets to all this. What do you think about the open building of FEMA camps across
[1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:58.120]  the nation openly saying North comms now going to occupy the US openly saying the whole anti
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:05.720]  terrorist system is for the American people, the force inoculations being hyped, the just
[1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:09.920]  the whole bizarre landscape we're witnessing.
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:16.360]  Well I think it's horrifying and I think you do a really good job of translating things,
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:23.720]  which is a real key. I think that part of the dynamic in terms of the info wars and
[1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:29.240]  the saps kind of thing is basically that whatever you want to sell, you package it in a language
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:34.880]  that somehow sounds appealing and beneficial. My specialty area is in psychiatric oppression
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:40.840]  and that's one key aspect of this whole thing. And it's very important to understand the
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:46.480]  basic dynamic, which is this, that psychiatry is a mechanism of social control first and
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:54.640]  foremost. It masquerades as a form of medicine, but it's really about social control outside
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:17:02.880]  of military or law enforcement channels. The basic dynamics, and this is why I still resonate
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:08.920]  with your end game and your whole focus on eugenics, is that what people don't understand
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:17.920]  is that psychiatry is in and of itself a form of modern-day eugenics. Psychiatry was a big
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:26.520]  force in planning the Nazi final solution. The Nazis modeled their final solution after
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:31.920]  American eugenic programs that were wanting to eradicate life unworthy of living in the
[1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:37.520]  United States, sterilization going on in all kinds of states here. The Nazis modeled after
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:44.440]  that, did their thing, and modern-day psychiatry evolved from basically German psychiatrists
[1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:49.520]  that came to the United States and continued that basic dynamic, which in the key belief
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:56.560]  is that problems in living are due to biological or genetic defects. The early American eugenics
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:02.880]  called it germplasm, defective germplasm, and so we would sterilize and segregate these
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:07.640]  retards and morons and all these other people in the United States in the early 20th century.
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:13.000]  Now it's called mentally ill people who are biologically or genetically defective. We
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:19.720]  put literally what, 50, 60 million United States citizens on these brain-damaging, brain-disabling
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:27.120]  sex libido drive, disabling psychiatric drugs, call it medicine, say that they have biological
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.760]  or genetic defects without any evidence of that.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:36.680]  We'll take Endgame. We have one of the head psychiatrists in Texas testifying before the
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:40.880]  legislature and they say, why are you putting close to 70% of kids on drugs? And he just
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:46.360]  said they have bad genes. There's no test for that. It's just a made-up quack. No, they
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:50.560]  want to pump the kids full of drugs because they get pharmaceutical money and because
[1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:56.280]  it's a tool of control. I mean, it's just, it's so obviously quack made-up garbage.
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:19:00.840]  And so obvious when you get them to actually say it overtly, that was Dr. Joe Burkett from
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:06.160]  Fort Worth mental health system up there. We managed to get some attention in the Texas
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:10.960]  legislature on the foster kid situation. They're getting the brunt of it more than anybody.
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:16.640]  It's like you said, 70% of teenagers in the foster care system are on multiple psychiatric
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:22.400]  drugs. And when Joe Burkett was pinned down by Susanna Hupp in that committee, he basically
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:28.680]  said, because they come from a bad gene pool, he was outed and he looked pretty bad because
[1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:32.520]  they don't want to say it out front. They don't want to say it out loud, but that's
[1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:33.720]  the belief system behind it.
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:37.000]  Now I've talked to these people in private. They'll say, what's wrong with killing 80%
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:43.960]  of the population? I mean, these are sickos. These are sicko, sicko control freaks. And
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:48.400]  the average person out there needs to grow up and realize that there are real monsters
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.520]  in the world. And there are a bunch of control freaks who are setting up their guild here
[1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:58.400]  in the United States and taking over every facet of society. Stay with us. Dr. John Breeding
[1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:01.000]  is our guest.

[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:04.440]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:09.680]  affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:14.040]  of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:19.240]  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:24.400]  Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin
[1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:29.720]  D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:34.280]  intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries
[1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:38.280]  of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading with

[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:08.800]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:15.760]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:21.160]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:30.000]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.680]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:38.560]  that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:41.240]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.400]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:46.600]  after power. That's their after-easy.

[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:26.120]  I have a story here out of the New York Post. His mother, three, no criminal record, can
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:35.920]  go to her personal website. It's on the Glenbeck Fox News Clubs. A little bit of me on there.
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:39.800]  She went out to the military base because they admit it's going to be a FEMA camp, take
[1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:45.480]  some photos and they came running off the base and grabbed her and she's now in jail
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:50.120]  and they put her in a mental institution because she believes it's part of an internment camp
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:55.280]  even though I have NationalGuard.com saying they need troops for the internment camps.
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:00.520]  It says four internment camps and resettlement inside the United States and they're on the
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:07.520]  same TV saying get ready for force inoculations and all this and I've seen national TV
[1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:12.400]  attack myself and others lately and the mantra is when I'm on these other radio shows being
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:18.000]  attacked that I need to be put in a mental institution that we're all crazy. We saw this
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:23.040]  in the Soviet Union but more and more in the United States in cases like Charles T. Sellup
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:28.400]  in Missouri, they actually grabbed people. You don't even go to trial. They're now grabbing
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:33.960]  political enemies and just throwing them in the psychiatric gulag and then two, three,
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:38.960]  four, five years later roll you out after being in solitary on antipsychotics. Your
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:43.680]  head shaved, you're drooling and they say, look, he's crazy. Isn't this just in many
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:49.880]  cases just an excuse to carry out predatory, sadistic, criminal behavior?
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:56.320]  The estimates I see are about 1.5 million United States citizens incarcerated in psycho
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:02.560]  prisons every year who have not committed any kind of crime that's on the books. That's
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:08.240]  the point about psychiatry being a mechanism of social control and it's the point about
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:16.040]  the root mechanism of psychiatry is coercion, the right of the state to forcibly incarcerate
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:22.560]  and treat, which means inject with poisonous toxic substances any citizen who is judged
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:28.120]  by the powers that be as needing to be in that kind of treatment. So in a sense it's
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:33.400]  all political. Every one of those 1.5 million and then more and more you're seeing the kind
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:38.040]  of dynamic that you describe with that woman where anything can be interpreted if you get
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:42.640]  a psychiatrist to agree with you and psychiatrists are paid flat. So you can always get a psychiatrist
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:48.640]  to agree with you. You're vulnerable to being incarcerated against your will without a trial.
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:53.120]  Well, more and more we see them arresting patriots like a neighbor will see an old man
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:57.240]  cleaning his gun. I've seen this in the news and they're scared of the gun. So the police
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:01.040]  come and arrest him and say three or four guns and some ammo was an arsenal. And then
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:04.880]  you always hear a week later that the old man is in a psychiatric facility because
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:10.400]  he believes that he's being oppressed. Now he's been arrested for not committing a crime.
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.400]  So he's saying I'm being oppressed and then they now have designations as you know, doctor
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:18.800]  saying him saying he's being oppressed and his rights are being violated. In fact, that's
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:24.560]  in the New York Post. That is the proof of insanity. Well, what I want is for the listeners
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:30.880]  to really get and break down that split that happens in the mind where you can be all against
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:35.600]  oppression and all against police state and stuff. But somehow this, this screen comes
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:40.800]  down when you look at somebody whose judge is acting bizarre or has some belief system
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:45.440]  that's a massive affront to yours. And you all of a sudden you get behind the state and
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:49.360]  say, Oh, that's mental illness. They need treatment for their own good. And you call
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.400]  the police or you call the state to get that person help from a psychiatrist. And you think
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:59.600]  you're doing some kind of good instead of the truth that you are an agent of a police
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:04.080]  state that's coercing that person against the wheel, however extreme or bizarre their
[1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:08.480]  behavior, you might think it is. And that's what happens every, every day. What happens
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:14.080]  to this woman is horrible for confronting, you know, a governmental, totalitarian action.
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:20.160]  But it's happening to literally millions of our brother and sister citizens. My own kids
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:25.600]  were out in front, the front yard a few nights ago, a neighbor called all of a sudden four squad
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:32.320]  cars come up, they confront these two teenagers. And finally they say, they say, well, about
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:36.880]  you should go inside because it's suspicious that you're out here. And what were they doing?
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:40.720]  They're sitting out there drawing pictures and sitting on the curb. Yeah, I've been to your
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  house, nice little middle class area. And so, you know, they're out there drawing on the,
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:51.920]  I mean, now if you're not inside watching the glowing television, that is I send film crews
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:55.600]  all over the country and I go all over the country. We can be in small towns, big cities,
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:59.520]  the police walk over and say, you're not allowed to film the city hall. You're not allowed to be
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:05.760]  here. Why are you here? It's total secret police land. Mental illness is a made up concept.
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:12.240]  There is no biologically or genetically based brain disease that constitutes a mental illness.
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:19.280]  It's made up and yet people believe, oh, she's bipolar. Oh, he's ADD. Oh, that person's schizophrenic.
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:23.680]  Well, most of the time it's the dyes they're eating and the sugar and the caffeine. And then
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:28.000]  once they, well, I mean, now, as you know, Dr. Breeding, they have drugs for the Prozac. Now,
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.560]  they have drugs for the side of stay there. When we come back, I want to break down in the long
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:38.000]  segment coming up all these different facets of this and how they're pushing, drugging the kids
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:44.640]  and how it ties into other, you know, activities of forcing people to take vaccines. And now
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:49.440]  they're saying you're mentally ill if you don't trust the government and want to take the shot.
[1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:57.520]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:04.640]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. And I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do
[1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:09.600]  you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:15.040]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:19.440]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:24.320]  system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric water
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:29.040]  generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The

[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.920]  one of our affiliate radio stations. He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:12.720]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job
[1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:17.040]  for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:22.480]  security. You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:28.400]  and own your own business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his own boss
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:34.160]  for over 37 years, and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits
[1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:39.600]  of working for themselves and not for others. MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business
[1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:44.000]  opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.920]  and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income. Visit chocolate.omyself.com
[1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:55.360]  and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.omyself.com. It takes very little money,
[1:32:55.360 --> 1:33:05.840]  and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you. Remember chocolate.omyself.com.
[1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:23.520]  You know, I think it's been three or four months since I've done a show, maybe six months without
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:31.360]  going live at Prison Planet.tv, but I may not go live at Prison Planet.tv today in the 34th hour
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:39.360]  because I'm doing back exercises Saturday. I have this terrible crick and I don't want to be
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:45.760]  grimacing and stuff on the camera the whole time, but we'll see if the Advil kicks in. If it does,
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:51.360]  I'll go live. I'll come up in about 30 minutes. I know those are popular. Folks like to watch,
[1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:54.160]  and I'm honored that you do. Let me show you all the documents and prove. In fact,
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:59.600]  I'm going live. Forget it. It doesn't matter. Maybe somebody can find me more than one Advil,
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:04.160]  then, and that will knock this out. Of course, maybe I'm mentally ill. Maybe I'm imagining
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.400]  that. You know, I mean, if I get arrested for my political speech and then I say that my rights
[1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:12.560]  are being violated, they put me in a psychiatric facility because there's no such thing as government
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:18.720]  oppression. In fact, Doc, I'm kind of cold colony on this, but I've read them in the past. There's
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:24.800]  scores of new designations in the last decade where if you don't trust the government or you think
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:29.280]  you're being impressed, it's mentally ill. So I guess if I don't like these FEMA camps or I go out
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:35.360]  and photograph one, I've got to go to the mental institution because it's crazy to not like the
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:44.960]  FEMA camp. Well, I mean, the core dynamics of incarceration in a psychiatric facility include
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:50.800]  the idea that's one is somehow a danger to yourself or others, and that's often indicated by
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:56.560]  the notion that you have a so-called delusion or hallucination. In plain speech, if you want to
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:02.080]  translate that, that means a false belief or a vision that someone else is not seeing. So that
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:07.680]  can be used with anything and that can certainly be used, like you said, with a woman who had a belief
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:14.560]  that the military installation was going to be an internment camp. That could be declared a delusion
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:19.760]  and there you go. Because it was on an official government list. Yeah. And so sure, that's the
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:24.480]  basic. That's the thing. I had the FBI here last week with some subpoena over some trial I'm supposed
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:31.680]  to have to go to, not a trial of myself, somebody else. But I was saying, look at EcoScience by
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:37.120]  John P. Holdren about forced abortion, forced sterilization and planning us with drugs,
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  time release, you know, sterilants and other. And I said, look, and they wouldn't look at it.
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:48.640]  Because see, to them, I mean, who's really living in delusion, doctor? Yeah. Well, that's, that's,
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:53.920]  that's called denial. You know, that's, that's a mechanism called, you know, I see the world the
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:59.280]  way I want to see it and I won't look at anything else. You know, whether it's information in that
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:05.840]  book or whether it's children being blown apart, you know, in any rock, you know, you just don't
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:12.240]  see that what you see is only terrorists that justify aggression and continued bombing. Or what
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:18.800]  you see is only a certain segment of so-called science that justifies a certain position in an
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:25.520]  action. And you've had it used against you. You have the wits and wherewithal and resources and
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:32.640]  support and friends and family that, that are so you're able to keep going and, and stay strong
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:38.720]  and not be so vulnerable, you know. But the thing is that, you know, for most people, it comes down
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:45.360]  to, are you going to let them call your child a dirty name called ADHD and give them a stimulant
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:50.880]  drug called speed that's addictive, toxic, brain damaging, heart damaging and think that you're
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:56.960]  helping your child. Are you going to have your teenager or your wife or husband who's depressed
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:01.040]  because they're looking at this horrible reality? They've been listening to too much Alex Jones and
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:06.480]  they're reconsidering their life and they're feeling kind of uncertain about what they thought was
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:10.960]  real and stuff. Are you going to decide that they have a chemical imbalance and so all they need is
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:16.800]  a little Prozac or Paxil to bring them back to life. Are you going to allow them to be stigmatized
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:22.160]  and drugged and think that it's medicine and that you're going to a doctor for help? Or are you going
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:27.760]  to take the, I don't know if it's a red pill or the blue pill, but the one that you see reality and
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:34.480]  to see that those are lies that are used to control and cause and keep you from facing the real
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:39.200]  issues of so-called social and economic justice and tyranny and whatever. Well, Dr. Breeding,
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:46.080]  I've met your children. They're both good-looking, clean kids, but it wouldn't matter if they had
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:49.600]  green mohawks. That's their right and they're about to both go off to college. We were talking
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:52.960]  about that last week when you were dropping some more books by that we saw in the bookstore.
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:58.240]  Now, your two books, you're telling me Austin cops in your middle-class neighborhood pulled up and
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:03.040]  said you shouldn't be in your front yard. I mean, that's like we, I mean, this country's gone
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:08.640]  because I've got all over the nation where the police declare martial law in towns. In fact,
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:14.560]  people won't believe it. Google a YouTube CNN martial law in town and they say you got to show
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:18.800]  papers to leave your neighborhood. You're not allowed to be in your front yard. I mean, the
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:23.840]  Austin cops pulled up and said, who are you? And then they, I guess showed them IDs and then they
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:28.400]  said, well, you shouldn't be in your front yard. That's suspicious. It appears that a certain
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:35.040]  cranky distrustful neighbor called the police and said, we got some suspicious people out there
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:41.680]  and the police took that action and decided. And the part that bothered me the most was that they
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:49.760]  told these two 16, 17, 18 year olds that they were looking suspicious by virtue of their acts,
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:54.480]  that they shouldn't stay out in their front yard drawing pictures and talking because that was
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:58.880]  suspicious, you know. Well, to a lot of people, actually, I'm starting to run into people that
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:04.880]  think being able to read or being able to use large words almost like idiocracy, the movie,
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:12.640]  is suspicious and knowing things is suspicious and drawing might have been terrifying to some TV
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:17.920]  head that to them that was so alien that might have looked like a green alien or something out
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:23.200]  in the front yard. Well, that reminds me of the, of the teen screen kind of things where they go
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:28.400]  into the schools. And by the way, this is part of the current public health policy or insurance
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:33.200]  bill being put forward is to include a school mental health clinics and preventive treatment
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:36.480]  programs, you know, to bring forward more. There's still called mental health screening that we've
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:43.040]  been that's the model states all these years. The president's new freedom initiative said we
[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:48.640]  want to go from 15% of kids on the drugs to 50%. Yeah, that was Bush's new freedom initiative.
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:54.240]  And now Obama's insurance plan includes the school mental health clinics and preventive
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:58.480]  treatments that bring more and more this mental health screening forward as well. So it's like
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:02.960]  you talk about a lot, you know, it's not about whether it's a Republican or a Democrat who's
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:10.320]  president, it's about this basic policy push towards more and more expanding of anything
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:16.000]  that's going to support a basic corporate dynamic. That's right. It sounds good if they just gave
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  people insurance. That would be, you know, socialism, but, but, but if an angel was administering it,
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  it might work. The problem is, as you said, these eugenicists 150 years ago took over all
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:34.800]  academia, their mindset runs basically most of medicine, psychiatry, psychology, the culture.
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:42.240]  And we still haven't gotten rid of this group that that are literally waging war against any
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:48.320]  other idea, any other philosophy, freedom itself. And going over to the healthcare bill, you're
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:53.520]  right. It is a total federal takeover of everything. Doc, tell us about the psychological perspectives
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:59.040]  that was in this. Well, there's the school mental health clinics, you know, that bring forth more
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:03.920]  mental health screening and then also emergency services, which means more and more situations
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:11.840]  where some quote unquote benevolent adult will decide that a young person is is suicidal or
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:16.400]  something. And then immediately they're, they're launched off to the psychiatric facility. You
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:21.360]  know, there's that there's preventive treatment, the sort of sort of like a violence prevention
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:25.200]  where you bring in mental health treatment, supposedly it's going to prevent violence,
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:30.160]  you know, you've got mental health parity, you know, which means that you've got lifelong
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.520]  mental health benefits to parallel physical health benefits, you know, and problems with that is one
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:40.960]  remember that that includes the benefit to be forcibly treated since psychiatry can treat you
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:47.200]  forcibly whereas the rest of medicine can't. Well, page 16 of the bill says that if you have
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:51.280]  insurance, the time of the bill becoming long and change, you'll be required to take a similar
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:56.480]  plan. If that's not available, you will be required to take the government option. And under that,
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:00.400]  when you go in to get the free government health care, they also make you do a psychological
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:07.440]  screening just like the Head Start program. Now the kids get three CPS visits a year and
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.760]  start trying to get them into the system. So see that they're saying it's free, but it's really
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:17.520]  a way to get you into the system. Any kind of quote unquote screening, I mean, vision screening is
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.360]  one thing, you know, or hearing screening is one thing. But anything that's in the realm of
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:26.880]  psychological psychiatric mental health screening is dangerous because in this is the drug companies
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:30.720]  write the policies, they have an initiative and incentive to get you in. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:35.600]  Well, that's exactly right. It's basically mass marketing for the drug companies. But the other
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:43.440]  part is that you have to understand that psychiatry, even though it's a branch of medicine
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:51.200]  legally and structurally, is not valid medicine. Psychiatric so called illnesses are just behavior.
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:55.520]  They're judgments that are put on somebody's behavior and you cannot diagnose an illness from
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:01.360]  behavior. You can diagnose disease by finding a physical or chemical abnormality that's
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:06.560]  confirmable and it's consistently present with that disease. This does not happen with any form
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:12.880]  of so called mental illness. It's all just somebody's exactly about behavior. I was reading studies
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:19.200]  from like 1880, 1890 when psychiatry really got going because there were so many people
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:24.560]  murdering their families, going crazy, chewing off their fingers, going nuts. And there were
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:29.760]  medical doctors at the time going, no, stop dumping mercury from these giant global
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:38.800]  industries where they were making plates and painting lead and mercury dyes on them,
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:45.920]  where they were making mass tanneries, where they were dying hats. Matt is a hat or that term. The
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:51.040]  point is England was supplying manufactured goods the whole world at that time. It was the industrial
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:56.080]  center. Germany was just starting to rise, but most stuff was getting made in England. And so they
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:02.480]  were dumping it in the water supply and large portions of people were chemically going nuts
[1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:07.280]  because they had mercury and lead and all this in them. And there was a fight at the time with
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:12.880]  medical doctors going, stop dumping lead and mercury in the water. That's why this is happening.
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:16.720]  And the psychiatrists and people and psychologists, well, I didn't have those yet, but that whole
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:22.160]  science developing said, no, they're all insane because they've got bad gene pools and that whole
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:27.280]  Malthus Galton situation. Go ahead. Well, yeah, every, every one of those things, whether it's a
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:33.920]  distraction from looking at, at, at corporate and industrial pollution and poisoning of people,
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:39.360]  you know, whether it's a distraction from issues of social and economic justice,
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:45.120]  whether it's distraction from government schools and whether they meet kids needs or not, you
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:50.960]  know, once you say that the problem lies in a genetically defective or biologically defective
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:58.640]  individual, a child in school, a teenager in high school, a young adult in college or the work.
[1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:04.720]  You've dehumanized them. You dehumanize them and you take attention from addressing the real
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:09.120]  issue that might be going on. And instead you've explained it. It's just they're defective and
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:13.600]  that's where the eugenics comes in. Yeah, it's not the lead and mercury is the reason people are,
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:18.080]  are flipping out. No, it's, it's, they got bad genes. You know, those poor people,
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:22.240]  we don't need to stop having them working factories with their hands in the mercury all day.
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:27.840]  No, no, no, it's because they have bad genes. That's why they're having all these deformed babies.
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:32.720]  That's right. Yeah. And it's the same thing with ADHD and your wealthy Westlake schools,
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:38.000]  you know, they're violent. It's just an unfortunate biologically, they use metaphors,
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:43.120]  you know, like miswired or, or chemically imbalanced kind of thing, but it's all just
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:47.120]  a judgment based on behavior. And then you don't look at, is that child really getting
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:51.760]  their needs met? Have they been over-vaccinized? Is that school really meeting the needs of the
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:57.040]  kids? You know, are the family parents present and helping, you know, I mean, it's, there's
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:01.200]  many, many things that can cause a kid to go off the rails. Well, I mean, they're finally,
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:07.280]  they're finally because of pressure from you and others. Many schools are taking the machines out
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.000]  where it's Snickers and Coca-Cola and every two or three breaks, the kids are drinking
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:16.320]  coax and eating Snickers and not eating any good food. Of course, they're bouncing off the wall
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:20.080]  and then crashing and getting depressed. I mean, I took my kids to see up. By the way,
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:24.560]  that's a great movie. I recommend everybody go see it. Uh, you know, it has a very good
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:28.480]  message in it. I'm surprised Hollywood has put something good out. It's, it's a real surprise
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:33.520]  that I ended up eating a box of Butterfingers, you know, those little movie theater ones and
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:39.040]  drinking a cherry slurpee. And, and, and it felt like I'd had, you know, a hangover from 14 shots
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:45.680]  of Jack Daniels. So, I mean, folks, sugar is a drug, especially processed sugar. And, and so,
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:49.520]  of course, your kids are bouncing off the walls and then depressed. Most of this talking to
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:55.040]  child psychologists and doctors, they're saying it's sugar. How much of this have you found
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:47:00.960]  is processed foods and sugars? Well, I just like to think about things multidimensionally. And I
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:06.000]  would say that I don't know the percentages. You know, there's definitely a percentage of kids
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.960]  who are very sensitive and a percentage of, and there's a large percentage who eat a large
[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:17.840]  preponderance of junk food and sugar. And that child is not going to be well suited to the kind
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:22.480]  of things that are expected in a school setting called sitting quietly, called focusing and paying
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:28.400]  attention. So, yeah, that's a big factor in all this diagnosis of ADHD. But so is the fact that
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:35.440]  in 1991, ADHD was added to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which was originally
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:40.560]  developed to make sure that schools met the needs of kids with cerebral palsy and vision impairment
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:44.800]  and hearing impairment. And then you gradually started adding things like non-specific learning
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:49.680]  disability. And have you heard the latest? In ADHD. And then you saw the spike in all these kids
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:56.160]  labeled ADHD and drugged. The latest. I mean, most of the studies show kids are in school too long.
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:48:02.800]  They need more recreation, more art, more recess. Instead, some schools are getting rid of recess,
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:12.080]  adding more hours. And now, Obama has announced they want an 11 month school year totally taking
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:16.800]  the children away from the family. And so the social engineers are screwing everybody up. So,
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:24.000]  their answer is no, you're defective. We've got to drug you to fit a square peg in a round hole.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:30.800]  I mean, folks, now they want to make the kids be in there 11 months out of the year. And when
[1:48:30.800 --> 1:48:35.600]  if you notice no dodgeball, no tag, no chase is allowed now, they are literally turning them
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.360]  into like zombies. How can how can kids be happy if they're not running around? Best thing you can
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:46.800]  do for your kids is keep them out of so much school and spend a lot of time out running around and in
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:51.280]  the woods and in the water. That's a very, very best thing you can do for your kids. That's totally
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:55.760]  true. The other concept is this whole thing of medication madness. And I was thinking about
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.440]  that when you were talking about the schools. But the other thing that we know is that these drugs
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:05.920]  are brain disabling and intoxicating. And so there's a large percentage of people. In fact,
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:10.480]  anybody's taken various of these psychotropic drugs, the stimulant drugs and the so-called
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:15.760]  antidepressants to some degree or another is suffering from what we call medication madness.
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:22.080]  Involuntary intoxication is another way of putting it. It's the same thing as like the person
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:26.720]  who's drunk on alcohol and you say, I'm not going to let you drive home. I'll take your keys. I can
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:32.160]  drive. I'm fine. They're unaware of their own impairment. The same thing is true with Prozac,
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:37.120]  Paxil, Ritalin, Adderall. To some extent, the individuals are impaired. A lot of them end up
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:42.320]  going off and doing dramatic things like school shootings and killing their kids and suicide
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:46.880]  and stuff like that. Most of them, though, are just impaired in terms of their ability to be aware
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:52.400]  of themselves and to realize the extent of their actions and have less controls on their impulsivities.
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:57.200]  And that's all attributed to their mental illness when what's really going on is that they're
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:01.360]  deranged by the treatments for their own mental illness and it just continues to spin more and
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:05.840]  more out of control. And for decades, they denied that. But now they have to put on the inserts of
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:10.800]  the psychotropic, thanks to your work and others' work, doctor, admitting it causes psychopathic
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:15.920]  behavior, suicides, rages. And every time the cops show up where a mother's chopped her baby's head
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:21.280]  off, they're always on it. I've never seen a case because women don't normally do these type of
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:26.960]  incredibly dramatic, savage things unless they're hopped up on something in a hallucinogen class
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.000]  and they're having a bad tripture. Absolutely right. Now they're having to admit,
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:35.760]  but then they make money out of that. They say, okay, Prozac is causing this. We have a drug
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:41.440]  to treat the Prozac side effects. You mentioned the mother. One of the acts in the federal
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:46.640]  Congress right now is the so-called Bellamy Blocker Stokes Mothers Act, which would create
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:52.000]  screening for pregnant mothers and newborn... Tell us about that when we get back. Yeah,
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:56.800]  they're saying, well, just like half the births are cesarean now. I got an article where they
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:04.560]  CPS'd a woman because they wouldn't let her do a cesarean. Recognize that sound? If you're taking
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:09.920]  vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up. Hello, my name is Dr.
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:15.680]  David Friedman. According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10%
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:21.920]  absorbed. So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet. In
[1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:27.680]  fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets. Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:09.920]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[1:52:10.800 --> 1:52:16.000]  world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:21.120]  myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:26.640]  fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:32.960]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:40.880]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.

[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:28.880]  situation, the FEMA camps, 31E internment, the Army hiring masses of personnel, four domestic
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:33.840]  internment of American citizens, lockdowns of cities, forced quarantines of entire cities.
[1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:40.000]  This is Fox CNN ABC News, and I have all the video. This is on the news. They've gone from,
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:44.640]  oh, we're not doing any of this psychologically to get us to stand down. So we wouldn't build a
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:49.280]  movement against it. Now they're like, oh yeah, it's all real. I mean, there is no end to what
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:54.560]  these bankers are trying to do. For all the listeners out there, I hope you visit infowars.com,

[1:55:55.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  to go teach a college class. Okay, Dr. Breeding, continuing with in the last 10 minutes, other
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:05.200]  topics, points you wanted to make, things that are on the horizon or things that are on our front
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:10.640]  porch. The establishment has been having some defeats. People are waking up to them, but it
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:17.680]  seems they're just expanding their wild takeover as kind of their fleeing forward. Or where do
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:23.120]  you see things going? Well, I want to finish first on this Melanie Blocker Stokes Mothers Act.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:28.560]  Oh, yes, yes. Which is in the U.S. Congress right now. It's one of these incredibly Orwellian
[1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:34.480]  nightmares. It's called the Mothers Act, you know, so it's presented forward with this benevolent,
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:39.840]  loving rhetoric that we want to support pregnant mothers and their children. And it sounds really
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:43.840]  good. You're for mothers, aren't you? You're for mothers who could be against a mother. And it's
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:49.360]  named after a mother, Melanie Blocker Stokes. But what most people don't know is that Melanie
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:54.880]  Blocker Stokes was a mother who got the treatment that this program is going to make available
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:57:00.160]  for more and more mothers. And here's the results of her treatment. Over a period of seven weeks,
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:05.120]  she was hospitalized three times in psych facilities. She was put on four different
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:10.240]  polypharmic cocktails, meaning combinations of three or four different psychotropic drugs,
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:15.840]  switched four times. And at the end of that, she was given electroconvulsive treatment,
[1:57:15.840 --> 1:57:25.040]  electroshock, and then given more electroshock. And then she ended up jumping out of the 12th
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:31.360]  story window of a Chicago hotel. Who wouldn't get away from that and killed herself. And this
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:37.920]  thing is devoted to her. It's dedicated to her, you know, as it's dedicated to who they killed
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:44.480]  so they can do it to all women saying having birth is mental illness. All women have to have CPS come
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:50.000]  in and force psych evaluations when they're bloody on the table to then try to steal their kids.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:57.040]  That's the real reason postpartum depression. And now they have postpartum father's depression as
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:00.560]  well. So they want to screen the mothers. They want to screen the fathers. They want to screen the
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:05.360]  babies, but more and more of these babies on these psychotropic drugs in spite of the fact.
[1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:09.920]  Yeah, they're there. Thousands of these babies are now suffering from heart damage and birth
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:16.160]  effects by virtue of they or their mothers taking these psychotropic drugs. They are just such
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:21.120]  incredible vultures saying, well, I mean, now everybody I know that has a car wreck knows the
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:25.680]  hospital. They try to put it on it. They are pushing their drugs on everybody. People don't know
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:31.200]  that then is giving them a psychological determination, which then turns them into these subhumans.
[1:58:31.200 --> 1:58:36.160]  Stay there back with the final five minutes. I want to, I want to end on this situation,
[1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:40.000]  this legislation. How do we beat this to keep the CPS away?
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.
[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:55.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:58:55.280 --> 1:58:59.520]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:04.720]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:09.360]  allows you to have. It's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:13.920]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:18.000]  dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:22.400]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[1:59:22.400 --> 1:59:27.200]  lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:31.280]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:35.680]  generators offered by solutions from science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more

[1:59:53.520 --> 1:59:58.720]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:58.720 --> 2:00:12.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:29.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:34.640]  Dr. John Breeding is our guest. Coming up, more on the flu, the FEMA camps, open announcement
[2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:40.400]  of FEMA camps in the United States, and Obama announcing that they're going to raise taxes
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:44.640]  on every American. They're now publicly going back on their promise and pledge and saying
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:48.080]  that they never made the pledge. It doesn't matter how many video clips of them saying
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:52.880]  that we have. In fact, I have some of those clips coming up. Also, they're going to pay
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:59.680]  US doctors $50,000 to take part in the inoculation because of liability to give people the new
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:06.800]  deadly flu shot. And doctors in England are to get 27,000 pounds or more than $50,000 at US.
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:12.320]  So you wonder how they do this? Well, they get paid to do it. Dr. John Breeding, in closing,
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:17.200]  I was jumping in here because I've had three children with my wife. She's had the children,
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:23.600]  but I've been there. And I've seen them entering your data and asking, do you have enough money in
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:28.960]  home? You know, does your husband hurt you? And they'll always say, oh, take this file out here
[2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:32.880]  for me. And I've three times they've done it. So I know what they do now. And then later,
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:37.120]  I confront them. I go, oh, that, that, that's for the CPS. If my wife would have said yes.
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:43.040]  See, they don't tell your wife, oh, hey, this is like a police interrogation. They get around
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:49.200]  all that because it's the whole eugenical social system. But even if you say, yeah, money's tight,
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:54.000]  now you're at risk. They want those kids, but they also want to drug the mothers. And so you
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:58.320]  were telling me Unite for Life.org is a group fighting this. I remember reading the bill a
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:04.880]  few months ago, but I haven't covered it like I should. In closing Dr. Breeding, this is huge.
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:08.640]  They're trying to turn everything into the psychiatric system.
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:14.160]  Well, we've been fighting for years, the mental health screening in the schools, you know, Texas
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:18.560]  has been the front lines of it because they really like to get things through in Texas. And the,
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:22.640]  and the Texas governors were lined up with the president. It went right into the legislature.
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:26.480]  And so we've been fighting it, fighting and fighting it from the new freedom thing. So you
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:31.840]  need a little pocket dictionary that translates government speech into plain speech. I know
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:36.240]  that's what you do with your website and stuff, but people have to systematically do that. Amy
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:42.720]  Filo has the website Unite for Life.org, which is challenging the Mothers Act, which is an incredible
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:48.800]  example of Orwellian language. My website is wildestcolds.com. Our website challenging
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:55.920]  psychiatric electroshock is endofshock.com. Electroshock is the backup treatment to the drugs.
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:00.880]  That's making a comeback now. They are forcibly treating this met treating. See,
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:06.640]  that's another thing. They're forcibly shocking this man in Minnesota right now on an outpatient
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:12.400]  basis and where they pick him up at his home and take him into the, to the lock up and shock him
[2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:17.600]  and then drive him back home. Unbelievable. They're forcibly giving electroshocks to people in New
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:23.520]  York in the hundreds of electroshocks. In Texas, there's thousands of people being electroshock.
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:27.200]  We're going to have you. In fact, let's set you up the next few months to do a whole hour on that
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:31.680]  because I had the American Psychological Association psychology today call me. They're
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:36.400]  doing a big hit piece and I brought up to him that the lobotomies were done by a lunatic with an
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:40.800]  ice pick who would just jam it in people's heads in front of crowds and like carnivals.
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:45.360]  And he tried to deny that to me on the phone and I sent him the encyclopedia about it.
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:49.680]  I mean, do you think that guy at psychology today is in denial or is he playing games?
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:54.880]  Psychology today is pretty pathetic. They take a lot of ads from drug companies and they,
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:59.680]  they're pretty much bought into biological psychiatry. I don't know about that particular
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:05.600]  guy, but it's amazing how ignorant people are of history. You know about the ice pick in the
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:09.760]  head thing, don't you? Oh yeah, Freeman, you know, he went around with his lobotomobile and
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:15.600]  stuck ice picks in people's eyes and kids and it's like Hellraiser and he did thousands and
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:21.120]  thousands of them. The person who invented the lobotomy got the Nobel Prize. The history of
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:26.400]  psychiatry just like the history of eugenics is a horrific one. Hey, you know what? Let's have
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:31.760]  you in for two hours, like in a month to do the history of it. That would be awesome. Yeah.
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:35.760]  One of my favorite historians, Howard Zen, he says, you know, if you don't know history,
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:40.720]  it's like you were born yesterday. You're just a fool and so it's good to know. Oh, that's a
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:45.120]  great saying. If you don't know history, it's like you were born yesterday. Dr. John Breeding,
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:52.160]  fire out your website for folks one more time. wildestcoats.com. God bless you, Alex and carry on.
[2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:56.560]  Hey, great having you here. infowars.com is our website. Your call is tons of news. Another big
[2:04:56.560 --> 2:05:03.760]  guess straight ahead. Stay with us. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time
[2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:07.680]  it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:11.840]  independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:16.080]  until you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take
[2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:20.400]  care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:25.200]  family in the final equation, but you know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to shift horrible
[2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:30.080]  food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports, and they do it at

[2:06:00.320 --> 2:06:04.560]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:06:04.560 --> 2:06:09.040]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:13.760]  environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:17.520]  municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:22.480]  reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:06:22.480 --> 2:06:27.600]  The E. coli blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:32.240]  and your family's drinking water. The E. coli blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from
[2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:37.200]  the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis,
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:42.800]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques. That's right. Clean water right from the air you
[2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:52.640]  breathe. Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043. That's 1-800-691-6043, or visit E. coli blue on the

[2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:07.680]  that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center,
[2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:12.320]  buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[2:08:01.440 --> 2:08:07.120]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:18.720]  Okay, let's take some phone calls and I'm getting into the whole latest
[2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:28.240]  flu developments. We're in August, September, October and their stage pandemic is just
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:37.120]  minutes away in the scheme of things. All this FEMA camp news. I want to go over what the actual
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:43.760]  healthcare bill does. It's just amazing. Stan in Missouri, you're on the air. Stan, go ahead.
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:52.080]  Hello, Alex. I've been listening to you. I'm going to tell you all, the only way you're going
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:56.160]  to make it through this, you're going to have to have some kind of special forces training,
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:01.840]  combat training, wilderness survival training, winter training, mountain training, or been
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:06.240]  in police training and firearms training, Alex, because they're going to come at us. This is
[2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:10.800]  for real. If everything they've got, people have got this Rambo mentality. I talk to these
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:15.120]  civilians all the time. They think they're going to be like Rambo. They have no concept what we're
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:19.840]  in for. These military people, they're going to be wearing flat, flat jacks. They're going to have
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:24.480]  every special flat jacks that are flame resistant and everything else.
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:33.920]  Well, a lot of the military is waking up though and the establishment is able to brainwash the
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:38.720]  public and they're testing the waters right now. They've got their finger in the air. They think
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:43.600]  the public's going to go along with this takeover. Then they're going to launch it. That's why we
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:49.840]  have got to be getting the word out at city councils and on talk radio and on access TV and
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:57.280]  letters to the editor like our lives depend on it because they do. And there is no doubt this is
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:10:02.240]  all part of a larger master plan that I want to simply and succinctly boil down coming up in the
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:12.080]  next segment, but it's good to hear from you. Stan, I appreciate your call. There's no doubt the
[2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:18.160]  flu is a hoax and then there's no doubt there's a massive buildup in and around it. The question is,
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:24.160]  is it just high to get vaccine sales and to further expand federal and international control
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:32.080]  and the UN's auspices of being in command under the level six pandemic? Or are all the
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:40.000]  FEMA camps and mass graves and massive preparation we've seen in preparation for a controlled
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:45.360]  bio weapon they're going to release that will actually kill a bunch of people that will then
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:51.520]  cause a panic and scare the population to take the shots, which we know our government and other
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:11:03.120]  governments have been caught adding cancer viruses to and hormones to sterilize women.
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:07.360]  But they don't even need that their own GMO foods they've engineered have been proven
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:12.480]  to have had their genetics changed to sterilize or lower fertility in all mammal species.
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:18.080]  That's why many places they've stopped feeding GMO to pigs and cows and things because then
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:23.680]  they can't even have babies. Folks, I mean, it's eugenics. They write textbooks on it. It's real.
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:28.560]  I'm sorry. That's frightening and crazy. Believe me. It's hard for me to believe,
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:36.000]  but it's true. The facts are the facts. The army is advertising for concentration camp guards.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:49.840]  You can't make this type of stuff up. You can't do it. This is taking over my whole life. They now
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:58.080]  admit their chemtrail is maybe on a prison planet.TV show later in the week. I should
[2:11:58.080 --> 2:12:04.800]  do a chemtrail show because we have all these FAA documents now from the FAA with the chemtrail
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:10.560]  flights plotting them and how they're spraying us. I mean, folks, we're living in the twilight zone.
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:15.200]  It's almost like we're living on a planet hurtling through space. Oh wait, we are.
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:20.160]  Everybody's looking out at the dirt instead of looking up around them. I mean, we're in the
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:39.840]  middle of a wild incredible universe. Oh man. And there is a lot of incredibly amazing good stuff
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:46.400]  and there's a lot of incredibly amazing bad stuff and I like the good stuff and I don't like the
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:51.760]  bad stuff and we need to get the people to recognize the bad stuff so that we can start
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:59.840]  cleaning house and getting it under control. You know, I looked at those FBI guys that were here
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:05.600]  Friday and I said, you think you can win? I go, you better pick which side you're on because
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:11.600]  even if you don't know it, you're on my side. Even if you don't recognize it, you're under attack
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:19.360]  by the very same eugenicist. And I said, don't drink the tap water. Don't take the vaccines.
[2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:28.880]  And I said, your investigators, you go investigate eugenics.
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:39.200]  And I have the research. I have the confidence. I have the facts. I know I'm telling the truth
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:47.680]  and both of them were shook up when they left here because I told them, I said, my life doesn't
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:54.320]  even matter in the whole scheme of things. This is a great evil we face and you need to choose
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:14:00.080]  which side you're on. And a spiritual level, the hair on the back of their necks was standing up.
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:05.040]  I could see it in their eyes, see it in their faces. It wasn't some good cop, bad cop act because
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:11.920]  everybody fundamentally knows at their gut level that things aren't good, that things are serious,
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:17.200]  that there is a threat. And the establishment or masters of mind control, they know we have a sixth
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:24.480]  sense, a deep, instinctual understanding that we're all in danger. So they say, yes, that
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:30.240]  instinct you feel is al-Qaeda. You're afraid of al-Qaeda. And people go, yeah, I am afraid of
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:36.960]  something. Wait, it's you. It's you I'm afraid of. It's you I'm concerned about. And then now they
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:45.120]  admit the whole system of control, the whole police state grid that they've built is for veterans and
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:51.280]  gun owners and landowners, the very people who aren't going to roll over for the open Sovietization
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:56.640]  of this country. It happened in Germany. It happened in China. It happens in everywhere else.
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:01.440]  Everywhere else gets taken over by tyrants. And now it's happening to England and the United States,
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:07.840]  Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The last somewhat free nations are falling right now
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:13.840]  into scientific dictatorship. And it's not good for 99.99% of us.
[2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:21.440]  Matt and Alabama, Matt, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. How are you doing today? Good, sir.
[2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:27.040]  I'm a first-time caller. And I just want to bring two real quick points up to you.
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:33.520]  Did you know that China was absent for the T-bill sales five and seven year T-bill sales last week?
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:40.400]  Yes. Foreign governments are stopping to buy the treasury bills. We are on the total verge of
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:47.520]  collapse. The globalists wanted to fear monger the economic collapse to sell the American people
[2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:52.720]  on giving in to the new bank of the world. But it over destroyed confidence. So they're now
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:58.960]  balancing saying that recession, the depression's over. Everything's fine because they've now
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:04.960]  overdone it. And it looks like the T-bills may default. And then all hell is going to break
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:12.640]  loose economically. We have got time bombs ticking economically, societally, militarily on every
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:18.800]  front. And I know one of them is going to blow. And what happens when one blows? The others are
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:23.920]  going to blow sky high. We are on the verge of plunging into something that's going to make
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:30.560]  World War II look like a game of tiddlywinks. And I can't get the average person to wake up and
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:38.560]  realize it. Yeah, I have a problem with that as well. It's like just getting people to understand
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:43.520]  that there's something big going on than what would have been perceived in front of people's
[2:16:43.520 --> 2:16:50.720]  face. And it's not just on a, I believe it's on a spiritual level as well, where you got
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:58.960]  good and evil. You're battling between good and evil. That's what it is. It's millions
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:04.720]  of evil control freaks and sadists and sociopaths and psychopaths all working for their own greedy
[2:17:04.720 --> 2:17:12.080]  aims, but in colonies and crews and like pirate gangs. And all together it creates this giant,
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:18.560]  powerful, evil mutation. And just like we, you know, we communicate societally in kind of a
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:24.080]  group mind. They operate under that as well. I mean, they have scientific algorithms for this.
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:31.360]  They know what they're doing. Yeah, I know. I know. I mean, it's hard to keep positive mind,
[2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:37.680]  but I mean, even though you might not be here in this earth, there's something better after it.
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:42.320]  And there is a God bless you, my friend. I appreciate your call. Look,
[2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:49.360]  we got to beat this thing for our children and other innocence. And that's the heart of being a
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:55.920]  man is not looking for a fight, not looking to end your life, not looking to, but just saying,
[2:17:55.920 --> 2:17:59.680]  I'm doing the right thing, whatever happens, happens. And you're just laughing about it.
[2:17:59.680 --> 2:18:04.640]  I mean, you know, I've gone from years ago being scared of this stuff to then not being scared,
[2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:09.520]  but being focused to now. I just think it's funny. I mean, my own life. I just, I just don't,
[2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:16.880]  I am just far beyond their reach now. And I, I know whatever happens to me in the end,
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:24.000]  it's all part of God's plan. I'm not worried about it. Let's talk to Casey in Indiana. Casey,
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:30.800]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex Jones. I just wanted to let you know that I'm a big fan
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:38.800]  of your show and I believe in what you're doing. And, and I wanted to talk to you about my experiences
[2:18:39.680 --> 2:18:45.040]  trying to wake people up and also a few other things. What do they do? Stick your thumb in their
[2:18:45.040 --> 2:18:52.240]  mouth and suck it. Move on. They're people that want to be slaves. I wish it was that easy.
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:58.080]  And you know, the average Joe that just, we, we, uh, we downloaded a bunch of your movies
[2:18:58.080 --> 2:19:04.160]  on, uh, to blind CD DVDs and pass it out at the county fair to, you know, everybody who would
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:11.200]  take one, sit there and talk to them and talk to them, try to explain them. And it was, it was a
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:17.040]  success because we got people to take the movie. And if they do what they say, they'll watch it.
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:24.320]  See, see, and I mean, here's the deal and I'll hold you over. Here's the issue. A lot of people,
[2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:29.040]  it's just an experience to talk to somebody out in public. Everybody's gotten these little comfort
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:34.480]  zones, these little bubbles, the security guards and cops come over and boss you around. We become
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:42.000]  broke back. And so just the experience of having a fellow slave talk to them and give them info
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  and to have someone talk to them about something other than sports or acting cool, uh, or something
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:53.440]  like that is revolutionary. So just communicating. And then they're going to watch the films and
[2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:57.760]  then they're going to talk to others. So what you're doing is changing the world and will bring
[2:19:57.760 --> 2:20:04.000]  the globalists to their knees. Stay there. Heart related health problems affect millions of people
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:08.960]  each year. Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood

[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:10.480]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:16.560]  world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[2:21:16.560 --> 2:21:22.240]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. Well Obama's already fudging.
[2:21:22.240 --> 2:21:27.200]  Yeah, fudged since day one of this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:33.520]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:41.440]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:49.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of

[2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:25.920]  This happens every three or four months. The phone system just died.
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:32.640]  So Casey and Joe and Mike and Jay and Travis, everybody, you can call back again
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:39.120]  whenever the Genesis phones work again or we have our own backup system. I might just give those
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:48.400]  out. I want to just say something. Paul Hartman is incredible. I'm trying to get back in shape so I
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:53.600]  was doing a lot of back exercises weekend, not even that heavy. And two days later, my whole
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:58.880]  back was seized up tight, aching, throbbing right in the middle. And he said, here, I'll pop your back
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:04.560]  and he knew what he was doing. I mean, he picked me up way off the ground and I'm not as big as I
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:09.440]  used to be. So I guess I'm not, it's not that big of a feat, but 230 pounds off the ground. I was
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:17.680]  two, almost 270 folks, 267. And he just let my legs hang and my back went pop, pop, pop, pop and
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:27.280]  90% of the throbbing pain is gone. Now it's like a memory. Unbelievable. He's definitely got his job
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:32.800]  secure around here now for like the ones we twice a year when my back seized up. I didn't even go
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:36.960]  live at prison planet.TV because it was hurting so bad. I didn't want to have the added postural
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:41.440]  focus to sit there and look at the camera. So I will now go live next hour. Thanks to that.
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:47.360]  Oh my God. You know, if I had gone to a medical doctor for that, they'd have put me in for surgery
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:50.560]  or something because that's how they make their money. And that's what they do. They cut, burn,
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:56.400]  and poison. But no, instead I just got my back pop and I feel great now. I can go for, I didn't
[2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:01.280]  even go jogging this morning. I wasn't so much pain. So now I can go jogging tonight. Good job,
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:08.160]  Hartman. There goes one for team Hoosh. Okay. The computers or the computer phone system,
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:18.640]  whatever it is, the T1 just came back up. So 1-800-259-9231. You know, I, I promise to get into
[2:26:20.800 --> 2:26:26.640]  the flu situation and I promise to get into the FEMA camp and all these video clips I've got.
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:31.440]  And then I do have Phil Bird popping in because this,
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:39.760]  this birther situation has now reached absolute crescendo. Well, I would say it's a crescendo
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:46.080]  building to its penultimate, penultimate is number two, building to its paramount peak
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:56.800]  to its maximum. But I believe this is its penultimate. This is, this is, this is a big
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:01.040]  explosion, but I don't believe the final growth curve of this.
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:07.360]  I mean, this is getting crazy. So that's coming up. I'm on about 20 minutes.
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:12.880]  I got Dr. Jerome Corsi who's also weighing in big on the birther situation,
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:22.320]  joining us coming up on Friday. We've got a bunch of different medical doctors coming on this week
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:26.960]  with their perspective almost really happening with the flu fear mongering.
[2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:32.160]  They already tried SARS and bird flu. What's really going on with that?
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:37.040]  And we've got Wednesday for two hours, Steve Quayle. That is going to be
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:39.040]  interesting. He's got a lot of inside intel and
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:48.720]  so that is all coming up right now. Was it Casey or Matt I was talking to last,
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:52.720]  who was telling the story about the fairgrounds and giving out the videos.
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:58.400]  Yeah, Matt never got back in on the line. Well, too bad. You know, he was,
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:02.480]  he was talking about, he's, I'm having problems waking people up and I said, what,
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:06.960]  they're idiots. And then he never, he never got to the end of his story. So I wanted to hear it.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:13.520]  Sounded like it was going in the direction of the police are telling me I can't hand those out
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:19.520]  now, but other people can hand their stuff out. I got one of those calls yesterday.
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:23.920]  Hell, people been arrested in the news for handing my videos out.
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:27.680]  And the police later have to apologize when the citizens fight it. But
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:32.720]  how do you, how does a cop get to the point of where they think they can just walk out on the
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:37.440]  side of a sidewalk somewhere and tell a citizen they can't have a sandwich board saying 9 11's
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:45.120]  an inside job or impeach Obama or impeach Bush. I mean, it's so in America to say free speech zones.
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:51.760]  But again, I know a lot of police aren't bad. It's just so many are bad and
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:56.240]  the bad ones are in command by and large, giving all these evil orders.
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:03.920]  So get back in on the line while we still have one line open Matt in Alabama,
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:11.680]  1-800-259-9231. And we'll take a few calls. Then I'm going to,
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:16.720]  I'm going to just do a news blitz to cover all the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[2:29:16.720 --> 2:29:20.720]  And then at the last 40 minutes of the show, I'll do the flu and the military. I promise
[2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:27.280]  in detail. It's kind of upsetting to psychologically focus in on those files in my brain. But
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:29.440]  that's why I'm kind of procrastinating, but I'll do it.
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:36.080]  Also, I know I don't have words or intellect to describe all the thousands of nexus points and
[2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:42.960]  just how real and serious it is. But bottom line, we have a very dangerous buildup of enemy forces
[2:29:43.760 --> 2:29:47.360]  and propaganda right now. And it looks like they may be getting ready for their biggest
[2:29:47.360 --> 2:29:54.320]  attack on free humanity ever. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.320 --> 2:30:03.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:06.960]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one,
[2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:10.880]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[2:30:10.880 --> 2:30:16.080]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:21.200]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:30:21.200 --> 2:30:25.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:28.400]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[2:30:28.400 --> 2:30:32.720]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:37.520]  lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[2:30:37.520 --> 2:30:41.680]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:46.000]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more

[2:33:13.120 --> 2:33:18.000]  Okay, well Casey in Indiana is on the line. He is the caller who was saying he was handing
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:23.680]  him out at the fairgrounds. So quickly Casey, what is your problem then? I mean the people
[2:33:23.680 --> 2:33:29.200]  are taking the DVDs and promising to watch them. What is your problem? Oh, well, uh,
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:34.080]  the pro, there's really no problem. You know, I got, I got quite a bit of people to take them,
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:40.960]  but you know, I ran into the average dumbed down American and some of them would sit there
[2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:46.400]  and listen to me talk and they would accept what I was saying, but some of them when they heard me
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:51.120]  say Obama deception, they would be like, Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're wrong. If
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:56.480]  he wanted Obama out of the office, then that movie is wrong. You know, the way to approach it is to
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:03.920]  say, Oh, Bush and Obama are both just front men, whether you love them or hate them. This has to
[2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:09.760]  do with how the banks are ripping you off and solutions or Hey, this is the big picture. I
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:15.920]  see, I wouldn't approach it from a partisan position. The name Obama deception is because
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:20.080]  it's about the fact that it's a deception and he runs anything. And then we need to
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:25.360]  depoliticize it. So I think you'll be more successful. If you approach it from that,
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:30.080]  because I would imagine the folks that were greedily wanting it were George Bush supporters,
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:34.560]  but that's even better because it's really designed for them. They think they're getting
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:39.360]  a movie that is bashing Obama. So what happens is they end up watching it with an open mind and
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:46.160]  I've had family. This has happened to completely deprogrammed. We're mad at me. We're angry at me.
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:51.120]  Some of them had worked in intelligence, thought I was anti-American. You know, well,
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:54.400]  I know the government does evil stuff, but I can't believe they did that to the towers.
[2:34:54.960 --> 2:35:01.280]  They saw the Obama deception completely broke their conditioning because then they finally
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:06.000]  saw the map, the false left, right paradigm, how they've been played their whole life. So
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:10.880]  then Democrats watch it because they're angry and want to debunk it. And the first five minutes I
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:16.480]  attack Bush and then they go, oh, wait, I'll watch this. Look, it's designed to shatter the left,
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:23.280]  right paradigm. It is my grand slam out of the park. Go ahead. Yeah. You know, I made sure I
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:30.720]  actually got a few standing ovations. You know, I felt I had a very well planned out speech that I
[2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:39.200]  would end. So you were in the ancient experience of liberty. We're standing amongst your peers,
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:45.600]  like in the town square, speaking. We were walking in saying we're leading the American
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:51.360]  Revolution. You know, we're fighting right beside you, Alex Jones. We are, you know, speaking for
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:57.920]  the youth of this country. I'm 19 years old and I, and I for one, am not going to take this. I will
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:03.040]  fight against this cause until the day I die or until they change it because, you know, that's
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:08.640]  how the civil rights was born. They didn't stand up. They showed the world how it was wrong and
[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:14.640]  then everybody else realized, hey, that is wrong. And, you know, the first caller you got said,
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:21.520]  we need to get ourselves and prepared for ammunition and fighting. And I mean, you know,
[2:36:21.520 --> 2:36:28.800]  if it comes down to that, that's what you got to do. But I believe if we, if we take Dr. King's
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:34.800]  route, you know, and show them hitting us and us not doing back, then everybody else is going to
[2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:40.800]  see who, who's the Batman if they don't want to listen to what everything else that we're telling
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  them. Absolutely. My friend, it is good to hear your great points and keep up the good work. So
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:56.160]  there he is going to the town square, going to the town fair, standing up on top of the steps,
[2:36:56.160 --> 2:37:05.120]  giving speeches and getting standing ovations and handing out DVDs. That is 110% pure American
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:13.200]  spirit of 1776. That, that assured commitment that all our actions together are going to beat
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:19.680]  these people that focused, you know, in the face of ridicule, he ends up getting a standing ovation.
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:24.800]  And, and that is what I'm hearing more and more. Let me tell you, I go speak to crowds
[2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:28.240]  14 years ago and get laughed at. That doesn't happen now.
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:36.160]  You know, now I've got government people. It doesn't matter listening to what I have to say,
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:43.680]  because folks know everybody's in danger. This is a very disgusting, sickening system. The elites
[2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:48.160]  have set up because the elites are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Some families are worth
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:54.240]  more than that. And they're decadent and they just want to control people. And this is the
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:59.520]  type of stuff that elites do throughout history. It's very bizarre. They've got all the chateaus
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:04.320]  and all the power and all the money and all the sex and they want to start wars and control
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:08.720]  populations and destroy nations. This is what they do throughout history. It is a fact.
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:12.640]  I'm going to do something a little bit different in about 10 minutes. I'm going to go live at
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:16.880]  prisonplanet.tv. I don't normally go live in the middle of a segment, but I want to play some video
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:22.560]  clips and they're more effective and people can actually see them in posterity for the
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:28.000]  prisonplanet.tv viewers. So go ahead and go to prisonplanet.tv if you're a member and stand by
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.480]  because we're going live in about five, six minutes through this news blitz I've got. I'm going to
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:38.400]  play some video clips first and comment on them like uncovered. Obama explains how healthcare plan
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.920]  will eliminate private insurance. See, that is the plan. Read the bill. But this is from his own
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.800]  words. Also, vera chips for workers at airports. The government wants to implant workers at airports.
[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:53.040]  That's just off the charts, but I'm so conditioned that it's no big deal that
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:58.240]  it's kind of, you know, and in a side issue, they want to make you take chips. I mean,
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:03.760]  this is getting twilight zone mainstream news and I wanted to integrate it with an older story.
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:09.280]  Government issued stun bracelets for all airline passengers. Homeland security has had meetings
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:14.800]  and has proposed this. This is the might where we all wear shocker bracelets.
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:22.800]  I mean, that's right out of the running man. In another video clip, Lloyd dogged meeting of
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:32.080]  Obamacare in South Austin, Saturday, a huge crowd of Democrats booed him and completely
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:44.960]  shot him down. I went to school with his nephew. Dogged's a real piece of work. One time in high
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:49.360]  school, even went over to dogged's house because I was getting a ride home from school from his
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:53.200]  nephew and he had to drop by there and bring something and dogged was walking around like a
[2:39:53.200 --> 2:40:01.680]  vampire in the front yard. Anyways, I'm so sick of him because let me tell you, the people were
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:06.400]  on the edge of revolt and that's why the system is rushing to get everything they want in place now
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:10.400]  because they know once they pull the rug out and we're total depression, the public isn't going
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:17.200]  along with anything. That's why they want amnesty, gun grabbing, the carbon tax, the socialized
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:22.960]  healthcare. They got to get their new bank of the world now. They got to get everything now.
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:28.320]  They're on the defensive. The Federal Reserve is now universally hated. Nobody knew what it was
[2:40:28.320 --> 2:40:34.160]  two years ago. We're having victory after victory so the enemy is going to strike. You blow up their
[2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:39.040]  Death Star. The Empire is going to strike back with the Executor. And let me tell you, they are
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:45.760]  coming at us right now, ladies and gentlemen. You better believe it. But that's what a fight's
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:50.720]  all about. They're not giving up without a fight. We got to discredit these murderers,
[2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:55.360]  these criminals, so that's coming up as well. But right now, I want to bring Ted Anderson up
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:41:04.080]  because gold is exploded in price again and Ted happens to have gold. This is what Ted does.
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:07.840]  You know, Ted will sell you gold when it's down. He'll sell it to you when it's up. But he knows
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:15.360]  people like to buy when it's up for some reason. Well, guess what Ted does then? Ted Anderson,
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:18.800]  the trusted name of precious metals, gold and silver. Well, I get my gold and silver. The
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:23.280]  best price is out there bar none. And he's a patriot, big supporter of the campaign for Liberty
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:27.600]  and Ron Paul. He's the guy with all the airplanes you saw flying around the country with the messages
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:35.600]  of Liberty. Ted Anderson buys gold when it's low and sells it to you when it's high at the low price.
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:42.800]  That's his big secret. And it's no secret at all. And so I wanted to bring Ted up for a few
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.520]  minutes. Ted, good to have you here with us. Yeah, it's always good to be up there with you, Alex.
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:52.960]  I really appreciate it. The fact that the, that the plunge protection team stepped in the middle
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:57.840]  of last week and it was, and allowed me to buy gold at a lower price again. But it didn't take
[2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:02.640]  long for it to come shooting back up though. That's right. They propped up the stock market,
[2:42:02.640 --> 2:42:06.880]  drove it down, but now it's shooting up again. And I meant to cover this. I did mention it last
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:12.560]  week. The Chinese and others bought no U.S. Treasuries last week when it was open for sale.
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:18.160]  And so the Federal Reserve, you know, had to basically with our tax money buy its own crud
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:23.360]  from the Treasury. So they're already monetizing debt. They're monetizing it in a big way, Alex.
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:27.760]  And that means a lot of inflation. That's a lot of new money that's being printed,
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:31.920]  added into the system. It's competing with the money that we've earned. There's no way that the
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:37.920]  United States dollar is going to hold value with that kind of activity. But that's why
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:44.000]  the Federal Reserve pays banks not to loan so that the inflation isn't caused. So our tax money
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:49.120]  money is only used then to buy up infrastructure because they believe that doesn't trickle down
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:55.360]  to the people. This whole $23.7 trillion is not meant to trickle, but it still is because
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:42:59.600]  all these bankers are stealing it. They're buying mansions. They're buying yachts. They're buying
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:03.920]  hookers. And so it is going to start pushing the inflation.
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:09.120]  Oh, it sure will, Alex. There's no question about it. You just can't monetize a currency
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:15.440]  that's based upon fiat without having the destruction of the value. It just, it comes
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:20.720]  hand in hand. If the Chinese don't want the U.S. dollar and they've got one point or they got
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:26.160]  $3.3 trillion of this commodity and they start selling it, what do you think is going to happen?
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:30.480]  The value is going to go down. That's what's going to happen. But I did have an opportunity,
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:36.960]  like you said, Alex, and I'm still holding my prices. I've got Frank still 216 and I still
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:44.160]  have British sovereigns at 266. That's relative to the price at 913. And we're sitting here
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:53.440]  with gold seeing a high today of 963 and silver right now $14.50 at its high. I mean, that's,
[2:43:53.440 --> 2:43:58.720]  I mean, that's, I'm like those Lakota coins, they're jumping over 20 bucks a piece. Now,
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:04.400]  I've got them at 1974. I still have the walking liberties when silver was down there at 11 at
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:10.080]  869. I still have those at 869. And I just can't say it enough. I mean, there's way too much
[2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:15.520]  trouble out there, Alex. People need to consider gold and silver. And you know, don't get lulled
[2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:19.840]  into this thought that you can make a lot of money on the stock market right now, because there's
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:24.240]  just way too much trouble out there. The United States government is trying to finance its way
[2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:29.680]  out of its problems by going further into debt. And that's a solution for catastrophe, not a
[2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:37.120]  solution for a strong economic future. Well, absolutely. Ted, I've never seen you hold a
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:42.160]  special this long. You thought you were going to sell out, but I guess you've still got some left,
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:46.400]  or I guess you were able to buy at that original low price. Well, I was able to go a month ago.
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:50.240]  I mean, I was able to cost average in Alex. I mean, they did. They beat up gold last week,
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:54.720]  and it gave me that opportunity to go in there. I mean, I had, I mean, I thought I was on vacation
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:58.320]  instead of on the phone with Mona and I'm like trying to figure out what I can buy and get my
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:04.640]  hands on at the lower prices. You know, okay, well, Ted, to be specific, though, so this is gold at
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:14.480]  the 9 11 or 9 10 level silver at a level much lower with it with both up big time gold up at
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:22.080]  9 55. So do the math. That's a 40 plus dollar increase. And so you're passing those savings
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:27.760]  on that's factored into an already great deal on British sovereigns, European Franks, that's
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:32.480]  French and Swiss and others. And what do you have in the silver department at that low price?
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:37.040]  Well, the best buy I have in silver right now are the walking Liberty haves. And I know a lot
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:43.440]  of people like those Lakota coins too. I'm selling them at $19 and 74 cents. Everybody else is in
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:48.880]  the 20s now with that coin. And I just need to tell you, that's a great buy. But the walking
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:53.120]  Liberty haves are a sleeper. I mean, I'm, I'm going to sell out of that inventory and I'm going to
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:58.560]  have to raise my prices just because my costs are going up too. And, and I can't afford to sell
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:03.200]  something for, for less than what I had paid. It just simply, I won't be in business, neither
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:07.600]  with anybody else. So I would suggest that you take advantage of these buys. It's a great time
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:14.480]  to be getting in. It's an insanely good time to get in. And with the notice, they're coming out
[2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:18.720]  Ted and saying the economy is now doing great when unemployment and every other indicator is
[2:46:18.720 --> 2:46:23.600]  we're in deep trouble and it's only accelerating. That is pure desperation by the establishment.
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:31.840]  They wanted to fear monger and say the economy was dead earlier on because they wanted to terrorize
[2:46:31.840 --> 2:46:37.840]  everybody into giving unlimited banking power and tens of trillions to quote, get the market going.
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:42.640]  But now that they see their fear mongering overdid it, the Chinese and others aren't buying US
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:46.560]  treasury notes. They're now saying, Oh no, everything's fine. Everything's blown over.
[2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:51.600]  And they've been saying that, of course, for three years off and on. So I only see this blowing
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:56.160]  up in their face, unfortunately, because this is going to be bad for all of us. Folks need to get
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:03.440]  into gold and silver today. You couldn't find a better deal to get into this market. 800-686-2237,
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:10.800]  800-686-2237 on the silver half dollars and the gold coins that deals you're not going to find
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:17.840]  anywhere else. 800-686-2237. And the brokers are going to be there until midnight central
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:25.600]  standard time. That's 10 p.m. Pacific tonight. 1-800-686-2237. If you don't get anybody tonight,
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:29.360]  leave your name and number. They'll call you back tomorrow and Ted will hold that deal over.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:34.480]  800-686-2237. Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:39.200]  Well, again, it's about my inventory, how long it lasts and how many people call for it. But I
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:42.880]  have to say, I'll probably have it through midnight tonight and we'll just take a look and see what's
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:52.480]  going on tomorrow. So, all right, 800-686-2237. Ted Anderson, thank you so much. Yeah, thanks for
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:57.440]  having me up, Alex. You bet. I hope folks take advantage. 800-686-2237.
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:08.160]  All right, folks, we are simulcasting the last hour and 12 minutes or so today at prisonplanet.tv
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:13.840]  and I want to play a few video clips here now and analyze them and break them down.
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:20.960]  We come back from break, all of Obama's major surrogates, Axelrod and others. The White House
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:26.400]  Chief of Staff, of course, as well, Rahm Emanuel, are on TV this Sunday saying we never said we
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:31.840]  weren't going to raise taxes on everybody. We have to. Carbon taxes, healthcare taxes, income
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.960]  taxes. If you make more than $30,000 a year, we're going to raise your taxes. We never made
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:43.200]  that pledge that you were delusional. You never heard that. I mean, this is incredible. Also,
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:55.440]  Obama said that he was never going to shut down the regular healthcare system, that it's crazy,
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:49:01.280]  that there's no plan to federalize things and have national healthcare. But the bill says that
[2:49:01.280 --> 2:49:11.280]  and does that. So I want to go over some of the facts and what this plan really does versus what
[2:49:11.280 --> 2:49:17.280]  Obama is saying coming up after this quick break. But the first thing we're going to play is his
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:23.600]  lie. Here is Obama going back on the lie though. This is him a year and a half ago admitting
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:27.600]  they're going to get rid of regular insurance and take over. But now he's lying and saying he never
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:35.360]  said this. You decide which Obama to believe. Here he is. Evidence Obama and the Dems healthcare
[2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:42.720]  goal is government public option. The public option is not your enemy. It is your friend,
[2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:49.680]  I believe. Let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward by those who
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:54.880]  are claiming that a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payer system.
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:50:00.160]  My commitment is to make sure that we've got universal healthcare for all Americans by the
[2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:10.320]  end of my first term as president. I would hope that we set up a system that allows those who
[2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:16.720]  can go through their employer to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort.
[2:50:18.320 --> 2:50:21.120]  Obama admitting the plan to eliminate private insurance.
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:25.440]  But I don't think we're going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately.
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:31.600]  There's going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:37.280]  out or 20 years out. I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal healthcare claim.
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:42.240]  A single-payer healthcare claim. Universal healthcare claim. That's what I'd like to see.
[2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:47.040]  I think if we get a good public option it could reach a single-payer and that's the best way to
[2:50:47.040 --> 2:50:52.560]  reach a single-payer. And next to me was a guy from the insurance company who then-
[2:50:52.560 --> 2:50:56.160]  Okay, there you have it. They go on and on admitting what they're doing.
[2:50:56.160 --> 2:50:58.320]  But now they lie to you. These are criminals.
[2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:04.480]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:08.400]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:12.080]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[2:51:12.080 --> 2:51:17.280]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[2:51:17.280 --> 2:51:21.200]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[2:51:21.200 --> 2:51:24.640]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water,
[2:51:24.640 --> 2:51:27.280]  making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:32.160]  From the smallest to the largest systems, bigberkeywaterfilters.com has what you need.

[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:07.200]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:11.840]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:14.800]  just as strong, just as well-funded.
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:18.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:21.360]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[2:52:21.360 --> 2:52:25.840]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:30.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:52:30.160 --> 2:52:36.080]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:37.440]  that's fascism.
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:40.960]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:47.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:52:56.080 --> 2:52:58.960]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:53:00.640 --> 2:53:02.320]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[2:53:02.320 --> 2:53:04.080]  What does humidity mean to you?
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:06.800]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days,
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:11.920]  but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:13.440]  That's why I'd like you to visit.
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:19.040]  AkolaBlue.com, AkolaBlue, is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator

[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:23.120]  Okay, so there you have it.
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:25.600]  Getting rid of employers,
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:30.480]  gathering the money, running the system.
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:33.520]  Your paycheck money will go to the government.
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:35.600]  They'll keep it, give it to offshore banks,
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:38.160]  and when you have a heart attack, they'll give you an aspirin.
[2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:39.680]  That's socialized health care.
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:45.120]  Where all the services are to pay taxes to offshore banks,
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:47.360]  who made up the fiat currency to begin with.
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:50.320]  That's all this is.
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:55.920]  And if you go over the health care bill, page by page,
[2:54:56.720 --> 2:55:00.560]  you'll be required to take the government option, page 16,
[2:55:01.280 --> 2:55:04.640]  mandates audits of all employers that self-insure.
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:11.280]  So then the push is for employers just to stop giving you insurance.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:15.920]  Page 30, government committee will decide what treatments and benefits you get.
[2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:18.720]  And unlike an insurer, there will be no appeals process.
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:20.240]  Yeah, there's no liability here.
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:22.400]  The government health care is hellish.
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:27.520]  I always run into these idiots in the U.S. who think it's great,
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:29.840]  then you meet a Brett, or you meet a German,
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:32.240]  or you meet somebody from Canada, and they're like, it's horrible.
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:38.400]  The health choice commissioner will decide health benefits for you.
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:39.920]  You will have no choice, none.
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:42.240]  Page 42, you can go read the bill.
[2:55:42.240 --> 2:55:42.960]  I check this.
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:46.720]  Page 50, all non-U.S. citizens illegal or not
[2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:49.200]  will be provided with free health care services.
[2:55:49.920 --> 2:55:53.600]  That'll bring more tens of millions of illegals to further bankrupt the country.
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:55:56.320]  I mean, we can't pay for the whole world.
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:55:57.120]  Sorry, folks.
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:00.800]  Every person will be issued a national ID health card.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:02.640]  That's your national ID card.
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:04.960]  Just like Social Security was used to set that up.
[2:56:06.640 --> 2:56:08.640]  Federal government will have direct,
[2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:12.720]  real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer.
[2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:16.960]  That's just like some of the Scandinavian countries where they automatically just
[2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:18.640]  take money out of everybody's accounts.
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:21.040]  Everything's moving towards this casual society.
[2:56:21.040 --> 2:56:21.680]  It's hellish.
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:25.680]  This is the total federal takeover, the global takeover.
[2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:31.840]  Taxpayers will subsidize all union retiree and community organizer health plans.
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:36.000]  All private health care plans must conform to government rules
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  to participate in a health care exchange.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:41.200]  All private health care plans must participate in health care exchange.
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:44.320]  Page 91, government mandates,
[2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:46.560]  linguistic infrastructure for services,
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:48.960]  translation, illegal aliens.
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:52.400]  Page 95, the government will pay Acorn and AmeriCorps
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:56:54.560]  to sign up individuals for government-run health care plan.
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:58.240]  Those eligible for Medicaid will be automatically enrolled.
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:56:59.840]  You have no choice in the matter.
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:03.600]  Page 124, no company can sue the government for price-fixing.
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:06.560]  No judicial review is permitted against the government monopoly.
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:08.720]  Put simply, private insurers will be crushed.
[2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:09.760]  I mean, I went and read the bill.
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:11.760]  I didn't just believe this when I read it.
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:14.640]  Page 127, the AMA sold doctors out.
[2:57:14.640 --> 2:57:16.080]  The government will set wages.
[2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:21.520]  Now, the good news is nobody's buying this.
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:24.480]  Everywhere congressmen go, this is South Austin.
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:29.920]  This was at a meeting a mile and a half from where I sit, Saturday.
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:33.680]  Here is Lloyd Doggett being completely booed and shouted down.
[2:57:33.680 --> 2:57:37.680]  By his liberal, most liberal area of Texas is Austin.
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:41.920]  The most liberal area of Austin is South Austin, 78704.
[2:57:42.960 --> 2:57:44.720]  Now, this is what the liberals think of it.
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:58:10.800]  Here it is.
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:14.800]  And then Lloyd Doggett cowardly runs out of the building.
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:15.280]  Look at him.
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:20.320]  I mean, he goes on and on.
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:22.000]  There he is being chased outside.
[2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:26.960]  I mean, Lloyd Doggett is running.
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:34.240]  This is the most socialistic, communist area of Texas.
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:38.000]  And they're not buying any of it, pal.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:40.400]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:44.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[3:00:15.280 --> 3:00:16.640]  None of this eugenics.
[3:00:16.640 --> 3:00:18.560]  None of this rationing is in the bill.
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:21.680]  When it's all in the bill, we've seen the exacts.
[3:00:21.680 --> 3:00:22.640]  It's the British model.
[3:00:24.480 --> 3:00:25.680]  They're just phasing it in.
[3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:31.120]  And there is Lloyd Doggett with his favorite constituents being chased out of the meeting
[3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:34.400]  hall outside, running for his car.
[3:00:36.320 --> 3:00:39.520]  Because he doesn't want to be in front of the news cameras
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:44.160]  showing the people not going along with it.
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:52.160]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are slowly conditioning us to accept their
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:53.520]  police state their tyranny.
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:55.920]  They said 9-11 was about al-Qaeda.
[3:00:55.920 --> 3:00:58.960]  The police state was only four guys in caves with turbines.
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:04.240]  We always explain to you folks that it was designed Northcom, Homeland Security,
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:08.320]  for the American people, TSA on the streets of America.
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:10.400]  They're now on the streets of America.
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:17.040]  Checkpoints, body scanners, face-scanning cameras, DHS reports, gun owners, conservatives,
[3:01:17.040 --> 3:01:19.280]  veterans are the number one threat.
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:24.160]  The whole system is designed for people that aren't going to go along with the new world
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:28.400]  order and the socialized health care and the carbon tax and turning our guns in.
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:31.360]  They tell us that socialized health care isn't that.
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:32.080]  We can read the bill.
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:33.120]  We know they're liars.
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:35.440]  They say they don't want our guns when they've got the most
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:39.840]  decoding and anti-gun bills ever introduced, introduced, and the Attorney General argued
[3:01:39.840 --> 3:01:43.520]  in federal court for a complete gun ban in D.C. versus Heller.
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:46.000]  He was the government's lawyer just last year.
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:48.800]  We know they're panicking.
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:52.560]  We know that they know that we know that they're criminals.
[3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:53.200]  You understand?
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:55.360]  They know that we know that they're criminals.
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:58.000]  They know that we're waking up.
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:03.520]  And so they always want to make their own slaves first live under tyranny,
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:07.360]  their own minions, so their minions will then say, well, I live under tyranny.
[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:09.680]  You should have to live under tyranny.
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:14.320]  And so some of the most oppressed people are the police and the military and others.
[3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:18.400]  And that's why in Mexico, they make the federales take microchips.
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:20.800]  Source ABC News, MSNBC.
[3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:25.200]  That's why they're trying to push the special forces to get chips.
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:26.880]  Many units have already gotten them.
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:29.600]  And that's why they want to make federal workers take chips.
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:32.080]  They want to make them take the inoculations first.
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:33.760]  So they'll then force us to take it.
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:38.240]  The good news is they're saying, no, they tried to tell TSA two years ago.
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:42.800]  We heard about this from sources that's now been confirmed that they were telling TSA,
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:44.960]  will you take a chip to keep your job?
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:49.440]  But not just TSA, the mechanics, the food prepares.
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:54.080]  If you work at Monja at the Austin airport or at the Salt Lake, you got to take a chip.
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:56.800]  This is really being proposed.
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:02.160]  Here is San Antonio Mainstream TV, KENS.
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:02.720]  Here it is.
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:07.440]  Ends the random bag checks as passengers.
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:11.360]  We've come to expect tight security measures associated with flying.
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:15.440]  Soon those measures will extend beyond those just taking off to include those who never
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:16.560]  leave the airport.
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:20.880]  San Antonio international officials tell Kins 5 Congress is putting into motion
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:25.680]  measures that will ensure airport employees are subject to stricter security checks.
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:29.440]  Selena Hernandez joins us live from the airport with the Kins 5 exclusive.
[3:03:29.440 --> 3:03:29.840]  Selena?
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:36.240]  Chris, right now all airport employees must pass a police and FBI background check soon.
[3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:39.840]  Those checks could include something a little more intrusive.
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:48.480]  At San Antonio international airport, officials here await the arrival of stricter security
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:48.960]  measures.
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:53.600]  Not for passengers, rather airport employees.
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:58.240]  This would be a huge step as far as the amount of background checks that we're going through.
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:02.240]  This would kind of open it up to a lot of different areas that we don't currently have in place.
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:06.640]  Members of Congress are currently debating how to keep closer tabs on those who have
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:12.720]  access to secured areas, meaning everyone from restaurant employees to airline mechanics
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:16.160]  could soon be subjected to more rigorous background checks.
[3:04:16.160 --> 3:04:18.880]  We're just kind of waiting to see what they come up with.
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:20.560]  It's fairly early in the process.
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:24.160]  Under discussion, a check of an employee's credit history,
[3:04:24.160 --> 3:04:27.840]  search of their bags and property before entering secured areas,
[3:04:27.840 --> 3:04:34.400]  and perhaps the most extreme measure, the use of biometric readers for fingerprints and eyes,
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:36.640]  even possibly a chip implant.
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:41.120]  An idea we're told more than likely won't fly.
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:43.760]  Before they ever got to the chip in the hand or anything like that,
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:46.800]  we feel like they would probably opt for a less...
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:51.680]  See, to make face scanning sound okay, they say, okay, we won't make it take a chip,
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:53.280]  but we want you to face scan.
[3:04:53.280 --> 3:04:56.400]  And then, oh, you got to have a chip, but don't worry.
[3:04:56.400 --> 3:04:58.240]  It's not the tracker kind.
[3:04:58.800 --> 3:04:59.760]  See, it's incremental.
[3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:01.360]  Hello, friends.
[3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:04.960]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:06.960]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:05:06.960 --> 3:05:10.640]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:05:10.640 --> 3:05:15.520]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:18.720]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive,
[3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:21.040]  immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:05:21.040 --> 3:05:22.880]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:05:22.880 --> 3:05:28.000]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:29.360]  and your family's drinking water.

[3:05:37.600 --> 3:05:40.480]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.

[3:06:00.640 --> 3:06:02.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:06:02.080 --> 3:06:04.080]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:06:04.080 --> 3:06:05.040]  Well, you should.
[3:06:05.040 --> 3:06:09.520]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[3:06:16.240 --> 3:06:18.960]  And secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[3:06:18.960 --> 3:06:20.400]  All for pennies on the dollar.

[3:06:23.840 --> 3:06:27.600]  Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:31.280]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:34.560]  to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[3:06:34.560 --> 3:06:38.160]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:40.160]  or drill instructor attitudes.
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:41.600]  This is real.
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:45.440]  Don't miss out. Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course.
[3:06:45.440 --> 3:06:49.680]  Plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.

[3:07:57.760 --> 3:08:01.360]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:08:01.360 --> 3:08:04.960]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[3:08:04.960 --> 3:08:09.760]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:09.760 --> 3:08:23.360]  So I just finished out playing the club while San Antonio TV with the feds are proposing making airport workers take unplanable microchips.
[3:08:23.360 --> 3:08:25.120]  This is really going on.
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:29.280]  And they just keep repeating it and repeating it and repeating it until we just get acclimated and go,
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:34.320]  okay, where's my chip? I've been hearing about this for 10 years.
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:36.720]  Coming up, I want to play a clip.
[3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:40.320]  The government issues stun bracelets for all airline passengers.
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:54.080]  Now, we first played this a year and a half ago, but the issue is homeland security since then has had meetings and has proposed making risky flyers.
[3:08:54.080 --> 3:09:05.520]  And then later, everyone, see, they phase it in, take a taser bracelet and they're saying, if you have bad credit, you're now a risky flyer in the data mining.
[3:09:05.520 --> 3:09:07.760]  You can't make up stuff this bizarre.
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:22.240]  Now, Aaron Dykes and Jason Burmas, I sent them up to interview Phil Berg in Philadelphia and they were flying back in Philadelphia.
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:29.120]  They were announcing on big TV screens while you're in line at TSA.
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:38.720]  I guess you get them in here about it, about how you're going to have family travelers, expert travelers, infrequent travelers, and you get searched accordingly.
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:41.840]  So they're already getting you ready for the yellow stars, the different groups.
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:48.000]  Oh, we don't profile all of you as slaves, but we profile what group you're in.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:54.480]  And then you get used to being asked questions and being prodded and being searched and taking your shoes off and all these acts of submission.
[3:09:54.480 --> 3:09:59.600]  And then, oh, you get a taser bracelet, oh, you go in the body scanner that scans your neck and body.
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:04.000]  They already have those and they record your neck and body.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:05.520]  It's acts of submission.
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:07.520]  Now TSA is going to be on the streets of America.
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:08.720]  It's already begun.
[3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:11.040]  This is the phasing in of the tyranny.
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:14.080]  This is all psychologically being done.
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:15.840]  Attorney Phil Berg joins us.
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:22.080]  He is the progenitor, the starter of the whole questioning of Obama's birth certificate.
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:25.600]  He's the first person to follow a lawsuit in conjunction with it.
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:36.240]  And we called him yesterday when WorldNet Daily broke this big story about a prominent lawyer, Alan Key's lawyer, putting out this Kenyan certificate of live birth.
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:43.280]  Not a birth certificate, but a similar certificate of live birth to what Obama is showing.
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:45.600]  Not as birth certificate, but as certificate.
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:48.320]  And there's been some anomalies in that.
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:56.000]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who we got coming on Friday, he's looking at it and he's calling Hawaii and filing things.
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:04.800]  And Hawaii won't, won't, won't give him the documents, won't even say where Obama's camp got the certificate of live birth.
[3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:08.560]  In fact, guys, will you put that latest story up on screen?
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:09.040]  Here it is.
[3:11:09.040 --> 3:11:19.440]  Hawaii refuses to verify president's online COLBs, officials mum on images released by Obama's campaign, factcheck.org.
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:24.320]  It's basically run by George Soros, another one of his little fake groups out there.
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:28.400]  So we'll be, we'll be breaking all that down.
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:30.640]  But where there's smoke, there's fire.
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:32.080]  I mean, they are acting very suspicious.
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:36.720]  They are stonewalling and saying you've seen his original birth certificate when it isn't.
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:40.160]  They've stonewalled and said his name isn't Barry Sotaro when it comes out.
[3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:41.920]  That is one of his little fake names.
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:48.640]  This is a very sneaky guy with a mama who worked for Tim Geithner's dad at Big Foundations.
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:50.400]  His dad an open communist.
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:52.160]  I mean, these are very sickening people.
[3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:54.560]  And so nothing he says should be believed.
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:11:57.440]  He's now announced that he's going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[3:11:57.440 --> 3:12:00.080]  His office is announcing it.
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:03.600]  I mean, just everything's been a lie.
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:06.080]  He, his father, you know, was mainly Arab.
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:07.680]  He's not even really the first black president.
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:09.040]  He's the first Arab president.
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:10.240]  I'm not saying Arabs are bad.
[3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:11.280]  That's fine.
[3:12:11.280 --> 3:12:14.240]  It's everything with Barack Obama is a lie.
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:16.400]  Just like everything with Hillary is a lie.
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:22.880]  Attorney Phil Berg, you've now had 24 hours to look at all these new revelations coming out
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:26.880]  of kind of the other birther camp.
[3:12:26.880 --> 3:12:28.560]  You are the original birther camp.
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:33.760]  You know, I'm glad everybody's researching this and looking at it, whatever the truth is.
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:35.760]  You know, there is obviously something substantive here.
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:39.600]  The way the, the, the, the, the Obamanoids are behaving so, so scared.
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:44.720]  And this thing is building to a crescendo.
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:48.240]  When is the cacophony going to reach its, its peak?
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:51.120]  I mean, this gets bigger and bigger by the millisecond.
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:52.720]  Phil Berg, thank you.
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:55.360]  It is getting bigger and bigger by each day.
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:12:58.000]  And I think that's where we get bigger during this next month,
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:01.920]  because Congress is going home now and they're going to have to meet with her.
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:06.240]  They, you know, normally vacation, but they also meet with their constituents.
[3:13:06.240 --> 3:13:11.040]  And not only is this health fiasco going to be brought up, the stimulus package, you know,
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:13.360]  which hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:17.280]  But now, as we've seen with Congressman Castle, people are going to ask questions
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:18.400]  about the birth certificate.
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:21.600]  I think it's going to grow and grow and grow from now through Labor Day.
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:26.480]  And even more, because the more the, you know, we're the birthers now, they're calling us, though.
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:31.920]  The more the non-birthers come out, as ridiculous as they say we are,
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:35.680]  we really are coming up with substantial questions.
[3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:37.520]  We have circumstantial evidence.
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:38.480]  We don't have the hard core.
[3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:42.720]  We have a lot of circumstantial evidence that Obama was born, not in Hawaii.
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:44.160]  He was born in Kenya.
[3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:48.880]  I mean, just the biggest fact is that he, Obama will not release any documentation
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:50.240]  regarding his life.
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:51.520]  We know nothing, think about it.
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:52.960]  We know nothing about him.
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:57.520]  And what we do know about him, the various stories, like even where he met his wife,
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:13:58.560]  he lied about that.
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:01.520]  I mean, he lied about his job when he was at Columbia.
[3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:03.040]  He lied about everything.
[3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:03.520]  And you're right.
[3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:07.280]  Now they're talking about tax increase, but his press secretary was just going to say,
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:09.440]  no, no, no, he's not going to raise taxes.
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:13.680]  You know, Bologna, as you don't look at, as you don't look at him closely,
[3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:15.680]  he's doing everything he possibly can.
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:19.360]  Well, I mean, that's always his tactic is slippery oily deceit.
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:26.240]  He has Axelrod and a manual running around saying, yeah, well, he never quite pledged.
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:28.240]  I mean, we may have to.
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:31.360]  And then he has his other surrogates say the president's not going to do that.
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:36.880]  It's like he always speaks out of both sides of his mouth like no president I've ever seen.
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:38.240]  Absolutely.
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:42.640]  And he's dropped in his polls as because he's dropping in the polls,
[3:14:42.640 --> 3:14:46.000]  more and more people now are going to start looking at him and they're going to start
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.640]  realizing they're going to hear about this birth certificate.
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:53.120]  And there could be alarm because all of your listeners out there have to produce their birth
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:54.000]  certificate.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:59.040]  Sometimes in a lifetime, one to five times, one to 10 times, they needed for a baptism.
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:01.040]  They needed to register for little league.
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:02.640]  They definitely needed for a passport.
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:06.960]  Sometimes they needed for applications for college or for various schools or scholarships
[3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:09.520]  or driver's license, different states of different things.
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:14.960]  And here, Obama won't produce the simple birth certificate, which is really outrageous.
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:17.360]  It's amazing.
[3:15:17.360 --> 3:15:25.280]  And has that added fuel to the fire, Mr. Berger, because they keep saying we've given you the
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:28.880]  birth certificate, we've given you the birth certificate and everybody knows what their
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:32.000]  birth certificate looks like versus the certificate.
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:37.520]  And people see that's a computer printout modern certificate.
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:41.440]  They can see that it's not the original birth certificate.
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:46.800]  And then, like you said, he's been caught lying about everything else and his name's really
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:50.240]  Barry Citero and all this other weirdness.
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:56.160]  Now, where does that bring us to, though, with the other camp, the other birther group,
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:02.160]  which, you know, I'm neutral on, but we've seen other fake birth certificates come out,
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:03.680]  not associated with these guys.
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:05.120]  Now they've got one.
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:10.080]  Some people like Mike Rivera, who I respect at what really happened, he's on tomorrow,
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:14.800]  he's looking at it and saying, it looks like it may be a fake.
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:19.600]  Do you know more today, Mr. Berger, than you knew yesterday about the Providence?
[3:16:19.600 --> 3:16:21.360]  You know, we don't know Obama's Providence.
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:25.360]  We also don't know the Providence of this latest birth certificate receipt.
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:30.320]  Early indications are that it's a phony, but I don't want to comment completely that we
[3:16:30.320 --> 3:16:32.960]  gave it to our expert, but we're looking at it.
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:38.400]  There's different things because the status of the Republic of Kenya changed during that
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:40.400]  time.
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:44.800]  Was it, you know, who, who was it, a British, or what was it, when was the form changed,
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:47.920]  and all that kind of stuff, and we're getting a lot of questions in here.
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:49.040]  It looks real.
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:53.680]  It looks real, but, you know, we have to check other documents at that time, and I don't
[3:16:53.680 --> 3:16:54.800]  want to knock it out.
[3:16:54.800 --> 3:16:58.880]  If it turns out to be real, I'm wonderful, and I'll give the blessings to the other
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:04.000]  attorneys who I don't see either eye on, but what she did is she's probably just part of
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:09.920]  her court case, the Allen Key's case, in California, and she's asked the court to grant
[3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:14.880]  her special motion so that she can check the authenticity of the document.
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:17.520]  That's not how I do things.
[3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:20.880]  We've gotten several birth certificates over this past year.
[3:17:20.880 --> 3:17:22.640]  We've paid for some of them.
[3:17:22.640 --> 3:17:24.240]  They've turned up to be phony.
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:25.840]  Have I posted any of them?
[3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:26.960]  No, why not?
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:31.440]  Because I feel that we have to, and we have with ObamaCrimes.com, our website.
[3:17:31.440 --> 3:17:35.840]  Excuse me, we've stayed very straight and narrow here.
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:38.640]  We have three lawsuits pending in federal court.
[3:17:38.640 --> 3:17:43.840]  We're not playing games because we want people to be assured that when I say something, it
[3:17:43.840 --> 3:17:44.840]  means something.
[3:17:44.840 --> 3:17:47.840]  So I can't, I don't want to say it's, it's definitely, I'm not going to say it's good
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:51.520]  now, but I don't want to say it's bad, but there's indications now by certain things
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:54.880]  on that document that we've been reading about, and we're all reading about in the
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:17:55.880]  Internet.
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:18:01.000]  There's some indications here that it's phony, and I just hope if it is that we can
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:05.440]  talk to people like through your station and allow me to speak and say, let's not take
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:09.080]  this as a setback, let's just move on, you know, because we don't know.
[3:18:09.080 --> 3:18:13.560]  Like for all we know, think about it, Obama's people could have been put it out as a phony
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:17.160]  document looking good to try to discredit us.
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:20.160]  Well, I mean, that's a classic government trick.
[3:18:20.160 --> 3:18:25.520]  Carl Rove was been caught repeatedly when somebody's on his tail throwing out fake documents
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:29.120]  that incriminate himself to then discredit the whole story.
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:34.520]  He got caught doing that with Dan Rather, and the whole situation with Bush in the Air
[3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:38.800]  National Guard, which we know Bush was AWOL that was later proven correct, but all people
[3:18:38.800 --> 3:18:43.000]  remember was Dan Rather getting in trouble, and I'm no fan of Dan Rather, just facts or
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  facts.
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:48.560]  No, but I agree that Bush was AWOL, and they just tried to frame him up on that document,
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:49.560]  and you're right.
[3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:52.240]  But wait a minute, wait a minute, how can we say this, Alex?
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:56.920]  I mean, Obama, the transparent president, he wouldn't do anything phony, would he?
[3:18:56.920 --> 3:19:02.080]  Well, absolutely, I mean, them to say that, I mean, I mean, with all the weird, he lived
[3:19:02.080 --> 3:19:10.040]  all over the world, and a lot of foggy stuff, well, now they're asking how did this certificate
[3:19:10.040 --> 3:19:15.960]  of live birth get to fact check, and Hawaii won't say, so they're acting suspicious.
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:16.960]  What do you think of that?
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:19.120]  Of the original document or this document?
[3:19:19.120 --> 3:19:22.960]  No, no, no, the, yes, yes, the original certificate.
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:28.000]  Yeah, well, the original one was supposedly at first, if you would think about it, June
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:33.480]  2008, it first came out on the Obama campaign website, and then fact check came in several
[3:19:33.480 --> 3:19:38.800]  months later to check the authenticity of it, and they came back and said it's valid.
[3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:43.240]  I think that's the most damning thing, is that no one was questioning his birth in the
[3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:45.320]  US, nobody even thought about him.
[3:19:45.320 --> 3:19:47.680]  Why would they early on push that out there?
[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:49.960]  Phil, I think that's the most damning evidence against him.
[3:19:49.960 --> 3:19:53.000]  I want to ask you in the final segment with you, when you get back, what your take is
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:58.120]  on that and where you think all of this is going, also look at some of the problems with
[3:19:58.120 --> 3:20:01.840]  this newborn certificate, stay with us.

[3:21:02.200 --> 3:21:07.520]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:14.040]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:21:14.040 --> 3:21:15.600]  just as well funded.
[3:21:15.600 --> 3:21:20.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:22.240]  of the American people.
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:27.840]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election, if you have a demagogue
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:32.960]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a
[3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:38.280]  group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:38.280 --> 3:21:41.840]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:48.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:06.000]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4, 1776.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:12.360]  However, few know the importance of September 17, 1787, the day the Constitution was written
[3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:14.360]  and adopted by our founders.
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:19.640]  Unfortunately, over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack, along with
[3:23:19.640 --> 3:23:21.080]  our beloved Republic.
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:24.760]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners, which
[3:23:24.760 --> 3:23:28.120]  have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.

[3:24:04.240 --> 3:24:10.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:24:10.800 --> 3:24:21.800]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:25.360]  Bill Berg, where do you see all this going?
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:27.840]  No president has dropped this fast.
[3:24:27.840 --> 3:24:30.880]  He just keeps dropping a couple points every week.
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:35.480]  I don't see Obama and the criminals that run him being able to continue their gutting of
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:38.560]  the nation unless they stage something.
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:43.680]  I've had Ron Paul on last week, he's coming on Wednesday again saying that he believes
[3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:47.040]  they may stage a crisis or a war or an economic collapse.
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:50.920]  They may use this flu hysteria as a cover.
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:53.440]  What are the Obama people going to do?
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:59.720]  He is going to be the most unpopular president in U.S. history at this rate in just two months.
[3:24:59.720 --> 3:25:04.600]  I think that's going to go hand in hand with the truth coming out that he's constitutionally
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:10.200]  ineligible to be president and once we get the public behind us, and I think we will,
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:11.680]  because what are we asking for?
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:12.680]  Two main things.
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:17.760]  Number one, his birth certificate, the old copy, the true copy of it, but two more important
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:20.560]  is when he was adopted in Indonesia.
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:21.560]  Think about one thing.
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:25.720]  We have the school record on our website, NelswhereObamaClimbs.com, that his name is
[3:25:25.720 --> 3:25:29.760]  Barry Soturo and his nationality is Indonesia.
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:36.040]  I would like to see where he has legally changed his name back to Barack Hussein Obama because
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:39.680]  if he hasn't legally changed his name, think about it.
[3:25:39.680 --> 3:25:44.240]  Every state where he signed Barack Hussein Obama to run for president, that was fraud.
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:46.520]  See, that's a whole other issue.
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:50.800]  He went and got adopted by a Muslim family, went to Madrasas, and I'm not saying that's
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:53.160]  a bad thing, but then he said, oh, that's ridiculous.
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:54.680]  I have no Muslim roots.
[3:25:54.680 --> 3:25:57.840]  Then he goes to Cairo and says, I'm a Muslim, basically.
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:00.040]  This guy is a chameleon.
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:01.880]  I don't think he's any of these things.
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:03.960]  We probably don't even know what his real name is.
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:06.520]  Well, that's good, but you're right.
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:09.000]  During the campaign, I'm not a Muslim.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  Now that he's president, I'm a Muslim.
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:15.840]  I love the fact that during the campaign, how dare you use my middle name, Barack Hussein
[3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:16.840]  Obama.
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:19.520]  He had to call him Barack H. Obama or Barack Obama.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:24.080]  As soon as he got elected, when it came time, he swore in and it came out a few weeks earlier.
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:25.080]  What did he tell everyone?
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:28.400]  I want to be sworn in under my name of Barack Hussein Obama.
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:31.680]  I mean, this guy is a phony from day one.
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:33.280]  But the big thing, think about it.
[3:26:33.280 --> 3:26:39.360]  If we can't get him on the birth certificate right now, if he hasn't legally changed his
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:45.880]  name, his name Barry Soturo, and he's committed fraud ever since leaving Indonesia using the
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:46.880]  name.
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:50.560]  Now, it might not be in Columbia when he was a doctor then on California, everyone called
[3:26:50.560 --> 3:26:51.560]  him Barry.
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:57.800]  I think his legal name today is Barry Soturo, and remember what happened with Watergate?
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:27:00.600]  The Watergate break-in with Nixon was no big deal.
[3:27:00.600 --> 3:27:05.400]  It was a cover-up, and now we're in a massive cover-up, I believe, by Obama and the people
[3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:06.400]  around him.
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:11.880]  I think that's where we're going to get him because they had hoped, US, why they brought
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:12.880]  this up.
[3:27:12.880 --> 3:27:18.440]  I got involved August 2008 a year ago now, but in June of 2008, they put this on the
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:19.440]  website.
[3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:23.360]  And then they did, it had been circulating on the website for a year before that, so
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:28.480]  to try to quell the rumors that were going around, that's why they put this false document
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:29.480]  up.
[3:27:29.480 --> 3:27:32.600]  But there was such idiots because they put such a phony document up that they took time
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:34.600]  to prepare a better one.
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:36.200]  Maybe we wouldn't be talking about it today.
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:40.800]  Well, lastly, people kept saying, we want to see a birth announcement.
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:46.680]  But of a family, once their child be able to claim US citizen down the road, and they're
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:51.440]  born in the country, that's very common to fly back and then put a birth announcement
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:56.120]  in, and then put out a fake birth certificate, especially back in the 60s.
[3:27:56.120 --> 3:28:01.960]  So I don't think this silences some supposed microfilm on some establishment website.
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:02.960]  What do you say to that, Philburg?
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:08.080]  Yeah, no, the two announcements in the newspaper there, that doesn't really bother me.
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:09.080]  I'll tell you why.
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:13.680]  Like, for instance, my son was in a different state, and he had a child, and my granddaughter
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:14.680]  was born.
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:18.520]  So I decided to put an announcement here in Philadelphia, and I could use my address
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:19.520]  or any address.
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:23.360]  And it turned out the address they used isn't even a legitimate address because the people
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:26.940]  living next door who's lived there for the last 50 years said there was never a black
[3:28:26.940 --> 3:28:28.600]  child living next door.
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:33.040]  So to me, that's just another, they're saying that's great evidence.
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:34.040]  That's not great evidence.
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:43.160]  But also, these people are intelligence agents, you've got this spooky cover-up that has been
[3:28:43.160 --> 3:28:48.520]  going on this entire time where they're acting all sneaky, and nobody's allowed to ask questions
[3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:56.320]  and his dad is a communist, and his mother works for these big, creepy, spooky foundations
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:28:57.320]  and Geithner's dad.
[3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:00.320]  I mean, this guy gets scarier and scarier by the minute.
[3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:01.320]  Absolutely.
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:02.320]  And think about it.
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:03.320]  You know, we forget now.
[3:29:03.320 --> 3:29:04.600]  They try to push it away.
[3:29:04.600 --> 3:29:05.720]  We forget Reverend Wright.
[3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:06.960]  We forget Bill Ayers.
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:12.440]  The people that Obama is associated with, he couldn't get a job as a Chicago police
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:14.800]  officer, let alone an FBI agent or a police officer.
[3:29:14.800 --> 3:29:17.720]  My God, if I was hanging out with terrorists, I'd be in prison.
[3:29:17.720 --> 3:29:18.720]  Right.
[3:29:18.720 --> 3:29:19.720]  Well, you had me.
[3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:23.800]  No, there's just, we know nothing about his background.
[3:29:23.800 --> 3:29:27.440]  He's 100% phony, and we need the public.
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:30.720]  Everyone out there, go to my website and spread it to everyone you know.
[3:29:30.720 --> 3:29:31.720]  ObamaCrimes.com.
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:32.720]  Phil, thank you.
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:35.000]  As this develops, we'll talk to you more in the future.
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  Be careful.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  Thank you.
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  All right.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:39.000]  Thank you, Phil Burr.
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:46.240]  All right, I got a bunch of swine flu news and military police state news on the other
[3:29:46.240 --> 3:29:47.240]  side of this break.
[3:29:47.240 --> 3:29:51.720]  And then some of your phone calls, stay with us.
[3:29:51.720 --> 3:29:55.480]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.480 --> 3:30:01.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:05.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:06.880]  this summer.
[3:30:06.880 --> 3:30:10.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:10.800 --> 3:30:15.720]  Number two, our new energies wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:16.720]  you to have.
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:17.720]  It's true.
[3:30:17.720 --> 3:30:21.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:21.760 --> 3:30:25.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:28.280]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:30:28.280 --> 3:30:31.840]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:30:31.840 --> 3:30:35.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:40.080]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:40.080 --> 3:30:44.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science,
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:45.880]  a long time sponsor of ours.

[3:31:03.440 --> 3:31:06.880]  I've known you for a long time, it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more

[3:31:13.640 --> 3:31:17.680]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[3:31:17.680 --> 3:31:21.600]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[3:31:21.600 --> 3:31:23.200]  the final equation but you.
[3:31:23.200 --> 3:31:27.560]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,

[3:32:01.720 --> 3:32:06.840]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[3:32:06.840 --> 3:32:09.280]  high energy and vibrant health.
[3:32:09.280 --> 3:32:14.160]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:37.560]  of your body.
[3:32:37.560 --> 3:32:43.520]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:06.160]  into mainstream media then we have the civilian inmate labor camp program in fact just to
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:13.920]  my guys running the live tv show and radio show right now here is video of the internment
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:21.800]  specialist over here getting their training and putting americans in fema camps and enrolling
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:28.400]  and learning how to take people and put them into the camps and how to get their riot gear
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:34.800]  i mean this is just so disgusting ladies and gentlemen and they're actually recruiting
[3:38:34.800 --> 3:38:38.880]  illegal aliens they have ads on there too that even if you don't speak english you can
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:44.280]  come run the american prisons and you can press up in riot gear and swat team american citizens
[3:38:44.280 --> 3:38:47.880]  and then whenever you hear about on the news they say oh it's for foreigners but then when
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:52.080]  you read obama has said oh we're not going to have foreign camps we're going to have
[3:38:52.080 --> 3:38:59.280]  camps in america that hold u.s citizens and foreigners and you're not going to have rights
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:05.960]  and they're already beta testing at two super max one in wyoming one in montana with political
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:14.080]  dissidents in them and so the houston chronicle and the new york times all report in the last
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:18.840]  five years building these fema camps and taking old bases and turning them into camps and
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:23.160]  we would see going back more than ten years ago taking old camps refurbishing world war
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:27.440]  two camps getting the power and water turned on we'd have workers there come on and say
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:31.280]  yeah we're all compartmentalized but you know they're taking the old seven forty seven
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:37.240]  hangers out here at the base and turning them into camps and we see the police arresting
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:42.400]  thousands of people in new york in 2004 who were peaceful putting them in a fema break
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:48.000]  here fifty seven we see austin has one out the old airport they're taking over the old
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:53.680]  mall and building one in some of the stores i mean all of this is really happening and
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:58.120]  going on and they're converting large numbers of the regular army and regular national guard
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:04.480]  force to counter insurgent to military police and then having them go out and run checkpoints
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:11.840]  in america so this is not for overseas yes it has that dual use then you have the three
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:17.200]  one e infantry resettlement specialist how to train to put americans in fema camps for
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:28.080]  resettlement and reeducation you cannot make something of this magnitude up and you can
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:33.320]  go to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com to the story titled army national
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:39.120]  guard advertises for internment specialist in fact guys pull this article up i want to
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:43.600]  show people watching on the internet out there and those listening how you click and the
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:49.320]  first link is to the army and then you click the nexus to the army and their civilian inmate
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:54.680]  labor camp program for the united states and u.s. citizens that's this link right here
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:40:59.840]  i mean this is all that army dot mill this is not our opinion and then you click on the
[3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:07.880]  others and it's all cnn and it's all other mainstream news sources we bibliograph document
[3:41:07.880 --> 3:41:14.120]  everything we're saying and and and that judas goat you know glenn beckon say none of this
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:26.720]  exist i don't want to be glenn beck's enemy but we sent him all this material and you
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:32.080]  know you've asked where your sports stadiums are we have the training videos we we have
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:43.840]  everything here it's so unspeakable and we have the infrastructure protection training
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:50.720]  videos they give in regard people where they teach about the mass graves and the quarantines
[3:41:50.720 --> 3:41:54.400]  and lockdowns of cities and they've been doing this year after year and right as all the
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:59.040]  infrastructure comes together the cherry on top is actually doing it now the question
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:03.440]  is are they going to go ahead and implement this i don't know but if they almost shut
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:08.120]  the whole country down over a couple flu deaths in the u.s. what are they going to do when
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:12.240]  tens of thousands die from the regular flu it is going to they're going to do a scyop
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:16.600]  and get away with anything and then have the military roll in and have some checkpoints
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:22.400]  and lock down a few towns and cities and lock down a bunch of airports and then that will
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:28.080]  set the precedent see we locked everything down and not many people died and everybody
[3:42:28.080 --> 3:42:32.080]  took their shots which no doubt will sterilize them they've been caught doing it in the past
[3:42:32.080 --> 3:42:37.080]  and it's in white house you know science our textbook that he wrote how to put it in the
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:41.160]  vaccines and how to how to sterilize us and how to put it in the water i mean how to use
[3:42:41.160 --> 3:42:45.240]  crises to get us to do it i mean you know it's we've written articles that have the
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:49.720]  bibliograph what page it's on where he says it it's just unspeakably evil you got to read
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:56.200]  it for yourself so how do they have an anti-terror exercise that goes real world where they take
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:43:01.840]  over the society but where everybody accepts it and it looks legitimate north com and they've
[3:43:01.840 --> 3:43:06.800]  now announced on seeing in fox and everywhere else that in fact google the fox clip from
[3:43:06.800 --> 3:43:18.480]  last friday headline army to aid during swine flu and they say north com's new job is dealing
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:24.060]  with the american people in swine flu well north com's entire job is spying on us spying
[3:43:24.060 --> 3:43:30.080]  on ron paul spying on tea parties the army our army for fighting foreign enemies we told
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:36.000]  you with the secret documents months later confirmed baltimore son army spying on tea
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:45.320]  parties fact show them that after army spying on tea parties
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:48.880]  the you've got all the videos saved in there on your screen it was last friday it was something
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:55.600]  like army to be involved at army to help with flu outbreak point is you've all seen the
[3:43:55.600 --> 3:44:00.680]  clips out there ladies and gentlemen the articles are up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[3:44:00.680 --> 3:44:08.920]  dot com and uh yeah there it is source fbi spot on tea party protesters nationwide and
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:17.960]  then if you scroll down into the article this is some mirror side of fan has um yeah that's
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:23.560]  the northeast intelligence report but it was also in in the baltimore son i remember seeing
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:29.360]  that but regardless pull up the other article we now i'm obsessed with this it was last
[3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:38.880]  friday we we played the clip here and it was uh fox news was the headline army to be deployed
[3:44:38.880 --> 3:44:47.680]  during swine flu outbreak that was it army to be deployed there it is
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:52.800]  i don't know if this is the clip though probably not the clip that's an older clip well regardless
[3:44:52.800 --> 3:44:56.240]  i always get sidetracked trying to re document everything the point is they're saying the
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:45:00.840]  army is going to be involved in this like out of the gates they just decided all of this
[3:45:00.840 --> 3:45:05.680]  has been set up all of this has been prepared the police have been acclimated to work with
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:11.520]  the military everybody's been trained to go through this and to go along with this and
[3:45:11.520 --> 3:45:17.360]  then they need it to be a microbe so everybody can be suspect so everybody can be bad so
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:22.560]  different people can be arrested to train everybody now into the new biological medical
[3:45:22.560 --> 3:45:26.880]  tyranny that we've got to arrest people because they won't take the vaccines and they're
[3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:31.120]  endangering everybody else because they won't and it's the law to take all the shots we
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:41.920]  say to set this precedent to forcibly inject you yeah that's it military to prepare teams
[3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:47.040]  in case of h1n1 outbreak back it up and let's play it for everybody right now here is the
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:51.440]  clip ladies and gentlemen in case you doubt us here it is there with the military we're
[3:45:51.440 --> 3:45:55.680]  told it's as health officials race to get vaccines ready the u.s. government has just
[3:45:55.680 --> 3:45:59.880]  gotten 20 million doses and we're told it could be getting ready to start giving those
[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:05.080]  shots by october even though the trials for these drugs hasn't even begun yet just minutes
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:09.160]  from now a panel from the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta is expected
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:14.360]  to hold a news conference in atlanta and give its recommendation on how the new vaccine
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:18.680]  should be handed out we keep an eye on that news conference and we'll let you know exactly
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:22.080]  what happens and all the developments from it our brian wilson is covering this brian
[3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:27.840]  the military getting involved that seems kind of you know drastic well i think it is dramatic
[3:46:27.840 --> 3:46:32.280]  ship fox news has confirmed that north com has a proposal sitting on the desk of secretary
[3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:36.840]  defense robert gates that would authorize the military to back up fema should there
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:43.080]  be an h1n1 pandemic the proposal comes from north com commander victor renwar who wants
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:49.000]  permission to set up five regional military teams will respond if fema says it let's stop
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:56.520]  right there soon they already have six it's in the bill for the domestic fema camps and
[3:46:56.520 --> 3:47:00.800]  then they have the regional things already set up it's already all set up they're just
[3:47:00.800 --> 3:47:06.560]  telling you oh we just now got permission we just now deployed this they have been setting
[3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:11.900]  this up forever and then magically the flu is popping up and it's a non-event it's already
[3:47:11.900 --> 3:47:16.200]  mutated shot won't protect you doesn't matter they all know that it's all part of their
[3:47:16.200 --> 3:47:20.840]  hoax they all know this it's an absolute hoax the question is what is the hoax gonna
[3:47:20.840 --> 3:47:27.440]  be we know they're lying about it but what is the end game that's the sixty four million
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:32.000]  dollar answer that we're looking for here because we better hope this is just a fair
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:36.600]  monger to sell tens of millions of vaccines and expand federal control this may be a big
[3:47:36.600 --> 3:47:41.360]  one this may be their final move because look how they're trying to get the carbon tax the
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:47.040]  global bank of the world the gun bands the open borders this everything is happening
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:52.840]  now and remember remember during the campaign right after you got elected biden said six
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:47:57.280]  months and obama is going to be hated but we got to do this job for the elite didn't
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:02.440]  always being recorded with high level democrats they are here to kill this country and obama
[3:48:02.440 --> 3:48:07.800]  was there just to stall people with his fake hope and change long enough to get this agenda
[3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:12.960]  through i mean bush carried it all the way to the one yard line and they're on the same
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:17.640]  team and bush's shoulder was sprained and he had a concussion he went over and hugged
[3:48:17.640 --> 3:48:21.240]  you know hugged i mean literally this is how they operate when he was leaving we have video
[3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:25.080]  bush hugging them saying i'll see you soon thank you for the great help oh you're just
[3:48:25.080 --> 3:48:29.840]  really good they're all funded by the same people obama's related to bush and cheney
[3:48:29.840 --> 3:48:34.840]  totally staged and so bush got them right down to the one yard line and now they hand
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:38.680]  the ball to obama and they said can you bring america down for the new world order and obama
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:42.880]  said i'm going to try my best let me just con these suckers as best i can they said
[3:48:42.880 --> 3:48:50.280]  pent game high five boom i'm serious man and man he is he is one inch he's been trying
[3:48:50.280 --> 3:48:56.200]  to move it and he you know he got one foot got another foot but now he's stalled everybody
[3:48:56.200 --> 3:49:01.440]  figures out that you know the play he's running up the middle and obama's got one more foot
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:04.960]  he needs to get just one more and they're getting ready and they're going get ready to run the
[3:49:04.960 --> 3:49:11.920]  bird flu we're going to use this as a smokescreen for the whole operation blue 42 blue 42 and
[3:49:11.920 --> 3:49:16.440]  the ball is in play is he going to pass is he going to run is he going to hand it off
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:21.480]  what's going on here i mean can you hope and change idiots wake up and realize we don't
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:28.440]  support bush we don't support osama bin laden we don't support barack obama we don't support
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:35.400]  any of these new world order people soma bin laden george bush rock obama they all work
[3:49:35.400 --> 3:49:40.040]  for the new world order it's all theater the whole world is a stage each of us a player
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:45.040]  upon it and we need everybody that loves liberty and freedom to stand up to these bashers right
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:49.280]  now it's clear they are going to use this as the cover for their martial law mexico
[3:49:49.280 --> 3:49:53.000]  was about to collapse that was a beta test the people were about to revolt as the summer
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:57.840]  began they're not revolting now they're just happened to be alive that was their excuse
