[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:29.040]  Texas Alex Jones it's happening things are moving faster and faster and faster
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.920]  our republic along with the European Union and every other sovereign nation
[00:33.920 --> 00:40.040]  on earth and every economic union are being imploded by design we have
[00:40.040 --> 00:46.120]  predicted it we have laid it out we have read to you the white papers of the
[00:46.120 --> 00:51.280]  social engineers bragging about how they plan to do this I cover it in the
[00:51.280 --> 00:57.440]  Obama deception now out for more than two years fall the republic those films
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.280]  are even more powerful today they're not pressing it though that's what's crazy
[01:02.280 --> 01:08.060]  about this it's like reading Mein Kampf Hitler's manifesto and then people were
[01:08.060 --> 01:20.320]  shocked by what he did he told the world exactly what he was going to do and I'm
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.200]  gonna be covering this when we come back from the break I told you in the last
[01:24.200 --> 01:31.120]  year that I'm seeing a major brand marketing test to shift the entire
[01:31.120 --> 01:39.400]  Homeland Security apparatus on to any type of mainline political activism and
[01:39.400 --> 01:45.600]  that's in the news today Pentagon to watch Americans in cyberspace well they've
[01:45.600 --> 01:50.040]  already been doing that Pentagon to counter Americans Pentagon to engage in
[01:50.040 --> 01:54.000]  propaganda ladies and gentlemen for decades they've been paying off the
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.020]  media the dominant corporate whore media that isn't dominant anymore so the
[01:59.020 --> 02:05.240]  systems coming in with kill switches and taxes and controls the Pentagon does
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.920]  not represent the Republic it represents the foreign banks that have
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.120]  overtaken it and they give the military a false mission statement of why
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.760]  they're doing what they're doing they're compartmentalized so don't go off of what
[02:17.760 --> 02:22.440]  you're being told is the reason you're doing things analyze what you're really
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.120]  doing reality test information and if you've studied any history you know
[02:28.120 --> 02:36.240]  every indicator of a total tyranny an authoritarian autocratic dictatorial
[02:36.240 --> 02:42.400]  centrally controlled nightmare system every indicator has been checked off not
[02:42.400 --> 02:48.200]  once not twice the system has checked it off so much that they've that they've
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.520]  you know the pen has gone through the paper they've scribbled and filled in the
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.760]  box so much that it is now gone into the table and like Rahm Emanuel stabbing
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.320]  you know the White House desk saying kill kill kill about members of Congress
[03:03.320 --> 03:08.160]  he doesn't like on record in front of the press they are just jabbing their pen
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.640]  into those boxes and just you just police state total control unaccountable
[03:13.640 --> 03:19.520]  government surveillance robbing the people just just just grinding grinding
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.800]  those boxes just just scrubbing them I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.600]  a brain surgery to know we're in deep trouble it doesn't take someone with a
[03:28.600 --> 03:36.920]  IQ any higher than room temperature what's room temperature 76 degrees
[03:36.920 --> 03:42.440]  someone who is seriously mentally retarded should be able to figure this
[03:42.440 --> 03:49.840]  out I mean there are there are people who have serious brain damage or who
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.720]  unfortunately you know are born that way who know corruption when they see it
[03:55.720 --> 04:00.680]  who know what tyranny looks like you know the feds in the last decade of
[04:00.680 --> 04:04.400]  financed even foreign governments but our own local police to wear black mask
[04:04.400 --> 04:11.440]  helmets to beat their batons on their shields and now they've had police chiefs
[04:11.440 --> 04:15.400]  last few years admit this is done for intimidation well of course it was
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.520]  always done for intimidation this is secret police you know the police wear
[04:20.520 --> 04:26.760]  mask in Mexico robbers wear mask police wear mask I mean this this is all out
[04:26.760 --> 04:30.400]  of the open the cameras they put up aren't going to be used on criminals
[04:30.400 --> 04:34.160]  they're going to be used on you criminals run the system and look at
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.880]  everything from the perspective of the criminals you understand okay I must
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.840]  at least read the headlines of all these articles I must discipline myself and I

[06:11.800 --> 06:15.840]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.840 --> 06:19.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.720 --> 06:24.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:28.160 --> 06:32.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.480 --> 06:36.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[06:36.200 --> 06:40.360]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[08:01.000 --> 08:06.040]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[08:06.040 --> 08:21.800]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Welcome my
[08:21.800 --> 08:27.040]  friends listening in the United States and of course across the world fellow
[08:27.040 --> 08:33.680]  lovers of liberty truth and justice all the things that went out of fashion in
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.280]  the last few decades and so did all of our prosperity it also went out of
[08:38.280 --> 08:43.360]  fashion when the crooks came in and destroyed our constitutional Republican
[08:43.360 --> 08:47.840]  of course overthrew countless other sovereign nations we're now living in a
[08:47.840 --> 08:53.720]  corporate global government that resembles an arena where the heavily
[08:53.720 --> 09:01.000]  armed corporate non-free market monopoly men mercenaries hack up the unarmed
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.120]  companies and industries and now our liberties and steal the pension funds
[09:06.120 --> 09:12.320]  public and private and they have decided to fully commit to absolute global
[09:12.320 --> 09:18.480]  collapse and an absolute assault and attack openly on every sovereign nation
[09:18.480 --> 09:22.560]  on the planet on every individual liberty all of it being sold as the
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.760]  solution to the crises that they've orchestrated that's exactly what's going
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.120]  on let me just read you some of the headlines then I'm getting into the top
[09:32.120 --> 09:41.440]  story today that we are here to cover and that of course is the fact that we
[09:41.440 --> 09:49.040]  have been proven absolutely accurate and correct about the controlled
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.120]  demolition of the world economy and that as that control demolition took
[09:54.120 --> 10:01.680]  place anyone that exposes the big six megabanks and their cartel whose
[10:01.680 --> 10:06.840]  fingerprints are all over this I mean not just fingerprints they're on record
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.320]  the authors of it openly bragging they would implode the global economy shut
[10:11.320 --> 10:15.400]  down industrial societies and then bankrupt people to where they're totally
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.560]  dependent on government and the corporations that control it absolute
[10:19.560 --> 10:23.600]  global corporate dictatorship and exactly what they said they would do they
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.040]  have done so I can't even say we predicted all of this we said here
[10:28.040 --> 10:36.000]  they're admitting their battle plan just like Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in the
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.240]  late 1920s and he said exactly what he was gonna do and the Germans went along
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.520]  with it and Germans who didn't like Hitler were still in denial and said
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.880]  well it can't be this bad and Americans were in denial it was the same thing
[10:49.880 --> 10:54.120]  about the red terror the same thing the reports coming out of China in the
[10:54.120 --> 11:00.600]  40s 50s and 60s late 40s 50s 60s about Mao killing the Chinese say over 80
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.600]  million people and of course today we know it was all true and worse same
[11:04.600 --> 11:11.560]  thing with Pol Pot killing 30% of his population Castro killing 300 400,000
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.400]  political dissidents people just don't want to believe it they think they can
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.880]  have magical thinking and deny that tyranny has come to their shores and
[11:21.880 --> 11:26.560]  now this is a global assault on all that is decent all that is good it is a
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.800]  total scientific tyranny and now I told you at the key juncture what are the
[11:32.800 --> 11:35.800]  banksters going to do what are they gonna do to their political opposition
[11:35.800 --> 11:41.280]  anyone who is informed who is educated about history who can see what they're
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.880]  doing anyone that understands the banks are above the law anyone that knows the
[11:45.880 --> 11:49.840]  majority of the debt is not owed by the people and is impossible to pay back and
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.280]  must be written off the 1.5 quadrillion anyone that says get rid of the
[11:54.280 --> 11:58.080]  private Federal Reserve of the Bank of England anyone that says look at Al Gore
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.560]  and Lord Rothschild on private jets and trains and yachts calling for carbon
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.560]  taxes and then old people can't have heating in the winter and that you
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.760]  shouldn't be able to take a hot bath because of carbon while they live like
[12:11.760 --> 12:20.040]  lavish pigs if you criticize them you are going to be called a terrorist. I told
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.840]  you that right as the collapse accelerated they would begin to announce
[12:23.840 --> 12:27.800]  that the people that don't like the bankers and the Federal Reserve of the
[12:27.800 --> 12:36.320]  New World Order are racist, are murderers, are killers, are terrorists and now if you
[12:36.320 --> 12:39.880]  type Tea Party terrorist in there are thousands of articles in the last two
[12:39.880 --> 12:45.800]  weeks even before the kickoff of the clearly staged event over in Norway
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.440]  provocateur bare minimum and now you see Joe Biden coming out you see the other
[12:51.440 --> 12:56.160]  Democratic leaders coming out you see them coming out and saying the Tea Party
[12:56.160 --> 13:00.720]  is terrorist the New York Times says they're Hezbollah and it's all over
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.360]  talk radio it's everywhere it's in the Mayak reports the Homeland Security
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.200]  training manuals the Homeland Security videos it is on and they are test
[13:10.200 --> 13:14.840]  marketing what Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London told Barack
[13:14.840 --> 13:24.080]  Obama he said minus a catastrophic event like Oklahoma City or a 9-11 you are
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.440]  not going to get your agenda through and there's similar reports out now coming
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.120]  up I'm going to remind you I'm gonna play Glenn Beck months and months after I
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.720]  warned and even sent Glenn Beck emails I said they're getting ready to set you and
[13:36.720 --> 13:43.480]  I up I said here are the memos here's the different White House advisors he gives
[13:43.480 --> 13:48.400]  a couple of examples saying that in their internal memos that have been made
[13:48.400 --> 13:52.120]  public that we're there's gonna be terror attacks and we're gonna blame it on
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.720]  these people now they don't say we're going to do it they are one micron from
[13:56.720 --> 14:03.880]  admitting openly what they're up to okay and Savage Michael Savage is smart
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.360]  enough to get this in the last two years he said you mark my words when
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.120]  people wake up to Obama and his approval rating drops he's gonna blow up a
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.440]  Reichstag like Hitler and I absolutely absolutely folks even though I don't
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.640]  like Glenn Beck because he's done things to me behind the scenes and you know I
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.560]  said on air Charlie you're clean which means not on drugs and then they turned
[14:27.560 --> 14:30.520]  it into something that I was in the shower with Charlie Sheen you know I
[14:30.520 --> 14:34.600]  mean really vicious type stuff look Glenn Beck you've already been run out of
[14:34.600 --> 14:42.280]  Fox because you told too much of the truth okay but you better and so had
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.480]  Michael Savage and everybody else and all you mainline you know kind of
[14:45.480 --> 14:50.040]  Republican mainline conservative types you better get this through your heads
[14:50.040 --> 14:56.880]  the system is coming after you because you are the mouthpieces even though to a
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.440]  certain extent your establishment and controlled opposition you are going to
[15:01.440 --> 15:05.200]  be night of the long knifed and for those that don't know what night of the
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.360]  long knives was first thing Hitler did after he blew up the Reichstag after
[15:10.360 --> 15:15.840]  he'd been in office a few months in February of 33 was go after first his
[15:15.840 --> 15:22.360]  internal opposition and then he went after his outside political opposition so
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.640]  none of you are part of the establishment just like they'll take
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.040]  special forces troops put them in a chamber tell them it's a drill nerve
[15:29.040 --> 15:33.600]  gas them dissect their bodies tell their wives they died in a helicopter crash on
[15:33.600 --> 15:39.800]  record many cases of that or say you die to the flu they will use you and they
[15:39.800 --> 15:49.600]  will come after you now that's the bottom line here and there's only one
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.840]  other person in talk radio that is somewhat of a loose cannon and somewhat
[15:53.840 --> 15:57.640]  of a real Maverick and that's Michael Savage because I have to know some of
[15:57.640 --> 16:01.680]  the inside baseball at talk radio network and the you know the wars they've
[16:01.680 --> 16:04.840]  had with him and you know the fact that they let him do what he does even though
[16:04.840 --> 16:08.440]  it's caused him a lot of issues what you hear there is not something you're
[16:08.440 --> 16:11.920]  gonna hear in the future if this continues and you're certainly not gonna
[16:11.920 --> 16:16.480]  hear people like Alex Jones okay now I said I'd get to at least the headlines
[16:16.480 --> 16:22.920]  but the globalist are carrying out a criminal takeover of this society and
[16:22.920 --> 16:28.880]  they are going to stage terror attacks and blame it on their opposition
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.440]  anybody that talks about the New World Order in a bad light and there's gonna
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.520]  be an attempt here to get people to turn their backs on this information and run
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.240]  from it and not talk about it because of the demonization just like just like
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.480]  after Oklahoma City but it's going to be far worse and they are going to link
[16:47.480 --> 16:52.960]  up anti-New World Order Patriots worldwide with Muslim extremists in these
[16:52.960 --> 16:58.280]  staged events there'll be other events that aren't directly connected in fact
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.480]  I believe the first attacks will be purely right-wing to get folks to shift
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.160]  away from Al Qaeda as I've been predicting at nauseam and has now
[17:05.160 --> 17:08.600]  happened and then they're going to have joint attacks and I'm already starting
[17:08.600 --> 17:12.960]  to see that rhetoric look you can get into the enemy's mindset see what
[17:12.960 --> 17:19.320]  they've done over and over again their pathology their psychology and then you
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.760]  can think like you're them what would I do if I was totally ruthless and you
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.040]  think of the very worst most effective thing you can do there you have it okay
[17:28.040 --> 17:32.720]  you know what they're going to do the best generals have not just studied
[17:32.720 --> 17:38.280]  their the enemy and studied their own force but they put themselves in to the
[17:38.280 --> 17:43.920]  mind of the enemy and that's what I do and I am literally and I've proven this
[17:43.920 --> 17:50.600]  time and time again I am looking out of their eyes now I can do that in a
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.520]  general way I don't know exactly what combo they're going to pull where they're
[17:54.520 --> 17:57.160]  going to hit though I've been able to say they're going to probably blow up the
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.160]  World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden my prediction two
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.880]  months before 9-11 with total precision not just that hey they're going to
[18:05.880 --> 18:08.720]  stage something and blame it on bin Laden you could see that on the news they
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.480]  were building him up I knew that they'd hit the World Trade Center before cook
[18:12.480 --> 18:16.040]  the bomb train the driver given them the detonators that's New York Times CBS news
[18:16.040 --> 18:20.760]  and only because they're the the the Egyptian CIA agent they'd hired a mod
[18:20.760 --> 18:24.600]  salon knew that they were setting him up because he said first it wasn't going
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.920]  to be a real bomb then it was build a real bomb but don't give him real
[18:28.920 --> 18:31.560]  detonators then it was we're not going to let him drive the truck out of the
[18:31.560 --> 18:34.520]  garage and then it's you're going to let him drive it down there and let it go
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.000]  ahead he figured it out recorded them on the phone and in meetings and in a
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.560]  press conference and released the tapes and handed out copies while he was
[18:42.560 --> 18:49.400]  breathing heavily only reason he lived he figured it out he he he was smart he
[18:49.400 --> 18:53.360]  got it out he's like I was there to set up Muslim extremist this whole thing is
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.080]  a setup they they you know they carried out that bombing he gave the press
[18:57.080 --> 19:03.520]  conference the day after it happened and and reportedly he even left his
[19:03.520 --> 19:06.840]  apartment and and literally slept in his car till the next day when he did the
[19:06.840 --> 19:12.920]  press conference that's how you do it that's how you whistle blow he would
[19:12.920 --> 19:16.200]  have been deader than a hammer or if they would have set him up oh here's the
[19:16.200 --> 19:21.320]  guy from Egypt who did it he's the leader he's the bomb maker okay instead
[19:21.320 --> 19:24.040]  they had to pay him off what was it a million and a half bucks he got to go
[19:24.040 --> 19:27.280]  back to Egypt okay here's your settlement for what we did to you go you
[19:27.280 --> 19:30.880]  get a million bucks plus instead of going to prison and being the new McVay
[19:30.880 --> 19:34.560]  that's another thing for people that work in government don't think you're
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.560]  taking part in a drill or don't think you're taking part in a sting they will

[24:25.560 --> 24:32.560]  collapse is coming that's the former comptroller general and I just so happen
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.360]  to have from the tax policy center the White House's numbers and projections on
[24:37.360 --> 24:42.360]  tax revenues be going over this later in the broadcast oh well bomb is his
[24:42.360 --> 24:47.960]  overall taxes aren't going to be going up they project tax revenues to go from
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.200]  $2 trillion
[24:53.000 --> 25:03.080]  $173 billion to $2 trillion 627 billion next year and by 2013 $3 trillion
[25:03.080 --> 25:14.760]  2014 3.3 trillion plus 2015 to 3.5 83 trillion and then finally 2016 3.819
[25:14.760 --> 25:20.960]  trillion so they're talking about within five years
[25:22.280 --> 25:30.000]  almost doubling the amount of taxes coming into the government does anybody
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.280]  believe that that isn't going to take huge tax increase increases across the
[25:34.280 --> 25:38.880]  board kind of like Obama's health care was going to give you a pre-existing
[25:38.880 --> 25:42.120]  coverage and was going to help everybody turns out the insurance companies
[25:42.120 --> 25:45.280]  wrote it by the way you know in his speeches he's been giving he says his
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.040]  number one mission now and in fact we'll play this later his number one mission
[25:50.040 --> 25:55.240]  is to get everybody to chip in the austerity's here but not for the
[25:55.240 --> 26:01.680]  globalist no no no their profits are all up all the big mega banks profits up
[26:01.680 --> 26:07.200]  general electric and others offshoring our jobs accelerating and profits are up
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.880]  it is so much fun to be bankrupting and enslaving the population while you
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.440]  make giant short-term profits consolidating things but you're not
[26:16.440 --> 26:21.000]  really thinking short-term because there's not going to be any competition
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.280]  left and they don't care if it's a wrecked society they'll be in their
[26:24.280 --> 26:30.360]  armored luxury compounds their their 21st century high-tech green zones while
[26:30.360 --> 26:36.880]  we the slaves live out here under the carbon tax austerity look at these look
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.200]  at these news articles I've got here Europe on the brink of major financial
[26:41.200 --> 26:50.880]  collapse Guggenheim's CIO CNBC Italy under fire in widening euro crisis it
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.400]  was always designed to expand into the every other country well I mean we've
[26:55.400 --> 26:58.720]  told you this over and over again this is a design for severship the banks have
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.680]  admitted that Ireland a great economy until the month after they signed on to
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.800]  the euro which was a banking agreement to go under foreign bank ownership as
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.840]  the as their head of their central bank told the BBC he said yes it's good to be
[27:10.840 --> 27:14.040]  run by foreign banks that's a quote it's like saying it's good to murder
[27:14.040 --> 27:19.640]  children they just come right out and say it with a straight face Italy under
[27:19.640 --> 27:25.000]  fire for widening euro debt crisis here's another one and it just continues
[27:25.000 --> 27:33.000]  US stocks massive route spells trouble for Wall Street Europe on brink of major
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.200]  financial collapse another report on that debt deal doesn't dispel downgrade
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.160]  fears we always told you that was going to happen no no it gets worse as you do
[27:43.160 --> 27:46.000]  what they want and by the way they reported the numbers of the budget
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.800]  huge increases every year going on massive increases but that's corporate
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.520]  welfare increases in banker bailout you are gonna get your social security and
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.560]  your pensions and your Medicare and your Medicaid cut that's what the health
[28:00.560 --> 28:04.280]  care law is where they tell the doctors what to do you don't get cataract
[28:04.280 --> 28:11.680]  surgery by a cane by thicker glasses they've already done it in other
[28:11.680 --> 28:14.880]  countries so we can follow what they've done in other countries it's a global
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.640]  standardization know exactly what's going to be done here we know exactly it's
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.160]  like predicting yeah I bet next August in mid-August it's over 100 degrees in
[28:25.160 --> 28:29.760]  Austin well not rocket science well the very same banks did this and all these
[28:29.760 --> 28:33.000]  other countries and the same people are here and this is their formula here's
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.160]  their memos saying it I mean there is no hope because they're in charge anything
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.480]  they say is a fix their so-called fight Mitch McConnell saying the Tea Party won
[28:43.480 --> 28:52.360]  with his budget I mean that is such a mind game it just defies reality doesn't
[28:52.360 --> 28:58.080]  even fit into reality oh republicans out of victory with this oh the super
[28:58.080 --> 29:01.160]  congress and then some people are saying oh the super congress isn't that bad
[29:01.160 --> 29:06.920]  it's just a committee oh yeah that decides the bills I'm gonna get into that
[29:06.920 --> 29:12.520]  later I mean it is just amazing that grown adults most these congress people
[29:12.520 --> 29:16.360]  are just idiots that they don't even know what they're doing most the analysts
[29:16.360 --> 29:21.160]  out there don't know what they're talking about it's so lonely to more and
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.840]  more realize that quite frankly I know a lot more than most these people I can't
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.120]  believe that I don't ever thought of myself as that smart look at this
[29:29.120 --> 29:35.960]  Chinese agency downgrades US credit rating again even lower China joins
[29:35.960 --> 29:40.200]  Russia in blasting US borrowing after debt ceiling agreement why because that
[29:40.200 --> 29:44.520]  devalues the dollar worldwide and causes global inflation bond market

[34:09.160 --> 34:13.200]  major corporations design the Stuxnet and I even predicted at the time that it
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.200]  wouldn't just be the US and Israel launching the industrial bug that has
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.400]  to be put directly into the systems it's not over networks but that they would
[34:21.400 --> 34:26.640]  use it that they would use the system that's to be delivered at the point of
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.800]  attack by spies inside that they would use that as a call to set up cyber
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.440]  security and they did it all again they think you're so dumb they launch the
[34:36.440 --> 34:40.360]  terror attack on cyberspace and then they and then they take your rights they
[34:40.360 --> 34:45.320]  think you're so dumb they ship tens of thousands of guns to Mexico and get five
[34:45.320 --> 34:50.640]  cops three border patrol killed at least in the US unbelievable bedlam and then
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.200]  blame the Second Amendment and then outside of law start restricting gun
[34:54.200 --> 35:01.440]  shops without authority and what did Larry Pratt say here yesterday on the
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.000]  air and what is everything from the AP the Huffington Post saying that the
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.760]  Super Congress does begin the process of setting up a new form of government and
[35:10.760 --> 35:15.800]  some people out there just just cannot believe this is happening and they
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.720]  make excuses for Obama launching wars without congressional approval or carbon
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.240]  taxes without it because they just do this incrementally or all the
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.400]  Super Congress in that bad it's another committee oh yeah that originates the
[35:28.400 --> 35:32.040]  spending and cutting bills which is the total power of government and I mean
[35:32.040 --> 35:36.360]  that's that's the heart of it all right I'm gonna get into that coming up but
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.880]  GOA chief Super Congress will lead US to dictatorship and they could have an
[35:41.880 --> 35:47.600]  up or down vote now can't filibuster can't amend and then it says if you if
[35:47.600 --> 35:52.360]  Congress doesn't go along with it then the automatic cuts go into effect which
[35:52.360 --> 35:58.040]  then will be decided by the leadership oh so you pass what we want or it just
[35:58.040 --> 36:07.680]  goes into effect that's not tyranny you see and then there's other crazy news
[36:07.680 --> 36:13.400]  tepco says highest radiation yet is detected at Fukushima Daiachi I saw an
[36:13.400 --> 36:18.120]  MSNBC article yesterday reporting highest radiation ever recorded there and
[36:18.120 --> 36:24.200]  it had the term in it pockets of death another drudge report had it up drudge
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.760]  reports also had our Ron Paul story up last night until this morning dealing
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.920]  with Ron Paul a very concerned about the Super Congress and they have a judge
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.640]  Andrew Napolitano clip they're breaking down the fact that it looks like it's
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.160]  not constitutional man that's really putting it lightly but see we've gotten
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.720]  so used to committees deciding and getting more power into themselves that
[36:48.720 --> 36:56.040]  that now just everybody's getting acclimated it's starting to come down
[36:56.040 --> 37:00.360]  the wire and it's going to get crazier and crazier and crazier and yes it's an
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.280]  incremental process still but it's going to move faster and faster and as you
[37:05.280 --> 37:09.320]  get closer to absolute tyranny which is the globalist dehumanizing goal
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.360]  trampling and being trampled upon the priest of power always pressing on the
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.840]  nerve of power setting up a global system for psychopaths and sadists to enjoy
[37:18.840 --> 37:23.520]  themselves they are converting the world to their system think about it we've
[37:23.520 --> 37:28.080]  become comfortable with them calmly talking about torturing people and
[37:28.080 --> 37:35.080]  quietly you know just just pushing the idea at first that the Constitution is
[37:35.080 --> 37:39.440]  outdated and now time Newsweek all hundreds of publications last few months
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.520]  get rid of the Constitution it's bad it's old it caused the problems yeah get
[37:44.520 --> 37:48.560]  rid of it we'll fix things when it's the fact that we've gotten rid of it and
[37:48.560 --> 37:52.280]  gotten away from it that suddenly like oxygen being sucked out of the room
[37:52.280 --> 37:59.720]  we're living in a tyranny I mean do you see these headlines Moody's S&P total
[37:59.720 --> 38:06.520]  minions revolving door with a big six megabanks saying oh you know give us the
[38:06.520 --> 38:11.000]  tens of trillions and we'll fix the economy three years ago and and oh now
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.680]  give us more money in Greece and then a few months later give us more sending an
[38:14.680 --> 38:18.880]  Ireland give us more and and they turn it around and you're bad you you know
[38:18.880 --> 38:24.280]  you you you've got too much government spending it's the people's fault and it
[38:24.280 --> 38:27.360]  is the people's fault for being conned for thinking they were getting a free
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.680]  lunch for thinking that that the poor can have free cell phones because it
[38:32.680 --> 38:40.040]  sounds good but it's done to position you to control you so it's bad that we
[38:40.040 --> 38:47.080]  got domesticated on the chicken feed but we're being now given the guilt that
[38:47.080 --> 38:52.160]  we're in financial ruination because of that when it is a tiny part of the
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.120]  equation I mean they say the debt's 14 and a half trillion dollars real
[38:56.120 --> 39:05.840]  obligations 190 trillion sounds big is it anything compared to the 600 trillion
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.760]  that we supposedly have signed on to in America for the derivatives and the
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.600]  total global 1.5 trillion and I've got to get the economists and experts back
[39:14.600 --> 39:22.160]  on because that that that numbers a year old they design it to destroy us this
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.560]  everything is going according to plan like Emperor Palpatine would say
[39:26.560 --> 39:32.560]  everything is proceeding as I have foreseen it that is what is happening
[39:32.560 --> 39:46.720]  economic scorched earth economic blitzkrieg lightning war and it's going
[39:46.720 --> 39:50.720]  to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
[39:50.720 --> 39:55.160]  more intense the globalists are moving their command base in the future away
[39:55.160 --> 40:02.560]  from the United States to Europe and China a lot of political analysts
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.840]  well I'll get more to that later the point is that we are not in Kansas
[40:08.840 --> 40:13.960]  anymore Chinese agency downgrades US credit rating China joins Russia in
[40:13.960 --> 40:20.440]  blasting US borrowing after debt ceiling agreement and why because the why did
[40:20.440 --> 40:30.360]  gold surge today why did gold surge today to over 1,670 dollars in fact it
[40:30.360 --> 40:33.680]  was still surging 20 minutes ago you guys pulling the latest numbers and put
[40:33.680 --> 40:37.880]  it on screen I've got that graph over here that is just incredible that you
[40:37.880 --> 40:44.760]  guys gave me just showing it rocketing up just absolutely rocketing up right
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.480]  now why is that gold's not going up they're signaling that they're going to
[40:50.480 --> 40:56.640]  continue the path of hyperinflation they're not just going to raise taxes on
[40:56.640 --> 41:02.160]  everybody they're destroying your purchasing power they're destroying
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.280]  people on fixed incomes and the Republicans and Democrats aren't telling
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.800]  you about this no they've just formed a bipartisan super Congress that gets to
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.760]  make the decisions into the future on the debt and have introduced this idea
[41:17.760 --> 41:21.560]  like it's no big deal so they can continue this in the future with further
[41:21.560 --> 41:29.320]  quote banker takeovers known as banker bailouts where is it right now 1,666
[41:29.320 --> 41:36.640]  90 graph I had earlier showed it I guess shooting up to the 70 mark and then I
[41:36.640 --> 41:41.720]  guess it went down little and has now gone back up a bit but the point is that
[41:41.720 --> 41:47.600]  this is a precision operation and government plays on the psychology of
[41:47.600 --> 41:51.560]  making you feel big and powerful and important because you know most of us
[41:51.560 --> 41:54.920]  individually have trouble balancing our checkbooks and they say oh the
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.600]  government's the same way they're a bunch of idiots well at the bottom they
[41:58.600 --> 42:01.600]  want a bunch of morons who don't notice the corruption above them and follow
[42:01.600 --> 42:07.440]  orders but on top they know how to shoot 30 years ago a cruise missile down your
[42:07.440 --> 42:11.200]  chimney now the people that run our country have taken over the whole world
[42:11.200 --> 42:17.880]  they know what they're doing they know what they're doing these people 150 years
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.120]  ago said we want to live longer and we want to learn how to control people so
[42:22.120 --> 42:25.720]  we're going to discover the building blocks of life and the eugenicist went
[42:25.720 --> 42:30.600]  and had their cult discover DNA every one of the top scientists all openly
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.920]  say they're going to set up world government and reduce population the
[42:34.920 --> 42:37.720]  head of the human genome project had to resign three years ago saying blacks
[42:37.720 --> 42:41.800]  weren't humans every one of them go research every stinking one of them
[42:41.800 --> 42:49.560]  you're not led into there unless you are a hard core globalist all right all
[42:49.560 --> 42:52.920]  right I want to get into the big news here now and then in everything else and
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.600]  Gerald Salente is coming up at the bottom of the next hour he's been proven
[42:56.600 --> 43:00.320]  right with his prediction the collapse has been ongoing people said well we
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.120]  haven't collapsed yet he's wrong folks we're collapsed and they didn't tell you
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.200]  it's like waking up and your wife's dead next to you in bed you get up go to the
[43:08.200 --> 43:12.680]  bathroom make coffee come back in and go hey honey I'll let her sleep you know
[43:12.680 --> 43:15.720]  it's Saturday morning and finally at noon you go in to wake her up and she's
[43:15.720 --> 43:20.040]  dead just because you didn't know that the stinking economy is in the deep
[43:20.040 --> 43:24.080]  depression then imploding just because they didn't tell you that your wife's
[43:24.080 --> 43:32.800]  dead in bed next to you doesn't mean she hadn't just because nobody knew in 1942
[43:32.800 --> 43:36.440]  that Hitler had death camps working people to death and put folks didn't
[43:36.440 --> 43:41.360]  find out until 45 didn't mean it wasn't going on I'm sick of the culture of
[43:41.360 --> 43:46.280]  denial I'm sick of it I'm sick of their psychological warfare that even works on
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.000]  most libertarians and so-called constitutionalist how they incrementally
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.280]  train us for it it doesn't condition me it makes me angry I have an allergic
[43:56.280 --> 44:10.800]  reaction to it like poison ivy it makes me mad I see it all and it's just gonna
[44:10.800 --> 44:16.600]  get crazier and crazier and crazier by increment the frog in the pot hey I don't
[44:16.600 --> 44:20.680]  if I'm a frog you put me in a pot it's nice cold water I don't trust you I
[44:20.680 --> 44:26.320]  don't like the way this pot looks I don't have to start getting my my webbed feet
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.400]  burned before I jump out I jumped out of the pot a long time ago and I'm watching
[44:32.400 --> 44:38.280]  the my country and the world boiling and the frogs rolling belly up and I'm
[44:38.280 --> 44:44.680]  being told oh Alex you're you're a fear monger everything's fine yeah yeah
[44:44.680 --> 44:50.680]  they're launching wars without congressional approval they're doing it all and
[44:50.680 --> 44:53.080]  if they can get away with that they can get away with the next thing well we're
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.200]  gonna restrict your guns without law we're gonna open the borders up without
[44:57.200 --> 45:00.800]  law we're gonna sign an agreement to use foreign troops outside of law we're
[45:00.800 --> 45:04.360]  gonna give foreign banks unlimited money just do whatever we want they asked
[45:04.360 --> 45:09.320]  Henry Paulson three years ago during the banker bailout they said how
[45:09.320 --> 45:14.000]  congressman stern of he said who gave you the authorization gave yourself 214
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.240]  million of bailout money to your own account he goes well I think Paulson
[45:18.240 --> 45:25.600]  couldn't believe it was asked the question turned red I did he was like
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.480]  I will leave the office in the Treasury gave me authorization and who was the
[45:30.480 --> 45:37.400]  head of that office none the head of the office they couldn't breathe I I am you
[45:37.400 --> 45:40.480]  mean you know don't admit that I'm an absolute criminal out in front of
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.640]  everybody you're you know you're part of the the club we're supposed to play
[45:44.640 --> 45:48.100]  like the emperors wearing beautiful new clothes the emperors parading in his
[45:48.100 --> 45:52.280]  underwear in front of everybody in the middle of town and finally a three-year-old
[45:52.280 --> 45:55.640]  steps forward and laughs and says the emperor is naked and everybody starts
[45:55.640 --> 46:02.160]  laughing and I mean I'm not smart I'm like a three-year-old I'm like that
[46:02.160 --> 46:06.480]  that looks like tyranny I read a few history books that that that it's like
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.520]  if I was in off the coast of San Diego and I was you know out there on a
[46:10.520 --> 46:15.720]  surfboard or something and I saw a big fin go by and I let me see that was a
[46:15.720 --> 46:21.160]  big gray fin look like a gray white shark I'm gonna not be pessimistic and I'm
[46:21.160 --> 46:24.760]  just gonna keep swimming around right here I'm not gonna race in on the board
[46:24.760 --> 46:28.880]  as fast as I can I'm just gonna be oh I just saw another big fin now there's like
[46:28.880 --> 46:32.320]  a hundred fans done and done done done done done done and then everybody's like
[46:32.320 --> 46:40.040]  oh it's fun football's on everything's great I'm on the beach going get it and
[46:40.040 --> 46:43.200]  they're like oh Super Congress isn't that bad I had launching wars in that
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.200]  oh so the ATF's telling gun shops what to do without law you know it's not that
[46:47.200 --> 46:53.760]  big of a deal stop fear mongering Alex yeah cancer rates have doubled and yeah
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.280]  diabetes has doubled in the last 10 years and yeah you started reporting a
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.880]  few years ago that almost every water supply has radioactive isotopes added
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.600]  to the sodium fluoride that's mixed in and now we were reporting it suddenly
[47:07.600 --> 47:11.440]  there's newscast all over the country saying it's in the aquifers yes yes the
[47:11.440 --> 47:15.200]  aquifers had to know it's in the sodium fluoride they mine out of phosphate
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.600]  deposits in limestone that's where they mine the stinking uranium as well
[47:18.600 --> 47:25.400]  the strontium the radium the solid form whatever the rate on gas deposits out
[47:25.400 --> 47:30.480]  into it's all there and now I got Texas newscast it turns out everywhere we test
[47:30.480 --> 47:33.520]  look at these pipes they got a Geiger counter right here it's not even going
[47:33.520 --> 47:41.040]  off go over the pipe I'm playing those newscast there's like the government says
[47:41.040 --> 47:48.520]  it's in the aquifer I'm a city inspector and they say it's in the aquifer oh
[47:48.520 --> 47:52.800]  really when we finally forced all this out last year it turned out the state
[47:52.800 --> 47:58.240]  for 20 plus years had known all about it and had been ordered by the feds and
[47:58.240 --> 48:01.880]  it's going on every other state as well had been ordered by the feds to suppress
[48:01.880 --> 48:05.840]  the data and it turns out governor Rick Perry in the last decade has been part
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.880]  of suppressing it and so they go how do we get ahead of this that Alex Jones man
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.720]  we ought to kill him if you kill him it'll give me even more attention that
[48:13.720 --> 48:18.440]  guy has produced millions of hours of things we just better discrediting plus
[48:18.440 --> 48:21.760]  he blows up and acts crazy all the time that guy you know it doesn't matter
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.040]  we'll handle it we got ways to deal with it what we do is we just come out and
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.080]  announce it's in the aquifers and we've discovered it and we're fixing it and
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.040]  there's some truth to that because in some aquifers there are some natural
[48:35.040 --> 48:38.880]  deposits washing out of the limestone same place we're mining the fluoride
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.080]  yeah yeah limestone aquifers there is some radioactive stuff in there but why
[48:45.080 --> 48:48.120]  is it going up and why is it in the cities of Florida because it's
[48:48.120 --> 48:56.840]  concentrated you're adding more to it see people always think and this this is
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.320]  my one gift is that I'm able to full spectrum analyze a wide band of
[49:02.320 --> 49:06.400]  information and then sometimes when I'm articulating something I only show one
[49:06.400 --> 49:11.800]  band of it because you can't you know give somebody that much data with spoken
[49:11.800 --> 49:15.760]  word unless you spend hour after hour going through every facet so someone
[49:15.760 --> 49:22.440]  hears one spectrum you know they hear me make one statement on one issue but
[49:22.440 --> 49:27.440]  then they're not hearing how it then interconnects into all the other areas so
[49:27.440 --> 49:32.920]  I'm good at understanding this I'm not even so good at articulating but for
[49:32.920 --> 49:38.480]  heaven's sakes ladies and gentlemen it's very elementary the bankers are
[49:38.480 --> 49:42.400]  imploding the country they need to blame those that understand they're the
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.080]  enemy and they're hyping in the public ready to stage terror attacks to blame
[49:47.080 --> 49:53.600]  the American people it's very very simple to use this giant apparatus they
[49:53.600 --> 49:55.920]  said yeah we're going to bank up everything post-industrial world
[49:55.920 --> 50:00.160]  consolidate everything command and control we'll have the live extension the
[50:00.160 --> 50:03.920]  general public won't we'll hide it under national security how do we sell them on
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.280]  a total police state well you say foreigners attacked them you operate
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.080]  that you build up the system and then when you're ready for the next phase of
[50:11.080 --> 50:14.560]  implosion when you know there's going to be a political rebellion you then
[50:14.560 --> 50:20.200]  start staging events and move the narrative away from the muslim extremists
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.960]  on to the anti-fetal reserve people on to our enemies that's how they would say

[54:26.640 --> 54:30.640]  things get worse they will continue to pose as the saviors and then they'll
[54:30.640 --> 54:35.160]  have Mitch McConnell come out and say the Tea Party had a victory and blame
[54:35.160 --> 54:38.560]  this on the Tea Party even though the Tea Party doesn't like this and has been
[54:38.560 --> 54:44.320]  decrying it the Tea Party's like cut the spending now that's not enough you got
[54:44.320 --> 54:47.360]  to write off the derivatives but but still they're going in the right
[54:47.360 --> 54:51.160]  direction they don't like the Federal Reserve their pro-gun therefore they're
[54:51.160 --> 54:55.440]  now saying the Tea Party did this and and that and that oh now that we're
[54:55.440 --> 55:00.440]  losing our credit ratings it's all over the news today it's because of the Tea
[55:00.440 --> 55:05.560]  Party demanding that we try to cut spending that's why the dollar is in
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.520]  trouble yes it's not the Federal Reserve it's those stinking people that like
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.360]  guns and that like private property and to raise their own families and yeah the
[55:15.360 --> 55:18.960]  the mainline Tea Party are a bunch of fools on average you know they think
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.120]  Al-Qaeda is real the rest of them but they're still good people just like main
[55:23.120 --> 55:25.840]  lip mainline liberals are good people they really think everybody should get
[55:25.840 --> 55:29.040]  something free I think the government wants to give them free stuff because
[55:29.040 --> 55:31.720]  the government cares about them know the government wants to get a hoard of
[55:31.720 --> 55:34.520]  people that don't know how to work for themselves that can be used as a
[55:34.520 --> 55:39.160]  political weapon but again you're all gonna get front-row seats to it I
[55:39.160 --> 55:45.360]  understand you've got to get hurt really bad first and let me tell you
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.320]  they're they're test ballooning more and more they're beta testing they're
[55:48.320 --> 55:53.080]  moving right up to a whole string of stage terror attacks that they're gonna
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.640]  blame on the Tea Party and they're just putting the idea out oh see the vice
[55:56.640 --> 56:00.480]  president is right Tea Party are terrorists New York Times is right they
[56:00.480 --> 56:05.920]  are terrorist and I'm just sitting here watching it just like I'm watching NFL
[56:05.920 --> 56:09.160]  game and I can look at the clock and it's one minute to halftime and when the
[56:09.160 --> 56:13.040]  halftime comes up I don't go man I'm a genius they just went to halftime and
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.160]  and you know they've got a rock and roll band or Willie Nelson out there
[56:18.160 --> 56:25.440]  playing or Aerosmith no oh wow I'm seeing Burger King commercials man
[56:25.440 --> 56:30.480]  shocking I mean it's a complete rollout they're rebranding okay it's not Al
[56:30.480 --> 56:39.480]  Qaeda now it's conservatives and they're getting ready they're getting ready now
[56:39.480 --> 56:47.960]  gold has been has absolutely exploded in price to 1,670 above that the Wall
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.960]  Street Journal it now has gone above 1,670 Wall Street Journal refuge demand
[56:52.960 --> 56:58.680]  since gold record and comics gold powers to another record high bulls now
[56:58.680 --> 57:05.520]  eyeing gold at record as debt worries folks I wouldn't get up here on air and
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.720]  say I think gold at 2000 is very doable in the next year said that about six
[57:10.720 --> 57:15.520]  months ago because of dollar devaluation if they announced QE3 it is
[57:15.520 --> 57:21.360]  going to happen well here you go and I'm sure they'll finagle and drive it back
[57:21.360 --> 57:23.800]  down a little bit for a while that's a buying opportunity but then when it
[57:23.800 --> 57:28.640]  retraces that will go up to 2,000 that's what the laws of finance say Ted
[57:28.640 --> 57:31.680]  Anderson drug him into the studio obviously I'm gonna pitch gold and
[57:31.680 --> 57:35.320]  silver at you you know you can't beat these deals but Ted have we not been
[57:35.320 --> 57:39.520]  proven right again and again and again just proven right one time after another
[57:39.520 --> 57:43.080]  I mean here we there's a story yesterday in Bloomberg I didn't get a chance to
[57:43.080 --> 57:47.520]  print them today but they're talking about the Bank of Korea is getting out of
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.560]  the dollar in the Euro and they bought one billion dollars worth of gold I mean
[57:52.560 --> 57:56.680]  this the second world countries now are going hey we can't trust these mainline
[57:56.680 --> 58:00.960]  countries anymore first first first class first-rate countries because they're
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.080]  imploding and by now our media in fact we pull those out of yesterday's stack
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.880]  there were two mainstream articles are saying hey wait the Federal Reserve has
[58:10.880 --> 58:15.600]  uncounted hundreds of billions at least in gold everywhere that they claim they
[58:15.600 --> 58:19.360]  owe that's really us gold give that to us for the debt see people are trying to
[58:19.360 --> 58:25.000]  go hey who are these private bankers with all our gold well who are you but we
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.080]  don't have inflation we're not in a depression gold's a bad buy but you're
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.120]  hoarding it stay there Ted folks I want everybody to call Midas resources and
[58:33.120 --> 58:38.240]  ask for the radio specials you are insane in the membrane if you don't get

[58:51.640 --> 58:55.400]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.400 --> 58:59.160]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.160 --> 59:03.680]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.680 --> 59:07.920]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.920 --> 59:12.520]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.520 --> 59:16.480]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.480 --> 59:20.880]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:20.880 --> 59:24.600]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.600 --> 59:28.320]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.240]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in
[59:32.240 --> 59:35.440]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[59:35.440 --> 59:40.920]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my
[59:40.920 --> 59:45.160]  solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to my

[59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.520]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.880]  all right we're in hour number two five more minutes with Ted Anderson then I'm
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.440]  gonna get into a detailed analysis of the frame-up of the Republic then Gerald
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:43.800]  Salente joins us and then we have a lady joining us here on the broadcast who
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:51.640]  has sued the big GMO companies a plaintiff for the ACLU together they are
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:56.040]  fighting the US patent office for granting a one laboratory a patent on
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.160]  breast cancer genes BRAC one and BRAC two she has been interviewed by numerous
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.400]  news programs including 60 minutes but this is how they take your blood
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.440]  samples at birth they go patent it and when you try to go get gene therapy they
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.000]  say sorry so they're not just patenting seeds they're doing it with human beings
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.680]  so she's coming up in for for the last 30 minutes or 45 minutes of the third
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.520]  hour today very important area to look at that I know I've been ranting and then
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.920]  Ted sits there I never go to him I mean Ted it's so elementary and so people
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.400]  call me they go well why do I want to buy gold you know with with with dollars
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.440]  how does that help me well okay the dollars been devalued and so if you
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.920]  bought gold 11 years ago at 300 bucks an ounce or whatever it was where was
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:51.720]  gold 11 years ago Ted well we had about 245 dollars an ounce at its bottom okay
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.760]  okay so if you bought it 11 years ago at 245 I keep forgetting I actually bought
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.160]  some then I would say 300 something I remember buying it at 200 but I want to
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:06.440]  make sure because you know memory fails that far back so I buy gold at a lot of
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.120]  what about was 300 350 400 500 stuff like that and now obviously I can't buy as
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.240]  much because it's so much but I buy a little but thank God I did buy you know
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.440]  some back then really when I had almost no money but I was able to you know every
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.600]  month to get a little something get some silver and it builds up so so people are
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.320]  like why is that a good deal let me see your dollars been devalued real
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.840]  estate's been devalued all this stuff's gone down or as flat at best but then
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.320]  there's something in the last 11 years that went from 240 bucks to 1670 and
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.640]  silver went from 5 to 40 plus I mean I don't I don't understand Ted why people
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.680]  don't understand I just don't get it they should they should hold it pretty
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.760]  clear in their mind by now I don't know why they wouldn't either but one of the
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.640]  things that's going on right now Alex the only reason why I haven't adjusted
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.720]  prices because I have to is that I was building out a studio and I just walked
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.080]  in hit the microphone you're able to buy at prices that are $1600 an ounce
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:10.840]  gold and right now we're looking at gold at 1670 310 silver went up to 4215 today
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.040]  I mean like the walking Liberty halves I have at 1897 should be over 20 the
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.000]  British sovereigns at 449 they're well into the 50s the Franks right now at
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.880]  358 those ones are into the 360 level everything that I have that that book and

[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.360]  has to come up and everything is going to go up so if you're interested in
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.920]  getting into something right now do it today because I'm holding the prices

[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.000]  and the debts he's been proven absolutely correct and he's going to be joining us

[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.320]  those for years so side issue the point is the globalists are coming down like a

[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.800]  and shift into the enemy which is where I do not want to be so I tend to screw
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.360]  around the show subconsciously I don't want to focus on this because it's so
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:01.040]  deadly. This special report is of the utmost importance and this is a warning
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.680]  to everyone this is a warning to everyone just like I told you 11 years
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.920]  ago the decision had been made getting rid of plasticle to destroy the dollar
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.200]  and that gold and silver would go up exponentially it's because it's a law of
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:20.000]  commodities and finance and economics just like jumping out in front of a
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:28.920]  Mack truck is a law of physics that you are going to get hurt really really bad
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.720]  if the truck's going above 10 miles an hour and it's going about a hundred
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:39.880]  miles an hour so this is not this is not complex stuff if you know history but
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.480]  those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it the people perish for lack
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:50.160]  of knowledge as as the good book tells us now there are so many deceptions here
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:57.080]  that first off Miss McConnell is a nightmare I hate him even more than
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:03.200]  Obama now I mean he is disgusting Bainer is disgusting they make me want to
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:08.480]  throw up at least Obama admits he's been a communist who wants to ban all our
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:14.480]  guns he's honest about it still he's deceptive on many issues and I find
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.560]  him disgusting as well but these Republicans these Republican pimps
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.280]  bought and paid for by the very same interest have come out and said this is
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.760]  a victory for the Tea Party a victory for America and you read the budget it
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.080]  increases it by trillions of dollars doesn't really make any real cuts until
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.160]  next year and those are tiny overall I mean here's an example they're saying
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.440]  we're in deep trouble over a few trillion dollars and the banks were given
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.320]  over 27 trillion the last three years I mean come on again what about their
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.440]  welfare we'll see oh the whole economy will implode if you don't get behind it
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:53.000]  remember Glenn Beck endorsing the banker bailout you will always know these
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.600]  people at key junctures by what they do Ron Paul called insane for being against
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.520]  the banker bailout and so this will only make it worse a few years down the
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.320]  road now we're there it's designed but here it is as Senate votes McConnell
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:18.480]  declares Tea Party one Reed says Tea Party is disconcerting what did Biden
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.960]  come out and do he said that he said they're they're terrorist remember that
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.680]  Politico headline Biden linked Tea Party years to terrorists and then he tried
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.160]  to say well I didn't really mean that oh really here's the New York Times the
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.040]  same day can't we do this right Thomas L. Freeman read that yesterday he
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.320]  compares the Tea Party to people with bombs strapped in themselves and he
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.960]  compares them to Islamic terrorist groups like Hezbollah go read it for
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:51.560]  yourself oh here's another one Politico the Tea Party's terrorist tactics from
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:58.240]  the weekend July 29th just type Tea Party terrorist and you get hundreds and
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.480]  hundreds of articles in the last two weeks thousands in the last year here's
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.520]  another one letter Norway terrorist rhetoric similar to that at Tea Party
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:13.520]  that's out of what is that Gannett here's another one the left hopes for a
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.840]  Tea Party terrorist this is from last year with different national talk show
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:24.200]  host like Stephanie Miller saying oh this is a Tea Party person remember
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.400]  Bloomberg within an hour saying the Times Square bombing was a Tea Party
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.280]  or I mean that there and people said that doesn't make sense he knew it
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.200]  wasn't they're just introducing it in the back of the mind they know you're not
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:42.080]  really paying attention they know you're only halfway paying attention here's
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.520]  another one the examiner Tea Party terrorism was Biden right listen this is
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.120]  very elementary the foreign central banks have come in taken over the
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.760]  regulators bought off both sides of the Congress at the leadership level that's
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.280]  why they've created a super Congress now for banker bailouts and taxes and cuts
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.280]  so they can do whatever they want they're just getting us ready for this and
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:10.040]  they're saying now oh my gosh here's a DHS video for the public white people are
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.800]  the terrorists minorities report them and all these internal memos and training
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.400]  manuals for the military and police I've seen this from the secret documents
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.840]  that got leaked and told you hey behind the scenes this isn't about Al Qaeda
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.280]  anymore see before they go public with something they shift it behind the
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.520]  scenes and get everybody trained and ready before they roll it out so we
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.200]  knew they're getting ready to shift over to domestic groups then they start the
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.120]  public rollout of it in prep in preparation for everybody's mind to be
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.480]  primed and right now it's like Biden sounds dumb saying the Tea Party is
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:47.440]  gonna stage terror but then next it happens and they go he was right so
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.880]  this whole thing is scripted just like when you know that Chevy's coming out
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.280]  with a new Corvette or a new Camaro you see a bunch of ads you know coming out
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.880]  next month the new Camaro hey they got a new Camaro it's an advertising complete
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:09.080]  rollout 100% you have all the past cases of government staging terror Oklahoma
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.840]  City all the proofs there so we know the plan then you have all these White
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.080]  House advisors Robert Shapiro Financial Times of London others saying we need a
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.000]  terror attack to get things going I've read that quote over and over again
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.040]  barring an Oklahoma City or 9-11 we're not gonna get our agenda through Bill
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.960]  Clinton 96 tells USA Today I owe my reelection Oklahoma City that's quoted
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.840]  in there other letters go around you start having media matters framing it
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.400]  Glenn Beck Alex Jones they're gonna cause domestic terror Michael Savage
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.840]  he's gonna cause domestic terror you can see it all to the point that Glenn Beck
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.160]  finally got it what six seven months ago and that's when they freaked out and
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.600]  said that's it Glenn you're gone and he's like but they're setting me up I've
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.920]  got to come out and say they're preparing a new Oklahoma City that's what he says
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.120]  he points at the Democrats says they're preparing it you bet they are the
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.520]  private corporations that said above them they've been given the word go with
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.960]  this script something's gonna happen that's gonna pull your bacon out of fire
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.000]  I mean they got public memos everywhere rubbing their hands together how much
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.240]  more obvious to have to get let's go to Glenn Beck as we go to break here's
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.200]  Glenn Beck talking about it and our article go ahead and put it up the
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.000]  news article there it is Glenn Beck government preparing a stage care here
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  it is left need this violence well listen to a clip from a Democratic
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.360]  pollster Mark Penn happened just the other day and yet no one pays attention

[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.400]  things President himself has to reconnect with the people remember President
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.600]  Clinton reconnected through Oklahoma right and the president removed and it
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.320]  wasn't until that speech that he clicked with the American public Obama needs a
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:19:01.080]  similar similar words of work for Obama needs a similar kind of event like
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.440]  Oklahoma City if only Barack Obama couldn't have the opportunity to speak
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.120]  to America after another Oklahoma City type event then he'll politically be
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:18.440]  in good shape Wow now according to Drummond Pike the founder of Tides who
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.320]  drum and I hope you watch this week because oh it's all coming undone this

[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.520]  told conservatives stop buying into giving up liberty to get the Muslims you
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.560]  love to hate so much because it's gonna be used on you keep hating the Muslims
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.640]  if you want if that's your fetish okay whatever but remember it's gonna be used
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.880]  on you get it through your head get it through your head get it I told
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.800]  all you Bush supporters I said everything he's setting up is gonna be used by the
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:14.320]  next Democrat and now the moron liberals everything being used you know
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.520]  that Obama's got now and grabbing it's gonna be used by the Republican they're
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.960]  all on the same team Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid it's a scam now here's
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:27.720]  Michael Savage he's got a bunch of these clips just type in the YouTube that
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:32.920]  Michael Savage Obama Reichstag and he lays it all out that when the people
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.280]  wake up to them that they're gonna stage terror here it is now I'll make another
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:43.360]  prediction I predict that very soon Obama will create a crisis along the lines
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.080]  of the Reichstag fire Reichstag fire I don't know what form it will take but I
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.560]  believe that once the minions are seen for what they are Ramam Manuel and his
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.920]  gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind and they will
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.440]  recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.080]  War when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant I will tell you
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.400]  as I sit here I fear that every night as I go to sleep I put nothing past these
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.080]  agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.720]  the most powerful military on earth and they're running into the ground by
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:23.280]  designed for their banker masters and here's the deal you're not gonna join

[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.400]  around and then have folks go you said this was gonna happen when we didn't
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:12.160]  say it was going to happen you know that it was a foregone conclusion if we stop
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.240]  it but yes this stuff is going to happen if we do not turn it around now
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.560]  remember this is a listener-supported radio broadcast so when you purchase from

[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.440]  when I wear a hat when I'm out fishing or working in the yard this baby there's
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:16.840]  not a lot of hats all wear I'll wear a short brimmed Stetson stuff like that

[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:57.080]  around here so it's a win-win-win-win-win now going to Gerald Salente who for
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.240]  decades has been a best-selling author and a political and of course economic
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.280]  researcher going to him and about two years ago the New York Times now they're
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.880]  trying to do attack him and say that he's into pessimism porn that he's a bad
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.880]  guy that the economy was great that the banker bailout was going to fix
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.960]  everything and he really just covered common sense and said QE1 QE2 now QE3
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.080]  this is going to devalue the dollar our manufacturing base is gone it's
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:28.600]  insiders and their crooks looting us they're lying to you telling you
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.600]  everything's okay because they are consolidating the wealth and they
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.520]  demonized him they attacked him they went after him and said look this crazy
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.160]  guy from New York he says the sky's blue we're telling you we're telling you
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.320]  it's burn orange at high noon this guy says waters wet this guy says ducks

[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.960]  are crazy and it's not that they're crazy they're lying on purpose they have a
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.720]  record of being wrong about 90% of the time because they want to lie to you
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:18.520]  Gerald has a record of being right about 98% of the time just like we do
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.640]  because we're in the reality now look at this news is he right what about a year
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:27.360]  and a half ago saying by the end of 2010 we'd be in depression well the real
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.560]  numbers show we are in one they are now having to admit I see it in the news
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.040]  every day oh this kind of is a depression a double-dip recession no
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.200]  according to real economic numbers it's a serious sliding depression the crime

[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.920]  news today crimes up 30 some percent in Austin from last year but the national
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.160]  news lies and says the crimes low we're going to Gerald but I want to toot his
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.320]  horn and two dars as well listen to this CNBC Europe on the brink of major
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.080]  economic collapse we told you every time they bail them out it's designed to
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.720]  consolidate power only gets worse I mean that's not hard we told you that was a
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.520]  fraud two years ago so did Gerald here's another one Italy under fire and

[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.440]  and now it's gone down even more here's another one China joins Russia and
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.560]  blasting us borrowing it for debt ceiling agreement people say why do they
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.320]  care because it's globally causing inflation bond market developments are
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:42.040]  deep concerns as Baroso over in the EU incredible massive route spells trouble
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.720]  for Wall Street going to Gerald Solente Gerald here it is my friend and you
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.880]  predicted it you told folks we've hit an iceberg the waters coming into the
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.920]  Titanic and they said and all the boats just leaning because the captain likes

[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:10.960]  said the sky was blue Gerald I mean I but but let's break down where we've been
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:14.920]  how you knew this would happen and now what you have to say about the media
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.360]  that's been covering this up and where we're going in the future well how we
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.840]  got here let's go back to 2000 and of course we were getting there before
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.720]  then but they keep pumping up failing systems actually it happened after the
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.360]  crash of 1987 and they just keep doing it rather than letting the white shoe
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:40.040]  boys take losses they have to create another scam another scheme and SNL
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:46.960]  crisis whatever it might be to keep it going then we go into the great dot-com
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:52.520]  boom and in October it's right there you could go to our website transjournal
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:59.600]  dot-com in October of 1999 we said the dot-com bust was going to happen and it
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.240]  would happen by the second quarter of 2000 while a lot happened in March now
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:12.320]  what goes on March 2000 April May June July August September October and then
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.760]  you go into 9-11 George Bush is president the country's going into a
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:26.040]  freefall all of a sudden the country rallies around our president what do
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:32.960]  they do they begin to lower interest rates to 46 year lows and that's when
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.360]  they started creating the big bubble that has burst and the only thing we are
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:43.880]  feeling now is the fallout from it it's popped so they created the real estate
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:52.160]  bubble and they created the credit crisis now in 2008 you remember the US
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.720]  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson oh yeah the guy that used to be the CEO of the
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.320]  Goldman Sachs gang oh yeah that Henry the guy that you would never want to sit
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.560]  across and have lunch with because you think you were dining with Frankenstein
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:12.840]  yeah that Henry Paulson the guy that came out and told all of us that we have
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:19.240]  to give our money to bail out the two big to fails the Goldman Sachs gang the
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:26.200]  Merrill Lynch mob the city crew the city group bandits one after another yeah
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:31.400]  that Henry Paulson so we came out when that began to happen and we said they're
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:38.680]  creating the bailout bubble if the Paulson goes then Obama's team comes in
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:44.000]  and what do they do we're gonna put together a stimulus package that's
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.520]  gonna stimulate like you never felt before shovel ready jobs and what do
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:57.800]  they do wait wait a minute by the year 2000 mr. Salenti our unemployment rate
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:04.440]  will be around 7% and then you hear Joe Biden say you wait you wait we're gonna
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:10.560]  be creating up to 500,000 jobs a month and what did they create last month
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.120]  8,000 little bit off Joe so what they've been doing is they've been talking up
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.600]  the Ponzi scheme and to keep the scheme going they get more guys in there more
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:25.840]  the white shoe boys let's bring in Ben Ben Bernanke the expert on the Great
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:32.760]  Depression terrific what a guy knows how to fix a Model T Ford I got it we're
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.240]  gonna keep dumping money in and bail out our buddies we call it the discount
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.400]  window and if you're a member of one of the mob members you could borrow Alex
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.360]  at point zero one percent and you could get all you want just keep it going then
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:58.080]  QE2 QE1 QE2 and now we got we got screwed and the whole thing is collapsing
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:04.200]  that's why as I've been yelling now and since we first printed in 2001 the
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:10.240]  beginning of the gold bull run as a matter of fact I tweeted on July 27th
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:16.920]  that after the so-called bailout thing this debt ceiling crisis is salvaged
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:22.720]  watch gold because if it doesn't go below 1600 after they come out with this
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:29.240]  scheme it's gonna take a sharp spike and here we go and and again Gerald as you
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:35.320]  said many times the system knows this they know what they're doing there they
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:40.680]  they understand the laws of economics but they lie to the sheep they lie to the
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.080]  public to get them suckered back in to their Ponzi schemes while they are
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:49.160]  hoarding gold and silver themselves it's not that gold and silver are going up
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.720]  when they signal they're gonna keep running the debts up and go into QE3
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.800]  well that signals that it's that the dollar is being devalued along with
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:02.080]  every other global currency that's tied to it around the world and so gold and
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.880]  silver is going to go up and I always love it three or four months ago when
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.840]  they drove it down and manipulated it and played a bunch of games with naked
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:19.000]  shorts and use gold went down a hundred bucks and silver went down 15 bucks and
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.400]  everybody said oh my gosh Alex is wrong Gerald's wrong and we're like look at an
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:28.600]  11-year graph it always goes up they drive it down a little and then it goes
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.880]  back up even more because the laws of economics are there they can play little
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:37.120]  hat tricks and try to fool people for a little while to stay out of gold and
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.720]  silver because it exposes what they're doing with the fiat paper but it's a
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.640]  law of economics that this is going to happen and I'm not happy that we're
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.840]  right Gerald I know you're not I'm not happy that we're probably gonna have
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:55.040]  $2,000 gold by next year even earlier I'm not happy that this is gonna I'm not
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.240]  happy hearing that crime is exploding everywhere that of course you predicted
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.960]  three years ago and we did as well I mean this this means they're going ahead
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.160]  with the roasting of the United States and the rest of the world I mean we knew
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.120]  they were gonna implode Europe after the next round of robberies I mean this is
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.440]  that's all that's happening is the rats are stealing some loot as they leave the
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.920]  sinking ship that they knocked a hole in the bottom of so Gerald where do we go
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.040]  from here now and what's your view on the Super Congress they've never had a
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.280]  committee that can originate the legislation and then on top of it
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:36.560]  block filibusters and amendments I mean this is really scary well before I
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.320]  answer those I want to just jump back one second another question you asked me
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.720]  about it and answer you said why isn't the press covering this I you know you
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.400]  have our trends journal will send you the JPEG of the prostitute that's who
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:56.560]  they are the suck ups in the bowdowns that follow orders from the top that you
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:03.080]  know General Electric tells you what to do and who are they their CBS and NBC
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:09.280]  their ABC and NPR they're all of them the prostitutes they bow when they
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:15.960]  scrape we have a Anthony freighter illustration of a prostitute everyone
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:19.800]  that sees it will understand it so that's why they're not telling us the
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:26.680]  truth about anything all they do is carry the water Alex how about the news
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:31.320]  and Fukushima shouldn't that be front-page news oh the fact that it's
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:36.800]  the highest radiation ever recorded coming out of reactors and quote deadly
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.840]  pockets that if you were in there for minutes it would kill you the fact that
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.440]  they knew that in the in the first week that three of the reactors had totally
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.720]  blown up and melted down and then later the two other ones did only one of them
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.800]  didn't melt down of the six because it already been shut down or or or how
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.240]  about we went and looked up the fact that because we did some research that
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.120]  hundreds of thousands of spent fuel rods were stored above each reactor we blew
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.120]  the video up of that mushroom cloud that happened three days into the disaster on
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:11.680]  that Monday and we watched the the rods blown 3,000 feet in the air and we said
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.520]  those are rods and months later they admitted yes rods were blown a mile and
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:20.920]  a half away so that's it they're covering up the news you know what this
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:28.000]  really is it's not as we said and others politics is show business for ugly
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.920]  people how could any self-respecting person take a look at McConnell read what
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:42.760]  Pelosi or any of these people and think that they have it together oh I love
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.920]  that little guy Ryan out there you know the tough one that wants to take every
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:51.000]  benefit away from everybody and privatize it you had we looked him up
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.680]  this is story in the trends journal about him this guy's never gotten his
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.760]  fingers dirty in his life and they're telling you to cut and what does the
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:06.440]  media say have you heard one word from the prostitutes hey Congress how many
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:14.360]  cuts did you take how many benefits did you lose how are you making sacrifice
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:21.720]  not a word so what it is it's Hollywood for politics is show business for ugly
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:27.680]  people and all the press are are the same kind of hacks out there these
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.720]  Botox babes man you watch the only thing moving on their lips and barely they're
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:40.520]  like the paparazzi and the variety of Hollywood covering the stars all I've
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:44.320]  met a lot of them totally unhappy totally unfulfilled because they're not
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.200]  living in reality and Gerald you've told us this the economist every analyst
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.520]  we only have analysts on who've been right 90% of the time or more that they
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.600]  would shift in from hey remember this three four years ago we talked about it's
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:03.600]  gonna go from hope and change to sacrifice chip in and now they've gone
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:09.320]  to that you've got a sacrifice you've got to chip in with higher taxes but oh
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.840]  but not the big mega banks and the insiders the white shoe boys as you say
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:19.880]  they are exempt from taxes period because they write the rules and then they
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.440]  don't just they're not just exempt they then suck through corporate welfare the
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.320]  majority of the money but all their goodies are off the table Gerald well
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.280]  that's right because you know why hey they're too big to fail dog you know
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:38.160]  who we are I mean that's all it is you know they they're the the crime the
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.160]  Wall Street crime family and and as we move forward to answer your other
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.600]  question where is it going you know how many more warning signals the people
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.880]  have to hear before they start taking measures for if the collapse it has
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.680]  happened already look what's going on world world the world's a war how many
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:03.160]  more wars do you need to become a world war the mini's disinflames it is real
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:08.680]  this same reason and by the way they re-engineered history they keep calling
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:13.600]  these pro-democracy movements they have nothing to do with democracy they have
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.920]  to do with the same thing the Israelis are arguing about or unhappy about as
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:24.400]  the Greeks are as the Spanish are as the Italians and everybody else is getting
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:30.480]  the chef they're forced to sacrifice while the criminal oligarchs and the
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.760]  people controlling the monopolies are taking in all the business and giving
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:42.400]  them nothing and why not because they're better than we are they're Harvard
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.520]  Princeton Yale Club here to Cambridge eating boys they have proper etiquette
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:56.720]  it's all look the only day you've heard me the IMF it's a verb I am F you just
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:01.720]  dealt with the International Mafia Federation the loan sharks the last
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:07.840]  resort it's been declassified that IMF and World Bank actually sent hitmen in
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.160]  to kill government leaders who won't sign their people on the fraudulent debts
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.920]  and agree to default on them so they can come in and take over I mean these are
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:23.880]  savage savage criminals and but but but here's the good news for the last three
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:28.120]  years every economic indicator a classic depression they've said milk and
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:32.280]  honey everything's great now I'm seeing in the news this is a depression
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.400]  Geithner goes on meet the press a few weeks ago and says the greatest
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:42.480]  recession there are metal thieves everywhere taking everything car jackings
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:48.760]  coffee places I go to have their doors jerked off and their cash registers and
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.480]  safe stolen houses are being broken into everywhere the police are being cut
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:57.760]  and they're telling us crimes down crimes down you don't need your guns to
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:01.960]  protect yourself kidnappings exploding all over the Southwest and what's the
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:07.160]  ATF doing shipping guns to Mexico to then blame the Second Amendment and then
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.200]  the Attorney General gets caught lying and doesn't get in trouble Gerald this
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.320]  is so lawless but but the issue is now they're having to admit okay maybe it
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.840]  is a depression so they've discredited themselves so so where do you see this
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:22.760]  going as it I mean look at Obama's approval ratings plunging well where do
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:27.080]  you where does this go well it goes into the great depression the greatest
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:31.400]  depression it's worldwide there's no stopping it and as we said when we first
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:38.000]  made our forecast just follow the notes 1929 great depression currency wars
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:45.080]  trade wars world war three world war two play now the panic of our way the great
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:50.320]  recession great depression currency wars that going on as you mentioned it all
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:55.680]  of the currencies are under pressure and what follows trade wars and then real
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:53:00.720]  wars they're going to take us to war these are sociopaths and psychopaths and
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:06.240]  they love cotton fodder they'll get the people's mind off the problems just like
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:12.160]  remember the Obama vs. Osama story on May 1st how the whole nation went on
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:20.040]  alert we got Osama he's wearing cement block shoes and he's swimming with the
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:29.280]  fishes so they fear fear and hysteria this is what fascist governments do
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:34.240]  look at the fear and hysteria they generated from that and I got another
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:40.680]  one for you if your memories short how about we're gonna go into default if we
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:46.360]  can't come up with a deal if the if if if the two if Abbott and Costello and
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.360]  Laurel and arty can't put their minds together and come up with a deal we'll
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:54.000]  go into the fault and you're not gonna get yourself security money you're not
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.680]  gonna get your your your Medicaid Medicare you're gonna get nothing so
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:03.560]  fear and hysteria and that's where they're taking us and then they blame
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:07.440]  the fact that China and Moody's and staring and pours are all saying hey
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:11.560]  you already are defaulting by hyperinflation they then blame the
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:14.840]  Ron Paul type tea party people that actually want to get go after the white
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:20.240]  shoe boys the the New York mafia the globalist the private
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:24.560]  Federal Reserve they're now in the news saying oh we're losing our credit rating
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.000]  because you didn't get a deal quick enough it's not the hyperinflation it's
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.560]  not the too big to fail it's not the tens of trillion stolen it's not the
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.440]  derivatives now it's the fault of anybody left right center doesn't matter
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.800]  who is mad at the bankers and now there's the new one they've been beta
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.120]  testing Gerald oh these libertarian people and these people that are angry at
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:49.360]  the government they're terrorist and homeland securities now for them and
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:53.440]  they're about to hit us any minute Gerald I mean you can really see them now
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:58.160]  branding that homeland security is for the American people not for the real
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.800]  financial terrorist again fear and hysteria they're gonna keep playing it
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.600]  and as I said Obama's numbers spiked after the Osama bin Laden thing so
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:11.280]  that's what they're going to do they're gonna keep the people in fear and
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.520]  hysteria and it it's global and it's breaking down and there's no stopping it
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:21.600]  and I keep repeating GCs Gerald Solenties you know the three G's and
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:25.280]  that is guns gold and a getaway plan because this thing is turning ugly fast
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:31.440]  and as you point out right I could actually see this place across the
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.280]  street it's the old one of the oldest buildings in the United States late
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:40.760]  1600s it was built the pier Pearson's house and they just refurbished it and
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.000]  put on gutters you know to stay with the times you know big beautiful copper
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.600]  gutters they're gone I have pots out in front of my place out here at the trends
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:54.760]  researchers to the street guy comes to me says hey man I'm gonna tell you my
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:59.240]  pal wants to steal your copper pots out there I said what copper pots he said
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.200]  those two I said a copper they're pottery they're painted copper and of
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.840]  course I said to the guy listen if your friend steals those pots you know he's
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.200]  not gonna like what happens to him so that's what's going on his head that's
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.080]  the way America used to get its justice done and that brings me to the next
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.320]  issue we have breaking news Gerald I want you to do five more minutes in the

[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:53.800]  com today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:58.280]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.440]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:06.480]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.400]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:18.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:23.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:26.840]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:31.040]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:34.440]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:39.480]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:43.600]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government

[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:32.040]  all right we are back live the Declaration of Independence talks about
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:37.960]  the king has sent forth created new offices and sent forth swarms of new
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:42.480]  agents to eat out our substance it's like locust and and that's what happens
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:47.880]  and then they want more more more more more and you get a North Korea unless
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.680]  you stand up and I'm telling you it is a recipe for absolute bedlam the armed
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:57.720]  population all these illegal aliens all this other stuff together the mass crime
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:02.640]  the government's ignoring while they cut police and try to get our guns I mean
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.840]  this is bad news Gerald you were you were saying something about when we went to
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.800]  break about the evil woman trying to grow tomatoes in her front yard and the
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.400]  good news is people rebelled and that's why the city finally tried to charge her
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.000]  with other stuff but suddenly neighbors all over the city started planting their
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.280]  own front yard gardens and that's when the tyrants turned tailed and ran they
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.080]  only want to keep pushing when they know they can win the minute they start
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:29.720]  seeing us have victory they leave the field because they don't want our
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:35.600]  victories to become contagious you got it you know people often write to us and
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:39.000]  say you know I point out a lot of the problems what is some of the solutions
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.840]  well we have a salinity solution in this transjournal direct democracy let the
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:50.000]  people vote we do not have a representative form of government only
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.800]  little kiddies in high school believe that one there are only people our
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:02:01.240]  representatives represent are the very powerful the very rich and the special
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:06.320]  interests that's who they do they're carrying for so we're saying on major

[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:45.400]  has direct democracy that's probably one of the richest countries in the world
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:53.800]  the standard of living is the highest among the population everybody's on no

[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:07.400]  no not here we have I cause people start writing back they say we have a
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:12.840]  Constitution yeah if you think we have a Constitution you're adding a mind well
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:17.200]  Gerald the direct democracy and as you know and I mean I'm entertained this I
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.600]  didn't want to have you back back tomorrow I should have plugged this we're
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:25.360]  doing a special report 7 p.m. central 8 p.m. Eastern prison planet dot TV and then
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:28.920]  of course after that it'll go out later all over the web and we'll probably even
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:34.160]  re-erate here the next day because it's going to be so informative but he'll be
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.280]  joining us tomorrow prison planet on TV 7 p.m. central for an info war special
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:42.360]  report but in closing if you look at their system it states that have to make
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:47.680]  direct democracy and then they send their representatives who then vote
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:51.400]  directly there but so there's still some checks and balances I mean if it's
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:57.360]  totally direct they could bamboozle the public into by falsely labeling things
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:01.200]  some pretty dangerous stuff Alex they bamboozle the public now they're in total
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.120]  control least we'll get the future we deserve and we're looking for volunteers
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:13.440]  the website is directdemocracynow.org this to us is the greatest revolution it
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:19.080]  could happen worldwide let's put the take the hands look what we have a gang of
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:31.400]  535 running this country 535 people a cavalcade of clowns the Republicans and
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:39.840]  the Democrats making life and death issues for us I've had it well we've
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.560]  got to have a debate about it and I look forward tomorrow night getting into
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:48.760]  more of the trends and discussing this solution that you have Gerald fire out

[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:52.080]  briefly hit this because this is big breaking news multi-agency armed raid
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:58.440]  hits raw some foods healthy family farms are selling raw milk and cheese now
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:03.720]  again 50 years ago folks everybody got raw milk delivered it was all local
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:07.840]  dairies but the big combines came in and said how do we sell basically rotten
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:14.360]  milk that I mean and I've had family involved in in dairies I've milk cows
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.000]  when I worked on ranches I know all about it okay the point I'm gonna tell
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.640]  you here and I'm gonna go to our guest explain something it is a magic food a
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.840]  perfect food milk when it's live it's got antibodies everything it's live it
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:33.960]  lasts for a week if you keep it cold but if you get any blood or any cow manure
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.200]  or anything in and if the place isn't perfectly clean you got to throw the
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:40.680]  whole batch of milk out and the first time you get somebody sick they never
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:43.520]  buy your milk again plus you really don't get sick most you just it might taste
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:48.920]  sour taste bad or whatever okay but big agra said we want to just have big giant
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.400]  systems bankrupt the small dairies mime up we're going to get laws passed started
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.920]  state-level now the CDC is involved in this to make you boil the milk they
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:01.760]  boil it and turn it into basically a cheese product that it's deadly for your
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:08.100]  heart and that's why I don't have local dairies anymore like the one Ron Paul
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:13.000]  worked for growing up in Pittsburgh okay you all had local dairies your people
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.640]  knew had the best milk you ever had a problem you're out of business the point
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:21.600]  is is that they they radiate beef now so they can sell your rotten meat they
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.840]  they they do all of this so they can give you dirty food and they've had them
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.080]  with SWAT teams arrested them and again they're they're they're selling the idea
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.440]  this is illegal now it's not even illegal the I mean they're SWAT teaming
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:40.320]  Amish but this is a new massive raid in Los Angeles County with guns drawn
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.520]  putting people in police cars again to scare everybody they're shutting down
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:49.720]  real American industry okay I mean this is the Soviet Union didn't even do this
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:57.840]  okay only in America now shifting gears Janine Gerard is an amazing individual
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:04.960]  and she is a plaintiff for the ACLU together they're fighting the US patent
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:11.560]  office for granting one laboratory a patent on the breast cancer genes BRAC
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:16.560]  one and BRAC two she has been again interviewed by 60 minutes you name it and
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:24.880]  we'll of course give you her website as well off the rack book calm she goes
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:29.800]  over the monopoly on genetic tests that identify the presence of the genes all
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.040]  of it you think they're just patenting soybeans or potatoes now they're doing
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:39.240]  it with humans and tell us your story tell us what they did to you and where
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:42.200]  this lawsuit's going Janine thank you for joining us
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.480]  thanks for having me Alex I really appreciate it essentially I was diagnosed
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:53.600]  at age 36 and I had some breast cancer in my family and so I decided to go
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.920]  ahead and get the genetic test because I did test positive for breast cancer so
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:03.880]  I ended up testing positive for the BRAC a two gene what that means is that I
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:08.960]  have a five times higher likelihood than your average woman of getting breast
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:14.840]  cancer and also getting ovarian cancer when I got the results of that test I
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:18.400]  wanted to be you know prudent about making my decisions because these are
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.760]  really big decisions especially when you're in your 30s the possibility of
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:26.520]  not being able to have children it you know and having to get your ovaries out
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:34.120]  or extremely taxing and you know as you can imagine stressful so I wanted to get
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:40.000]  a second opinion because I did test BRAC a two positive through myriad when I
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.880]  asked for a second opinion they said that in fact I couldn't get a second
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:51.160]  opinion because only one company runs the test and I didn't think that could be
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:58.120]  possible really because I could only one company run a test like that but they
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:04.720]  said yeah in fact myriad is the only company shortly after that I had to
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:09.680]  start making my decisions based on the myriad test and was contacted by the
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:14.520]  ACLU through a referral that asked if I wanted to go ahead and join this lawsuit
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:21.640]  in 2009 now explain to people the technicals because I've talked a lot of
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:26.280]  medical doctors they say now they're coming out with a blood test that shows
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:31.320]  markers that cancer is in you but then of course most people are getting cancer
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.320]  every week and your immune systems defeating it what you had going on was
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:40.200]  different if I'm correct so explain this to us
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:43.960]  sure basically it's a genetic predisposition this means that it's
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:49.600]  passed on from a family member to family member generally you have a 50-50
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:57.920]  chance of passing it on to a child and so I had had breast cancer in my family
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:05.240]  through my grandmother and a second cousin and also my aunt and so what when
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:10.840]  you do have it in your family generally they they have you test for it pretty
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:16.080]  quickly the reason is if you do have a genetic predisposition that means you
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:21.400]  have a higher likelihood in many instances of actually getting breast
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:26.800]  cancer or getting ovarian cancer that weighs heavily in your decisions about
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:31.320]  whether to get a lumpectomy a single mesexmy or double mesexmy so to be
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:36.160]  clear you you didn't have cancer yet and but but but but but you had a very good
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.200]  chance of getting it and so now the medical system is recommending that
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:47.560]  you that you have those parts removed no I actually had tested for cancer and I
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:52.880]  did I had tested positive for cancer okay and so they did a lumpectomy initially
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:58.200]  and and the margins weren't clear what that means is that is a good chance I was
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:02.280]  gonna have to have a mesexmy on that side that was gonna come back that's
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:06.840]  exactly what the test indicates there's a very high likelihood of it coming back
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.520]  I just I just care so much about my mother my wife my daughters and you know
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:14.880]  this breast cancer as you know just exploding it it's just it's just
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:22.200]  horrific but I'm sorry getting back to the issue here now now so then you
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:26.880]  couldn't get a second opinion you just had to believe them that that's a bedrock
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:32.720]  of medical history going back to the Greeks is the second opinion but it's
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:37.760]  only one company well Alex and here's the really bad kicker is that they're
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:41.600]  other they're other laboratories out there that can run the test the
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:46.800]  technology exists it's that they had a patent on the gene itself because the
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:50.640]  technology exists their universities out there etc. they can actually run the
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.000]  test but what happened what was happening is that myriad would flap a
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.280]  cease and assist letter to them stating we have the patent and you know they'd
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.760]  flap their arm and say you cannot run these tests let's be clear here they're
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.640]  saying this human genes in humans we've gone and patented that gene so now no
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:13.840]  one can go look at it and and what if the company decided to shut down what if
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:17.720]  they do I mean this this is the control this is turning humans into pure
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:23.320]  absolute objects are you aware of the 39 year global plan taking blood from
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:27.080]  babies at birth even CBS News is reported and and giving it to these
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:34.360]  companies under the table yeah man they are evil they even get our blood and do
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:37.360]  this and then you try to go get a gene therapy and they say sorry we've
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:42.240]  patented that as well this is outrageous think about this only one
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:49.360]  laboratory in our country has banked all of our breast cancer data
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:53.800]  you know why they don't want you looking at these phenol A and stuff and why why
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:57.880]  it's triggering all this because even if you're predisposed and when you the
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:02.800]  bisphenol A hyper feminizes women and then feminizes men and accelerates the
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:06.640]  aging in those cells and that's one of the big reasons medical doctors have
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:09.600]  told us that's happening have you ever read into bisphenol A and what it's
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.760]  doing to women yeah very very very interesting very interesting you know
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:20.320]  that the other thing that I wanted to mention is I actually have a group of
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:28.040]  breast cancer survivors of over 24,000 that follow me online and
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:34.920]  essentially I get emails and calls all the time from women who are stuck in a
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:40.040]  queue waiting for funding to even get this test unbelievable so it's a form of
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:48.360]  rationing already and this is so evil I want to talk more about your lawsuit and
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.560]  where it's going on the other side and some of the horror stories of these
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:56.960]  other women Janine Gerard is our guest we'll tell you about her book as well

[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:25.320]  people that just joined us recap the magnitude of this one company jacking up
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:31.320]  the price people are in waiting list they can't get access you can't get a
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.400]  second opinion and people say well that's free market no no no they went
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:41.560]  and patented the gene and so from what I've seen research now when other
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:45.400]  companies go out and do their own discovery of the gene which is you know
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:49.600]  humankind's property then they're saying well you can't do a new therapy with
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.800]  that gene so this actually stops progress because we own the test on that gene
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:01.240]  I mean this is this is like saying I own the color blue or I own sunlight or or
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.760]  I own water or you know it's falling from the sky I mean it is such an insane
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:11.840]  power grab now tell us about the lawsuit and where you're going with this well
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.320]  essentially it started in the district court and we we won in the district court
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:22.480]  level and then it went to the court of appeal where it got overturned two to
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:29.200]  one you know with the judges and you know obviously it's very frustrating for
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.880]  me but also all women out there you know this test is not inexpensive it's
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:40.840]  about thirty six hundred dollars and and so they believe that and because only
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:48.160]  myriad has it is the monopoly they believe that if this was overturned that
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.760]  all laboratories could test if they wanted to and the price would drop to
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:26:00.440]  about 150 and so all women could afford it as it stands right now there's there
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:03.760]  seem any women that can't afford it and cancer is really not something you can
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.840]  mess around with on a time well the United States was built on monopolies
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:11.640]  not being allowed but since the robber barons in the last hundred and forty
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:15.840]  years that's all they do is John D Rockefeller the founder of the family
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:21.600]  said competition is a sin and this is just outrageous and and of course as you
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:25.680]  know I'm sure you've researched this now there are so many other companies who
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:30.960]  were going out and and patenting genes and gene therapies and things and a lot
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.720]  of times getting our blood samples and then saying they even own that
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:39.000]  particular protein combination that is individual to you and you go in to get a
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.840]  gene therapy and they go sorry it's gonna be a million dollars this company
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:49.960]  Gribble snap you know they own it right right yeah it's crazy within my 60
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:54.120]  minutes interview I I listened to a number of genetic scientists talk about
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:00.160]  the horrible repercussions of this and how it's going to simply retard so many
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:05.320]  areas of research and if like deafness and blindness and and all sorts of
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:10.120]  different disease that they're trying to you know move forward in finding
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:14.800]  here for it's just horrible I mean but when you're when you're actually in
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.840]  the trenches and let me explain something you know Alex this is a really
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:23.600]  difficult thing to explain to people it's not a two-minute conversation you
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.280]  know a lot of political you know activism and and so forth people get on
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:33.360]  board and it's rah rah rah this is one of those things where when I talk about it
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.320]  in the public and I'm so glad you're doing this interview is that people don't
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:42.120]  realize how it's going to impact them directly and it is it is a kind of a
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:49.120]  scientific difficult concept but and the flip side when you're in the trenches
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:52.520]  and you're actually having to make decisions on life or death decisions
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.480]  based on one company actually having a monopoly on a part of your body it
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:02.680]  really changes your outlet I mean it's very simple Monsanto goes creates a
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:08.200]  GMO crop that infects and takes over crops in the same family and then they
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:12.480]  have courts rule that you have trespassed and stole from them when it's
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:18.760]  admitted they contaminated you and in this case they're going in identifying
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.120]  building blocks the human body saying that they have now discovered it like
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.720]  Spain discovering you know the Americas and planting a flag and then saying no
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:33.280]  one can ever touch this we will deploy and develop only what we want with this
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:39.280]  gene it is like saying well we patented the genes for the eye now no one can do
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:45.520]  any treatments for the eye we own eyes and and and it's just total evil yeah
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:54.080]  yeah I totally agree you know I I'm not sure where this is gonna go we just got
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:29:00.640]  the the ruling back which was a hundred and five pages of you know just
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:06.880]  amazing banter back and forth but we don't even know what's gonna happen at
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:12.280]  this point and what what's gonna happen we haven't even had our conference call
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:17.280]  with our lawyers at from the ACLU to find out you know what direction this
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:23.720]  is gonna go well I gotta warn you I've seen the ACLU do some good work but
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:29.360]  any big organization gets political and I've seen them drop the ball before in
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:34.320]  key cases with some bad precedent being created but I want to come back and
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:37.920]  talk about some of the horror stories from the tens of thousands of women that
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:41.360]  follow your work I would imagine I'm guessing Twitter will give out all the
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:45.080]  different websites there's some other good news though court organic farmers
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:50.640]  can sue conventional GMO farmers and pesticides trespass will be right back
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:30:00.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:06.000]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:10.760]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:14.920]  about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even
[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:18.320]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:22.600]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:26.560]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:30.440]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:34.880]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:38.280]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a
[02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:42.200]  real eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:45.600]  free video online today he explains everything you need to know including
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:48.920]  simple steps you can take to protect yourself you can find the video at

[02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:08.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:12.560]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:16.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:21.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:25.240]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:29.840]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:33.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:37.920]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:41.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:44.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:15.200]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:20.240]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:25.640]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For
[02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:30.560]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:34.960]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:38.680]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:42.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:48.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:54.240]  the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:33:11.600]  watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:28.000]  Jenae Gerard is our guest and Jenae before we get into some of the horror
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:34.520]  stories so folks can get together and so women facing this scourge this plague
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:39.840]  of breast cancer from the GMO and the bisphenol and all the rest of it it's
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:43.000]  just exploding off the charts ladies and gentlemen but it's all part of
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.200]  globalism all part of the New World Order give us some of the websites tell
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:49.480]  us about the publications tell us about the work you're doing.
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:54.080]  Sure I actually wrote a breast cancer book called Off the Rack Chronicles of
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.560]  a 30-something single breast cancer survivor and it's just a humorous
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:03.400]  ironic you know look at what it's like to go through treatment and it's one of
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:08.160]  the first funny books out there that helps women have a little bit of humor
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.760]  and seriousness going through this. Secondly I have a website called Beyond
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:19.600]  the Booby Trap B-O-O-B-I-E and my community on Facebook is about 24,000
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:24.720]  and I get about 2.1 million interactions per month on there between
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:30.680]  breast cancer survivors. The Facebook site is facebook.com forward slash
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:38.000]  B-E-A-T breast cancer and that's where most of the action occurs where we have
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.960]  all of our communication and disseminate between each other drug
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:50.400]  interaction surgery information etc. They're pretty tight bond. Well it just
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:55.640]  makes me so angry when I think about what's happening to women in our
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:00.520]  country in the persecution go through for folks some of the reports you're
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:07.400]  getting. Sure I had one woman in a very rural county who didn't have insurance
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:12.120]  she had been laid off from her job for actually getting breast cancer. She had
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:18.160]  trouble even doing her work. She was laid off. She had breast cancer in her
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.520]  family and it was suggested to her by a local clinic to go ahead and get the
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:27.080]  genetic test run but she couldn't afford it because she didn't have insurance.
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:33.520]  Of course it was $3,600. So she asked what her options were and her options
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:41.720]  were to wait in a queue for public funds to be allocated towards her or to not
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:48.560]  get the test at all. And of course when you have breast cancer in your family and
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:53.920]  you have a diagnosis you really need it to get on the ball and figure out what
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:59.880]  you need to do to protect yourself and make the right decision. So to have her
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:04.800]  wait in a queue is absolutely ridiculous. Secondly there was a woman that was
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:09.560]  actually with me on the 60 minutes interview where they didn't, Maria did
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:15.960]  not accept her insurance. So they have the right to deny insurance yet they're
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:20.040]  the only company out there that runs the test. Well it's simple the way our
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:25.880]  system is set up. A you can't have a monopoly but B you can have the patent
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:29.960]  but then you have to license it to companies and you can charge your fee
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:34.160]  but you've got to license it but they're not doing that and that that's the
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:37.480]  the crème de la crème of corruption right there. I thought whoa I didn't know
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.720]  that they can even refuse you if they want. I mean this is insane you know
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:46.000]  they have debates about we've got to give poor people free cell phones you
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  have to fry their brain so everybody can you know pay for their brain cancer
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.800]  surgery and the illegal aliens get all their babies paid for the anchor babies
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:37:01.040]  but citizens of this country have insurance and go to them and they say
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:05.560]  no we don't accept your insurance. I mean that is that is a death sentence for
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:11.360]  many people. It's absolutely ridiculous. You know here our health care system wants us
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:16.400]  to be an active participant. They want us to get involved in our
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:21.240]  diagnosis and to have every piece of the puzzle to be able to make an educated
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:27.240]  decision and yet we have a monopoly on this piece of such a major part of our
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:34.760]  decision-making. You can imagine a woman having to get her ovaries out and not
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:39.640]  having the peace of mind to get a second opinion on that when you know you could
[02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:43.360]  determine whether or not you're gonna have children. I mean come on I mean it's
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:49.400]  absolutely ridiculous. Well and as you were saying earlier there's so many
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:54.760]  other cases of all of this, so many other. I mean you can just type in genes
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:02.120]  patented or blood samples used to create gene patent and I'm glad that you knew
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:05.680]  about that because I was talking about it 16 years ago when I was sent
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.480]  documents when I first got on air because they store them for quite a few
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:14.320]  states the different regional storage facilities down in San Antonio and it's a
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.440]  Department of Defense overall program but it's at a private university what UT
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:24.640]  San Antonio they store my blood sample when I was born in Dallas everybody and
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:28.000]  they say oh it's a health department mandated as if the hospital couldn't do
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.800]  their own blood test. We send this blood sample off and really what they're
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:36.520]  doing is taking that running your genetic sequencing selling it to
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:42.520]  companies it is just and it shows the secretive continuity of agenda and we're
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:47.680]  just now learning about it and they literally see us as animals who have no
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:54.320]  right to our own bodies and are really just just just there to be fed upon it's
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:59.880]  incredible I mean obviously you can't patent electricity you could patent that
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:04.880]  the processes are different systems of sending it out or or metering it or
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:14.080]  controlling it you can't patent basic systems things that already exist like
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:18.040]  our genes I mean I could see you'll quote they'll say well what we're
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:24.840]  patenting the gene test but again that's just recognizing the gene and for
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:27.920]  what I've read on this case it doesn't matter if a company develops another way
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:34.000]  of doing it they're saying we own that gene though. Yeah I guess what they're
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.640]  saying or what what the court ruled is that they have the ability
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:45.600]  to identify remove and isolate DNA from a cell that's how that's how they get
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:54.240]  around it so in the in the judge that disagreed with the case said that's
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:59.840]  the same thing as plucking a leaf from a tree it still is a piece of something
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:07.400]  that existed in nature and you know so I don't know I'm not sure where it's
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:13.760]  gonna go but what I really would love to see is the get overturned and that the
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:19.440]  monopoly goes away and that all women can afford to get the test to protect
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:25.000]  themselves and to also have this data not banked in one company in one
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:31.120]  company so that we can further research breast cancer and move closer to
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:35.920]  finding a cure and something that can well that's the other big issue these
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:39.600]  big mega companies many of them have been caught they don't want cures they
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.880]  want treatments because there's more money in that and we know most the real
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:46.520]  scientific advances we're always hearing about a cure for this cure for that
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:51.040]  that's all shelved because the establishment does not want life
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.280]  extension systems being given to the general public. Mr. Gerard I really want
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:01.720]  to thank you for joining us today and we will continue to follow your case as it
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.960]  develops but by educating the public about issues like this there will be an
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:15.240]  outcry and we will end up in the end defeating a defeating a big pharma
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:19.640]  because in most cases these companies I mean it's like Bayer Pharmaceutical got
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:22.800]  caught and convicted in French court but it turned out it was happening all over
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:29.480]  the world for a decade knowingly getting your buying blood from the different
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:32.720]  organizations that collect it where all these you know well many people going to
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.240]  get blood then they it turns out end up selling most of it it's not you know
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:42.160]  giving out to folks when they really needed it's sold to a big pharma and
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.360]  Bayer knowingly would just not even test it they would just mix all the blood
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:49.400]  together knowing it's a lot of homeless folks and drug addicts that are giving
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:56.120]  blood they would mix it all together and create blood platelet drugs like
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:00.280]  factor 8 ship it out knowing it was full every
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:05.840]  envial of hepatitis A B and C and HIV a death sentence worldwide for hundreds
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:10.960]  of thousands and it came out that they knew and just didn't care I mean that
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.640]  is beyond evil but because it's done medically it's kind of cute oh you're
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:19.680]  gonna you're gonna die hepatitis now you're gonna die of AIDS now it's okay
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:24.160]  the CEOs needed the money they're good people and since it was done by them
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:28.280]  it's okay the only country to convict them was France everywhere else they
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:31.680]  said you're allowed to do this Bill Clinton was involved allowing in
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:36.000]  prisons people they knew had HIV they'd sell them the drugs in the and I had the
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:39.760]  dead doctor from the prison on they firebombed his office firebomb the hill
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:46.200]  and filiac society the same night up in Canada to get at the documents when the
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:49.520]  doctor came on the show and then said this was all going on and later the
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:54.240]  whole blood scandal came out but people need to stop being naive stop being
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:59.760]  naive and and realize big pharma grew out of the eugenics lobby in the last
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:04.400]  hundred years and and sees us as animals and on average I don't know about this
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:08.720]  company in particular but but think all of this is very very cute it was good
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:11.840]  having you on and I hope folks will get your book and get it out to everybody
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:16.240]  we know because it's such important work thank you so much thanks for having me
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:21.440]  on Alex you bet good to have you with us now we're gonna go to Mike Adams here
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:26.760]  in just a moment with breaking news now now I haven't confirmed this and I've
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:33.640]  known about this for three days and I have been trying to get in touch with
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:38.000]  the gentleman who I know did work with Ted Gunderson and who did get us in
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.840]  contact with him last time but I've been able unable to all of all of Ted
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:49.280]  Gunderson's phone numbers are dead I had him on about a year ago and didn't have
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:52.000]  him back on because the phone quality was so bad and you could tell he was in
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.160]  bad shape and it was funny about him two weeks ago I said I gotta try to get him
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:59.840]  back on because I know he's beaten cancer a couple times then I looked it up
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:06.560]  online and folks that were helping him out said he's he's he's in a he's in on
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.880]  live support a couple weeks ago that's funny I was thinking about it wanted him
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:16.820]  on looked it up he was on live support and reportedly but I've contacted the
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:19.720]  person who I know has worked with him in the past and haven't gotten an email
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:26.200]  back I would like to get them on to confirm this but I know when I talked to
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:29.200]  him last year here I was about a year ago on air like look up the date guys
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:35.880]  well here it is 421 10 so it was a year and four months ago in fact that's the
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:38.480]  image they're using there in fact I think that's one of his last interviews
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:44.400]  actually and he said yes I just had surgery yesterday I've had my
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:49.120]  artificial it was a bladder made out of a animals bladder something I forget
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:53.920]  you can go listen to the interview and he was tough as nails Ted Gunnerson
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:58.360]  ex-regional head of the FBI in Southern California true seeker a lot of
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:02.240]  Cointel pro lied about him demonized him I looked into what they said about him
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:11.600]  and it wasn't true you know that he was CIA and all this stuff and I remember
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:14.680]  hearing when he talked about 15 years ago thought it was pretty wild but a lot
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:18.120]  of it did turn out to be true and then nobody's certainly perfect but there's
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:22.520]  an extra demonization now that he's reportedly died he reportedly died on
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:32.600]  731 so he died he died Sunday and of cancer Ted Gunnerson was born in
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:37.760]  Colorado Springs Colorado he graduated from University Nebraska 1950 Gunnerson
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:40.880]  entered the federal Bureau of Investigation in December 51 he served in
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:44.440]  Mobile Knoxville New York City Albuquerque offices he held post as
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:48.520]  assistant special agent in charge and New Haven in Philadelphia he bid he ran
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:54.080]  Cointel pro in New Haven and as chief it was honest about that and apologize for
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:58.160]  it and as chief inspector and special agent in charge of Memphis and Dallas
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:02.040]  divisions Ted Gunnerson is the former chief the Los Angeles Division of the
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:07.240]  FBI and he reportedly is dead and I've waited for three days and folks are like
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.200]  why aren't you sick gang he's dead well cuz I just obviously he must be or some
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:17.360]  I mean he was almost dead a year ago when I talked to him and so there you go
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:23.360]  and of course Aaron Zellman of JPFO died and we talked about that people said
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:26.240]  why have you talked about we did you missed it but a lot of great people
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:29.800]  passing and it's very sad I mean Aaron Russo has been dead for like four years
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:38.600]  now very very sad okay I take you now to Mike Adams who joins us the health
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:42.520]  ranger breaking news multi-agency armed raid hits

[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.280]  unmarked vehicle they did not serve a proper warrant and this all happened
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:00.200]  this morning and protests are taking place right now in Venice California
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:05.840]  outside the Ross and food store so they have no shame Alex they don't even

[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:32.520]  just doing this to scare everybody and they do it with guns because the jury's
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:35.880]  dumb and thinks well they have guns aimed at them they must be criminals
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:41.720]  that's right this was a SWAT style raid with helmets and bulletproof vests and
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:46.320]  other other gear like mob style I mean SWAT style raids but conducted with a
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:51.680]  mob mentality they went in they followed the owner from his home and then they
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:56.480]  raided his home and they raided his store and they raided a farm today three

[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.280]  nobody's hiding it's an open store getting data to find out when they've
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:02.600]  got their biggest production run and have made an investment designed to
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:07.520]  bankrupt them and they swatting the Amish I mean people selling tomatoes I

[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:26.880]  and they said where's the cash and he disclosed yeah that's exactly they go

[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:32.200]  to your front door that's why there was a milk man they had grocery stores but
[02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:36.560]  your milk was delivered fresh for the day how many bottles you wanted big
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.480]  family two or three bottles one person you know small bottle they delivered
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:45.640]  fresh milk and there was no problems big agar wanted to be able to sell rotten
[02:54:45.640 --> 02:54:50.120]  milk keep it a lot longer shut down their competition they passed state laws
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:55.080]  they lobby they shut off their competition the monopoly man now it's all
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:55:00.640]  coming back and they are trying to shut it down but people selling pumpkins
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:06.840]  people selling tomatoes this is about hey you're gonna buy from us the system
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:10.480]  is scared here in Austin it's caught on big time these co-ops and people have a
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.360]  farm and then you own your cow in the stall and then you go get your milk
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:18.320]  totally legal trying to stop that they have a farmers market folks would bring
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:22.160]  the milk under private sale you could buy the milk that was you know taken out
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:27.440]  of the cow at 5 a.m. I mean I've bought it not now they had undercover people
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:31.520]  they're threatening folks and it's like it's not the law but a cop's threatening
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:35.960]  you and they will pistol whip you they will get you there look this is the new
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:41.160]  America and and Mike is it just me or do I see this stuff exploding now there's a
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:45.160]  major assault going on tell us what else happened in this case well it's very
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:48.640]  clear the pressure is on and they're they're resorting to illegal tactics for
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:55.920]  example they gave James here $123,000 bail and they said it at that level but
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:00.800]  they told him that he could not use bail bonds to raise that money and they
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:06.640]  demanded that he had to disclose whatever sources that he used to raise the
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:11.560]  money so that he could make bail now that is completely illegal it's a
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:15.160]  violation of his due process rights but you see they don't respect the law
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:19.520]  anymore the entire raid is probably illegal we'll find out because we're
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:22.960]  going to get a copy of the warrant meanwhile the ATF is shipping guns and
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:27.680]  drug gangs in the US not just Mexico but that's okay but they're giving this guy
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:34.480]  a mafia level bond force tell us the evil it tell us about this company oh
[02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:38.960]  yeah they're they're terribly evil because they offer wholesome raw milk
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:43.800]  from farms and where cows are not treated with recombinant bovine growth
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:48.600]  hormones they're not given vaccines they're free range cows they sell free
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:54.080]  range chicken eggs those are obviously very evil whoa they sell all kinds of
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:58.040]  wholesome foods and products that actually help people prevent disease
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:01.480]  basically they write it a crack house that's good folks selling eggs that's
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:05.760]  it that's a no no I mean what do they think it's land of the free home of
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:10.160]  the brave I mean North Korea you're allowed to sell eggs but not here so
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:15.400]  where is this going now well right now he's being held in LA at a police

[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:14.080]  for big government you know I and I got to say this you know raw foods is a
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:18.240]  favorite of those on the left often you know the more progressive and liberal
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:21.840]  thinkers out there and they're the ones often calling for big government well I
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.200]  got to say to you people this is what big government does to you big government
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:30.200]  throws you in prison for trying to be healthy big government seizes your cash
[03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:35.280]  and turns you into a criminal for raising eggs and growing farm fresh meat
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:39.840]  grass-fed cows big government is not the answer here folks it is the problem
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:44.040]  whoa whoa whoa whoa we know they feed them awful and ground up dead dogs one
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:49.000]  of your dog goes at most vets it sold to a dog food manufacturer and then fed
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  back to your dog or fed to cows mixed in with the awful and the blood meal and
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:59.040]  the rest of it you're saying these psychopaths were selling beef from
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:02.600]  cows that ate grass what kind of conspiracy everybody knows cows don't
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.040]  eat grass you are a sicko yeah well I guess the norm is genetically modified
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:11.800]  corn to fatten up the cows that's what most people are eating without even
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:15.800]  knowing that but yeah your real real beef comes from real cows raised on real
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:19.520]  grass real pastures without hormones and vaccines and that's what they were so
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:25.120]  conspiracy theorist everybody knows cows don't eat grass yeah and you are a
