[02:52.280 --> 02:56.960]  up in december that we've been under their control but they've captured the country and
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.280]  have been converting us to a total tyranny while using our energy and our funds to build
[03:01.280 --> 03:07.440]  the planetary dictatorship this is a big big deal and i basically broke it down in
[03:07.440 --> 03:13.160]  an article update that i added to the top of watson's article this morning and we're
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.920]  going to read this when we come back then separately i had another epiphany today i
[03:17.920 --> 03:25.320]  was jogging on the hikin bike trail uh with my father as i hang out more and more the
[03:25.320 --> 03:29.800]  older i get the more i hang out with my dad and i tend to hang out with older people
[03:29.800 --> 03:34.440]  it's it's it's it's it's i feel old so my dad's not that old but i just like hanging
[03:34.440 --> 03:39.960]  around with him and my mom but also other other folks and so we went for a little jog
[03:39.960 --> 03:43.680]  i'm trying to get him in shape i'm trying to get in shape he was about a hundred yards
[03:43.680 --> 03:51.480]  behind me it slowed down and i jogged past a young family with a newborn little baby
[03:51.480 --> 03:59.760]  in in a pack on the chest of his father and reminded me of my children in the little infant
[03:59.760 --> 04:08.760]  packs and it was a little bit tiny uh maybe just a few months old and when i jogged past
[04:08.760 --> 04:14.640]  him i thought you know usually you'd stop and give them the speech about vaccines gmo
[04:14.640 --> 04:19.960]  fluoride but man i i'm late i got out of here late i got to get to work i got a lot of stuff
[04:19.960 --> 04:26.400]  to get done and so uh when i stopped and turned back around and came back past him i stopped
[04:26.400 --> 04:33.280]  and i talked to him and i had this thought after i got in the car later that the thing
[04:33.280 --> 04:37.800]  i'm going to do is i'm going to start videotaping these encounters just as an example of what
[04:37.800 --> 04:42.160]  to do with others so you warn them it's our responsibility to warn them and the fact that
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.960]  people think it's weird you're warning them about vaccines gmo and stuff that'd be like
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.680]  saying in in the 1960s if you knew about putting syphilis in black people's vaccines
[04:51.680 --> 04:56.480]  injecting them with syphilis infecting them if i knew and didn't go tell them hey don't

[08:48.400 --> 08:54.640]  this country cj grisha will pop in terry holcomb and many many others are going to be popping
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.440]  in here on the broadcast today we're going to have the folks on from don't comply dot
[09:00.440 --> 09:07.640]  com as well texas carry dot org and others and i'll be down at an open carry demonstration
[09:07.640 --> 09:13.880]  coming up ten a.m. with the texas land commissioner and others in san antonio texas in front
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.800]  of the alamo this coming saturday ten a.m. the police chief had said he was going to
[09:18.800 --> 09:24.020]  violate the law in the newspaper and arrest anybody that open carry the long rifle which
[09:24.020 --> 09:28.440]  is totally legal in texas and most other states he's now backed off and says he'll
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.560]  allow it this one day and that was in the san antonio express news and a press release
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.640]  by the police department yesterday and the police department said we're all on the same
[09:37.640 --> 09:42.800]  time it's not us against them and that's because the union and i've got this from inside sources
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.560]  but the police have also spoken out i said we're not going to arrest people for having
[09:47.560 --> 09:53.360]  legal guns so san antonio police department that's what the civil rights movement's all
[09:53.360 --> 09:58.560]  about we're not going to arrest people the black folks go into lunch counters and eat
[09:58.560 --> 10:02.720]  see that that's what you've got to do like mohammed ghandi they said you couldn't gather
[10:02.720 --> 10:06.520]  your own salt you had to buy it from the british east india company in india even though
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.400]  they had ocean surrounding half the country and salt was very inexpensive they would arrest
[10:11.400 --> 10:17.680]  you years in prison if you tried to gather your own salt from the ocean so mohammed
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.760]  ghandi marched to the sea across the country and first hundreds and thousands and hundreds
[10:22.760 --> 10:29.560]  of thousands followed him to all break the law and stood at the front of the bus eat
[10:29.560 --> 10:35.920]  at the lunch counter that was the case here in the united states but with him go to the
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.880]  sea and gather the salt well we are going to reclaim the second amendment and say being
[10:41.880 --> 10:46.720]  a father being a mother being a christian being a libertarian being a conservative being
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.320]  an american being a veteran is not a bad thing in fact it's a good thing and you're not real
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.400]  liberals like thomas jefferson that are against it your authoritarians and everybody's starting
[10:56.400 --> 11:03.480]  to see you for what you really are that is what is coming up let me give you our top
[11:03.480 --> 11:12.360]  story we broke this at info wars dot com yesterday and i saw the comments on some of the other
[11:12.360 --> 11:18.360]  news aggregating sites that aren't mainstream media people couldn't believe it well when
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.440]  paul watson went with the article he already had i talked to him this afternoon more than
[11:22.440 --> 11:27.480]  ten sources this had been coming in for about four or five days he didn't know what to make
[11:27.480 --> 11:32.240]  of it it kind of got stuck in the pile of news coming in he goes through all the whistleblower
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.480]  and tips that come in to the info wars emails show tips at info wars dot com and other emails
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.520]  like that the rest of our crew does that but after he had more than ten of them in yesterday
[11:42.520 --> 11:50.120]  morning he indeed made some phone calls and they said yes that's our policy but that they
[11:50.120 --> 11:56.040]  couldn't comment on it and then he went with the article that you saw up on info wars
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.400]  dot com and prison planet dot com titled chase bank limits withdrawals bans international
[12:01.400 --> 12:09.000]  wire transfers now drudge report dot com the biggest news site in the world picked up the
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.560]  article and you would have thought when drudge report dot com picked this up in the afternoon
[12:15.560 --> 12:21.560]  that it would have been all over the news because by then bike adams had called me and said yeah
[12:21.560 --> 12:27.160]  we because we do international business in china with their publishing company he's got
[12:27.160 --> 12:30.760]  a pretty big company didn't brag about it he's pretty successful guy he said no we got the
[12:30.760 --> 12:35.080]  letter and we've got a big business account no more foreign wire transfers and they basically
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.240]  have been telling people just get a new account we're not going to get you know do your business
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.920]  i mean that's what a lot of people are basically being told and so it's it's completely confirmed
[12:44.920 --> 12:51.560]  this is going on i personally had my wife go into chase yesterday uh and ask them some stuff and then
[12:52.920 --> 12:58.600]  i on the way home i had to leave early because of this went to one of their centers and went in
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.640]  and said i'd like to set up an account but is it true that i can't do wire transfers and i can't
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.600]  have more than $50,000 of any type of cash business a month total that's not just withdrawals folks i
[13:08.600 --> 13:15.720]  can't say run a restaurant and at $50,000 in cash deposits uh in a month they will shut down your
[13:15.720 --> 13:22.120]  account and they said that subject to change it may even end up being less per billing cycle or per
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.920]  statement cycle every month so let's just be clear let's get the denial out of the way chase
[13:30.920 --> 13:37.560]  put out an official tweet and said this is their new policy so this is real this is going on now
[13:37.560 --> 13:43.800]  let's talk about what it signifies drudgereport.com has since last night moved it from being a top
[13:43.800 --> 13:51.160]  story to the top story uh the big link at drudgereport.com in case you want to find it chase fees on cash
[13:52.600 --> 14:00.520]  limits withdrawals on some accounts now the french the german the british the irish the japanese
[14:00.520 --> 14:07.800]  they're all reporting on this and freaking out and saying capital controls looks like grease looks
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.440]  like spain emergency red alert run around like a chicken with your head cut off because that's
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.320]  what this signifies anyway you slice it this goes from super horrible to absolutely dire
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.800]  there as of just a little while ago there are no news articles in the united states about this
[14:25.160 --> 14:28.680]  just like obama last week had a press conference he said several others
[14:28.680 --> 14:34.920]  and no one will ask him about obama care not working i mean that's the first question in a
[14:34.920 --> 14:40.040]  real press conference even five six years ago everyone would be asking different angles of that
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.760]  guarantee anybody who works in the media or even citizens that follow news conferences
[14:44.760 --> 14:48.680]  you know whatever the big issue is with the president the white house the economy the
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.000]  government the system that's going to be nine out of ten questions and after every angle has been
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.520]  hit if they're still taking questions they'll ask about some other stuff no one at multiple
[14:58.520 --> 15:06.440]  press conferences multiple multiple multiple press conferences has asked him about obama care
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.160]  that's how controlled the press is no one has asked him about a hundred plus days earlier this year
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.080]  drudge is pointing that out today the mystery of a hundred plus days where the debt ceiling
[15:17.080 --> 15:21.160]  just stopped because they couldn't get it passed and didn't threaten everybody with oh my gosh
[15:21.160 --> 15:25.960]  we're going to lose our credit rating of course the chinese have now lowered the u.s credit rating
[15:25.960 --> 15:29.560]  and there are quote biggest creditors so they're already maneuvering us towards bankruptcy and
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.880]  they're already teaching the sheeple that we're going to go totally bankrupt not because they
[15:33.880 --> 15:38.760]  maneuvered us into 600 plus trillion in fake derivatives that they've signed us on to and
[15:38.760 --> 15:46.040]  have the country in 70 trillion in unfunded mandates and 17 trillion right now currently
[15:46.040 --> 15:53.000]  as actual debt do now 17 trillion do now 70 plus trillion in unfunded mandates any way you cut it
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.840]  and then 600 plus trill that we've been signed on to this not our debt but there's total
[15:58.840 --> 16:03.320]  economic ignorance in the general public so they can get away with this because of economic and
[16:03.320 --> 16:11.720]  geopolitical illiteracy illiteracy pygmies in the middle of africa know more about government
[16:11.720 --> 16:18.600]  and banking i guarantee you than the average trending i'll guarantee you if a pygmy was given
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.880]  a hundred gold coins and said go deposit in the bank the pygmy would laugh at you and run and bury
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.720]  it under rocks guaranteed the pygmy is a hundred times smarter that's never even seen civilization
[16:30.600 --> 16:33.880]  than the average trendy out there who does not know their heads from a hole in the ground
[16:33.880 --> 16:38.200]  now here's the big top story and let me read over this so you understand the magnitude of what
[16:38.200 --> 16:44.760]  we're dealing with and why this is so important all right update chase bank limits cash withdrawals
[16:44.760 --> 16:52.520]  bans international wire transfers paul joseph watson update by alex jones alex jones says quote
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.720]  the fact that these letters were being sent out to chase customers was confirmed at the time that
[16:57.720 --> 17:03.080]  we published but in the last 24 hours we have confirmed that even large businesses doing
[17:03.080 --> 17:07.880]  international transactions have also received the same letters or similar letters by the way
[17:07.880 --> 17:13.000]  people with other banks are getting these now too by the way haven't gotten that yet as i told you
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.880]  and chase won't be doing this alone you can assure yourself of that let me continue i personally
[17:17.880 --> 17:23.000]  visited chase bank and inquired about setting up an account and asked if i could wire money out of
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.640]  the country or withdraw the amount of cash listed in the letter i was told no and that i would have
[17:29.640 --> 17:34.680]  to qualify with them for a special type of international bank account and would have to
[17:34.680 --> 17:41.720]  deposit huge amounts of money and pay fees to be able to access those services what this constitutes
[17:41.720 --> 17:50.280]  is a war on cash in a war on small businesses and individuals two years ago we saw a giant backlash
[17:50.280 --> 17:55.240]  against bank of america when they announced customers would be charged for using their own
[17:55.240 --> 17:59.960]  money via their debit card five dollars for transaction we have crossed the rubicon where
[17:59.960 --> 18:08.200]  now the currency has been devalued so far that you will have to pay money to have your money
[18:08.200 --> 18:12.920]  in a bank or use a debit card it's like garbage now the banks have unlimited fiat so why do they
[18:12.920 --> 18:19.000]  want yours they've already got the money with the qe unlimited that you're going to pay taxes on later
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.360]  they're going to gang rape you two ways devaluing and making you pay it back to them because they
[18:22.360 --> 18:25.960]  got the money how's that sound by the way homeland security is standing by with automatic weapons you
[18:25.960 --> 18:29.800]  don't like it quote in homeland security sir to make sure this this this takeover happens this
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.640]  criminal bank robbery of you of your bank account continuing in saying that international wire
[18:35.640 --> 18:40.840]  transfers are too much of a risk chase bank might as well be bankrupt because it's telling you
[18:40.840 --> 18:45.400]  there is no money to withdraw and they are a zombie bank so they've been bankrupt for at least five
[18:45.400 --> 18:51.000]  years this is where the mega banks have wanted to take us all along a total cashless society that
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.360]  destroys all privacy and allows them to find and feed the general population into serfdom slavery
[18:58.360 --> 19:04.360]  bondage this is clearly a major step towards capital controls as we saw in the cypress bail in

[25:11.800 --> 25:23.240]  to control you and now if you just joined us jp morgan chase has come out publicly and said hey

[25:28.200 --> 25:34.120]  can't wire money period but you can have money wired in that's a capital control when a country
[25:34.120 --> 25:41.240]  starts going into hyperinflation which they're set to do according to every yardstick under qe
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.880]  unlimited and the new fed chief says she's going to accelerate what bernack he's done she's the
[25:45.880 --> 25:53.240]  reported author of the helicopter bin strategy and so the last thing they're going to want
[25:54.600 --> 25:59.880]  is for dollars to start going out of the country to be converted or people leaving the country
[25:59.880 --> 26:04.760]  with their money the irs is announced they don't care if congress doesn't pass a law
[26:05.400 --> 26:09.080]  they tried last year and this year they're going to talk to homeland security about putting you
[26:09.080 --> 26:14.520]  on a list if they open an investigation on you you can't leave the country even to go to cancun

[26:20.920 --> 26:26.280]  i mean it's known when countries do this you're in deep trouble nobody does this folks but the most
[26:26.280 --> 26:32.280]  draconian places like north korea but in america if it's a democrat doing it it's trendy it's racist
[26:32.280 --> 26:38.200]  if you don't support north korean style currency controls capital controls now let's go over the
[26:38.200 --> 26:44.280]  three points chaise needs to issue a statement clarifying exactly why they are imposing these
[26:44.280 --> 26:50.360]  capital controls it's clear that these regulations are being enacted for three different but equally
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.960]  plausible reasons all of which contribute to the ultimate goal of sacrificing the global economy
[26:55.960 --> 27:02.360]  on the altar of derivative monster zombie banks number one capital controls to prevent
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.920]  money leaving the country as the u.s dollar continues to devalue note that chase will allow
[27:06.920 --> 27:12.840]  international wire transfers coming in roaches come in they don't go out but not going out of
[27:12.840 --> 27:18.760]  the accounts note that they only that they are only concerned about risk when the money is being
[27:18.760 --> 27:25.000]  moved out of the account to forcing businesses to abandon cash and switching everything over
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.560]  to digital currency that can be easily tracked trace controlled and pilfered sucked off of
[27:31.560 --> 27:39.000]  security feed to death number three part of the preparatory phase of the cyber style bail ins or
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.840]  robbery of bank accounts or the government announcing a new tax to gouge out a percentage
[27:44.840 --> 27:51.160]  of people's savings or have the country go bankrupt under a debt limit increase see and now obama
[27:51.160 --> 27:56.520]  says we can never question another debt limit increase before that's financial terrorism
[27:56.520 --> 28:02.200]  when they did it four months ago and for a hundred plus days there the debt limit didn't go up they
[28:02.200 --> 28:09.640]  just froze what they said the debt was when it was actually going up so they decided this time
[28:09.640 --> 28:14.440]  to create all this hysteria now the chinese communists have downgraded our credit now the
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.400]  whole world's making fun of us like aha the people that didn't want to increase their debt
[28:19.400 --> 28:25.000]  they're the ones that heard america oh america's bankrupt now gotta be bankrupt soon and hyper
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.240]  inflation because people didn't want to hyperinflate and because people didn't want to increase the
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.600]  debt that's like saying he didn't want to he told that person not to shoot themselves in the head
[28:34.600 --> 28:40.360]  with a 45 and then the person did it that person's dead aha the person that warned them said it
[28:40.360 --> 28:45.720]  would kill them they're discredited don't jump off that cliff you may get hurt you jump off you
[28:45.720 --> 28:49.640]  break your legs and then the person at the bottom goes aha you told me i'd break my legs you're
[28:49.640 --> 28:55.720]  discredited that's how dumb down the public is what i just broke down to you they have maneuvered
[28:55.720 --> 29:00.200]  us like every other country towards this and now they're going to hold us hostage like 2008
[29:01.480 --> 29:06.600]  2013 but it's going to become yearly and then monthly give us the water districts give us the
[29:06.600 --> 29:11.640]  power plants give us the roads go work every saturday in a government work brigade or it'll

[34:51.720 --> 34:57.480]  going to see the same process we've seen just since i've been politically awake more than 20 years
[34:57.480 --> 35:02.920]  i've seen in the news more than 100 countries there's only about 190 countries i've seen more
[35:02.920 --> 35:09.400]  than 100 of them sometimes multiple times in 20 years have this same thing done to them where foreign
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.200]  banks take over their government leverage all this debt that's actually paid to them you understand
[35:14.200 --> 35:19.320]  they usually pay the imf world bank money back to subsidiary private groups and i've watched this over
[35:19.320 --> 35:25.000]  and over and over again and then maneuver them into okay your debt limits been reached you know
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  go into deeper debt to us or we'll bankrupt everything and then good people in the government
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.520]  find it the bankers pull back control the press lower their currency valuations lowest lower their
[35:34.520 --> 35:40.680]  credit ratings there's a panic everybody goes do what they say and then you get deeper into bondage
[35:40.680 --> 35:45.880]  until there's no electricity and running water and just armored compounds with military helicopters
[35:45.880 --> 35:51.160]  flying around and the money's transferred out of the country and the globalists do that they say
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.680]  to take control of the world to then bring in planetary government to then bring in world
[35:56.680 --> 36:02.440]  population reduction i was watching a clip uh just last night that lucredoski shot a long time ago
[36:02.440 --> 36:08.440]  a few years ago of um ted turner and he goes ted turner you said we should reduce population by
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.320]  90 percent but you still believe that and turner turns around looks so evil with bodyguards and goes
[36:13.320 --> 36:19.240]  i think two billions more like it and then pivots and walks off and you can say hey there are too
[36:19.240 --> 36:23.880]  many people you could argue that in some cases that there is dirty technologies there are problems
[36:23.880 --> 36:28.040]  we are hurting the earth but do you understand folks that they're bringing out a covert program

[36:49.080 --> 36:52.920]  explain to everybody now that they're going to have the maneuvering of obama who just came out
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.560]  in the speech and said don't listen to bloggers don't listen to talk radio they've openly authorized

[38:01.080 --> 38:06.280]  this pork barrel ripping us off biden offers federal workers handshakes hugs and kisses

[38:11.720 --> 38:14.920]  that for three years just now that now the factories are opening that they've been building
[38:15.480 --> 38:19.720]  they got suicide nets of course i mean i'm not kidding this is hell on earth oh our government
[38:19.720 --> 38:25.080]  wants to pay to build factories with suicide nets and fox com but but but they're liberal and want
[38:25.080 --> 38:34.200]  you to have free health care wake up folks wake up wake up please for heaven sakes they're now
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.920]  disguising manhole covers as giant wireless transformers frying people uh in new york i mean
[38:40.920 --> 38:46.520]  that's wired magazine we are entering the twilight zone ladies and gentlemen humanities and crisis
[38:46.520 --> 38:50.600]  and the reason everybody's show on edge freaking out everywhere you'll notice it everywhere is
[38:50.600 --> 38:54.760]  because people deep down know there's a crisis and the government run media the state run media
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.440]  goes oh it's al-qaeda oh it's right wingers oh it's patriots oh it's it's you know it's it's
[39:00.440 --> 39:03.400]  anti-war people it's anybody that doesn't you know the questions they're the threat
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.840]  misdirecting your instinctive concern no the concern the reason you're freaked out is because
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.720]  the bad people are in control they're the worst i've ever seen now before we go to really big
[39:13.720 --> 39:19.080]  news and talk about how to take control of areas we can take control of 30 minutes in the next hour
[39:19.080 --> 39:24.920]  then we got lindon laruse joining us and we've got a bunch of uh incredible civil rights activists
[39:24.920 --> 39:29.480]  joining us with open carry here in texas and all over the country historic things happening
[39:29.480 --> 39:37.000]  we're on the march the empire is on the run before we go any further i'm excited about freedom i'm
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.240]  awake i'm upset and i want to just just just follow me here this one of the most important
[39:41.240 --> 39:46.360]  things i've ever talked about i'm gonna spend a few minutes then we're going to our in studio guest
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.120]  who's driven here from south texas
[39:52.440 --> 39:55.320]  when i see a pregnant woman in a grocery store on the street
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.320]  or i see a woman with a newborn baby and i generally i always do it if they're with their
[40:01.320 --> 40:04.360]  husband because it you know might be creepy for a woman alone to have some guy come over
[40:04.360 --> 40:08.040]  getting her business but it doesn't matter i still do it because it has to be done but i
[40:08.040 --> 40:13.560]  especially do it a hundred percent of the time of a man's weather but i see them i have a responsibility
[40:13.560 --> 40:19.400]  to warn them about the gmo's the fluoride the what's in the vaccines on record us code title 50
[40:19.400 --> 40:25.160]  chapter 32 where it says for its experimental or law enforcement reasons they can kill you in test
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.320]  they say that's the law i say that's a fraud and all the history of secret experimentation
[40:30.520 --> 40:33.720]  i have a responsibility if i was in alabama they didn't learn about this till the 80s it
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.160]  went on for 45 years if i was in alabama when tens of thousands of black people came in for
[40:39.160 --> 40:45.160]  checkups were told they were being given vaccines and they were really being given a pentagon run
[40:45.160 --> 40:50.360]  program to give them syphilis to spread syphilis amongst blacks and also test it horrible torturous
[40:50.360 --> 40:56.200]  deaths that took decades spreading it to hundreds of thousands is estimated just like the declassification
[40:56.200 --> 41:02.680]  of hiv being put in the hepatitis shots for gay men in new york as a vector in the 70s it was a navy
[41:02.680 --> 41:09.560]  uh chemical biological uh weaponized cancer program under another name we know it is hiv age
[41:09.560 --> 41:14.760]  today that by the way it's on record the general public just doesn't research it so i know this
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.760]  type of stuff i have responsibility because i know the major vaccines on record have cancer
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.800]  viruses micro plasms all the additives the insert says it can kill you give you cancer
[41:23.800 --> 41:32.360]  guion berets neurological disorders uh narcolepsy i have a responsibility okay to warn these people
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.640]  and that's my info war so my dad goes jogging with me this morning because i'm making him
[41:37.640 --> 41:42.040]  trying to get him in shape i'm trying to get in shape myself he's about a hundred yards behind me
[41:42.040 --> 41:48.360]  i walk by a jog by these people they're walking by me and i see the father and the mother with a
[41:48.360 --> 41:53.960]  little baby look like an almost newborn baby in the little pack on his chest and uh i noticed
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.120]  the guy kind of looks at me and looks concerned i go that guy recognizes me probably in the fan
[41:58.120 --> 42:03.240]  i could assess him instantly run by i think i'm not going to mess with him i come back by later
[42:03.240 --> 42:08.920]  they're they're they're walking back the other way and i said hey a nice baby i got three kids
[42:08.920 --> 42:12.600]  myself i kind of stopped i go man i'm trying to get back in shape this is hard i really am
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.720]  taking a breather and they're kind of looking at me smiling and i go uh you know nice baby and
[42:17.720 --> 42:21.400]  they're like oh thank you blah blah and the guy goes are you alex jones and i said yeah
[42:21.400 --> 42:29.000]  shook his hand and she said her name and his name is um his name is um ryan crawley we found
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.520]  his facebook and this is the guy just a couple hours ago i was out there there is with his nice
[42:32.520 --> 42:39.800]  dogs he's a phd student in social studies uh at the university of texas he's a phd candidate i
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.720]  think he may already be a phd i have time to research on him and i'm gonna start i didn't do
[42:43.720 --> 42:50.040]  this today videotaping the people and i'm going to start putting them on air so that it so it gets
[42:50.040 --> 42:54.520]  some attention so that they get warned and so other people learn how to warn people i'm not
[42:54.520 --> 42:58.040]  going to just tell you about this now i'm going to multitask and then reach hundreds of thousands
[42:58.040 --> 43:02.200]  or millions by shooting a video and talking about them and i talked to him for about two minutes
[43:04.280 --> 43:10.680]  and uh i said listen i don't want to get in your business but i said vaccine technology
[43:10.680 --> 43:14.440]  is 500 years old the guy looked like he was a smart guy i said you probably know that and
[43:14.440 --> 43:17.640]  she was nodding and i said i'm not even saying there isn't something to the science it's that
[43:17.640 --> 43:21.160]  the history of testing he's trying to roll in his eyes and i went well you know about that he goes
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.360]  that was a long time ago i don't really know it's a lot worse now it's it's all currently going on
[43:26.360 --> 43:31.800]  they just use things that are less aggressive that kill you down the road or lower IQ and i said look
[43:31.800 --> 43:37.480]  up us code title 50 chapter 32 on bands on human testing except for exemptions on law enforcement
[43:37.480 --> 43:44.040]  or uh research purposes and then now she's smiling at me almost laughing almost thanking almost
[43:44.040 --> 43:46.520]  you know saying enjoy the rest of your run as i ran on up the hill
[43:48.280 --> 43:52.040]  so i i haven't had time to look at his phd papers i don't i don't know his politics but he looked
[43:52.600 --> 43:56.040]  almost amused but also kind of freaked out and i said listen i care about your baby i have
[43:56.040 --> 44:00.600]  responsibility and i said just like if it was Tuskegee and i would have known in the 60s decades
[44:00.600 --> 44:05.480]  before it came out if i saw black folks walking into the clinic i would be out there saying
[44:05.480 --> 44:11.800]  they're going to inject you with syphilis and i said just because i could tell you you're probably
[44:11.800 --> 44:15.240]  in the system somehow by the way you're looking at me the guy's going to listen to hear this go wow
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.800]  this guy really didn't read me i think i thought he was probably a cop or military or something
[44:19.800 --> 44:24.040]  i could tell he was establishment but no he's he's going to be an academic because there was
[44:24.040 --> 44:28.040]  kind of a smiling like laughing and i went listen i just care about your kid you've been warned
[44:28.040 --> 44:31.880]  and i turned and walked off and people could say man that's really weird to do that no it's not
[44:31.880 --> 44:36.680]  what if i knew black people were being injected with syphilis and i use that example because
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.360]  people seem to only know about that folks they did it to poor appellations they did it to
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.000]  Guatemalans they're still doing it they just gave hundreds of thousands of people in africa
[44:45.000 --> 44:50.760]  and india polio with the polio vaccine on record and it was a footnote in the paper 66
[44:50.760 --> 44:58.760]  thousand kids got paralyzed in one round of shots in india alone bill gates foundation okay i mean
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.800]  i have a responsibility this isn't a game and i get why the people want to laugh because if you
[45:03.800 --> 45:08.440]  don't laugh you've got to admit it's true and then do something so he's probably a great guy my point
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.320]  is is that he told me his name i went looked him up he's a public figure got a facebook i'm here
[45:13.320 --> 45:19.720]  talking about him and his wife i love you i want humanity to survive i don't want to be under eugenics
[45:19.720 --> 45:26.040]  i love everybody and i'm here doing this so you hear about it so you really research us code title
[45:26.040 --> 45:35.320]  50 chapter 32 subsection 1528 paragraph b which says we ban secret testing unless it's authorized
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.360]  for law enforcement purposes or research purposes so i'm done talking about that and they've got
[45:40.360 --> 45:44.280]  other codes and they change it one year and change it back the next so there's a bunch of versions
[45:44.280 --> 45:49.000]  the point is everybody knows about secret testing everybody knows the icu is lowering everybody knows
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.840]  this phenol a reduces fertility everybody knows this now we're joined by a guy that i've got to say
[45:54.840 --> 46:02.680]  as for medical guest health gas nutrition guest is the most popular we've ever had hands down doctor
[46:02.680 --> 46:07.960]  ed group and i'm not going to go over his whole giant bio you can go to his website and look at that
[46:08.760 --> 46:14.520]  but it's it's a huge um he's a diplomat of the american clinical board of nutrition doctor of
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.800]  chiropractic uh diplomat of the american board of functional medicine diplomat of the chiropractic
[46:19.800 --> 46:25.640]  board of clinical nutrition a naturopathic physician certified clinical nutritionist holistic
[46:25.640 --> 46:30.440]  health practitioner certified clinical herbalist and one of the big formulators in the country
[46:30.440 --> 46:33.640]  like now that i really know he is he's like the name in it that's why i've said who's the
[46:33.640 --> 46:37.720]  best everybody told me this guy so i got him lives here in texas alternative medicine practitioner
[46:37.720 --> 46:43.080]  and a lot more and he heads up his big uh you know different centers and things we're gonna tell you
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.120]  about that but the reason i got him back and he's here with us till the bottom of the next hour
[46:48.120 --> 46:53.000]  and then we're getting larouge on at the bottom of the hour the reason i got him here is obviously
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.360]  we've had so many frequently asked questions about nascent iodine you heard pharmacist ben fuchs also
[46:58.360 --> 47:03.800]  a great mind concur with his analysis yesterday uh he of course heads up the um go back to the top
[47:03.800 --> 47:09.080]  and i'll actually plug the cypress folks global healing center uh natural health and organic
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.760]  a living and we wanted to get him back on to talk about nascent iodine and other things that go with
[47:14.760 --> 47:19.480]  it that are so important and why people are you know really blown away by it and what it does is
[47:19.480 --> 47:23.080]  a shield in its floor and other things but i but you just heard my whole rant we're going to break
[47:23.080 --> 47:26.360]  in a moment dr grip and i appreciate you being here we're also going to tape an interview the
[47:26.360 --> 47:31.320]  little air next week for the nightly news but but you just heard what i said do you think it's
[47:31.320 --> 47:37.000]  extreme or bad to warn people when you know the vaccine insert says there's a chance it could
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.600]  kill your child or hurt them and they lie at the hospital and tell you that it's safe and effective
[47:42.600 --> 47:48.360]  no side effects when even the drug ads on tv have to admit what it can do to you with vaccines they
[47:48.360 --> 47:52.840]  don't do that because they're the worst do you think i'm wrong should i not warn these people
[47:53.880 --> 47:58.680]  i i think you should warn everybody i warn people too i remember when my wife was pregnant and we
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.240]  went to the gynecologist's office which i didn't even really want to go but she wanted to do some
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.160]  tests just to make sure everything was okay and there was a big sign on the door that said don't
[48:07.160 --> 48:12.760]  forget to get your vaccine today for pregnant women and i was in shock and there was some people
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.960]  sitting in the office and i was like listen do not get a vaccine this is what can happen to you
[48:19.400 --> 48:26.520]  and it's amazing that we are literally living in a chemical matrix because what led me to the
[48:26.520 --> 48:31.320]  root cause of diseases i wasn't even taught that in all the schooling that i went through and medical
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.640]  doctors aren't even taught what the root cause of disease is and they don't want to teach them that
[48:35.640 --> 48:40.440]  because even natural schools will teach you to prescribe a natural herb or something i went on
[48:40.440 --> 48:45.240]  a mission like you for 10 years to try to figure out what's causing all these problems what's the
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.200]  main reason we have all these chemicals in the environment looking at the air looking at the
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.640]  water quality looking at the food people are putting in their system and then realize that all
[48:55.640 --> 49:01.320]  disease i traced it all back and even looked at russian and and german research basically all
[49:01.320 --> 49:07.000]  the chemical stew that you're bringing into your body on a daily basis overloads your system and
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.080]  you're not able to get it out fast enough and that is a direct link to all disease and what we figured
[49:13.080 --> 49:18.520]  out was the most important part of the body which is never taught in medical school is how important
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.760]  the intestines are because when you look and you get a list of a million different chemicals and
[49:22.760 --> 49:29.160]  toxins that are entering the system on a daily basis well where are those and how are those toxins
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.800]  coming into the body they're most of them are all coming in through the intestines and that's why
[49:33.800 --> 49:39.560]  people have such bad intestinal problems that's why they have leaky gut the gmo's with the bt toxin
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.920]  burning holes through the intestinal lining and all those toxins does that's the honeybees on studies
[49:44.920 --> 49:51.080]  absolutely it blows up their stomach i mean the bt toxin so what happens is you have an excess of
[49:51.080 --> 49:55.960]  toxins coming in and not you know not even to mention all the anti fertility stuff that's out
[49:55.960 --> 50:01.000]  there the thyroid disruption the lack of iodine by the way and even mainline medical doctors
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.640]  sciences you know until about 10 years ago they said never take a vaccine when you're pregnant
[50:05.640 --> 50:11.400]  because it's known to lead to miscarriage autism so many neurological problems that is mainline
[50:11.400 --> 50:15.640]  medical science any doctor who was trained before 10 years ago will say you know we were taught that
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.360]  we know that now it's like no you need extra when you're pregnant and now look at all the uh drug
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.640]  stores everywhere you go to a drugstore and you get five percent off your bill if you get a vaccination
[50:25.640 --> 50:31.240]  if you get uh flu shots now they're promoting flu shots for pregnant women so it's a conglomerate
[50:31.240 --> 50:36.920]  of all these toxins that are being pushed upon us to create disease to put money back in the
[50:36.920 --> 50:42.760]  it is it is it is a mainlining of secret testing bio weapon programs under the eugenics program
[50:42.760 --> 50:47.320]  carried out in germany england the united states the united states with england created eugenics
[50:47.320 --> 50:52.200]  they created at all fitler on record and i told this phd guy that and i said you know that you
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.760]  know it was time time magazine man of the year you know they set him up the guy was like uh

[54:33.400 --> 54:38.280]  leading competitors I'm not leading competitors like eat the stopper out of the top I can't even
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.400]  take it it's the most nasty stuff I've ever tasted and they say that's nascent iodine and
[54:43.400 --> 54:46.840]  groups such a nice guy's like well I don't want to say anything but really that stuff breaks down
[54:46.840 --> 54:51.240]  and alcohol and other stuff it's not really nascent anymore and I want you to speak about that
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.000]  we're going to get into BPA and the new study out and what that's doing to the chromosomes and why
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.520]  the babies are having the autism and the deformity and the rest of it when we start the next hour
[55:02.520 --> 55:09.080]  but this is sold out and the factory that's been around 40 years the organic factory that
[55:09.080 --> 55:14.280]  he exclusively uses is making more exclusively for us right now it's back ordered about three weeks

[55:44.120 --> 55:49.320]  bisphenol and other toxins that have to be avoided and more when we start the next hour but briefly
[55:49.320 --> 55:56.600]  going out to break here starting the next hour you were getting into this total assault and why
[55:56.600 --> 56:01.320]  they want to make a sick for the medical model this medical tyranny in nazi germany and soviet
[56:01.320 --> 56:07.080]  russia the medical system was the tyranny because the tyrants found guys in white lab coats and get
[56:07.080 --> 56:13.480]  away with anything well that's the whole thing i mean if the if if a whole population is constantly
[56:13.480 --> 56:17.720]  sick i mean you can walk up to anybody on the streets right now and say do you feel healthy
[56:17.720 --> 56:22.520]  do you feel 100 i mean you're not going to find anybody i mean even children they're starting
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.080]  now when women are pregnant they're starting before women are pregnant they're trying to
[56:27.080 --> 56:32.840]  prevent them from getting pregnant i mean it's even if the if a young child is born they're
[56:32.840 --> 56:37.320]  finding all kinds of chemicals in the breast milk right now that from the time the child is bored
[56:37.320 --> 56:42.920]  they're fed not breast milk what they should be fed in most cases but they're on soy formulas
[56:42.920 --> 56:49.640]  gmo stuff i mean the kid is now sick from an early age the mothers are sick i mean people
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.840]  everybody out there suffers from at least one two three four five different negative health
[56:54.840 --> 57:01.000]  conditions and it says really the solution is as easy as we know and we've been talking about it
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.080]  for years how many chemicals and how many toxins and all this stuff that we're bombarded with on a
[57:05.080 --> 57:12.120]  daily basis everybody has to cleanse their body on a regular basis they have a shower they take
[57:12.120 --> 57:17.000]  a shower they wash their skin but they don't clean the inside of their system and the big secret that
[57:17.000 --> 57:23.480]  we found was if you have a million toxins coming into your body on a daily basis and you're only
[57:23.480 --> 57:30.520]  able to get rid of let's say 500 000 toxins on a daily basis you still have 500 000 toxins
[57:30.520 --> 57:38.200]  that your body has to keep and store somewhere in its system and how do we normally naturally get
[57:38.200 --> 57:45.320]  rid of toxins well through exercise we have respiration sweating we have urination we have
[57:45.320 --> 57:50.120]  defecation we and women have five elimination routes because they have their menstrual we also
[57:50.120 --> 57:55.320]  have abomination yeah well that's a whole another subject right there which is going to even cause
[57:55.320 --> 57:59.160]  more damage to the health care system we have we have chemtrailingation but go ahead we have
[57:59.160 --> 58:05.720]  chemtrailingation and we have the fact that we have a declining health care system that's a serious
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.960]  serious problem and we need people to stand up and take responsibility for their own health really
[58:09.960 --> 58:16.200]  because you know how much we can save and how we can attack this whole system is just preventing
[58:16.200 --> 58:23.800]  ingestion of all the things that cause disease just if you take away 90% of the things that toxins
[58:23.800 --> 58:28.600]  that people are putting into their system on a daily basis you can reduce doctor's visits you
[58:28.600 --> 58:33.000]  can reduce prescription medication your right stay there i mean i saw a washington post article a few
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.880]  months ago where they have to plant crops for the bees that aren't for humans just so all the bees
[58:37.880 --> 58:45.080]  don't die that's how toxic it is yeah that's right and what they're not this is gcn the genesis
[58:45.080 --> 58:47.640]  we'll be back folks with dr ed grip second hour coming up

[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.520]  well if you just joined us jp morgan chase says they don't need your business they've
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.200]  got the federal reserve they've got tens of trillions of mancubal out money they're
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.120]  going to basically charge you to deposit cash with them won't let you make any foreign transfers
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.760]  of money but money can't come in sounds like capital controls to me the story's top story on
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.280]  drudgereport.com dr ed griebs with us now the 30 minutes that london larouge is going to pop in
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:54.040]  to give us his geopolitical angle on what's happening and more here on this thursday
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.680]  edition of the worldwide transmission doc you were getting cut off by the break there
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.480]  going to break we're gonna talk about bisphenol a coming up the next segment ways to
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.720]  you know detox the body of that more but you've got the floor i mean what else is important people
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:13.880]  to know well what we found was that your intestines in your intestinal tract really is the main focus
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:19.560]  point so if you keep that clean on a regular basis using like a really good oxygen based cleanser
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.440]  you can prevent it's all about preventing the and and addressing the root cause of disease
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.960]  instead of addressing the symptoms of disease we know all the chemicals are going to come in
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.000]  they're going to get leaked through they're going to cause damage to all the organs they're going
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.880]  to dumb you down but what can people do about that i mean that's the main thing people want
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.840]  solutions the best thing you can do is reopen your elimination routes which means exercising
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.200]  breathing better sweating more and then eliminating the toxins that could be coming into your system
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:52.440]  and cleansing like just imagine if you were to take something every single meal that someone
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.640]  would eat and put it in a big trash can i mean they're going to have a breakfast meal with a big
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.360]  42 ounce coke they're going to have a lunch meal which probably going to be a big meat potatoes
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:06.680]  all kinds of stuff GMO dinner wine dessert mix all that up in a big trash can and pour it over
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.880]  the top of your system and then never take a shower for two or three days well i tell you
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.720]  most people are constipated they're not going to the bathroom two or three times a day so all
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.040]  that stuff is going and sitting it's a miracle we're even i mean no wonder we have the highest
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.360]  cancer rate in the world no wonder our IQ is dropping you know the studies guys pull that up
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.120]  us iq lowest in the world england trails us it's not just that we're dumbed down in the school we
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.080]  are physically brain damaged right because when you put all that stuff inside the system if you
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.960]  take the intestines out and cut them open it's going to be about 35 feet 35 square feet or the
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.120]  size of a tennis court is the surface area so if you have all that and you're not cleaning it out
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.040]  on a regular basis like two or three times a week then all that's going to just keep building up and
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.720]  building building up and building that's why bowel diseases are off the charts and i'm going to have
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.720]  you back in sooner to a whole hour just on gut support it's amazing why is nascent iodine so
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:04.920]  key nascent iodine so key because how many people that you know are losing their hair now how many
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:10.200]  people do you know that have cold hands and cold feet especially women if you have that extra weight
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.560]  around your waist area all of that has to do with thyroid and all that can be linked to iodine
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.040]  deficiency how many people do you know that don't sweat a lot of times when people don't sweat it's
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.840]  an iodine deficiency i would say that if you were to look at every single thing and i've researched
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.600]  every mineral vitamin for over 20 years i would say oxygen is one of the most important things
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:36.280]  you can put in the body it's the ultimate detoxifier the second thing is iodine iodine is regulated
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:44.440]  and needed by every single cell inside your system if you can trace every disease pretty much to
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.000]  has something to do with iodine whether it's too much fluoride coming in whether it's too much bromide
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.080]  coming into the body which they try to pile on us which they try to pile on and then we have the
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.280]  documents where they admit they're doing it on purpose it's not like two plus two it looks like
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.880]  they're doing it on purpose they admit they're doing it no it's all a fact i mean it's all a fact
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.360]  and when they know that's why they took iodine out of the bread that's why they took iodine out of
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.240]  the salt because they know that anyone who's deficient in iodine and you talk about mental
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.720]  retardation and problems with brain function women pregnant women need twice as much iodine
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:24.440]  during pregnancy and the rda is 150 micrograms a day i mean that's just enough to prevent
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.480]  a goiter in studies that were done on rats and so they do it so you don't get the goiter and no
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.960]  they do it right at the level just absolute scientific targeting with with hatred oh but
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.600]  they would inject people with syphilis they love us maybe i'm nuts because i would have
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.920]  warned somebody black or white don't go in that clinic get injected with syphilis that means i'm
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.120]  a bad person right i mean we're all bad for warning people because we're going against the system i
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.920]  mean the system so everybody go have the government inject you with cancer viruses and syphilis

[01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:01.000]  that that is coming up 10 a.m in front of the alamo san antonio texas now here's the ap article bpa
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.480]  miscarriage link study finds chemical may raise risk and uh they've got a bunch of different uh big
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:14.200]  studies uh that are now uh coming out uh on this front fact the article had yes to actually
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:20.920]  show the two different studies but uh antonio texas here with dr ed group and and uh anthony you first
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.280]  talk about bpa then we'll get dr groups uh take on this sure so we know for years now that bpa is
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.800]  linked to breast cancer of 130 studies besides uh susan g coman denying it and we know for a fact
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.320]  it's causing infertility but here's the most interesting thing about this study not only
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.520]  does it of course increase your risk of miscarriage and things like that by about 10 times or massive
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.640]  percentages but here's something that most people are missing this is only in the ap most miscarriages
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.320]  are due to egg or chromosome problems and a study in my suggested bpa might influence that risk
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.440]  so what this is there's an implication here that not only is the bpa of course causing miscarriages
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.400]  but it's actually augmenting and mutating the eggs or the chromosomes in your body and that has
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.640]  way more implications than just miscarriages when that's a statement by the american society of
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:10.680]  reproductive medicine yeah a stanford university uh endocrinologist was saying that this is in the
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.480]  associated press mainstream media so they're saying now it looks like bpa is going in infiltrating
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.600]  the chromosomes and warping them and affecting the just like last year's study showed gmo is
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.760]  exactly so we're being infiltrated notice also at the end it says it is impossible to avoid it
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.880]  completely speaking on bpa but here's the thing a woman is born with a preset amount of eggs
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:36.520]  in the event that bpa is so just invasive in our food supply and our overall environmental health
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.800]  what's happening is all eggs are being targeted and destroyed this is children of men's scenario
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.480]  yeah exactly so we could have a widespread infertility it's not like someone's going to be
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.880]  born and born in less than like a third world nation with lower bpa seems like the united
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.440]  states is being hit so heavily that all women now are being affected all babies are and by the way
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:00.280]  it's on almost all the printer ink the receipts they and again i've talked to the um the chemical
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.440]  engineers uh the people that run these plants they go there's no reason they have hundreds and
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.360]  hundreds and hundreds of different combinations where this isn't needed this is done on purpose
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:13.400]  no you mentioned earlier cost some more to make stuff with bpa it's also in dollar bills 90 percent
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.520]  of currencies contained chemical weapon yeah doctor group decimation well you know one of the
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.400]  things we've been focusing on is bpa d is detoxification of bpa because it's an endocrine
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:29.240]  disruptor and it disrupts a thyroid it disrupts the metabolism it it alters estrogen levels in
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:34.360]  the body we already have high estrogen levels men and female because of all the soy that's out there
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.640]  but john p holder and satan eco science in 74 that there's too many of us well the point is
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.320]  you know people say well there are too many of us and they go along with that argument but we're
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.240]  all being hit don't you get it these yuppies are going to try to have kids while they say
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:52.520]  there's too many people and there's a chemical weapon program this is big news if you go in any
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:13:00.040]  supermarket and you pick up any container you know the milk jugs the plastic uh water bottles
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.800]  it's going to contain the paper liners the paper plates paper just the jugs i mean and even the
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:11.960]  organic i mean you can like the organic coconut that's in the little uh uh flimsy uh containers
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.400]  what they have is aluminum lining and then they have bpa over that and i was just at the supply
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:22.600]  side expo in los vegas and i was looking at packaging out there it's the biggest manufacturing
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:28.600]  packaging expo there is every single supplier of packaging material out there has aluminum lined
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.120]  containers with a coat of bpa on them and not only that when most people don't know and this is
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.680]  what i found out for the first time it's the juice box liners for the kids box liners everything is
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:43.080]  that now they're setting up and this is kind of a secret thing they're setting up mandatory
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:50.440]  programs to where every single production food dietary supplement everything goes when it's
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.760]  done it goes through an x-ray machine and gets irradiated and x-rayed that's right they've always
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.920]  been lobbying to get it legalized just 10 years ago they also spray live viruses on meat that
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.440]  eat the bacteria that are grown in giant vaccine vats that's uh guys you can type in viral spray
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.080]  spray on meat abc news six years ago and now exactly you're saying you were there they're
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:16.280]  moving to make everyone with the fda make everyone irradiate that's right i mean you nobody knows
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.520]  that all their organic food and all their dietary supplements are going through x-ray machines
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.520]  before they go into the packaging system and um you know i tried to get some information on it is
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:32.760]  that is it absolutely a regulatory thing right now and it's not but all the companies are doing
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:38.520]  and they're saying we're doing it because we want to make sure there's no metal or any shavings of
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.960]  anything it's always for our safety yes for our safety and and the pharmaceutical drugs are also
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:49.720]  using bpa but so are the nutraceutical industry heads they're putting bpa because for who knows
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.360]  why it's it's more expensive they're putting bpa into uh nutraceuticals now like you know
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.840]  natural supplements so it's just so pervasive that's why you have to go with the brand that
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.080]  does not have it you know it's like vitamins are having aspartame added when it's not even a vitamin
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.560]  that you dissolve in your mouth it's just oh well this is the new vitamin the wood alcohol you needed
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.680]  they're loading it up by the way survival shield that's backordered that you developed uh i'm telling
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.640]  you this is special nascent iodine tell you you were telling me off air that it's called survival
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.160]  shield because this type of nascent atomic iodine is a shield for so much of this and and then tell
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.360]  me because let me let's talk about the leading competitor i'm not we pull we pull the label
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.600]  office i feel sorry for him we tried to be honest dr group as you know you said fine go ahead and do
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.200]  that to find other people to make nascent iodine and we got it and we can't sell it because we
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.600]  cannot sell this to our customers you are the only guy in the country you even have your own
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.400]  factory as well why is yours different in the leading competitor and what does it do well first
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:51.160]  of all there's a major shortage right now because everybody in japan china and all over the world
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:56.600]  wants iodine and they want the best form available so i mean that's a lot of the reason why you're
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.800]  on backorder and that's why i i suggest everybody just try to stock up as much as possible because
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.480]  it's only going to get worse we're getting calls from japan china and everything else where they
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:12.200]  want to buy the raw iodine they want to buy the nascent iodine because they know how fast it works
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.400]  i mean the nascent iodine is an electrically charged i mean it goes through a special processing
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.600]  our our processing system which makes it different than any of the other forms of iodine out there
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.560]  i mean this would be a standard form of nascent iodine which is in an alcohol base here let's
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.120]  show folks the leading competitor right here that's what it does to the top in a year rob do actually
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.320]  bought this a year ago and this is what is in his office on the shelf did that this is ours versus
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.160]  that and you have a bottle you did 20 something years ago still tastes just like that in the
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.000]  glycerin that actually tastes good to me it tastes sweet compared to that tastes like the most nasty
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.400]  thing i and i i mean i can drink like 10 shots of jack daniel straight tastes like mama's milk to me
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.080]  i mean i mean i can i can handle anything and i can't do that no actually what's the difference
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.560]  yeah so rob actually got this bottle here and and for the radio listeners basically what happened
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:04.280]  was there's a glass dropper and it was the off-gassing of the iodine or the grain alcohol
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.760]  something ate away the plastic holding tethering the uh plastic the glass dropper and that fell
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.920]  in so we had to take that out but then the rubber is not this it might not actually be rubber but
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:21.080]  the top here we don't use rubber but it was so degraded that it also fell off and the remaining
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:27.560]  is this plastic goo at the top by the way let's be clear we went all over trying we actually
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.240]  wanted this to be good in fact the crazy thing is we were actually looking to have this made by
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.960]  these people and getting test and and and they basically are nice folks to admit well it and
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.520]  then and then alex wanted to try it so we were like well let's try it you know see the taste like
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.920]  and he he literally stepped backwards a few steps after he took it and i thought he was joking around
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:49.240]  he he at first he probably was joking but then he realized wow this is horrible and i said
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.520]  can't be that bad give me some i put on my tongue it started burning my tongue and then it went numb
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.200]  to the point where when i was eating something i couldn't even taste it it was just now now dr
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.880]  group explain why why when it's because you kept saying glycerin glycerin or it breaks down this
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.920]  is obviously broken down into something what's happening well first of all the standard old
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.400]  school method of doing nascent iodine is in an alcohol base and that's a hundred percent alcohol
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.800]  that's like everclear you could run your car on that stuff and so you know i would never give that to
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.200]  a baby i would never give it to my kid i mean it's going to burn their mouth they're not going to want
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:29.400]  it what we did is we took 10 years to develop a new technology which is basically a thermodynamic
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:39.800]  pressure sensitive high energy sound pulse technology which creates a nano emulsion of the iodine
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.640]  into the glycerin matrix and so it's it's i think it's even better than the standard of a nascent
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:50.040]  iodine because it's a stable comp i was talking you guys have this proprietary and my dad looked
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.600]  this up because i've done it in years of research he said no they're like the only specially
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.440]  certified like i guess it's all secret or whatever but the government had to certify it
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.680]  where i guess it's a gas and it's injected in or something and all this other way i mean i'm
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.400]  guessing i don't know how you guys do that well put it this way i you know i love doing stuff like
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.200]  that i'm a big fan of nicolette tesla and i and quantum physics and that's kind of my hobby so
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.000]  what we did was i actually worked with two uh russian physicists some of the top russian
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.040]  physicists oh you never bragged about this i went and looked it up it's like in the national
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:25.800]  institutes of health and stuff i didn't even know that yeah so uh so anyway it took over a period
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.440]  of time i mean that's why people will say well you can't get that meant that much the mini micrograms
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.360]  of iodine and vegetable glycerin well vegetable glycerin first of all is a lot heavier than alcohol
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:40.520]  so you have to do the calculations different but this way you have an active form of nascent iodine
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:47.320]  which is going to penetrate and be used by all the pump it's safe to say you're the only person
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.600]  of development and it's only available through info wars live the survival shield folks this is a big
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.960]  deal you can pre-order it right now and if horse live comms it's sold out they're making more right
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:03.240]  now we're gonna go to break awesome awesome alex jones here and i want to tell you about a long

[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:28.280]  iodine the real nascent iodine that you've produced for us and developed for informers life.com
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.160]  but i mean it really is survival shield from all the research i've done all the experts i talked to
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.720]  because if you don't have this all the bad stuff goes in the thyroid and then how does that tie into
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.520]  things like bisphenol a and what we're being bombarded with dr. group well bisphenol a is a
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.800]  thyroid disruptor it's an endocrine disruptor and i mean when you look at all first of all all the
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:54.920]  cells in the body require iodine but the endocrine the thyroid to produce the t3 to produce t4 which
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:04.360]  is just tyrosine plus iodine molecules hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism all due to or can be linked back
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:11.080]  at least 99.9 of the cases to an iodine deficiency and what's happening out there is iodine is a
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:17.000]  major detoxifier i mean we're talking about all these chemicals iodine detoxifies fluoride it
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.160]  detoxifies chlorine bromine it detoxifies mercury it detoxifies lead from the body so if someone is
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.240]  taking a nascent iodine and they start developing symptoms like maybe skin rash or upset stomach or
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:37.480]  something that's a telltale sign that it's working so good it's probably pulling that bromine out
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:42.920]  and is detoxifying your body it's all about detoxification that's why not only will all of
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:48.840]  your organs start functioning better but and your skin your dry skin will go away and you if you have
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:54.200]  problems with your salivary glands in your mouth if your tongue feels too big for your mouth that's
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:00.440]  another indication that you're low on iodine the list goes on and on and on alex i mean it the fact
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:07.640]  is there was studies done with over 5 000 patients and 95 to 96 percent of those people that were
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.160]  tested were deficient in iodine it's something that you're not going to get from the food and
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.400]  it's something that but i mean you didn't i mean bragging said yours was unique but this this this
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:19.240]  is really special because i guess i mean i guess the stuff that tastes horrible that they call
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.520]  nascent iodine is actually good for you it's not bad for you it's just the fact that number one it's
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:30.120]  an alcohol base and number two you know you want to use iodine during pregnancy you want to use
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:36.360]  iodine for children and you don't want to use that with with alcohol i mean alcohol is an addictive
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.400]  substance it's a drug it's probably one of the worst drugs out there where they'll kind of and um
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.600]  you know it's it's like technology hasn't changed in a hundred and something years so what we wanted
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.840]  to do is just bring new technology something that could be absorbed very rapidly something that
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.480]  everybody could take they could get their iodine in a usable form they could give it to their
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:02.840]  children women could take it during pregnancy and oh my gosh if you have iodine around the house
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:09.240]  and your whole family's taking it um you know if we had every single person in the united states
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.680]  are in the world doing that it would drastically reduce probably it would put the pharmaceutical
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:18.680]  industry out of business but they don't want that they want to bankrupt america and the western world
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.600]  with this weaponized medicine program in closing you have frequently asked questions
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.240]  and info wars life dot com on the iodine where people can preorder it from the next batch comes in
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.640]  they get it uh and of course you produce it yourself as well that's way backorder and sold
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.560]  out as well so people go to info wars life dot com and it's the exact same iodine you produce
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.720]  just for us and yourself and we're very thankful that you did partner with us i know you've turned
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.000]  on a lot of other people and i'm very honored dr ribb you've done this with us i know you're
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.640]  very successful with your whole nutraceutical line and and we're just honored to be working with you
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.080]  thanks i appreciate it by the way one more thing is there is no bacteria that's resistant to iodine
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:28:00.040]  no virus resistant to iodine no fungus resistant to iodine no mycoplasm resistant to iodine so
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.120]  we talk about if there's a biological warfare which we know that's being injected through the
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.320]  vaccines and through the air iodine is going to protect people against any type of biological
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.280]  amazing and then on top of it the glycerin in this is non-gmo because we talked to all these
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.520]  companies and it's very hard to get other people that's why we haven't done more of this we can't
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.320]  find anybody that'll really give us a peer product now that's exactly right in fact before all of
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.400]  this before we got it into survival shield one of the things i was doing is trying to find suppliers
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.000]  for not just iodine just everything that i wanted personally and to help other people with non-gmo
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.760]  because all my readers were saying basically how do i find something that's super non-gmo
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.320]  and when i would contact the big three the nutraceutical people they would say yeah you
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.840]  know we kind of try to not use gmo's because some of our consumers think it's bad but we can't guarantee
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.240]  it and i'd say well does this specifically you know the vitamin c contain gmo and they say well
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:57.720]  about 98 percent of corn is gmo so we extract it from the corn so chances are yes but we try to use
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.920]  non-gmo sources so that's unacceptable to me we have to push the ante here and say this is totally
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.760]  certified up one side down the other amazing well guys i know you're going to go shoot some stuff
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.760]  for the news and i know you've got to go soon dr grip get back you know to your operation down in

[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.560]  linda larouche has been called a right winger by the left he's been called a left winger by the
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:39.080]  right he ronald reagan i looked this up when i've heard it over 15 years ago it was true
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.360]  you know called him you know just incredibly smart on geopolitics two cia directors uh
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.280]  listened to what he had to say he would do weekly briefings flying his helicopter to the
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.760]  lanley virginia and landing and having secret briefings with a cia director i mean what they talked
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:58.680]  about was reportedly secret that made george bush senior jealous of him so they set him up
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.800]  and threw him in the huskow as a political prisoner and and whenever i talk about government
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.960]  corruption they go oh that's linda larouche people don't even know who he is you know young
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:12.920]  people sometimes they just think oh that's like a dirty word or something of course that that has
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.880]  failed the systems try to do that i don't necessarily agree with all of the solutions
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.920]  they come up with but you cannot doubt their analysis of geopolitics and how it works
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.560]  is very very accurate and we're always honored to have mr larouche on he's a world war two veteran
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.280]  worked in all sorts of operations back then he's 90 years old and is one of the most interesting
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:37.960]  people i think alive out there i don't mean to get him on and throw a bunch of laurels at him
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.640]  there's one folks know he's very very interesting he's only with us for two segments then we've
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.200]  got a bunch of other international news and second amendment news coming up but i wanted
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:52.840]  to get him on because it was back last year he was on the air and and and folks have pulled
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:57.560]  these clips up and pointed them out and warned of nuclear blackmail domestically warned of currency
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:05.560]  devaluation warned of mega crises if we didn't impeach obama now they have started to devalue
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:12.840]  the u.s credit rating using the debt crisis to bring us into this current situation and really
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:18.760]  blame people concerned about debt with the insolvency of the anglo-american banking establishment
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.760]  that itself is completely uh zombie so i want to get him to talk about geopolitically where we are
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.120]  what's happening with the big banks what just happened with the shutdown where things are going
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:34.520]  and so we're joined by linen larouche thank you so much for coming on with us good to be with you
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.400]  okay sir so go ahead you've got the floor where are we geopolitically what's happening in the
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.440]  banking sector why are big banks saying you're not gonna you know be able to get your money out of
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:51.480]  the country what's happening we're going through an actual if it goes through any further we're
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:58.840]  going through a mass rate of death in the united states as it's going on in europe also similarly
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:09.560]  but this uh what the trend and the policy of this president of brock obama is mass murder there's no
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:17.640]  question about it this is this is hitler kind stuff quantify that sir because you've been
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.040]  predicting exactly what's now happening and then using the crisis they've engineered to
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.560]  bring in total control the gear up of homeland security against the american people mr larouche
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:35.320]  what's happening what's what's happened is that we the our government has been taken over by a secret
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:42.440]  government in which is associated with the president obama and this has gone to one step
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:47.640]  at another agent we just gone through another step which will is actually really mass murder
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:54.680]  mass murder of citizens of the united states that the only term you can call call for it this is of
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:03.880]  course obama's been up to this in his first year in an office and i attacked him on that and as other
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:10.680]  people had exposed him in his health care policies were in the direction of hitler style mass murder
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:18.280]  and that's even more so right now the most recent development by the obama is in the
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:24.840]  direction of genocide frank just plainly a hitler style hitler started on a regularly small place
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:33.400]  small considerations but they began to build up more and more and more and what just happened
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:40.840]  to the president's that actions now he's taken another step deeper for greater rates of mass
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:47.400]  murder of our own citizens that's right for those that don't know imf world bank loans and and and
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.440]  high rates are on record killing tens of millions a year worldwide and now that's expanding into
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.400]  europe people starving riots you name it more and more of that coming here but sir i remember
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:05.080]  six years ago when obama or seven years ago was running and some of the folks over at larouche
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:15.480]  pack dot com and also at the publication going to meetings with obama's health carehead even
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:21.720]  before he was elected exposing the plan for death panels exposing the plan for ration care
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.680]  exposing it was actually a trojan horse not even real socialist health care for people but a fascist
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:33.640]  health care system you were your organization were the first people can go see the videos on
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.720]  your site i was just remembering them to expose how bad it was before the bill was even written or
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.960]  introduced breakdown what was really in the bill and how how your team knew what was in it well
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:51.240]  that's my specialty that's what i do is not just on this subject but other subjects i'm concerned
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:57.640]  with the world economy i was specialist in forecasting in that area and i have a lot of
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.800]  influence in that area naturally how big it is or how big it is personally is not relevant the
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:09.080]  fact is that i'm on the case where other people have not done more and more people realize again
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:16.360]  and again that i'm on the case i could i could expand on that but it's that simple i mean this
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:23.160]  is what i do i'm a forecaster i'm an economist i i do a lot of forecasting and probably one
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:28.040]  of the most successful forecaster in terms of very specific kinds of forecast when did you
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:34.120]  first start to work with the international intelligence and the cia wasn't it in the oss i
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.320]  mean how did you because i find this fascinating for your view on the world 90 years old things you've
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:45.480]  seen how did you get to where you were giving weekly briefings of the cia directors in the 1980s
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:51.080]  and and what did that inside track give you on the different factions in the system well i couldn't
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:41:01.800]  say it goes back to the 1980s uh and the 1970 1971 for example uh i first had made a forecast of
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:11.560]  what was going to happen i made it actually in 1968 and uh this it hit uh i had made the forecast
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:17.400]  everybody else in the forecasting business had said it was not possible what happened in that
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:24.600]  1971 that collapsed and from that point i was challenged by a british representative of the
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:32.840]  british system on on this case and i defeated it in a debate which we had in queens college and this
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:39.880]  thing stuck and from that point on i was a well i'd been a forecaster and so forth earlier but
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:48.200]  this thing established my intent my intention uh as being worldwide and people began to get very
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:53.480]  excited about what i was doing because i was getting attention and but the facts i was giving were
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:59.640]  were the facts so that was well sir you give us the facts now on where we are geopolitically
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:06.840]  financially and what's happening in the markets what's happening with the system blaming the global
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.960]  derivatives debt on people that that are concerned about it i mean they they they're trying to blame
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:18.680]  those of us now that have been concerned for what they've done now this is there's no there's no lack
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:24.680]  of evidence on this thing this is what has happened is the health take the health care policy that's
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.280]  the thing that's right on the table right now obama care and that is murderous it there's a
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:36.200]  question about it it's mass murderous and intentionally so it goes together with obama has
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:42.520]  always been in his while president has been close to the queen of england and the queen of england
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:48.120]  has a standing policy now which has been going on for some time saying that we have to reduce the
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  human population on this planet from seven billion people down to less than one that is hurt about
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:03.320]  policy obama is an exponent of that same policy he's a supporter of that same policy as a matter
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:09.320]  of fact his position as in as president was a result of the british empires support for him
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.440]  the financing of his campaign and so forth so this has been that policy all the way through
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:21.640]  and the point was is reduce the human population if you actually go back earlier it didn't really
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:29.880]  start with obama you go back into the death of you know one of our president who was who was
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:38.520]  actually murdered and so we've had this and from since that time for the middle of the 1960s we've
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:46.040]  been on a course downhill it just starts out rather small but the death of kennedy of john
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:52.360]  of kennedy opened up a new region we got into this war in indochina which is a stupid thing to get
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:58.760]  into which macArthur had warned us against quite rapidly and accurately and this is
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:07.320]  it's gone step by step by step if you look at the economy the us economy in terms of per capita
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:14.520]  terms in terms of all the considerations has been on the descent ever since the beginning
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:21.240]  of the war in indochina and it started really as a result of the kennedy being assassinated
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:28.280]  so from that time on the people of the united states have been getting poorer and poorer and
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:34.680]  poorer sure even before the 1992 rio summit where they called for a post industrial world
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:40.120]  as the global policy and even thanked ted turner and prince phillip and others were
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:44.840]  helping develop the strategy out of the royal commission on population that they had adopted
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.240]  from from 1949 that i first learned about reading your publications and then went to the library
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:56.040]  and indeed was able to find that publication for worldwide eugenics cutting off resources
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:02.920]  in genocide long before the term at gen 21 was coined at rio uh your your writings your researchers
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:11.560]  writings uh again um documented their program to create world government not to create peace
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.760]  but to systematically destroy nation states and cut off resources we're now going under this in the
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:24.840]  west is there any way to reverse it yes there is if you were you right now you will probably notice
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:32.120]  that the u.s population has been increasingly angry the citizenry has been increasingly angry
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.640]  against obama and wants him out of office he manages by certain kinds of support to stay in
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:44.360]  office he should have been expelled a long time ago for what he does but that's just going on we
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:50.680]  are now in a position where with this last legislation that he put through he's actually
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:57.000]  is condemning a great number of our people to death early death by his so-called health care
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.840]  policies and related economic policies which affect health care is insurance policies these
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:08.680]  things are mass murderers this has been going on in a as a direction ever since shortly after
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:13.880]  the kennedy was assassinated and no one can deny it everything they're doing is to shut down small
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:20.200]  businesses small farms small factories shutting down our power plants they are completely engaging
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:26.920]  in warfare against the united states what is the the in-game strategy there mr larouche well
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.280]  the end game set is dead it was the queen's policy the queen of england has had been the
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:37.880]  leader in this policy saying the necessity is to reduce the human population of the planet
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:44.520]  from seven billion people approximately to less than one that's her policy it's what she said
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:50.680]  again and again and again that's the policy of her regime of the monarchy is genocide
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:58.520]  and so that you know hitler is not was not new on this thing exactly but on genocide but the
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:05.880]  queen's policy is in accord with the population policies of all fitler in the early period of
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:11.800]  his regime you were on early in the year i think it was in january people can pull it up and you
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:16.680]  said we're headed towards nuclear war with china and russia starting around syria and since then
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.640]  that's become the headlines but the the obama regime is backed off for now what's happening
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:29.400]  militarily well the policy is russia has played an interesting role in this because it seemed for
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:36.680]  a while that russia was a has been power i don't think it's a great power right now i mean it's
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:45.320]  and it's on hard times it's on regime but its influence has been accepted by other governments
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:51.080]  as well as the russian government itself and its effects like china for example is watching this
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:57.080]  situation and japan is aware of it and so forth so we're aware that this problem exists
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:05.160]  this we are that we are actually now and unless we let me put it this way clearly i think make
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:12.440]  it's clean if we don't throw obama out of office soon and there's every reason to throw him out of
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:20.040]  office preemptively he deserves to be thrown out of office normally for his sake but for the sake
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:26.280]  of our people in the united states if his policies as he's just put the new stage through into into
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:35.240]  operation if that policy is allowed you're going to see hit open hitler style genocide applied
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:41.960]  to a large section of the population who was that considered not fit to be survived not fit to survive
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:48.120]  not fit to live and then meanwhile they're doing everything they thought i'm so i'm
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:54.200]  unfit to live wow and that's what he's done that's what his legislation is right now on his new
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:49:00.360]  health care legislation i know i've read it it's unbelievably hitlerian to say the least it's it's
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:05.080]  malfusing and let me ask you this question um they're doing everything they can to block technological
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:11.240]  development clean technologies they want this neo feudalistic system as you say under the
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.640]  british crown on record they develop the program so it is their program is being followed whether
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:22.360]  they're completely running it or not uh if this goes through and they're able to carry this out uh
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:27.880]  it's terrible but i don't see their plan actually working but i do see it
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:32.840]  causing a giant world war three type scenario as the world finally stands up against the people
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:37.480]  that run america and uh the uk and i just can't believe we're going to allow ourselves to be the
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:42.520]  bad guys in this i see the people standing up and if we don't repudiate obama and impeach him
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:47.160]  and arrest his minions then it will set the precedent to allow them to continue the collision
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:52.680]  course towards world war three well you've got a situation now in which you can fairly say that you
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:59.800]  have the american population the u.s population the citizens are more and more enraged against
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:05.640]  obama and what about now the thing that keeps there are some people including democrats and so
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:11.720]  forth some democrats and uh are guilty of this sort of thing but the what the the significant
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:19.240]  thing is that people in the main except those who benefit from wall street it's only is wall
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:25.560]  street is the only factor in the u.s economy which really keeps obama still in office he
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:32.200]  couldn't have made it otherwise now that it what so what you have across the nation we have an
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:40.920]  explosion of determination and rising tide of determination throw this guy out now i was still
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:48.600]  alive that's the mood out there and it's increasing at a rapid rate well i'm finishing my film obama
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.160]  deception too soon that's basically while making the film the summation i came to he's not just
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.200]  another puppet he cannot be allowed to stay in because in another two years he'll totally wreck
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:03.000]  us anyways but regardless we cannot allow them to commit all these crimes and not get in trouble
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.760]  or the precedent set to where we are a fascist regime and now the banks are moving to keep
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:14.040]  people's money i mean this is getting scary well that's what has been the intention all the way
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:21.480]  through what has happened recently as popular opinion in particular in this nation has recognized
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:26.120]  that and it's recognized that not only because of what is happening inside the united states
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:32.280]  but they're recognizing what has been happening in europe the situation in europe is much more advanced
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:39.240]  in terms of pro genocide trends than in the united states yet but we're on we're going very rapidly
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:45.800]  that direction and obama is the specific driver of that crime i mean this this is the guy waiting
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:51.800]  for his norbert trial that's what that's that's what this president is is he i mean i understand
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:58.040]  he's a figurehead of this whole takeover and a very enjoys it in this part of it but but uh and
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.440]  i understand it's important to bring him down to bring the whole corrupt cabal down but specifically
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:07.880]  a lot of top people i know they say obama is particularly evil and that he is actually enjoys
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:12.920]  all this and that uh he is actually calling a lot of shots is that accurate or inaccurate
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:19.160]  sure it's accurate that's you could put i you could express it in other ways but from a standpoint
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:28.040]  of popular opinion in so far as popular opinion has that view the that the view is valid other key points
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:37.480]  but i would say that i'm concerned about getting back our laws because what we have now
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:47.080]  is not is not good it is not something we should tolerate we have to throw this government out of
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:57.880]  office now impeachment time buzz and all is due now and that's an understatement i mean i cannot
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:03.400]  believe they're openly running torture ships off the coast i can't believe they're openly training
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:09.800]  in army manuals i'm sure you've seen this this is official news they actually badmouth
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:15.960]  the founding fathers and say they were bad people and they're training for war against anybody that
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:22.680]  is pro-national system pro-liberty pro-freedom it's not even about left or right i mean it's cartoonish
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:28.680]  how officially authoritarian obama is i can't even believe that they're this out of control
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:36.040]  they are out of control but they but which are talking about a something worse than hitler
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.360]  hitler was you know reached very terrible levels of abuses but he didn't have 10 000 nuclear weapons
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:50.600]  this is worse how is it worse what what you're headed for in potentially which is the only
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:57.320]  factor of restraint in terms of the international situation is the fact that this we are on we
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:05.480]  were on the edge in the syrian operation we were on the edge of thermonuclear war globally
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:13.000]  just take the situation of russia the russia's role in respect to syria then you had the various
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:19.240]  kinds of operations back and forth on this sort of thing and you told you look at the history of
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:27.960]  obama with the crimes he's committed in office publicly and gotten by women he was understand
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:37.160]  two things first of all that is a criminal really by any standard of decency and he's a great liar
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:44.200]  are they also madmen because as you just stated even general dimsey who's known as a pro war guy
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.600]  most of the time it's why they put him in he went at midnight and told obama the military is not
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:53.000]  going to stand with you and i'm not from military coups but if it's stopping like hitler like you
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.880]  know operation valkyrie at least non-violently politically saying no i have confirmed it's
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:03.160]  even come out in the news that the military basically blocked that operation a few weeks
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:09.640]  ago saying this will probably lead to nuclear war so that shows me how insane the anglo american
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:17.560]  leaders are absolutely that's that's understood internationally that's where we are this man
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:26.920]  must be thrown out of office the time for impeachment now summary impeachment now sir what about the
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.520]  other release because i know you have your finger on the pulse i mean i mean they're not all this
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:35.800]  insane are they i mean what why why have they gotten so reckless i mean don't they know about
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:42.600]  napoleon and hitler and people i mean this i think that was people who are wall street oriented
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:52.040]  generally i think are not exactly civilized to put the kind of structure on it and they
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:56:01.080]  are they're worried about my money you get this you get the whole wall street crowd my money and
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:06.920]  you have all the people that go along with it and you've got look you've got republicans you know
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:13.720]  going along with this their way you have members of the democratic party leaders in the congress
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:20.840]  who are pushing the same thing so we're coming to a collision course and the thing the thing to
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:26.360]  worry about is are we going to have a bloody show inside the united states over this issue this crimes
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:31.160]  are being committed under the leadership of obama or are we going to stop it are we going to
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:38.120]  intervene and throw this guy out of office now if we throw him out of office we will probably also
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:44.200]  do some things to some of these swindlers on wall street who have ruined and are murdering people
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:52.200]  virtually with their policies we but we have to get back to our constitution this government
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:58.120]  is no longer operating on the basis of the federal constitution but directly opposite to it the time
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:04.680]  for impeachment is now that's right it's working for a foreign combine and this is how max keiser
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.240]  who worked at the highest levels even with soros his son in wall street he described him as suicide
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:14.920]  bankers he said they would blow the world up if it if they got all the money even though they'd be
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:23.000]  dead it is an attitude of just craven greed but on top of it it's worse because they're not even
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.760]  thinking about the larger ramifications it's just a pure mindlessness and it's not free market
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:35.800]  it's backed up with taxpayer money so they've been emboldened they are insane well this is sort of
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:43.000]  is a saudi-british operation which is doing on this is not you know actually 9 11 was a product
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.120]  of a saudi-british operation and they've got these special gags on people who know the facts
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:57.560]  about 9 11 but 9 11 was a part of this process and it was a british saudi operation
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.840]  and the fact that's the fact but the british government the saw these they're not going to
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.560]  survive world war three but that is not an important important question i think
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:14.920]  the that's because the the saudi's are also can be dispensed with under certain conditions
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:20.440]  no the question is this has we have to bring we have to deal with the economic question the

[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:39.800]  folks living with russians aren't cast russpack.com and i gotta tell you i'd probably read 100 history
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.280]  books or more by the time i was 12 years old but the more you know the more you don't know and
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:49.720]  then by the time i was probably 16 17 and first saw their quarterly intelligence review it was
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:53.480]  reading and i knew so much history i was like oh i've read this i've read that it was like
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.160]  most of it i knew was accurate the parts i didn't know was accurate because i just didn't have
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.320]  that historical knowledge yet it was gray area for me because i hadn't discovered it separately
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:09.080]  for myself yet but the way they put it all together and and and and uh what they lay out is is is
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:13.800]  really helped me understand how the world works and the funny part is from the john burt society
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.480]  and all those people can claim is connected to whatever they told a lot of the truth of what
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:21.320]  was going on but i think when you get to the end of the day there isn't really a left or right
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:27.720]  there's are you pro humanity pro civilization or are you pro war economy genocide death control
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.720]  and we got four minutes left uh lindl and rush thank you for your time make the point you were
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.480]  saying about what we need to do solutions now with the economy ideas how we stop this madness
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:41.720]  uh first of all impeach this president that's the first thing you have to do
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:48.440]  and the ability the grounds for doing so more than richly exists all right then we have to
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:54.440]  think about how are we going to take the economy for example the european economy is collapsing
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:02.600]  the transatlantic region is a disaster area for terms of economy my view is i'll just summarize
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:08.520]  it this way there's one thing we could do and that is if we could start a program of recovery
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:15.080]  which could be started now with with getting this guy out we would then think of taking our
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:22.920]  middle of the united states that mississippi west area we've lost our food supply our food supply
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:29.400]  has been destroyed by this operation by these kinds of operations so we've got it again we've
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:34.680]  got to get the food supply in there we've got to rebuild some of our economy we don't have the
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:41.640]  ability to maintain our own population that's what's happened now then what do we do well we
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:52.360]  go across the uh from the asian region into asia we cross there we restart we start again
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:59.560]  thermonuclear fusion as a driver program that is absolutely indispensable for the survival
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:05.240]  of civilization on the planet as a whole it will take time to get there make about 10 years before
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:12.200]  we could act but giant peaceful manhattan projects uh advanced technologies cleaner energies uh r and
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:19.320]  d the opposite of what the neo feudalists want yes well there are very specific things that the
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:25.720]  thermonuclear fusion which has been suppressed we have a miniature version of thermonuclear fusion
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:33.160]  which is now what the actual what is required as thermonuclear fusion to ensure the survival
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:40.200]  of mankind on this planet is something we've got to get but we have to start the program now
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:45.880]  get the program moving a recovery program immediately throw obama out agree to go ahead
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:50.600]  with the recovery program immediately get our food supply which has been destroyed
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.280]  in the middle of the united states and if we just back off from world war three the whole
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.480]  world won't give a sigh of relief it'll create confidence and investment and and true globalism
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:06.440]  people working together absolutely it is possible it it's it's something i'm very much
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:11.240]  concerned about my associates for example involved with this we're concerned with this program
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:18.520]  thermonuclear fusion is an absolute requirement for the diversification of the human species

[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:37.560]  well they ignored it yesterday but when the mighty old mighty when it comes to the news
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:45.960]  drudgereport.com made it their front top mega link today at drudgereport.com they had to respond
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:54.360]  and chase bank claims concern about capital controls is an overreaction financial analyst
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:09:01.640]  salente calls new draconian measures unprecedented yeah even from the perspective of your like
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.800]  bank of america two years ago when they tried to put five dollar fees to use your own debit card
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.920]  because see money's so worthless now they've devalued it so much it's only good to get us to
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:15.640]  you know kill ourselves for them for peanuts and they use taxes to control the economy but
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.960]  above the real economy that's only like 14 15 trillion dollars a year here there is the
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:28.520]  100 trillion 200 trillion dollar north american derivatives market every year and globally 1.5
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:34.200]  quadrillion total just in overhang they don't need the hundred thousand dollars you've been
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:39.960]  saving for 10 years for retirement they don't need that anymore and so they're saying you're
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.240]  going to pay us basically to have money in our bank account you're going to pay us to use it
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:48.440]  but just from the angle of them saying okay all our business account holders you can't
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:53.160]  wire money out of the country you can only wire it in and if you have cash transactions period
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:59.640]  that's not 50 000 at a time in a month or 50 000 over a month it's most even small restaurants
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:06.360]  i mean i know people that own like taco shacks and stuff that make like 100 000 dollars a month
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.680]  total and gross cash because people tend to use you know five dollar bill for a couple tacos or
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:17.320]  whatever their profit might be 60 cents a taco they're barely making it working you know 12 hours
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:22.440]  a day running a taco shack one of my friends you know does okay doing it but he puts 100 000 a
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:29.560]  month in the in the deal no you're not going to be at chase anymore and it's worse than that folks
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.200]  because other big banks and i'm working on this right now it already be a big national story but
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.720]  i've been so busy i haven't i've nailed it down but i got to get the name straight i got to get
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:44.840]  the authorization i got a big breaking tsa story that i forgot to pull the trigger on this morning
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:50.520]  it's so big i should have pulled the trigger on this morning i dropped the ball my problem is i
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:55.560]  got so many big stories coming in i can't even keep track of it right now like i'll talk to don
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.600]  salazar during the break he's been waiting he's up here late last night working on he's been
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:03.000]  waiting all day for me to come approve it and i need to proofread it not not proofread it um
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:07.960]  he's a great rider doesn't make typos i mean i've got to check because it's a secret source
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.200]  i just want to look at it because it's a it's a clandestine type deal so just have him print me
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:16.760]  that actually since it's not online yet and i'll read it and then approve it it should be ready
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:23.560]  by the bottom of the hour big tsa news i mean i'll just go ahead and tell you what i can't believe
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:29.480]  this is so insane the and what's dangerous is we are becoming like a major source because the
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:34.920]  mainstream media isn't real media they won't report on anything they won't ask real questions anymore
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:40.680]  so people are coming to us we're gonna go to our guest here it's just that chase is now responding
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.560]  and uh and saying it's no big deal that we're doing this well just on the basis of the war on
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:51.640]  cash and the war on business owners including businesses i know i know people they're turning
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.880]  over tens of millions a year that chase is saying you're not going to be able to do wires you're not
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:02.360]  going to be able to uh you know be able to have cash with us and we're going to charge you even
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:07.000]  when you try to get a fancy international account with us still there's going to be restrictions
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.880]  and then now it's coming in that other big banks people have called other big banks and they said
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:17.080]  well we weren't going to announce this yet but the word is it's coming by december chase is just
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:23.560]  doing it earlier testing the whole thing on the 17th of november and so this just absolutely
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:28.520]  illustrates very serious situation i haven't gotten to obama's bombshell statements from earlier
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.240]  we'll do this after we talk to some guests that are coming up obama came out this morning while i
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:39.080]  was live in the first hour and said talk radio don't listen to them don't listen to alternative press
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:46.920]  obama says ignore bloggers activists and radio talk show hosts demanding fiscal sanity unbelievable
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:54.600]  it's a war on the real press that's a curtain memo article again just absolutely insane but update
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:59.800]  chase bank limits withdrawals bans international wire transfers drudge has the headline now it's
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:04.360]  moved to the right hand side chase fees on cash limits withdrawals on some accounts
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:09.960]  u.s. watchings for signs of israeli strike on iran i mean this is just the insanity we're dealing
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:14.920]  with we'll add that update to the article that's on drudge uh where chase is now responding i want
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:22.200]  to shift gears now to uh murdoch pisgadi uh don't comply dot com which is a great alternative
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:30.120]  liberty minded uh news site and he's the guy taking on the volunteer effort to honcho the thousands of
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:35.800]  patriots that are set to show up uh down in san antonio you know i don't do a lot of speeches

[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.920]  unless you're concealed carry and it's got to be concealed we're trying to get that law repealed
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:22.440]  because that's unconstitutional but they've been arresting people like master sergeant cj grisham
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:26.760]  is going to be popping in he's in court right now with the criminal charges of legally carrying his

[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.960]  who called the police chiefs bluff and said look it's illegal for you to say people can't have guns
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:07.720]  plus the alamo state property i say i'm over that they can be on the alamo property so the police
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:13.960]  chief backed off he was in the paper yesterday and he said oh we're we're uh not enemies with the gun

[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:40.280]  bunch of people and beat them so they said you're kernel going down there and the mexican government
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:47.640]  had a bunch of uh uh anglo mercenary enforcers too that travis and others helped take out and
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:51.240]  the media won't tell you hispanics were about a third of the revolution against santa anna

[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:33.720]  but the food folks we got that breaking T.S. saying that little bird told us about in the federal
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:41.400]  record it will be breaking on air coming up in the next segment this is breaking news that is
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:48.600]  bombshell you think our J.P. Morgan Chase stories bombshell this is as bombshell I cannot believe
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:54.520]  we are the source for all this stuff let's go to Terry Holcomb a great guy who's been in studio
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:59.560]  several times he heads up texascarry.org and we're going to try to get CJ Grisham on who's
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:04.520]  in court right now for carrying a rifle loaded in a rural area with his son the police just said
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:08.680]  we don't care and arrested him on video that's got like nine million views or something on youtube
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:13.400]  so he's a real hero he's an active duty master sergeant we ought to get him on some time to
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:17.960]  tell war stories man that guy has seen so much combat is so highly decorated I would really
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:23.080]  like just not wanting to hear about blood and guts but the how interesting it is 19 years
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:26.280]  in the U.S. Army because I've got family that's been the army that long
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:30.520]  and are similar rank to him but in but in special operations they won't tell me anything they say
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:35.160]  it's a side issue they say it's national security but I bet a regular army sergeant could tell us
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:41.000]  some stories going to Terry Holcomb texascarry.org buddy this is a big deal I'm really excited
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:46.520]  about the fact that the police did the right thing and basically told the police chief that
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:50.040]  they weren't going to be part of arresting people for legal stuff and that now the police chief
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.680]  says that quote we're all on the same side that's a victory that's what you guys are trying to do
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:00.120]  is just normalize what is already our god given right what's already law. Thank you for having me
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:06.520]  Alex and that's true this is a small victory and very big battle while we're all excited about
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:11.720]  the progress we're making in San Antonio I'm not real convinced that I agree with you know
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:17.560]  Chief McMannus that this isn't as he quoted us versus them because you know the city ordinances
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:25.000]  in in San Antonio are still in place they are 100 unlawful they go above and beyond the local
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.520]  government code which we know is is against law and they haven't repealed those yet so I'm not I mean
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.680]  though this is a great victory and we're excited about it and they basically have no choice but
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:41.080]  to follow the law Saturday we still have a lot of work to do. Exactly but I'm saying like Gandhi
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:44.760]  marching to the sea it was illegal for people to collect salt they had to buy it from the British
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:49.640]  government at exorbitant prices when hundreds of thousands marched with him starting only as a few
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:55.160]  and gathered the salt that was the beginning of the end just pointing out that we called your bluff
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:59.560]  there is a second amendment and making them back off thousands need to show up tomorrow
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:06.040]  this is the spirit this is the idea that will turn the tide and we have people coming from all over
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:12.120]  the country not just here in Texas we're getting support nationally and it is a very exciting thing
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:17.480]  and we're all waiting to hear on CJ's verdict everybody's sitting on the edge of their seats
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:21.240]  waiting for the jury to come out so we're excited about that as well and then we've got to take the
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:26.920]  battle to Austin we're going to have to go to the Capitol and deal with the lawless DPS up there
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:32.440]  and we're going to have to do this all over again. Well you know I was just thinking about
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:38.280]  CJ Grisham and how much I admire him of all the battlefields he's been on supposedly for this
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:44.680]  country in some good war some bad he's now for America facing jail time for doing something
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:48.840]  legally and lawfully with his son for emerit badge in middle of nowhere marches through the
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:56.520]  countryside he's standing up in America for our rights he's a true hero he is and and CJ you know
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:04.040]  this is so fitting to have CJ at the Alamo he is the spirit of the Alamo and he is he is a true
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:10.120]  modern day Texas patriot that is putting it all on the line too many people you know sit out there
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:15.640]  and complain and and and want to do things on the computer and CJ is out there fighting the fight
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:22.520]  putting everything at risk putting it all on the line for everyone's freedom and I have the utmost
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:28.600]  admiration and respect for CJ and he's facing some serious yell time do you tell us the details of
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:34.120]  that yeah I mean well I mean they charged him and they changed the charge so many times it's
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:41.000]  hard to keep up with it but it's either rudely displaying a weapon or it was a resisting arrest
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:45.400]  at the beginning but they knew that was never going to fly so they changed it and then they
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:52.760]  changed it again and so I'm pretty sure that the in charge was a rudely displaying or resisting
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:58.120]  arrest or search or something like that but more confident he's going to get off for confident that
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:03.480]  the jury's going to acquit him but this is just evidence of things that are going on all over
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:08.920]  the state this isn't isolated this happened in McAllen this happened in temple this is happening
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:15.720]  in San Antonio listen we've got a ranch we've had since like 1829 when this was mexico and they
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:21.160]  now send game wardens in off season to demand to look at our guns and if you walk down the street

[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:32.920]  updates uh from terry holcomb uh on that as well because he's going through uh through all of this
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:37.960]  as well and has been in studio with us breaking down what's going on with his group uh but internal
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:44.680]  tsa documents body scanners pat downs not for terrorist and these are internal tsa documents
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:50.920]  that have come out in court and then been posted to the federal court websites no one picked this up
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:56.520]  we picked it up and tsa's administrative record admits invasive security procedures are ineffective
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:01.320]  and security theater we have the quotes this is them admitting all of it is not for terrorist
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:07.720]  but as a federal power grab bombshell info wars dot com it's going up on prism planet dot com
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:12.440]  right now as well adan shallas are we'll have we'll get some experts on about this in the next few
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.800]  days as well and give you more on that in just a moment uh but a devastating blow if we force this
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:23.880]  news out in the open uh going back to terry holcomb terry uh other points you'd like to make about the
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:27.560]  arrest that were made in austin where all that's going in the civil rights movement of the second
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:32.280]  amendment and of course we had two veterans you know scott liberty and gary hayes and then myself
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:39.080]  which were arrested at the capital for uh caring open caring um pre-1899 replica black powder revolvers
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:44.120]  um all of us uh they haven't even charged gary hayes yet so they're playing hide and seek with him
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:48.280]  and then with myself and scott liberty we both showed up to pre-trial hearings two
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:52.520]  fridays ago and the da's haven't even filed the case that so they're playing captain mouse with us
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:57.560]  as well and so we're rescheduled and we're going to continue to fight that battle and
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:02.760]  we're going to win we have the attorney general's office working on these things as well they're
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:07.000]  going to be uh getting some opinions out on some of these disorderly conduct codes that
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:13.720]  law enforcement is unlawfully using and by the way the the the the administrators in austin
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.040]  they're not all bad but a lot of them are hardcore democratic party operatives that's on record i've
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:22.040]  read about them doing stuff like they'll never let you know and then they'll wait a year or two to
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:28.040]  the statute limitations they'll file it the week before and send it to a wrong address on purpose
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:33.080]  so that you can't respond and then claim that you know you're absconding i mean they'll try all
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:37.880]  sorts of dirty tricks and we're all on top of that we're keeping a very close eye on it our
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:42.200]  legal defense teams are keeping a very close eye on that they're not going to get over on us um
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:46.440]  we're more than prepared to them um we're not going to go away we're not going to back down
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:50.440]  we're not going to shut up and we're not going to sit down um we're coming at them with everything
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:56.040]  that we have and and if if they want to continue these unlawful acts we'll be more than happy to
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:04.200]  oblige them in the battle um you know again i want to thank cj agression i want to uh thank
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:10.840]  all the patriots that are out there fighting this fight in uh san antonio october the 19th
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:15.560]  this saturday at 10 a.m you know draw line in the stand event you know we're going to be there
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:20.920]  lawfully exercising our rights and uh we're going to show up by well over a thousand people are going
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:27.400]  to be there and this is a movement that came out of cj's arrest and it's a movement that's going to
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:33.720]  continue until we win um the legislators need to pay attention uh because we're not going to stop
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:37.720]  and we're not going to give up and by the way for folks that don't know i've studied this
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:43.880]  historically this is in hype this is lexington concord level this is alamo level this is the
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:48.600]  stuff that led up to things like that if we don't exercise this openly this is what i'm going to
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:52.680]  speak briefly about at the event i mainly there film people because i want to put in obama deception
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:59.880]  too if if we don't peacefully exercise these rights now these scoundrels are going to start a civil
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:05.640]  war and come after us we have a responsibility to try to peacefully exercise these rights before
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:11.560]  they actually try to drop the hammer on everybody and for most pro-gun people they are just pro-gun
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:16.840]  and like guns they're not actual second amendment people and they're not doing their duty that was
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:22.920]  paid for with literally millions of gallons of blood not just here but all over the world
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:26.920]  by people that have died so they can be armed and not be slaves and defend themselves and
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:31.880]  this is so historic that the war against the british crown had never been beaten started
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:37.400]  when they came to take the guns and the colonies uh people were happy under the mexican government
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:44.120]  until the dictator santa anna took over uh and was trying to enslave everybody and had a bunch of
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:49.880]  uh mainly uh criminals out of uh the united states that he hired to go around robbing people
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.920]  and uh tax collecting that was actually his main force was actually out of other states not even
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:39:00.360]  out of mexico and they have so distorted history on that and they came to take the guns and at
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:04.520]  first it was don't have your guns in town don't be public in fact that's what they first said
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:08.600]  you can have them at your ranch house and then it was now you can't have guns period well people
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:13.320]  needed those just to live and defend themselves and hunt it's the same story that we think of
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:17.720]  william travis and all them as these legendary characters and they were just because they wouldn't
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:24.760]  back down and we think of sam houston and george washington we we are their descendants spiritually
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:32.440]  if not even physically we must now stand so people tell me i'm a hero and i get upset by it i think
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:36.680]  you are a hero once you've been arrested and are going through this you yourself but the point is
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:41.480]  i'm not a hero i'm trying to stop total takeover i'm actually covering my butt i'm actually trying
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:45.880]  to preserve my future and my children i'm not doing this because i'm some hero i don't particularly
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:50.360]  like having to do it but i understand if i don't it's a hundred times worse for my children
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:55.880]  and so i'm a hundred percent just like travis was and we've got to decide we are william travis
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:01.400]  we are william barrett travis all of us we're taking action and i want to see 10 000 people down
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:07.080]  there not a thousand this saturday you cannot watch the ut football game austinites even if you

[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:49.880]  smoke marijuana and it's just insane and i'm just thinking about all the attacks we put up with
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:57.160]  and it's the same thing with the guns you haven't committed any crime you're legally carrying a
[02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:03.560]  rifle in texas in the case of cj gresham in the middle of nowhere to get a merit badge
