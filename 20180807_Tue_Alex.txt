[00:00.000 --> 00:08.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:08.280 --> 00:10.720]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday Global Broadcast.
[00:10.720 --> 00:15.780]  You're going to get my exclusive breakdown with huge new developments coming up at the
[00:15.780 --> 00:17.440]  bottom of the hour.
[00:17.440 --> 00:23.280]  My official response to the big tech giant war, not just on my free speech, but your
[00:23.280 --> 00:24.520]  free speech.
[00:24.520 --> 00:29.560]  We have scores of top Democrats openly calling for Fox News to now be de-platformed and all
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.480]  conservative news information to be removed off of Facebook, and a new secret Democrat
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.120]  plan has been leaked to Reason Magazine, planning to do it before the election.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.120]  We knew it was coming.
[00:40.120 --> 00:41.600]  I'm the test case.
[00:41.600 --> 00:42.600]  Everyone's been warned.
[00:42.600 --> 00:46.120]  But first, here's part of an emergency report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:46.120 --> 00:50.000]  We'll come back with another report where I boil down the China connection, and then
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.120]  I'm going to give you live on air my analysis.
[00:53.120 --> 00:54.120]  Stay with us.
[00:54.120 --> 00:59.960]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube all completely banned info wars within 12 hours
[00:59.960 --> 01:05.320]  of each other, clearly suggesting big tech collusion and proving their terms of service
[01:05.320 --> 01:06.880]  are all bull.
[01:06.880 --> 01:08.760]  This is political censorship.
[01:08.760 --> 01:10.120]  This is the purge.
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.320]  Facebook cited language used to describe Muslims, transgenders, and immigrants, so provided
[01:15.320 --> 01:21.560]  zero specific examples as to what we said that was verboten, and neither did Apple, Spotify,
[01:21.560 --> 01:22.560]  or YouTube.
[01:22.560 --> 01:25.240]  I'm afraid that companies they could ban who they like.
[01:25.240 --> 01:30.120]  No, Facebook, Twitter, and Google have monopolized free speech online.
[01:30.120 --> 01:31.280]  They're a monopoly.
[01:31.280 --> 01:34.520]  They're also working directly with institutions of media.
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.160]  CNN whines all day about Trump threatening press freedoms, while simultaneously lobbying
[01:40.160 --> 01:43.280]  to have its competitors shut down by big tech.
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.920]  America's free press supports censorship.
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.880]  Big tech is colluding with leftist lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
[01:50.880 --> 01:55.520]  Democratic congressman Ted Deutsch pressured YouTube and Facebook to ban info wars just
[01:55.520 --> 01:56.680]  a few weeks ago.
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.040]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[02:02.040 --> 02:05.640]  Typically a channel gets three strikes, and then we terminate the channel.
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.880]  Democratic congressman Mike Quigley pressured Twitter to remove my tweets from trending
[02:09.880 --> 02:10.880]  hashtags.
[02:10.880 --> 02:11.880]  And they did.
[02:11.880 --> 02:18.440]  On Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYC Terrace Attack, which is quote trending,
[02:18.440 --> 02:25.000]  work with a red button saying quote live, the top tweet links to an info wars story
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.200]  with the headline, and mom, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror.
[02:30.200 --> 02:35.880]  He was too busy bashing Trump, but you saw this USA today at lunch.
[02:35.880 --> 02:36.880]  I did.
[02:36.880 --> 02:37.880]  Yeah.
[02:37.880 --> 02:40.560]  And I also saw the system system corrected as WikiLeaks tweeted.
[02:40.560 --> 02:43.000]  This is a global antitrust problem.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.480]  This is cultural imperialism.
[02:45.480 --> 02:48.400]  So no, it's not just a private company.
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.960]  This is a handful of far left hysterics in San Francisco, framing legitimate criticism
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.320]  of mass immigration and Islam as hate speech.
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.960]  This is language policing.
[02:58.960 --> 03:00.800]  This is political censorship.
[03:00.800 --> 03:04.760]  They know info wars played a key role in electing Trump.
[03:04.760 --> 03:06.680]  This is punishment for that.
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.200]  And this all happened three months before the midterms.
[03:10.200 --> 03:12.000]  This is election meddling.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.720]  This is election rigging.
[03:13.720 --> 03:15.160]  This was all coordinated.
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.120]  They all banned info wars within the same 12 hour period.
[03:19.120 --> 03:21.120]  That's big tech collusion.
[03:21.120 --> 03:23.360]  That's a total abuse of power.
[03:23.360 --> 03:26.400]  Now look at Apple's excuse for banning info wars.
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.760]  According to Apple, if you don't respect people with different opinions, you will be banned.
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.920]  Does this mean it's necessary to respect people who advocate child marriage and honor
[03:35.920 --> 03:38.360]  killings just to have a platform?
[03:38.360 --> 03:40.320]  Because I don't respect those people.
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.400]  I don't respect people like Louis Farrakhan, who praised Adolf Hitler as, quote, a very
[03:45.400 --> 03:46.400]  great man.
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.680]  Presumably Apple does, because his app and his broadcasts are still available on their
[03:51.680 --> 03:52.680]  platform.
[03:52.680 --> 03:57.000]  I don't respect Antifa, a group that violently attacks innocent people.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.120]  But Antifa's pages, podcasts and videos are rarely, if ever, banned on any platform.
[04:03.120 --> 04:04.840]  Now look at Wikipedia.
[04:04.840 --> 04:11.080]  Editors removing Sarah Jung's racist tweet controversy from her Wikipedia page, literally
[04:11.080 --> 04:17.240]  throwing the most important event in her career down an Orwellian memory hole, literally attempting
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.320]  to change reality and hide history.
[04:20.320 --> 04:21.320]  That's what this is all about.
[04:21.320 --> 04:27.440]  And all you liberals, orgasmically celebrating big business censoring independent media,
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.440]  you're not liberals, you're authoritarians.
[04:30.440 --> 04:32.880]  Whether you hate Alex Jones is beside the point.
[04:32.880 --> 04:37.760]  Do you love the fact that a handful of tech monopolists have the power to simultaneously
[04:37.760 --> 04:39.520]  purge him from the Internet?
[04:39.520 --> 04:40.640]  Forget the Supreme Court.
[04:40.640 --> 04:45.640]  Susan Wojcicki and Mark Zuckerberg are now de facto defining the parameters.
[04:45.640 --> 04:46.640]  All right, folks.
[04:46.640 --> 04:48.360]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[04:48.360 --> 04:55.560]  That full report is called The Purge, and it's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[04:55.560 --> 04:56.920]  Battle the globalist censors.
[04:56.920 --> 05:00.720]  Spread the live links from infowars.com forward slash news.
[05:00.720 --> 05:03.080]  Filling your body is hard work.
[05:03.080 --> 05:07.840]  That's why we've introduced the infowars life daily digestive pack to help you fuel it
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.840]  right.
[05:08.840 --> 05:13.960]  Combine fluorolife everyday maintenance and carnivore to help you fuel your gut and body
[05:13.960 --> 05:17.240]  and take advantage of the powerful nutrients you receive.
[05:17.240 --> 05:20.120]  There's no better way to power your body.
[05:20.120 --> 05:25.120]  Fluorolife is a powerful probiotic supplement with 20 of the most potent clinically studied
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.840]  probiotic strains.
[05:26.840 --> 05:32.040]  Being paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients.

[05:42.600 --> 05:45.520]  stress, age, and outside toxins.

[05:50.280 --> 05:51.280]  your body.
[05:51.280 --> 05:55.440]  Don't miss out on the chance to fuel your body and support recovery.
[05:55.440 --> 06:12.160]  Try the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[06:12.160 --> 06:16.800]  It's Tuesday, the 7th day of August 2018.
[06:16.800 --> 06:21.400]  Coming up in the next segment, go to DrudgeReport.com.
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.920]  We are tomorrow's news today.
[06:22.920 --> 06:29.720]  We had yesterday the image of the Chinese Apple computer logo merged and had it on the
[06:29.720 --> 06:32.960]  front page of the Drudge Report saying, that's going to be the big news.
[06:32.960 --> 06:35.600]  The China is running the censorship here in America.
[06:35.600 --> 06:41.080]  Well, look what happens if you go to DrudgeReport.com right now.
[06:41.080 --> 06:44.200]  We'll push that up on screen.
[06:44.200 --> 06:46.200]  Boom!
[06:46.200 --> 06:54.240]  Now, if you continue and expand on that, what did we have up yesterday?
[06:54.240 --> 07:00.040]  We said Drudge is dead on target with Apple quarterbacking the censorship operations,
[07:00.040 --> 07:04.440]  but we pointed out who's really in control of Apple because Apple officially became state
[07:04.440 --> 07:09.360]  run by China and admitted it to Reuters four months ago.
[07:09.360 --> 07:12.240]  Let's go back to DrudgeReport.com.
[07:12.240 --> 07:21.320]  The news I have is so big and so confirmed that I'm not even ready to go on air right
[07:21.320 --> 07:22.320]  now.
[07:22.320 --> 07:28.240]  So I'm going to go to a special report I shot yesterday, boiling down the China Internet
[07:28.240 --> 07:29.240]  Takeover connection.
[07:29.240 --> 07:33.920]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to try to come back then and be ready.
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.120]  And it's not for lack of research.
[07:35.120 --> 07:36.880]  I have too much.
[07:36.880 --> 07:39.560]  We have exactly what they're doing.
[07:39.560 --> 07:40.760]  We knew it.
[07:40.760 --> 07:41.800]  We predicted it all.
[07:41.800 --> 07:46.880]  We had the sources, but here's the deal, and I'm getting lightning bolt chills right now.
[07:46.880 --> 07:53.120]  That's why the enemy gets chills because if people realize what we're saying right now,
[07:53.120 --> 07:55.440]  it's done for the New World War.
[07:55.440 --> 07:58.280]  It's done for the Communist Chinese and this whole system.
[07:58.280 --> 08:04.600]  So we are in the zeitgeist right now, and I want to thank DrudgeReport.com and others
[08:04.600 --> 08:06.360]  for being at the heart and defending the First Amendment.
[08:06.360 --> 08:10.400]  Now let me just show you these articles.
[08:10.400 --> 08:12.400]  You notice I said this in a special report yesterday.
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.160]  You're about to see, and now it's happened, but it had already happened.
[08:19.160 --> 08:23.600]  Dem senator demands more citizenship of conservative media, demands all conservatives
[08:23.600 --> 08:31.320]  be taken off of the Internet, says that info wars is the stinking tip of the iceberg, and
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.400]  they call for Fox News, talk radio, everything to be removed.
[08:35.400 --> 08:37.400]  Go read it.
[08:37.400 --> 08:43.000]  Now that's him in Twitter.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.040]  Look at this.
[08:45.040 --> 08:49.720]  Now that Facebook, YouTube, and Apple have come for Alex Jones, now they will start coming
[08:49.720 --> 08:50.720]  out from the rest of us.
[08:50.720 --> 08:51.720]  Michael Snyder.
[08:51.720 --> 08:52.720]  Absolutely right.
[08:52.720 --> 08:53.720]  Here it is.
[08:53.720 --> 08:56.920]  Midterm meddling, Facebook blocks Republican candidate ad.
[08:56.920 --> 08:58.080]  It's happening every two minutes.
[08:58.080 --> 09:01.680]  I see a new article like this, and here's the key from reason.
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.680]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans secretly reason got a copy for government takeover
[09:06.680 --> 09:12.880]  of the Internet by them, calling everyone Russian agents.
[09:12.880 --> 09:18.520]  They have a Pulitzer prize winning New York Times reporter that basically has a bunch
[09:18.520 --> 09:20.160]  of reporters after me in Austin.
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.080]  And when I talked to one, she looked right at me and she said, tell me how you work for
[09:24.080 --> 09:25.800]  RT and how much money they pay you.
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.720]  And I said, I've never worked for RT.
[09:27.720 --> 09:28.960]  I've never been paid any money by them.
[09:28.960 --> 09:33.680]  I haven't been on this thing in like four years, I guess, except for Max Kaiser a few
[09:33.680 --> 09:38.200]  times and she looked at me and she went, uh-huh, oh yeah, right, right.
[09:38.200 --> 09:42.000]  These people are out of their minds.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  The crackdown continues.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.080]  Twitter suspends everyone running the Ron Paul Institute because you got to shut that
[09:47.080 --> 09:48.800]  evil guy down.
[09:48.800 --> 09:50.400]  Tommy Robinson banned from Instagram.
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.960]  Oh, by the way, that's the big news here.
[09:52.960 --> 10:00.360]  It's why my head's spinning right now.
[10:00.360 --> 10:05.240]  There was the Huffington Post last night going, Alex Jones is still on Instagram and he's
[10:05.240 --> 10:10.520]  still on iTunes and he's still on Droid and he needs to be removed.
[10:10.520 --> 10:16.240]  And Instagram clicked its heels and went, yes, sir, and put us down photos of me riding
[10:16.240 --> 10:21.720]  a horse, photos of my family, funny memes.
[10:21.720 --> 10:27.160]  And they just repeated what the media said, Islamophobia, transphobia, bullying children.
[10:27.160 --> 10:30.800]  By the way, but right as they banned us on YouTube yesterday, we happened to have our
[10:30.800 --> 10:31.800]  console open.
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.120]  We got a photo of it.
[10:33.120 --> 10:37.960]  We tried to screenshot it, but by then it was gone, how our account was in good standing
[10:37.960 --> 10:41.360]  at YouTube except for the community guidelines strike.
[10:41.360 --> 10:46.040]  So when they banned us, this is literally the minute they did, they never even said that
[10:46.040 --> 10:49.280]  we violated and got the other strikes.
[10:49.280 --> 10:55.440]  They just did it because the decision was made to circle the wagons after Patriots went
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.720]  into San Francisco and Portland this weekend and Antifa tried to attack everybody.
[10:59.720 --> 11:04.680]  When they saw that we had the diverse crowd of Hispanics, blacks, Asians and whites all
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.600]  loving each other and loving America and coming together around freedom, they crapped their
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.880]  collective britches.
[11:11.880 --> 11:18.480]  Just as WikiLeaks said, the cultural imperialism of San Francisco wants to rule America.
[11:18.480 --> 11:19.480]  People talk about Harvard.
[11:19.480 --> 11:22.960]  They talk about New York culturally dominating, no, no, no.
[11:22.960 --> 11:27.040]  If you want to know what really dominates culture in the universities and in this country,
[11:27.040 --> 11:33.800]  it's San Francisco, which has adopted the Tabistock Institute British system of cultural
[11:33.800 --> 11:34.800]  engineering.
[11:34.800 --> 11:41.280]  And you've got CNN lobbying everywhere, breathlessly, get Alex Jones off, get all his apps off.
[11:41.280 --> 11:44.120]  We just launched an app three weeks ago.
[11:44.120 --> 11:51.840]  It is now, if you go to the iTunes store, number four of all news apps and we'll go
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.720]  to number one and we're going to have an article up on info wars.com and news wars.com the
[11:58.720 --> 12:04.400]  next hour, but I have screenshots of it and there it is info wars apps still in Google.
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.280]  All that is is allowing you to access it on their platform.
[12:08.280 --> 12:13.880]  That is literally like them saying you can't buy and add the phone book or you can't have
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.400]  a phone number or breaking in during a phone call, which they can do now with digital controls
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.560]  if they want to do it over the internet and telling you, sorry, you can't say that.
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.560]  You can't do that.
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.040]  It's beyond, it's beyond spying on you.
[12:28.040 --> 12:35.680]  It's censoring you in live time, censoring you in live time.
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.600]  So we're going to break down who's behind it, what's happening.
[12:37.600 --> 12:46.720]  But now it's in mainstream news that China runs Apple and they're going to use it for
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.480]  leverage against America.
[12:50.480 --> 12:57.520]  No wonder the Democrats are telling you about Russian spies hiding under every cabbage leaf
[12:57.520 --> 13:04.320]  and you know, hiding in their basements because people ask, how am I taking it?
[13:04.320 --> 13:06.240]  People ask, what's it like to be lied about everywhere?
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.560]  I'm an American patriot.
[13:10.560 --> 13:11.800]  I've been right about this.
[13:11.800 --> 13:17.360]  I've studied the globalist, I didn't sell out like most other people.
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.120]  Trump isn't a traitor either.
[13:21.120 --> 13:26.880]  They call him romantic because he believes in the country and is trying to restore it.
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.600]  So China announces we will not surrender.
[13:30.600 --> 13:42.320]  We are holding Apple hostage because Apple has 100% of its factories in Shanghai.
[13:42.320 --> 13:45.280]  Now they've announced a fewer coming here.
[13:45.280 --> 13:49.840]  So the official government says, we have you now.
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.800]  China is like Darth Vader behind Luke Skywalker saying, stay in attack formation.
[13:53.800 --> 13:55.280]  I'm on the leader.
[13:55.280 --> 13:56.600]  Cover me.
[13:56.600 --> 13:58.920]  And they're right there going, I have you now.
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.680]  And at the last minute, like the Millennium Falcon, in comes Trump in the Liberty Movement
[14:02.680 --> 14:07.440]  and Info Wars and blast them out of the way so we can blow the Death Star.
[14:07.440 --> 14:10.120]  The problem is they'd already built another one around the corner and they just swung
[14:10.120 --> 14:12.560]  that bitch around.
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.640]  And this is it, baby, toe to toe with the globalist and the chai comms and the radical
[14:17.640 --> 14:18.640]  Islamists.
[14:18.640 --> 14:24.080]  I took my wife and children, took my girls, all three of my girls and my wife to the
[14:24.080 --> 14:35.040]  Cheesecake Factory and lo and behold, in came people in full burkus.
[14:35.040 --> 14:37.880]  That means you're chattel slavery.
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.200]  That started in North Africa with sex slaves 1,000 years ago, wasn't even in Islam and
[14:42.200 --> 14:44.080]  popular until about 500 years ago.
[14:44.080 --> 14:48.000]  All right, I'm going to come back and do the special report, breaking all this down.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.800]  And then I'm going to come in with my official statement.
[14:49.800 --> 14:52.600]  It's just it's got to be one hell of a speech from the heart.
[14:52.600 --> 14:53.600]  I don't have notes.
[14:53.600 --> 14:54.600]  I'm going to go off the research.
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.040]  I got to get this together and just show you article after article during my statement.
[14:59.040 --> 15:02.160]  See, no one else does that during my statement.
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.360]  Everything is like a PowerPoint in live time on radio and TV.
[15:05.360 --> 15:09.760]  So everything I say, I'm just going to lay on the table for the camera.
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.640]  Why do you think they move?
[15:14.640 --> 15:15.640]  They miscalculated.
[15:15.640 --> 15:19.040]  I told my dad two weeks ago, he said, why are you getting more aggressive on air and
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.040]  baiting them?
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.040]  Why'd you say the Mueller thing?
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.360]  And I said, I'm pushing them, I'm pushing them to move early instead of about a month
[15:26.360 --> 15:27.360]  before the election.
[15:27.360 --> 15:30.360]  I said, I think I'll be banned within a week and a half.
[15:30.360 --> 15:34.200]  Then they're going to move against everybody else and cause a landslide and a giant awakening.
[15:34.200 --> 15:36.680]  He said, I thought that's what you were planning.
[15:36.680 --> 15:41.600]  And now our operation is on all cylinders accelerating to attack speed.
[15:41.600 --> 15:42.600]  So get ready.
[15:42.600 --> 15:49.520]  I told everyone about a year ago from now on, I follow my gut and it's never failed me.
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.680]  Now the globalist face, my subconscious, I'm turning it loose.
[15:54.680 --> 15:59.800]  I'm doing what it wants in defense of liberty.
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.440]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[20:03.080 --> 20:16.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.400 --> 20:20.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[20:20.600 --> 20:25.040]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[20:25.040 --> 20:26.040]  one.
[20:26.040 --> 20:43.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:43.400 --> 21:02.240]  We knew it was coming, the whole thing was for me leg, first demonize Info Wars, lie
[21:02.240 --> 21:07.680]  about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake
[21:07.680 --> 21:14.200]  strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[21:14.200 --> 21:22.000]  And then voila, two weeks later ban Info Wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.320]  where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[21:26.320 --> 21:31.440]  CNN, MSNBC, the rest of the dying news system like the New York Times and the Washington
[21:31.440 --> 21:36.640]  Post, groups that are propped up by the Mexican kingpin in the case of the New York Times,
[21:36.640 --> 21:41.640]  Carlos Slim in the case of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, they can't allow something
[21:41.640 --> 21:46.160]  like Info Wars with a fraction of the crew or the money to be ranked higher than them
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.680]  on iTunes or on YouTube.
[21:48.680 --> 21:53.400]  They can't stand it when people like Mark Dye says more subscribers on his channel, he
[21:53.400 --> 21:57.960]  has a work for Info Wars, but he's an example of it, than CNN.
[21:57.960 --> 22:03.640]  And so their answer is, have CNN, the New York Times, Buzzfeed and all these other corrupt
[22:03.640 --> 22:11.120]  organizations openly lobby for us to be removed and then organize their listeners, their viewers,
[22:11.120 --> 22:17.360]  the different university organizations, Antifa, Sleeping Giants and a bunch of other groups
[22:17.360 --> 22:24.360]  to then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again is something out of 1984 or a
[22:24.360 --> 22:28.600]  Kafka novel where you don't even know what you've supposedly done, you can't face your
[22:28.600 --> 22:35.800]  accusers, then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[22:35.800 --> 22:41.280]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalist,
[22:41.280 --> 22:45.960]  conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial
[22:45.960 --> 22:50.120]  board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[22:50.120 --> 22:54.440]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[22:54.440 --> 22:58.880]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key, Apple has officially moved
[22:58.880 --> 23:04.280]  to China and is letting the government basically run Apple, and that of course is iTunes.
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.000]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them and whistleblowers from inside
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.840]  Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[23:10.840 --> 23:16.640]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American
[23:16.640 --> 23:19.520]  conservatives, nationalists and Trump supporters.
[23:19.520 --> 23:26.480]  So bigger than just trying to manipulate the election and give huge contributions in kind
[23:26.480 --> 23:32.000]  to the Democrats by blocking conservatives, libertarians, conservative candidates, conservatives
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.440]  in office, and trying to make sure they can win back the House to try to impeach Trump,
[23:37.440 --> 23:38.680]  that's only one part of it.
[23:38.680 --> 23:45.560]  The bigger issue is they don't like infowars exposing the fact in great detail that Communist
[23:45.560 --> 23:51.040]  China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda
[23:51.040 --> 23:55.880]  operations and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to
[23:55.880 --> 23:57.240]  block the Trump agenda.
[23:57.240 --> 23:59.280]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[23:59.280 --> 24:02.000]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.800]  It's happening right now and it's designed to silence the American people and other
[24:05.800 --> 24:10.120]  populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate
[24:10.120 --> 24:11.120]  totalitarianism.
[24:11.120 --> 24:16.080]  I've had a lot of top lawyers call me today and they say, Alex, we need to sue Apple,
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.800]  we need to sue all these groups that clearly are involved in cut and drive, antitrust
[24:20.800 --> 24:26.920]  activities, working with other big corporations to delist you and block you from the marketplace
[24:26.920 --> 24:28.080]  of ideas.
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.880]  So then when they demonize you, you don't have a way to respond to them and they can
[24:32.880 --> 24:34.160]  destroy you.
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.280]  And then with that model, move on against everybody else.
[24:38.280 --> 24:42.840]  Just five months ago, the Wall Street Journal had the new CEO of News Corp, Brad, that by
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.200]  2019, the Internet will be basically paid.
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.120]  He said, Barry Dillers also said this as well, he owns a Newsweek, so that's a Democrat,
[24:50.120 --> 24:52.640]  the other side, that the Internet will be paid soon.
[24:52.640 --> 24:56.880]  Watch, believe me, he said, because they're sending the president to deplatform M4 wars
[24:56.880 --> 24:59.040]  and WikiLeaks as a test point example.
[24:59.040 --> 25:01.440]  And once they've done that, they're doing it to everybody.
[25:01.440 --> 25:03.040]  Now, what do we need to do?
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.720]  We need to call the White House, go to Trump's rallies, call the campaign, let them know
[25:07.720 --> 25:13.120]  that this is about deplatforming conservatives and libertarians and other Republican candidates
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.720]  around the country to steal the election.
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.000]  It's true election meddling, not like the made up Russia meddling garbage.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.200]  This is out in the open and naked.
[25:22.200 --> 25:24.760]  And the Democrats have been very, very public about it.
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.040]  So if we simply have real congressional hearings about this, where I'm called and others are
[25:29.040 --> 25:30.600]  called, they will be exposed.
[25:30.600 --> 25:36.440]  They've had a bunch of hearings lying about me saying that I need to be deplatformed,
[25:36.440 --> 25:38.560]  but I'm never there to actually speak for myself.
[25:38.560 --> 25:43.640]  This is completely one-sided and totally deceptive because they can't handle me being there.
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.640]  So again, they secretly report you, they defame you, they lie about you, and then you never
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.240]  get to see what you've done or face your accuser.
[25:50.240 --> 25:53.200]  This is the essence of totalitarianism.
[25:53.200 --> 25:58.760]  And President Trump, the Republican Congress, the state houses, independent media all need
[25:58.760 --> 26:03.800]  to rally together against this global move to censor America and the planet.
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.640]  And if you look at what Facebook, Google, Apple, and all of them are doing right now,
[26:07.640 --> 26:10.600]  it's mirroring the EU censorship.
[26:10.600 --> 26:11.600]  And why is that?
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.840]  The EU has been finding them billions of dollars if they don't get in line on hate speech and
[26:15.840 --> 26:20.920]  fake news, which is whatever Brussels and the unelected bureaucrats say it is.
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.680]  So it's China, the EU, and others muscling in on America with all these global regulations
[26:25.680 --> 26:28.120]  trying to force their will on us.
[26:28.120 --> 26:30.280]  France is passing laws to shut down populist.
[26:30.280 --> 26:32.280]  Brazil is passing laws to shut down populist.
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.800]  Whether they be left-wing or right-wing, they don't want the people having control of their
[26:35.800 --> 26:36.800]  own destiny.
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.800]  This is modern global corporate colonialism against every nation state on the planet,
[26:41.800 --> 26:47.480]  be you first world, old world, or be you a third world nation.
[26:47.480 --> 26:48.480]  This is history.
[26:48.480 --> 26:49.480]  It's happening now.
[26:49.480 --> 26:55.320]  And we're at the tip of the spear at newswars.com, prisonplata.com, and infowars.com, and closing.
[26:55.320 --> 26:59.160]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing
[26:59.160 --> 27:06.800]  others is to simply go to infowars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast,
[27:06.800 --> 27:11.360]  just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.960]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your emails so
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.520]  that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.160]  that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[27:23.160 --> 27:28.080]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com forward slash show how they can download the
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.320]  free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[27:33.320 --> 27:35.720]  and point out, this is the verboten info.
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.440]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.440]  You're an adult.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.600]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[27:40.600 --> 27:44.240]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make
[27:44.240 --> 27:46.080]  your own decision.
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.400]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today, listen, I was never trying to win a
[27:51.400 --> 27:52.400]  popularity contest.
[27:52.400 --> 27:55.640]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's
[27:55.640 --> 27:56.640]  happening.
[27:56.640 --> 27:57.640]  We've been very successful.
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.640]  We were expected to be attacked.
[27:58.640 --> 28:02.520]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.560]  So now info wars is the banner of free speech, the Renaissance and Western culture and civilization.
[28:07.560 --> 28:10.640]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to
[28:10.640 --> 28:14.680]  fall against your cherished free speech and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand
[28:14.680 --> 28:16.560]  up for it now.
[28:16.560 --> 28:20.200]  Infowars is trending the top of Twitter right now and we've got record traffic at info wars
[28:20.200 --> 28:23.880]  and news wars, but they think in a few days you'll forget about it, then they'll move
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.120]  on to the next target and the next target, the next target.
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.360]  At least they would only partially ban us here, partially ban us there.
[28:30.360 --> 28:31.360]  They would cry wolf.
[28:31.360 --> 28:32.360]  They were going to ban us.
[28:32.360 --> 28:35.480]  And so when they finally ban us, they're hoping you're not paying attention.
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.480]  They're hoping you're stupid.
[28:36.480 --> 28:39.040]  They're hoping you believe the fake narratives about us and the lies.
[28:39.040 --> 28:40.040]  All right.
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.040]  That full response video is on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[28:43.040 --> 28:50.040]  I think I'm ready when we come back to lay out what's happened, what's currently happening,
[28:50.040 --> 28:52.240]  what's coming and how we stop them.
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.560]  We're going to get the absolute right now that they know is accurate, so accurate they
[28:57.560 --> 28:59.320]  keep asking people associated with us how we know.

[33:23.760 --> 33:44.560]  This is my official statement on the concerted plan to erase my electronic identity and put
[33:44.560 --> 33:51.040]  me into a true electronic ghetto that Matt Drudge first warned the world of two and a
[33:51.040 --> 33:55.880]  half years ago after he had meetings with high-level federal officials in the judiciary
[33:55.880 --> 34:00.880]  and in the executive and was warned of the takeover plan that Hillary was planning to
[34:00.880 --> 34:03.560]  launch once she got elected.
[34:03.560 --> 34:07.480]  Patriots were aware of the plan and fought back and elected Donald Trump, who's been
[34:07.480 --> 34:13.520]  valiantly exposing the enemy of the American people, the mainstream corporate news that
[34:13.520 --> 34:21.000]  ostracizes and kicks anybody out who's real, like the famous CBS reporter Cheryl Atkinson,
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.920]  who exposed that Obama was false-flagging shipping guns into Mexico to then get people
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.280]  killed to blame gun owners and the Second Amendment.
[34:30.280 --> 34:39.040]  Almost everyone has been purged, and mainstream corporate media with its dwindling audiences
[34:39.040 --> 34:45.880]  are now engines of censorship and harassment against those who try to actually follow the
[34:45.880 --> 34:51.200]  Constitution and restore our republic and who try to then shut down all of their competition.
[34:51.200 --> 34:56.040]  They are now terrorist organizations, most of them on the communist-Chinese payroll,
[34:56.040 --> 35:01.840]  which by the grace of God is now breaking, and that's the big takeaway.
[35:01.840 --> 35:06.000]  Number one, Info Wars is under attack because we will tell you what the president knows
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.080]  but has been advised not to say because it could damage the stock market and kill confidence.
[35:11.080 --> 35:16.040]  I believe, though, an emergency surgery is needed, we have to go ahead and admit it because
[35:16.040 --> 35:18.160]  the enemy has not backed down.
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.640]  China infiltrated the major universities, the government, the Democratic Party particularly,
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.900]  that's all coming out, the Office of Personnel Management hacked 21 million names of our
[35:26.900 --> 35:32.600]  entire key infrastructure, was given to the Chai comms, they own Hollywood, they own the
[35:32.600 --> 35:36.080]  national debt, we have been set up.
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.040]  And just today, if you go to drugsreport.com, China is threatening to basically take over
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.760]  Apple and shut down the factories over there that has already state run.
[35:44.760 --> 35:48.160]  Apple have been state run for a while, they announced it four months ago, to get total
[35:48.160 --> 35:49.160]  tax exemption.
[35:49.160 --> 35:52.200]  They wanted to point it out that we have been hammering that and that's the main reason
[35:52.200 --> 35:58.720]  they panicked, I have been told from my level sources, inside Google and inside the Washington
[35:58.720 --> 36:04.880]  Post particularly, that they have become very upset that I keep saying that the Russiagate
[36:04.880 --> 36:13.280]  thing is a distraction for the real China gate, global gate, where our own elites have
[36:13.280 --> 36:14.360]  sold us out.
[36:14.360 --> 36:20.080]  The EU, Davos had the Chinese dictator there a year and a half ago and he said, with Yonker
[36:20.080 --> 36:25.720]  we will defeat America, we will defeat Trump, we will crush them economically.
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.440]  You've got the big tech heads saying we'll crush conservatives, we'll crush Trump, these
[36:29.440 --> 36:31.560]  are in public statements.
[36:31.560 --> 36:37.840]  So here's the big news, A, this is globalist and Chinese run, B, it's totally illegal
[36:37.840 --> 36:47.360]  out of control if we just expose it, they're done, but most importantly, they are launching
[36:47.360 --> 36:53.120]  the full out censorship against everyone I know, every Republican congressman other
[36:53.120 --> 37:02.600]  than McCain, all of Ron Paul's staff, Senator Paul, you can go test their accounts, we've
[37:02.600 --> 37:08.920]  done it, they're major sites that do the testing, they're all shadow banned, 93% is the new
[37:08.920 --> 37:16.040]  number, it was 80% just a few months ago, it's 93% ahead of the midterms, this is election
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.440]  meddling, everything they claim we're doing, they're doing, this is out in the open, the
[37:20.440 --> 37:26.240]  big tech giants themselves, so China's involved so it's treason, they're trying to affect
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.440]  the midterms, they're ratcheting everything down, and now they're setting the precedent
[37:30.440 --> 37:38.560]  with yours truly to completely de-platform, tortuous interference, new companies have
[37:38.560 --> 37:50.200]  banned us just in the last hour, and ladies and gentlemen, wait till you hear this, now
[37:50.200 --> 38:00.600]  let's get into the facts, Dr. McCam shot right here, please.
[38:00.600 --> 38:05.160]  Stefan Mahlon who made the point, first they came for Alex Jones, and I did not speak out
[38:05.160 --> 38:13.680]  because I wasn't Alex Jones, just as Senator Ted Cruz has said, just as Donald Trump Jr.
[38:13.680 --> 38:19.280]  has said, just as Tucker Carlson has said, but everybody else is strangely silent, which
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.920]  is very, very foolish, Michael Sabich is speaking out on the show today, so we're finding out
[38:24.920 --> 38:30.720]  who the Americans are, who's free speech.
[38:30.720 --> 38:37.120]  Democrats Senator demands more censorship of conservative media, we knew that was coming,
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.440]  I'm going to go through each of these, and of course we knew that was coming because
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.360]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the internet, they
[38:46.360 --> 38:52.640]  say it's the only way to save democracy, the survival of democracy is to shut down everybody's
[38:52.640 --> 38:54.760]  free speech.
[38:54.760 --> 38:59.520]  First they launched a year and a half long demonization campaign of yours truly, second
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.160]  only to the demonization campaign against Trump, and it's the same story, Alex hurts
[39:04.160 --> 39:08.360]  children, no evidence, Alex said this about people's families, no evidence, Trump has
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.440]  babies taken from their parents, not true, Trump says all Mexicans are criminals and
[39:12.440 --> 39:13.800]  rapists, not true.
[39:13.800 --> 39:19.520]  So first they ran a big demonization to build me into this straw man demon, then they come
[39:19.520 --> 39:24.480]  in and start saying, oh, we're private companies, we can censor you, and then they start de-platforming
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.880]  you continually until you can't even have a bank account, that's the Communist Chinese
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.560]  global social score model that big tech has been at conferences admitting their planning,
[39:34.560 --> 39:40.600]  so they've gotten CNN, MSNBC, all of them together, the New York Times, at these conferences
[39:40.600 --> 39:45.360]  going back five months ago and they publicly then announced this plan, that's how we knew
[39:45.360 --> 39:49.880]  it was coming, so the chai comms are involved, it's high treason, it's donations in kind
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.760]  election meddling, the Democrats are now going public with the plan because their plan got
[39:54.760 --> 40:02.440]  leaked to reason, got no attention for a week except info wars dot com and our audience
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.040]  and now top of drudge report dot com, socials clamped down on info wars, Instagram bans
[40:08.040 --> 40:13.000]  tony robinson, facebook blocks republican candidates ad, that's just the latest, asked
[40:13.000 --> 40:19.720]  to change rules for journalists, twitter suspends libertarians accounts, ron paul's,
[40:19.720 --> 40:25.440]  senate dim circulating plans for government takeover of the internet, survival democracy
[40:25.440 --> 40:32.440]  depends on banning sites, banning the sites and the democrats are saying ban the sites
[40:32.440 --> 40:41.160]  themselves and fox news is now at the top of the list and the folks running news corps
[40:41.160 --> 40:48.320]  want that, they want to use that outside power to bully their host into submission, to basically
[40:48.320 --> 40:54.320]  become what CNN was ten years ago, kind of globalist light.
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.040]  Now that facebook, youtube and apple have come for alex jones, now they'll come for
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.560]  the rest of us as michael schneider and indeed they have midterm meddling facebook blocks
[41:02.560 --> 41:08.440]  republican candidates ad, the crackdown continues twitter suspends libertarian accounts including
[41:08.440 --> 41:12.480]  ron paul institute director, they're going over all this for you and now here's the
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.480]  new news, they've got all these laws on email where it's almost impossible to send it to
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.440]  people so we use one of the biggest companies mail chimp, you don't even know that unless
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.440]  you basically try to get in and look at our servers, they have said the exact same thing
[41:25.440 --> 41:29.440]  after review, we've determined that your account is in violation of our terms of use and has
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.320]  been disabled from sending, affected immediately, you may log into your account the next 48
[41:34.320 --> 41:38.600]  hours to retrieve your data, mail chimp compliance.
[41:38.600 --> 41:44.240]  Total Kafka asks, we're put into the phantom zone, hey the president is too, west hollywood
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.680]  votes to remove donald trump's walk of fame star because the left kept attacking it and
[41:49.680 --> 41:56.000]  beating it up, now it's being taken away because they demand control the streets, control the
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.440]  schools, control your bank account, control the churches, control the food you eat, control
[42:00.440 --> 42:04.000]  the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control everything, they're
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.680]  here.
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.880]  Alex jones info wars removed from linkedin, still up on instagram and twitter, yes i misspoke
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.800]  when i said instagram, i'm still on instagram, i've been taken off pinterest, excuse me,

[42:22.440 --> 42:29.560]  my shingle out if i wanted a job, that's truly being sent to the electronic ghetto, and after
[42:29.560 --> 42:35.200]  they take you to the ghetto, what do they do, they arrest you, and here it is, scarbro calls
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.440]  for alex jones to be arrested, the story's up on info wars dot com, and for info wars

[42:53.200 --> 42:59.280]  lory clousudz, is that how you say it?

[46:59.840 --> 47:26.720]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[47:26.720 --> 47:53.680]  Because there is a war on your mind.
[47:53.680 --> 47:59.720]  What's your witnessing is the globalist preparing to make their move on President Trump and
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.880]  the populist awakening and the American resurgence that's happened.
[48:03.880 --> 48:05.520]  I told everyone they're coming to ban us.
[48:05.520 --> 48:07.040]  They were bidding they wanted to.
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.200]  They had Soros Group, Buzzfeed, The New York Times, all of these anti-American organizations
[48:12.200 --> 48:14.040]  calling for us to be shut down.
[48:14.040 --> 48:15.840]  These are true American haters.
[48:15.840 --> 48:18.360]  Born, bred, trained for it.
[48:18.360 --> 48:19.600]  Chinese communists funded on record.
[48:19.600 --> 48:21.240]  It's all coming out in the news.
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.560]  Bid by Tim Cook at Apple.
[48:25.560 --> 48:30.360]  And now they're involved in massive economic warfare against the American people and they're
[48:30.360 --> 48:36.160]  giving donations illegally violating federal election laws with billions of dollars of
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.800]  Republican ads and conservative information being blocked on these platforms to try to
[48:40.800 --> 48:43.840]  ensure that they win the midterms coming up.
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.880]  In fact, Google lists all Republicans in California as Nazis on their official candidate
[48:49.880 --> 48:51.480]  front page.
[48:51.480 --> 48:55.680]  You've seen everything they've been trying to do and the Republican Congress has been
[48:55.680 --> 48:56.680]  in a coma.
[48:56.680 --> 49:03.160]  They had hearings about the censorship and when those presidents and VPs of the big tech
[49:03.160 --> 49:09.560]  companies sat there and witnessed all of that and when they saw how ignorant Congress was
[49:09.560 --> 49:19.520]  in the House Judiciary Committee in other areas, it green-lighted a avalanche of censorship.
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.400]  So there is a massive cascade of people wanting publicity and wanting with Trump derangement
[49:24.400 --> 49:34.040]  syndrome to pile on to an attack against info wars to set the precedent to shut us down,
[49:34.040 --> 49:37.760]  to set the precedent to shut everybody else down.
[49:37.760 --> 49:43.200]  And now we've got Democrat senators, Democrat Congresspeople, leaked memos, public statements,
[49:43.200 --> 49:49.480]  shut down Tucker Carlson, shut down Matt Drudge, shut down Fox News.
[49:49.480 --> 49:55.160]  Shut down everybody and then LinkedIn bans me so I couldn't even get a job if I lost
[49:55.160 --> 49:56.160]  this job.
[49:56.160 --> 49:57.160]  Trying to make me bankrupt?
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.080]  They admit they are and then you can't even hang out a shingle to try to get a job.
[50:02.080 --> 50:03.920]  That's true authoritarianism.
[50:03.920 --> 50:06.960]  That's true fascism.
[50:06.960 --> 50:10.800]  And here's another headline with virtue signaling from TechCrunch.
[50:10.800 --> 50:18.000]  Now even U-Porn has banned Alex Jones, but he's still on Twitter.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.680]  And that's because Twitter knows it's under investigation because of the shadow banning
[50:21.680 --> 50:22.680]  right now.
[50:22.680 --> 50:26.160]  That's the only reason because it was the one thing that the committee got right.
[50:26.160 --> 50:30.240]  The one thing they signaled, they were looking at.
[50:30.240 --> 50:36.440]  And so Jack Dorsey backed off for now, like you're around the campfire with your fires.
[50:36.440 --> 50:37.440]  You got your kids with you.
[50:37.440 --> 50:38.440]  You don't have any weapons.
[50:38.440 --> 50:39.440]  You've got fire.
[50:39.440 --> 50:40.440]  And the fire is burning out.
[50:40.440 --> 50:41.440]  You don't have any more kenneling.
[50:41.440 --> 50:44.120]  And the wolves are coming in.
[50:44.120 --> 50:45.920]  But Dorsey got a little close.
[50:45.920 --> 50:47.360]  Fire almost scalded him.
[50:47.360 --> 50:48.360]  His whiskers.
[50:48.360 --> 50:54.720]  So he jumped back and started stalking in the night, those red eyes.
[50:54.720 --> 50:59.600]  I'll crush the conservatives yet.
[50:59.600 --> 51:03.160]  But the Republicans see that and go, oh, the answer is antitrust.
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.400]  The answer, tell them all back down.
[51:04.400 --> 51:09.040]  The answer is talking about China in control and funding, which is now mainstream news.
[51:09.040 --> 51:15.480]  I knew years ago, Diane Feinstein, is a Chinese operative.
[51:15.480 --> 51:19.600]  Her and her husband have gotten billions in Chinese investment.
[51:19.600 --> 51:22.960]  Yes, her husband.
[51:22.960 --> 51:28.080]  They own biotech laboratories in China.
[51:28.080 --> 51:33.200]  Part of that deal was putting one of their agents directly in command of her daily schedule
[51:33.200 --> 51:38.960]  and her driver and her valet and her attache, her aide-de-camp.
[51:38.960 --> 51:40.280]  You make a deal with China.
[51:40.280 --> 51:44.440]  You marry them, just like Apple announced five months ago they were moving to China
[51:44.440 --> 51:46.320]  and becoming state run.
[51:46.320 --> 51:50.160]  And now China says today, and it's officials, people's daily.
[51:50.160 --> 51:54.560]  You try trade war with us, we'll shut Apple off because all your factories are here and
[51:54.560 --> 51:57.520]  they belong to us now.
[51:57.520 --> 52:06.840]  The headline was no surrender to Trump, Apple is ours.
[52:06.840 --> 52:10.880]  And all these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't
[52:10.880 --> 52:11.880]  say it.
[52:11.880 --> 52:17.440]  I'm here hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering and all these
[52:17.440 --> 52:21.840]  fools and all these traders don't get it.
[52:21.840 --> 52:25.880]  That was our fun mock-up if you're watching us on TV of what the Drudge Report headline
[52:25.880 --> 52:30.680]  should be, China with the Apple Cross through Regulate Speech, not that we're telling Drudge
[52:30.680 --> 52:32.040]  it's something he doesn't already know.
[52:32.040 --> 52:36.400]  And then magically today, the Chinese say, we own and control Apple, we're holding in
[52:36.400 --> 52:46.400]  hostage and that exact symbol is on DrudgeReport.com right now because it's the truth.
[52:46.400 --> 52:49.440]  China uses Apple as bait, that's the way to say it nice.
[52:49.440 --> 52:53.440]  China is holding Apple hostage.
[52:53.440 --> 52:57.880]  China says we will not surrender with a gun to Apple's head.
[52:57.880 --> 52:59.720]  Wow.
[52:59.720 --> 53:05.600]  As the Democrats openly call for the US economy to implode so they can teach us all a lesson.
[53:05.600 --> 53:09.400]  They've dropped the shark here with a bad calculation if people take action and folks
[53:09.400 --> 53:12.000]  get upset about this and if people wake up, they're done.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.200]  We have them right now.
[53:14.200 --> 53:18.080]  If Congress opens investigations right now into China again, it's all happening with
[53:18.080 --> 53:19.080]  Dianne Feinstein.
[53:19.080 --> 53:22.200]  They're letting her know right now they're aware of her activities.
[53:22.200 --> 53:29.600]  It's not the CIA around the New York Times or Washington Post folks, it's foreign governments.
[53:29.600 --> 53:37.320]  If you look at it quite frankly Bezos is the least of the bad because he actually is in
[53:37.320 --> 53:40.680]  competition with Alibaba and China and I've got that from high level sources and I looked
[53:40.680 --> 53:45.480]  into it so it's the whole thing's a mess and I'm trying to figure out all the players
[53:45.480 --> 53:49.680]  but let me just tell you, if you aren't for Trump in Info Wars, you're an idiot because
[53:49.680 --> 53:52.840]  Trump's trying to turn this economy on and help everybody and take care of our veterans
[53:52.840 --> 53:56.560]  and bring us racially together and culturally together and he's a patriot.
[53:56.560 --> 54:00.600]  But their attacks on us have already backfired, that's why they got to go for broke, that's
[54:00.600 --> 54:11.280]  why CNN's like take his apps down that I pay for, I build, they accept.
[54:11.280 --> 54:14.960]  You know, the radical Muslim groups can have their apps but they're saying I can't.
[54:14.960 --> 54:15.960]  You know why?
[54:15.960 --> 54:19.080]  We launched this app three weeks ago, it was already in the top 30 before the censorship.
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.280]  Yeah, just a few weeks of news apps, it was like number 34.
[54:23.280 --> 54:29.640]  Now it's number four today at the iTunes store, it's free.
[54:29.640 --> 54:36.160]  Number one is Twitter, number two is Newsbreak, Local and Breaking, all your local channels,
[54:36.160 --> 54:39.720]  that's a smart app, and Reddit.
[54:39.720 --> 54:48.240]  Info Wars is number four, stories up on infowars.com but what everybody needs to do, there's a good
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.320]  chance they're going to delete these, is contact everybody and say this is tortuous
[54:52.320 --> 54:55.800]  interference, this is racketeering and if they do that, clearly there's lawsuits will
[54:55.800 --> 54:56.800]  win.
[54:56.800 --> 54:59.600]  But by then, the globalists would have taken the country or not, that's why we haven't
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.160]  gone with that strategy of lawsuit, we may have to.
[55:05.160 --> 55:09.600]  But everybody should share infowars.com and newswars.com and prisonplotter.com and everyone
[55:09.600 --> 55:13.520]  should be proud of Info Wars, not the lies they put out, not the will, he's crazy but
[55:13.520 --> 55:17.960]  oh yeah, I told you Trump had won, told you the chai comms were running it all, no, I'm
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.640]  crazy like a fox and they know it.
[55:22.640 --> 55:25.680]  And right now all these cowards are looking to see which way the wind blows, they don't
[55:25.680 --> 55:27.000]  know who's going to win this fight.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.280]  If Congress wakes up to the draconian takeover happening and understands what they're dealing
[55:31.280 --> 55:34.880]  with and stop acting like a bunch of bumpkins, we're going to win this.
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.320]  Now I haven't barely plugged last day and I should be because when we've got record
[55:39.320 --> 55:43.720]  traffic and attention, if we can't raise extra money, when we go into the dark winter
[55:43.720 --> 55:47.920]  of the mass censorship it's coming, Info Wars will be shut down, but it will continue on

[1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:10.920]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:32.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:36.920]  My response to the big global purge, porn sites.
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:46.920]  Oh, this is where we have freedom.
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:48.920]  No.
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:53.920]  You can have 50 guys simulate gang raping a girl that looks like she's 12.
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:54.920]  That's okay.
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:56.920]  But you cannot promote America.
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:57.920]  You cannot promote freedom.
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:00.920]  We're going to just nebulously say you're an Islamophobe.
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:06.920]  And you know what, I was in a cheesecake factory with my wife and $3 last night and ladies came in.
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:10.920]  I got video of it, by the way, in full burqas, man.
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:15.920]  I mean, it was like Halloween and that is a sign of their enslavement, their control.
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:19.920]  People are arrested in Saudi Arabia if they see their face.
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:25.920]  But the feminists are like, they see a nuclear family or a masculine man they get triggered.
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:33.920]  But they hear us talk about how I'm worried about radical Islam and how it's not compatible in the West.
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:35.920]  And they ban us.
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:39.920]  So, you know, this is all San Francisco morals on us.
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:43.920]  The S-hole city, as it's known.
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:47.920]  I got a bunch of reports here that are really, really important.
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:52.920]  But I think the one I want to get to right now is Portland stand down in the face of Liberty, Alex Jones.
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:56.920]  This is one of the real reasons I think they've been banning us off the Internet is they just know that
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:01:58.920]  Antifa tries to intimidate and bully people.
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:01.920]  And three, four times the numbers of patriots show up.
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:05.920]  And half of them are wearing M4 shirts or M4 stickers on.
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:06.920]  So, that scares them.
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:10.920]  So, let's go to that video report and I'll be back with a really big news on a whole bunch of fronts.
[1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:12.920]  Take your phone calls and more.
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.920]  And we have some special guests that I'll be telling you about.
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:17.920]  But right now, here's that report. Portland stand down in the face of Liberty.
[1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:22.920]  Spanics and black folks. That's the big takeaway here. And the poll numbers are showing this.
[1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:31.920]  In the pro-America pro-prosperity movement, and at this prayer meeting, then there are on the other side.
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:34.920]  The other side are people literally who flunked out of drama school.
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:35.920]  That's what liberalism modern is.
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:39.920]  Like a bunch of weird posers that just lie and make stuff up and dress up in clown suits
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:41.920]  and then run around bullying everybody.
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.920]  And if you speak out against them, they call it bullying.
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:50.920]  Calm down. No one wants to hurt you, man. No one wants to hurt you, dude.
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:54.920]  Let them go. Hey, let them go. Let them go. Let them go.
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:56.920]  Hey, hey, don't chase after them.
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:02:58.920]  Hey, just let them go.
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:01.920]  Hey, what have you thought about this so far?
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.920]  I was worried that there wasn't going to be this many people here, but we have a pretty good turnout.
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:07.920]  And honestly, so far it's just been fun.
[1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:11.920]  So far, yeah. And who knows, maybe it might say that way.
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:14.920]  For me, so far, we've been down here for about two hours.
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.920]  So far for me, I've just had a good time.
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:18.920]  Same here. No one's attacked me.
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:23.920]  I'm a black male and supposedly, according to them over there, they want to attack everyone like me.
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:25.920]  It's not happening. It hasn't happened.
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:27.920]  He's from the Infowars. Does he have white privilege?
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:29.920]  I don't know. I'm scared, man.
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:30.920]  I mean, you know what I was saying? White privilege.
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:32.920]  You know what? I'll answer that question.
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:35.920]  I have American privilege because I was born free.
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:37.920]  I don't have to deal with the communist government.
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.920]  That's all of our privilege as an American.
[1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:43.920]  And it's sad that you have thousands of people out here that march against their own birthright.
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:45.920]  I went down there and I tried to talk to them, and they wouldn't even talk to me.
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:48.920]  They just cursed me out. Actually, I got in a little pipe because of that.
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:50.920]  I got a little over there. Yeah. And all I...
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:51.920]  Over on the other side?
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:54.920]  And I had my wheelchair, my walker, because I have Parkinson's.
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:55.920]  And they still struck you?
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:56.920]  They still struck me, yeah.
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:00.920]  And there were some people that came over here that were anti-Trump and leftists or liberals,
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:04.920]  and they didn't get hurt. They were allowed to come over here and execute their right to free speech.
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:12.920]  When Tifa has put me on an anti-racism watch list where they...
[1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:14.920]  Are you also a white supremacist? Of course.
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:16.920]  We'll be ready if they want to attack us.
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:17.920]  You look like you're ready.
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:20.920]  Oh, I'm very ready. I'm from South Central L.A.
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:23.920]  I'm of Mexican descent. I am a minority in your eyes.
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:26.920]  Can we talk? Can we chit chat a little bit?
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:28.920]  Even Che Guevara, can we speak about Che Guevara?
[1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:30.920]  And they don't want nothing, bro.
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:31.920]  They don't even know who he is, really.
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:35.920]  I'm a racist. I'm a fascist. They got no more ammunition, bro.
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:39.920]  And let's be clear. The big multinational banks, China all over trying to bring down Trump,
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:42.920]  trying to keep America from being rebooted.
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:46.920]  The patriots in America, in our own government, you name it, knew what was happening.
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:50.920]  The general citizens took action, and we're now in a battle to take the country back.
[1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:55.920]  We haven't won it yet, but we're in a battle, and we've smoked the enemy out to show all their actions what they're doing.
[1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:57.920]  And the left points, it goes, look at the knots.
[1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:02.920]  InfoWarsLife and infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release,
[1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:06.920]  Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:11.920]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:16.920]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:19.920]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:21.920]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:25.920]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:29.920]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:32.920]  The research and development took over two years,
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:38.920]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:43.920]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:46.920]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood,
[1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:51.920]  but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function, something the globalists are targeting.

[1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:29.920]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:36.920]  But when they're running down our country, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:41.920]  They're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:49.920]  Running down a way of life, our fighting men have fought and died to keep.
[1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:52.920]  If you don't love it, leave it.
[1:06:52.920 --> 1:06:57.920]  Let this song that I'm singing be a warning.
[1:06:57.920 --> 1:07:02.920]  When you're running down our country, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:06.920]  I told Merle Haggard bringing us in.
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:08.920]  Alright.
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:11.920]  I've announced what they've done to us. I've talked about what's happening to us.
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.920]  Let's talk about what's happening to you. Let's give you the data. Let's give you the intel.
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:18.920]  Let's go into the facts. Let's go into the meat and the guts of what's unfolding.
[1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:25.920]  We have a giant corporate swarm, an electronic lynch mob,
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:32.920]  organized by big tech giants Google, Facebook, and Apple,
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:43.920]  to completely ban us on the same night, Sunday evening, early in the Monday morning hours.
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:53.920]  Then to never show what we said or did, to give general politically correct hate speech statements,
[1:07:53.920 --> 1:08:00.920]  and to then deplatform us off of hundreds of other things like LinkedIn, MailChimp, you name it,
[1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:06.920]  and they're now going after the NRA's credit card processors.
[1:08:06.920 --> 1:08:08.920]  They're going to go after your credit card processors.
[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:12.920]  And now we have leaked memos from the Democrats a week ago.
[1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:16.920]  And now that Drudge Report linked to it, they had to report it.
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:21.920]  And so they said, yes, we believe banning Republicans off the Internet is the way to go.
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:26.920]  I'm going to read those quotes. So they're coming after everyone.
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:32.920]  They first demonized me. They first lied about me to set the precedent.
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:41.920]  And now we've got prominent Democrats everywhere saying, take Fox News off the air.
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.920]  We've got a whole news organization. You know, on iTunes and Stitcher and a bunch of other places,
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:56.920]  there was one area that David Knight, one of our longtime hosts of six, seven years,
[1:08:56.920 --> 1:09:00.920]  was surpassing some of my stats, which is great.
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:02.920]  But when you're here longer, you know, it's hard for folks to get to that level.
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:04.920]  We want David to be the biggest thing in the country.
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:08.920]  He's a great, smart, intellectual guy, very polite, very genteel.
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:12.920]  Doesn't even say the word poo poo on air, very family friendly.
[1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:20.920]  He got banned on a whole bunch of platforms and he had something like 10 million downloads
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:26.920]  on one of the podcast sites a month.
[1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:29.920]  And they just blew it all away.
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:36.920]  And his YouTube and a bunch of other platforms that were actually his.
[1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:41.920]  And as WikiLeaks said, the Empire Strikes Back, Apple Spotify, Facebook and Google YouTube,
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:45.920]  all purged info wars. Alex Jones, yes, info wars is frequent nonsense.
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:47.920]  You mean the media puts it out and then you believe it.
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:56.920]  But also a state power critique, which publisher in the world with millions of subscribers
[1:09:56.920 --> 1:10:00.920]  is next to be wiped out for cultural transgression.
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:08.920]  And they went on and said San Francisco or the tech giants are really based is the imperial elite of culture.
[1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:14.920]  And they're going to tell you what flies and what doesn't.
[1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:19.920]  That's why if you've got transsexuals, they call it a drag queen festival.
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:20.920]  They say that's a hate word.
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:21.920]  So I can't use it.
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:25.920]  They can solve this to class system.
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:30.920]  Sexualizing two and three year olds at a public event with people pole dancing
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:37.920]  and shaking their rear ends in baby's faces and little toddlers putting money in their G strings.
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:41.920]  I mean, if it was.
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:47.920]  Marilyn Monroe and her prime twerking to a two year old, I'd say it was sick and evil.
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:52.920]  Man, there's something special about a guy in a purple wig who weighs 300 pounds shaking his ass and little kid's face.
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.920]  And they said I was obscene in that video.
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:04.920]  It was on the news naked men with glitter on their chest and their genitals out but glued to their bodies.
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:05.920]  We're not going to show it.
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:12.920]  They could show it to kids, but we can't show it to you.
[1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:18.920]  Even though we're banned on all these platforms, I'm going to take the high road.
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:20.920]  But you can still go find copies online.
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:24.920]  We're going to start, we're going to find all the names of those old videos because everybody else copied them and start going.
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:29.920]  Here are the 35,000 banned videos of a whole library burned down.
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:31.920]  Here's one they didn't want you to see.
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.920]  Here's another they didn't want you to see.
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:38.920]  But it was the sexualization and people couldn't believe it.
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:41.920]  So I got a couple of million views and they deleted that copy.
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:42.920]  So a million we ever put it back up.
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:43.920]  They got about a half million views.
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:44.920]  They took that down.
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.920]  They never even met an issue.
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:49.920]  They didn't give us a strike because they knew they couldn't stand on it.
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:52.920]  So we put it up again.
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:58.920]  And last time I checked that about 100,000 views and people, liberals, conservatives, you name it, were like, this is evil.
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:11:59.920]  This is sick.
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:00.920]  This is crazy.
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:06.920]  And guess particularly who thought it was evil, Hispanics and blacks.
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:16.920]  And you see, we went and we sent four reporters and crew members to Portland where the antifa said, you're not allowed to march.
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:19.920]  They said all Christians are Nazis, Christians aren't allowed in the city, literally.
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:21.920]  And the media supported the police stood down.
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:24.920]  So we sent a crew there and we sent one to Berkeley the next day.
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:27.920]  And we had millions of views online.
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:31.920]  The videos had gone viral despite the shadow banning.
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:33.920]  The tyrants in Portland stood down in the face of liberty.
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:36.920]  So did Berkeley, San Francisco.
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:43.920]  So because literally in the videos that they've now deleted and banned, we can show you them here.
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:47.920]  There was a good 15% were black.
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:52.920]  That's the little overpopulation numbers and a good 20, 30% were Hispanic.
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:54.920]  That's about populist numbers.
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:13:02.920]  So it was demographically a cut out of society altogether loving on each other for freedom.
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:05.920]  An antifa beating up a man that's partially paralyzed.
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:07.920]  There he is on his walker.
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:09.920]  It says muscular dystrophy.
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:11.920]  They beat him up.
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:18.920]  So the image of a little Hispanic man wearing red, white, and blue being beaten up by a bunch of white methods, white guys.
[1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:24.920]  And you go to the other side, they were 95% white.
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:30.920]  Saying everyone on the other side are Nazis and beating everyone up.
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:31.920]  And that's why they banned us.
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:33.920]  That was the last straw.
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:40.920]  Exposing China's control of Apple and the leveraging of Google and them setting up search engines censorship here and there.
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:42.920]  The med terms coming up.
[1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:56.920]  The fact that it's showing an even skewed polls, even Gallup polls that are cooked, double the support Hispanics and blacks ever seen for a Republican candidate in modern history.
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:01.920]  Even though the Republicans were the party of Christians and minorities.
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:03.920]  And they're in full panic mode.
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:07.920]  I mean, when they saw these videos, everybody else was pointing it out.
[1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:10.920]  And I pointed it out on here and I noticed the organizer pointing it out.
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:12.920]  Organizers Japanese.
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:15.920]  Well, half Japanese.
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:16.920]  Amaration.
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:19.920]  When they pointed that out, they were freaked out.
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:27.920]  You saw all those little Antifa method white guys looking at a whole bunch of like big six foot four black guys that look like linebackers.
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:29.920]  Wearing red, white, and blue Trump 45 shirts.
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.920]  They looked.
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:38.920]  In one scene, one was calling him Nazis and it's a bunch of black guys and Hispanic guys were not Nazis and the guy actually just sits down and looks at the ground.
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:40.920]  He goes.
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:49.920]  Because they're just brainwashed crazy people that want to run around screaming Nazi all day, you know, in between whatever they're doing to their to their bodies.
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:50.920]  So we come back.
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:51.920]  I'm going to go over all of it.
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:52.920]  I'm going to give the number out.
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:53.920]  We got some guys coming up to.
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:57.920]  But this is history because we cannot confident we're having some gains.
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:00.920]  But because we are so successful, they're coming after all of you.
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:01.920]  So they're censoring everybody.
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:03.920]  They're shadow banning anybody who's conservative.
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:05.920]  They're blocking all these Republicans from Facebook and Twitter.
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:09.920]  Total violation of campaign finance law.
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:10.920]  It's donations of the Democrats.
[1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:12.920]  They're doing it in plain views.
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:13.920]  We got big problem in Congress.
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:14.920]  They're as dumb as a box of rocks.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.920]  Trump gets it.
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:25.920]  The mainstream media is the enemy for their lies about everything and trying to stop the recovery and, you know, the Bill Maher saying, I hope there's a depression to bankrupt Americans.
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:27.920]  That's enemy talk.
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:39.920]  But the fact that they're trying to purge us off the web period and economically totally shut us down and saying they're now saying, oh, we're going to de-platform anything Alex Jones off Google or off YouTube.
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:41.920]  Just, you know, you upload it.
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:42.920]  Well, then challenge that.
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:43.920]  Do it.
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:45.920]  They're now saying just this person's ban.
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:49.920]  And if that is Nazi Germany, I'll kiss your booty.
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:50.920]  We'll be right back.

[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:08.920]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.920]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:17.920]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool.
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:21.920]  And read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:25.920]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:30.920]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill,
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:33.920]  micro-ZX body, it's all amazing.
[1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:34.920]  Thank you, brother.
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:39.920]  And I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:42.920]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:47.920]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God.
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:51.920]  And I wanted to say that it's an un-understand side-by-side with you, the crew,
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:54.920]  and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:01.920]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:04.920]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:07.920]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:10.920]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:14.920]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:18.920]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:24.920]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:28.920]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:30.920]  and acidity in the rainwater.
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:34.920]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:38.920]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:41.920]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:46.920]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:52.920]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:20:02.920]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:30.920]  OK, let's get into the facts here.
[1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:34.920]  A multinational global combine is trying to take the U.S. over.
[1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:36.920]  It already thought it had control.
[1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:38.920]  Trump, that elected Patriots are awake.
[1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:40.920]  Nationalism is exploding.
[1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:41.920]  People are waking up.
[1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:42.920]  The economy is coming back.
[1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:43.920]  They're panicking.
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:46.920]  So, how do they shut down free speech?
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:49.920]  Well, you pick somebody, you demonize them, and then you do it.
[1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:53.920]  And then once people go along with that test case,
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:57.920]  you move forward against everybody into the midterms.
[1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:00.920]  Then you get your Congress elected as Democrat.
[1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:01.920]  Then you can start the impeachment.
[1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:06.920]  Then Mueller can put out all his BS, the rest is history.
[1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:08.920]  This is a red alert.
[1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:09.920]  Call C-SPAN.
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:10.920]  Call Talk Radio.
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:11.920]  Call Congress.
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:14.920]  It's been a long time since I did a lot of interviews,
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:16.920]  because I'm so busy running things here.
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:21.920]  But I've agreed to dozens and dozens of interviews in the next few days.
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:23.920]  Michael Savage this afternoon, a whole bunch of others.
[1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:27.920]  Gavin McGannis, the list goes on and on.
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:34.920]  And I'm doing it because I'm giving my full expenditure of will and energy to this thing.
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:38.920]  And now's the time for you to do that as well, because we're winning.
[1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:43.920]  And I was so happy Saturday and Sunday when I was covering those videos.
[1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:48.920]  I saw the love, the white folks, the blacks, the Hispanics, everybody together, the Asians.
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:51.920]  Love in America, love and freedom.
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.920]  People say, I was a Democrat, but I believe in free speech.
[1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:55.920]  And I don't believe in beating people up.
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:58.920]  And Trump's really a moderate and a populist and doing reasonable things.
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:01.920]  And they lied about him and I looked into it and it wasn't true.
[1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:03.920]  And I'm just not going to be part of this.
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:04.920]  That's beautiful.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:06.920]  That made me feel so good.
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:10.920]  I looked at some of the crew and I said, they're going to ban this.
[1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:15.920]  Because they could see a third of the people's shirts were in full wars.
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:19.920]  Another 20% or so were ball caps or stickers.
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:23.920]  And people say, man, don't you feel bad?
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:24.920]  They're coming after you.
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:25.920]  They're trying to shut you down.
[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:27.920]  I'm not trying to make money here.
[1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:31.920]  The New York Times kept saying when they were talking to me last week, over and over again, the money, the money.
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:32.920]  You want more money.
[1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:39.920]  And I said, you understand that most big talk show hosts would have a big private jet and mansions here and there and all this other stuff.
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.920]  You know, and drive like Ferraris.
[1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:51.920]  That stuff's all fine and dandy, you know, driving a $60,000 car or whatever, having a decent sports jacket or flying first class sometimes.
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:53.920]  But I like being with the people.
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:57.920]  I want to spend my money on building something, changing history.
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:00.920]  And my ancestors were like that as well.
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:08.920]  And so my mom's side of the family, direct line of the stock exchange, started the Texas Revolution, working directly under Jackson.
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:10.920]  Was the treasurer of the state.
[1:23:10.920 --> 1:23:11.920]  Raised Colonel Travis.
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:13.920]  I mean, that's just one little factoid.
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:15.920]  So I'm trying to not even try to measure up.
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:17.920]  I'm literally those people.
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.920]  I can feel them, the energy, what they want to build, what they want to do.
[1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:25.920]  And they're calling out, be strong, build the future.
[1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:27.920]  What matters is if humanity fails.
[1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:28.920]  That's death.
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:30.920]  That's spiritual death.
[1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:37.920]  In fact, in my own mind, I think if the planet dies and the human species fails, I believe we are put in the type of purgatory.
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:39.920]  No one else has ever written this or said this.
[1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:40.920]  They talked about purgatory.
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:44.920]  It's a thing you pay indulgence as the Catholics, you know, to get your family out of it.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.920]  I don't believe in that.
[1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:48.920]  Don't worry, the Pope abolished purgatory a few hundred years ago.
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:56.920]  I just instinctively know that, that if physically, if the species fails, then we do die.
[1:23:56.920 --> 1:23:57.920]  Because we live through the genetics.
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:00.920]  We live through the ongoing experiences.
[1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:02.920]  We have the race memories, but there's a consciousness.
[1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:05.920]  There's a higher order that's been basically proven above that.
[1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:07.920]  That's a spirit.
[1:24:07.920 --> 1:24:15.920]  But if it gets cut off, if the species gets totally destroyed, that is the type of spiritual death.
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:22.920]  And I'm not sure exactly how it works, but at a spiritual level, I know it.
[1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:24.920]  So we need everybody to survive here.
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:26.920]  We need to make the species continue.
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:29.920]  Black, white, you know, old, young, it doesn't matter.
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:31.920]  We've got to make it together.
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:33.920]  This is the big test.
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:35.920]  I'm sorry, I didn't do this.
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:37.920]  My cat is coming on to cover it all.
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:43.920]  But let me just get the big one with you right now.
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:44.920]  This is so big.
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:45.920]  We've been harping on this for a week.
[1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:46.920]  It's now all over the news.
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:47.920]  Thank God.
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:50.920]  There's Drudge Report linked to it yesterday.
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:55.920]  So now the Democrat senator involved comes out and goes, yeah, Jones is the rotting tip of the iceberg.
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:56.920]  Shut him down.
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:57.920]  Shut it all down.
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:24:59.920]  Shut them all down.
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:00.920]  Follow what we say.
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:01.920]  Do what we say.
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:03.920]  It's so criminal.
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:07.920]  It's so naked because they're losing.
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:17.920]  And so they've just built this whole thing on this house of sand by demonizing me so they can then bring it on to the next person, the next person, the next person.
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:22.920]  This is so clear and present danger, so diabolical.
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:23.920]  So let's read it.
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:26.920]  Dem senator demands more censorship of conservative media.
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:30.920]  These companies must do more than take down one website.
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:31.920]  That's right.
[1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:32.920]  Website.
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:38.920]  See, they want our website taken down and they're hitting all of our infrastructure right now.
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:47.920]  Democrat Senator Chris Murphy has called for social media websites to ban more conservative news outlets in the aftermath of info wars being purged from the internet.
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:48.920]  The stories on info wars.com.
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:49.920]  It's so critical.
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:26:02.920]  Yesterday, Apple Spotify, Facebook, Pinterest and YouTube all deleted info wars and it coordinated assault on free speech that sent shockwaves throughout the media and mainstream media is defending it saying why is he still on apps?
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:03.920]  Why is he still on Pinterest?
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:05.920]  Why is he still got credit cards?
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:06.920]  Why?
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:08.920]  We want him gone.
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:09.920]  Talk about dangerous.
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:15.920]  Murphy responded by celebrating the bans and calling for more right wing sites to be targeted.
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:17.920]  This is Chris Murphy.
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:22.920]  I don't know if Beijing or Beijing info wars is the tip.
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:34.920]  He has to admit it doesn't he info wars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses science like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:39.920]  What do Democrats do in their own WikiLeaks race war division demoralization?
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:50.920]  Everything he's saying is about him. It should read the Democratic Party is a tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook, YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:58.920]  The Democrats and people like me, Senator Chris Murphy are committed to destroying you and your family because of our sick corrupt evil and our solid to communist China.
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:26:59.920]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:02.920]  I was putting a little bit of truth bot on that.
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:08.920]  Putin told me to say that info wars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate.
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  And lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:18.920]  These companies must do more than take down one website.
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:21.920]  The survival of our democracy depends on it.
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:24.920]  What an Orwellian statement.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:26.920]  And then it goes on.
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:32.920]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover the internet reason.com.
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:44.920]  Senate Democrats can take a host of bonkers and authoritarian proposals. Really, it's not bonkers. It's working for regulating digital platforms reportedly as a way to get tough on Russian bots and fake news.
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.920]  They define their enemy as that. Where'd your dad go? Where'd mom go? He was fake news.
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:59.920]  To save America's trust in our institutions, democracy, free press and markets, they mean the whole crumbling, lying, chai con, globalist funded edifice, the robber baron edifice.
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:12.920]  It suggests we need unprecedented and undemocratic government intervention into online press and markets including comprehensive GDPR like data protection legislation to be selectively enforced.
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:16.920]  Of the sort enacted in the EU. That's all just selectively enforced.
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:21.920]  Titled potential policy proposals for regulation of social media and technology firms.
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:30.920]  The draft policy paper penned by Senator Mark Warner and leaked by an unknown source in Axios. The paper starts out by noting that the Russians have long, and this goes on from there.
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:38.920]  Yes, the Russians, they're the ones banning our press. They're the ones trying to bankrupt the economy to teach those dirty it. No, no, that's HBO and Bill Maher.

[1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:42.920]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be

[1:33:22.920 --> 1:33:37.920]  Thanks to the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law. Curfew is now in place. Return to your homes. Any congregating with two or more people outside of your homes will result in you being arrested on site.
[1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:57.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's the Alex Jones Show. All right, every 30 minutes we're learning we've been banned off of our WebChimp email we've been using for a decade. Make sure we follow all the rules on that.
[1:33:57.920 --> 1:34:13.920]  SproutSocial that we've been using since 2012 for all of our social media to coordinate that. They just banned us 10 minutes ago. It's all pouring in right now in a military globalist test.
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:29.920]  ChaiCom coordinated. It's all coming out in the news. Allied with the Democrats and Silicon Valley, even Politico admit Silicon Valley is run by the Chinese communists. They're making their move. I mean, iPhones won't send out Taiwanese emojis until there was a big stink.
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:40.920]  China's in the news threatening right now to take over Apple because it's state run and we get to trade war with them. It's all unfolding.
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:56.920]  And in the middle of this, you've got the Democrats on CNN and MSNBC whining and bitching and complaining over and over again saying Trump says we're the enemy of the people. He's trying to shut us down. He's hurting us.
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:08.920]  He's not calling for shutting you down. He's exposing you and your incredible lies and your leakers trying to violate national security and sabotage the country.
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:17.920]  And then meanwhile, CNN's everywhere saying he hadn't been taken off iPhone, Android apps and CNN is admittedly contacting every service we might be on.
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:33.920]  So is the Huffington Post. So is Buzzfeed. They brag about it. That they are reaching out to every service we've got like Nazis knocking the windows out of Jewish businesses in 1935 to shut us down and put us in a ghetto.
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:40.920]  They kicked me even though I never really signed myself up. I don't know who did it. Well, the salesman did like 15 years ago to LinkedIn.
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:48.920]  I'm banned off LinkedIn. So if I ever they were able to bankrupt me and I tried to get a job at Baskin Robbins or at McDonald's, I couldn't.
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:53.920]  I mean, we laugh at this, but these people are authoritarian.
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:36:03.920]  Instagram has let us up there for now, but Pinterest took us down and they're all attacking Twitter. Why are you on Twitter? Why are you on Twitter?
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:09.920]  Because Congress showed a little interest in the shadow betting of Twitter. So Twitter knows it's being looked at.
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.920]  Congress couldn't believe the last few hearings that they didn't care about Google or Apple or any of it. So that was a green light.
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:23.920]  So Trump needs to take antitrust action on all of this now. But just think about that hypocrisy.
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:38.920]  I saw an article on CNN reportedly in 2012, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, asked someone working there to delete two articles that were unfavorable about one of his real estate partners.
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:44.920]  Well, how do you even know that's true from some deranged leftist with the Trump Arrangement Center? But how do you know the articles weren't accurate?
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:48.920]  How do you know who knows? He was the owner of the New York Observer.
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:58.920]  And deleting two articles, CNN says is a huge journalistic scandal because those were critical of somebody.
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:03.920]  They just got 35,000 of our videos deleted, critical of CNN and others.
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:10.920]  So it's a big story that, oh my God, six years ago, maybe Kushner may have deleted something with no proof.
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:18.920]  And it says in the article, after we saw Trump attack the free press and realized he was a Nazi, I, as a developer, had to go public and fight him.
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:25.920]  Because what we do, it's so bad. These people are amazing. They'll sit there on the same segment going,
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:34.920]  shut Alex Jones down, he's hate, he's evil, indoctrinating their viewers into upside-down logic, dislodgic, discordial, mental illness.
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:41.920]  And then next, did you see Trump called us the enemy and said we lie? That's fake news.
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:44.920]  Calling us fake news is violent. He's fake news. He's a traitor.
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:52.920]  So Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, who helped write the big report, he quarterbacked that, was gotten to the president on a web censorship and more,
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:38:01.920]  all hell's breaking loose. And there's a big backlash, but not big enough because they're trying to economically de-platform me from everything.
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:07.920]  They're trying it with the NRA as well. This is totally criminal. You run real.video that carries a lot of our stuff.
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:13.920]  We're favorably uploading there. That's really taking off and exploding. And that's the answer is an exodus from these guys.
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:24.920]  But Apple and CNN, MSNBC, these media outlets are all lobbying other outlets and other services to blacklist this as well in a test.
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:32.920]  And I think Mike, the big news is, I want to get your breakdown on this in the next segment, is to shut everybody down ahead of the midterm.
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:39.920]  Something big's coming. They want to be able to blacklist whole groups where people just hear blacklist, blacklist, everybody's de-platform ahead of something big.
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:45.920]  They don't want us to be able to communicate when they put their people in the streets, when they make their Civil War move they've been talking about.
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:52.920]  I mean, this is it. We've been talking about it for months. We predicted this was happening. Everybody heard it and saw it. This is it, I think, Mike.
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:59.920]  Well, this is modeled after the Communist China. You nailed it in yesterday's broadcast and today's broadcast. This is a blueprint.
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:09.920]  And first, they did this in China. For example, in China, you can't see my website. You can't see your website, you know, because we talk about liberty and freedom or Falun Gong or Tiananmen Square or whatever.
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:20.920]  So that model is now being applied in the United States. And remember, it was a coordinated multi-platform collusion attack on you over the last 36 hours.
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:33.920]  This was coordinated. This is racketeering. That's why I said in my video that I'm calling for a RICO Act investigation and potential prosecution of these tech giants for racketeering.
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:42.920]  This is a racket. It violates your constitutionally protected rights. It violates your human rights. This is an assault on the civil rights of all Americans.
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:54.920]  And I believe that what we need today is a kind of like a civil rights uprising, a peaceful one that calls for basic human dignity to be respected, that the freedom of speech is a basic human right.
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:40:00.920]  Even in the spirit of the 1960s, civil rights uprising by African Americans and Martin Luther King, Jr.
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:09.920]  Today, this censorship, this has become the civil rights issue of our time. And keep in mind, too, Alex, that they have never, not yet to this moment,
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:19.920]  have they told you why exactly you were banned? They can't cite the actual videos, the actual snippets. They can't say who made the decision.
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.920]  They can't present evidence against you, and they won't allow you to present any evidence in your defense.
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:31.920]  And what they've done through CNN and other fake news media outlets is spread hatred about Alex Jones.
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:39.920]  And then this hatred is invoked by MailChimp and others to say, well, we're going to de-platform Alex Jones because we just hate Alex Jones.
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:47.920]  And then they say that they're banning you because you're spreading hate while they're actually the ones engaged in the hatred and the censorship.
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:52.920]  And by allowing the show people today, I'm glad you mentioned the emails we sent out, the last ones to our listeners.
[1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:57.920]  We're going to get a new system, obviously. It was all like, hey, we're being censored. Come hear the love.
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:03.920]  Black, white, old, young, whatever, gay, straight, come here. We just love America and free market.
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:09.920]  We want to stop the chai-coms that kill Buddhists and Christians and everybody for no reason. They're the ones.
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:15.920]  And now it's in the news today that China is threatening to take over Apple, which has moved there if Trump doesn't back down.
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:23.920]  That's how crazy this has gotten that we're forcing them. I told my dad a few weeks ago, privately, he said, son, I know what you're saying is legal and lawful and I agree with you,
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:29.920]  but you're really escalating things. And I said, I've got to do it for the country and the kids. And he said, let me guess, you're trying to not get yourself banned,
[1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:34.920]  but pushing it because you know they're already going to do it, but you want to force the issue now instead of later. And I said, exactly.
[1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:43.920]  So that's what I've done on purpose. It's not these things that violated the rules. I just escalated it to force them out in the open and, you know,
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:51.920]  ran some psyops on them from behind the scenes when they sent an intelligence operative in here. And so they took the bait, but now it's up to the people.
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:57.920]  Because you understand this. This isn't a war simply on Alex Jones or Infowars or Paul Jones.
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:41:58.920]  I'm just the first domino.
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:07.920]  That's right. This is the tech giants have declared war on human freedom. This is a war on humanity and it will impact everyone.
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:16.920]  And remember when the left used to be pro free speech? Remember that? It wasn't that long ago. And now they are celebrating the authoritarian censorship,
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:24.920]  not realizing that that weaponization of technology could one day very easily be turned against them to silence minority voices,
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:30.920]  to silence anyone that is on the enemy's list of the tech giants, whoever is in control at that time.
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:34.920]  It's a dangerous precedent and they've declared war on humanity.
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:38.920]  That's right. What the globalists really believe is they're creating a replicant stock.
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:41.920]  In the future, they're going to breed everybody and just have humans for certain jobs.
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:46.920]  Those were good biological androids in their view, but they wanted to come from natural stock.
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:49.920]  So that's what they're basically doing. And that's the view of what we are.
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:54.920]  And that's why their robots can't replace us. They see us as the ultimate android. We'll be back.
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:06.920]  Years ago, Infowars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.

[1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:52.920]  but other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:47:21.920]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:25.920]  We'll take you live for the battle for free speech.
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:36.920]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:41.920]  The battle is raging for the future of western civilization and basic free speech.
[1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:46.920]  We're on the front lines at the core of the main fight. Would you like to know more?
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:53.920]  Keep tuning in and please spread the live links to others.
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:55.920]  Go back to Mike Adams here in a second.
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:57.920]  We'll be with us five minutes to the next hour.
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:01.920]  Then I have several other guests joining us, the head of GABS coming on about all the censorship that's happening there.
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:08.920]  Andrew Torba and Roger Stones got big breaking news about who they're deposing and what's happening in the whole Russiagate situation.
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:15.920]  But when I had the New York Times talk to me Friday, they were stalking my family custody situation.
[1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:21.920]  And I continued to have my kids and beat the fake filings, no coverage.
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:26.920]  And when I said that I was waving the fees, even though the Sandy Hook families are being funded to sue me,
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:29.920]  just take the high road, they said that I was not waving the fees and suing them.
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:33.920]  Just lies, lies, lies is what these folks do.
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:39.920]  And they've already been caught lying so much, they've just escalated the lying because they're not going to give up.
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:43.920]  That said, there's something that can stand in the way of what they're doing and something they hate.
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.920]  And so they're trying to deplatform us, trying to stop us from emailing, kicking us off all these systems now,
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:55.920]  sprout social, not letting us use that even though we've been paying to use the service for six years.
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:59.920]  And of course, I am going to have to sue somebody just so when the next person does this deplatforming,
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:03.920]  like I'm trying to buy a bus ticket, they go, sorry, you're Alex Jones.
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:09.920]  Or I'm trying to buy bread, store, sorry, you're Alex Jones, or I'm trying to, that's what this is now reached.
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:16.920]  So it's come down to that. So we're going to have to take action very, very soon.
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:23.920]  And I haven't decided who we're going to have to litigate against right now, but it's got to be done because it's got out of control.
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:26.920]  But the biggest thing you can do is understand we're fighting for all your rights.
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:30.920]  And we're trying to take the country back, it's an information war and people thought it'd be easy.
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:33.920]  It's easy if people take action, it's not easy if people fall back to sleep.
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.920]  I know you're not asleep, but a lot of you are tuning in for the first time to hear, what is it that's so horrible this guy says?
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:44.920]  Why are they so scared of him? The globalists were selling the country out, the chai comms are involved.
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:50.920]  It's all coming out now. They know that if people listen to the White House lesson, it's over for them.
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:52.920]  They're trying to steal the midterms right now.
[1:49:52.920 --> 1:50:01.920]  So the biggest thing you can do is commit to get great products we have, all of them are game changing and support the broadcast.
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:09.920]  infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com. We're under attack. Our products are great.
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:12.920]  Fish oil, our clean, high quality fish oil, highest quality out there.
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:17.920]  Wild harvest is in the north and we've got the krill oil and we've got honor roll for kids.
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:20.920]  It's a smaller caplet, but the type of oil is just for the brain mainly,
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:23.920]  where the regular fish oil is good for the brain and the heart and the rest of the body.
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:28.920]  It's all there. 40% off when you get them together, 25% off when you get them individually.
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:32.920]  They're at two months supply, highest quality. You're not going to find a better deal.
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:35.920]  Right to use, sign up for auto ship for stuff you want to reorder.
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:38.920]  Additional 10% off for shipping or $5 or more.
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:41.920]  And it's you funding us that angers them. The idea of a new economy.
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:43.920]  The idea of something that isn't a monopoly.
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:47.920]  So please, for the First Amendment and your own health and your own future,
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:51.920]  check out infowarsstore.com and get some vitamin B12, secret 12.
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:55.920]  Get some vitamin D3. Get some high quality coffee.
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:59.920]  The Wake of America coffee from Chiapas is so high quality.
[1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:02.920]  Whatever the product is, get a t-shirt.
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:08.920]  Go look at all the George Washington in his prime with a musket and a hatchet.
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:11.920]  Great shirt. Go get the I am the resistance shirt.
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:15.920]  Established 1776. All these shirts are great.
[1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:19.920]  Re-elect 45. That's how you fund the operation and how you spread the word
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:24.920]  and how you'll meet like-minded people, but even bigger than that.
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:29.920]  It takes care of you and your family and it helps you stand in the way of these globalists.
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:32.920]  So please think about infoworks today financially.
[1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:37.920]  We have a lot of funding coming yesterday, but that's kind of the initial phase of being blown up.
[1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:41.920]  There's a lot of, like at the end of the movie, the thing, the remake in the 80s,
[1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:45.920]  and they're like, yeah, we're not dead yet. Fire's got the temperature of the camp up.
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:48.920]  We're going to be frozen solid in about two hours.
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:53.920]  Again, for my ego, I'm not worried about it. I asked for this. I picked this fight.
[1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:57.920]  I did this. It's just that I wanted them to jump the shark.
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:02.920]  So I kind of thumped them in the nose a little bit, not really on air, but behind the scenes.
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:06.920]  And there is some internal stuff about the Washington Post and New York Times coming out,
[1:52:06.920 --> 1:52:10.920]  but I really, really pulled a number on them.
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:13.920]  And so they are flipping out right now.
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:16.920]  And we've got a bunch of stuff to really get the beehive going because I believe in you.
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:19.920]  I believe there are attempts at censorship and all this are going to blow up on their face,
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:24.920]  but now when people are listening and wondering why, say, hey, out all these voices,
[1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:30.920]  infowars.com forward slash show. No matter how they're censoring us, infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:33.920]  We're always going to have ways right there until God knows what.
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:38.920]  But getting back to that, Mike, I want to bring this up now in the next segment, how we counter it.
[1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:41.920]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, a great patriot at the tip of the spear fighting this.
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:45.920]  He's launched his real video site that's got millions and millions of views a day now,
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:47.920]  doing a great job to counter all this. He saw it coming.
[1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:50.920]  We'll talk about that some too, but just briefly.
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:54.920]  Stelter and everybody, the talking point is Trump's going to get us killed when they're the ones calling for violence.
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:59.920]  And now they're censoring us and now they, I think they have their own bots out making threats against themselves.
[1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:03.920]  There could be a false flag against the media in response to my censorship,
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:05.920]  to legitimize censorship and go after Trump.
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:10.920]  I'm really concerned. So there's an article by Kit Daniels on infowars.com,
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:14.920]  MSM fueling Nazi style censorship to trigger violence.
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:20.920]  Don't take debate. Just say no to violence. Censorship is an act of desperation by those who are already losing.
[1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:24.920]  So I see these polls out. Forty-something percent of Republicans want to just shut down the mainstream media.
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:31.920]  Well, just shut off the chai-com funding. Just indict them for the racketeering and the intimidation of other businesses.
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:34.920]  Don't shut them down because their media just indict their asses.
[1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:38.920]  And that'll turn around things real quickly. Mike Adams.
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:44.920]  Well, look, it strikes me that this is not just an information war against you,
[1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:47.920]  but also an economic war. There's economic sabotage.
[1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:50.920]  I mean, you think about CNN calling for you to be de-platformed.
[1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:55.920]  It's a form of economic sabotage. This is like they're targeting your infrastructure
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:02.920]  in the same way that an invading military force would target bridges and target roads and target telecommunications.
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:09.920]  They're targeting your mail chimp, your mail delivery. They're targeting your store products they targeted last year.
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:11.920]  They're targeting your ability to speak.
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:15.920]  And even think about right now the NRA is suing the state of New York
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:19.920]  over the fact that the financial institutions were ordered by the governor of New York
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:25.920]  to deny services to the NRA, insurance services and basic financial services.
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:30.920]  The truth is none of us can exist in a society if we don't have access to basic infrastructure.
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:34.920]  I mean, what's next? Is your electric company going to come to you and say,
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:38.920]  well, we don't want our electricity to be used to spread hate, right?
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:41.920]  And then they got to cut off your electricity. They got to cut off your water.
[1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:44.920]  They got to cut off your bandwidth. You know, this has got to stop.
[1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:50.920]  We need legislation right now and maybe backed by executive orders in the meantime
[1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:58.920]  that protects our right to exist in a tech society and to communicate in a tech society.
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:02.920]  And that's what they're trying to do is destroy your very existence.
[1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:04.920]  They're trying to memory-hole your very existence.
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:08.920]  This is total siege taking what they think is one of the strongest, most versatile groups as a beta test
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:11.920]  and then using it against everybody else, which the Democrats admit.
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:14.920]  And quite frankly, if Trump and the Republicans don't move against this,
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:19.920]  they're mentally deficient. They've got serious mental retardation problems.
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:23.920]  I don't mean that meanly. I mean, I understand that they're being told by a bunch of yes men.
[1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:26.920]  Everything's okay and they're out giving speeches, but this is outrageous.
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.920]  This is the big campaign issue. This is campaign meddling. This is classic rackets.
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:36.920]  This is classic curtailing. This is classic Nazi gulag. This is it.
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:38.920]  And it's a blueprint from China.
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:42.920]  Remember the social scoring system where in China, you can't ride public transportation.
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:48.920]  You can't go to a college. You can't get a loan if you don't fit the social score
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:50.920]  that's put down on you by the government.
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:55.920]  And that score requires what? Absolute obedience to the narratives of the government.
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:59.920]  That's exactly what Facebook is doing today. YouTube, Google, all of them.
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:04.920]  They're saying that if you go outside the bounds of the official approved narrative,
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:10.920]  you effectively have a low social score. You will now be denied access to basic services.
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:13.920]  And I just saw the headline a few months ago where CNN said,
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:18.920]  oh, look, China just didn't let 11 million people fly on flights, 11 million flights.
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:22.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has a name. It's called the mark of the beast.
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:24.920]  It's actually happening.
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:25.920]  Yeah. I mean, what's the next?
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:30.920]  Is CNN going to call for your driver's license to be revoked in Texas so that you can't drive
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:33.920]  because you might commit hate on the roads?
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:38.920]  I mean, and besides, they still have not pointed out what you did wrong in any of your videos
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:41.920]  or any of your articles. They can't point to it.
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:44.920]  And besides, CNN deliberately fakes the news.
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:51.920]  They're constantly faking or twisting or distorting or editing out things they don't want you to see.
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:54.920]  CNN is legitimately fake news.
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:58.920]  And yet they claim that only they alone have a First Amendment right,
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:00.920]  but you don't have a First Amendment right, Alex.
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:02.920]  And that means that none of us do.
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:04.920]  That's the thing. You're the canary in the coal mine.
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:06.920]  I agree. So let me ask you this question.
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:09.920]  When you go to break here, start answering now if you can.
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:12.920]  And we'll talk about what do we do to stop this, but next hour is critical.
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:15.920]  They're making their move clearly against Trump in America right now.
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:18.920]  I mean, this is serious.
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:23.920]  Well, yeah, something big is coming up and they want you silenced so that you can't react to it.
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:26.920]  And they want the beta test where they can then go,
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:29.920]  and now here's the new guy to ban everybody wolf packs them.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:31.920]  And then here's the new guy just like Nazi Germany.
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:33.920]  They'd say brown shirts, brown shirts. Get them.
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:36.920]  They'd humanize you first and then the D platform you second.
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:39.920]  And only a few people like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul get this.
[1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:51.920]  And I got to say, Trump, I'm very proud of him in many ways, but I'm getting disappointed in some.
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:53.920]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen,

[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:14.920]  All right, Mike Adams with us under two segments.
[2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:17.920]  We've got the head of gab right in front of the start and next segment.
[2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:19.920]  I've got to say, Breitbart's been getting it too.
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:21.920]  We appreciate Breitbart being pro-freedom of speech
[2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:23.920]  and not wanting to slit their own throats.
[2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:26.920]  Zero transparency, six questions that tech giants refuse to answer
[2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:29.920]  about the InfoWars ban.
[2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:32.920]  But look, here's the deal.
[2:00:32.920 --> 2:00:35.920]  A lot of people are sociopaths and they're all about themselves,
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:37.920]  so they think, why are you making the sacrifice?
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:38.920]  How are you doing?
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:40.920]  I mean, I'm worried about the country.
[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:41.920]  I'm doing great.
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:43.920]  I've been trying to get them to, you know,
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:45.920]  come out in the open and admit their plans.
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:47.920]  And now we've got the Democrats saying they want to censor all conservatives.
[2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:49.920]  They want draconian control.
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:50.920]  This is outrageous.
[2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:52.920]  But Mike Adams of naturalnews.com,
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:00:55.920]  Trump's done great about saying mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:00:56.920]  They're globalists.
[2:00:56.920 --> 2:00:58.920]  They're workers with foreign powers.
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:01.920]  But the fact that he's gotten your report,
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:05.920]  I know I was talking to some folks at the campaign this morning
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:07.920]  and China's openly setting up, you know,
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:10.920]  censorship systems with Google, Apple's moved there.
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:13.920]  Dianne Feinstein has been caught being a chai-com agent.
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.920]  This is the big issue.
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:16.920]  They're moving against this.
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:18.920]  Trump needs to act now.
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:23.920]  Instead, they've had hearings where the Republicans literally act like they got 70 IQs.
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:27.920]  Well, the problem right now is that the tech giants lobbied for a law
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  known as the CDA, the Communications Decency Act,
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:34.920]  specifically Section 230 many, many years ago.
[2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:37.920]  And that law protected them from, you know,
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:39.920]  any kind of liability related to free speech.
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:41.920]  There are some aspects of that law that are good,
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  but it also allows them to engage in discriminatory censorship
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:46.920]  against people for political reasons.
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:48.920]  Yeah, we need amendments to that law right now
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:49.920]  in an inter-couple of rights.
[2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:50.920]  That's right. Exactly.
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:52.920]  This has to be legislatively attacked
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:55.920]  or attacked from a regulatory point of view.
[2:01:55.920 --> 2:01:57.920]  You know, I've mentioned RICO Act violations.
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:01.920]  Well, how about the Protect the 2018 Right to Free Speech Emergency Act
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:03.920]  since top-censoring conservative voices?
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:04.920]  Exactly.
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:07.920]  Or the Federal Trade Commission could go after Facebook right now
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:11.920]  for monopoly behavior or the FEC for election fraud
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:13.920]  or attempts to steal the upcoming midterm elections.
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:15.920]  There are a number of regulatory agencies
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:17.920]  that could take action right now if they wanted to.
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:21.920]  Now, Trump issued an executive order to protect, say,
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:23.920]  something like an internet bill of rights for the people.
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:26.920]  Sadly, a lot of lower court judges,
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.920]  they believe they have judicial power to override the president,
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:31.920]  even though constitutionally they don't,
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:32.920]  but they try to assert that,
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.920]  and so far they've been successful in doing that.
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:37.920]  And ultimately, by the way, Alex, strategically,
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:41.920]  this comes down to getting Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:44.920]  so that whatever actions escalate to the high court
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:49.920]  are heard by Kavanaugh and others, Gorsuch and others,
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:52.920]  so that we have a chance to reassert the First Amendment
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:57.920]  across not just, you know, sidewalks and public speech,
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  but online speech.
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:00.920]  That's where this has to go, Alex.
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:03.920]  And I think now, because of you and what's happened to you,
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:05.920]  there's a wake-up call to everyone,
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:07.920]  and I think there's a rush now for people to say,
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:09.920]  wait a second, if they can ban Alex Jones,
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:12.920]  I mean, I've heard a lot of people say they don't agree with you
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:14.920]  on everything, but if they can ban Alex Jones,
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:18.920]  they could ban us, or him, or her, or anyone,
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:19.920]  and that's for sure.
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:20.920]  Well, sure, what they mean is,
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:23.920]  I don't agree with the straw man that mainstream media put out.
[2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:25.920]  I mean, seeing him as the great stuff of me,
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:28.920]  there were like two-second clips edited together last night.
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:29.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:32.920]  I mean, the portrayal of you in the media is utterly false,
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:34.920]  and completely distorted.
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:37.920]  So people don't even really know what you stand for.
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:40.920]  I put out a tweet today that said, hey, reminding everybody,
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  Alex Jones is pro-organic food.
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:43.920]  He's against pesticides.
[2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:45.920]  He's against herbicides.
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:47.920]  He's against the toxic GMOs.
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:50.920]  Alex Jones is in favor of homeschooling, preparedness,
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:51.920]  home gardening.
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:55.920]  All these issues that people on the left claim to care about,
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:03:57.920]  and no one's ever heard that about you.
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:00.920]  So I'm just trying to remind people what you actually stand for.
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:03.920]  Well, I appreciate you defending me, but I mean, look,
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:05.920]  I've tried to defend other people that have been under attack,
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:06.920]  and there wasn't that much interest.
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  I guess they were smaller.
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:09.920]  Now, this is really big.
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:12.920]  I mean, I think they have really gone too far here,
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:14.920]  but at the same time, I think they know they've gone too far.
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:17.920]  They're planning something really, really big, Mike,
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:19.920]  and I think it's about to happen.
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:22.920]  Yeah, clearly, something very, very soon.
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:23.920]  I agree.
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  I've warned about it.
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:25.920]  You've warned about it.
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:27.920]  And by the way, you and I both warned about this censorship coming,
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:31.920]  and that's why we built alternative platforms and took measures.
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:33.920]  We saw this.
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:34.920]  Absolutely.
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:36.920]  But who knew we'd be right in the middle of it?
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:38.920]  Do another segment with us on how we counter this
[2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:40.920]  and what President Trump needs to do.
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:43.920]  And listen, Trump's great, folks, but on a lot of issues.
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:45.920]  But this is the big issue.
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:48.920]  As big as the border, this is absolutely paramount.
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:50.920]  This is how they plan to shut him up
[2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:52.920]  and stop this pro-America agenda.
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:53.920]  We've got to defeat it.
[2:04:53.920 --> 2:04:56.920]  Fuelling your body is hard work.
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:00.920]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack

[2:06:20.920 --> 2:06:34.920]  I think they are watching me.
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:36.920]  Having a little bit of fun with it.
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:38.920]  Look at the New York Times.
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:40.920]  There are literally hundreds and hundreds of news articles
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:41.920]  an hour coming out.
[2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:43.920]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:44.920]  It's unbelievable.
[2:06:44.920 --> 2:06:46.920]  And all the articles are written the same.
[2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:48.920]  They put the script out.
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:51.920]  So we're battling this evil, horrible person.
[2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:52.920]  No one buys white supremacy anymore,
[2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:55.920]  so they say bully this and that.
[2:06:55.920 --> 2:06:57.920]  And then they go from there and they say,
[2:06:57.920 --> 2:06:59.920]  but the problem is there's thousands of other sites
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:00.920]  and people who've got a ban.
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:01.920]  And Fox News is bad.
[2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:02.920]  And it's all bad.
[2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:06.920]  Ban it, ban it, ban it.
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:08.920]  Who would put up with this?
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:12.920]  And then you've got the calls by Democrat senators
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:15.920]  and leaked memos where they want to ban even Fox News.
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:19.920]  And I'm telling you, folks, the Democrats early on
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:22.920]  appointed a bunch of people, these special committees
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:24.920]  that Obama signed executive orders for,
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:28.920]  to federalize elections and say that everything was Russian fraud.
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:30.920]  And then overturn the 2016 election at some point
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:32.920]  and then have a new federalization of elections
[2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:37.920]  where you'll never have a real two-party system again.
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:40.920]  And we've got Andrew Torba of gab.ai
[2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:42.920]  that Google and others have tried to shut down
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:45.920]  the open and free independent social media system.
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:46.920]  He's joining us.
[2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:47.920]  And Mike Adams is riding shotgun.
[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:49.920]  I wanted to finish up with you, Mike.
[2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:51.920]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:55.920]  They now admit they want to censor even Fox News.
[2:07:55.920 --> 2:07:57.920]  They want to take over because they know the planet's
[2:07:57.920 --> 2:07:59.920]  realigned against collectivism and globalism
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:01.920]  and leftist garbage.
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:05.920]  You've got real.video and yourself doing your own platform.
[2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:08.920]  But now they're saying, hey, we're going to go after the bandwidth,
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:11.920]  the servers, the hubs, the DNS, the credit cards,
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:12.920]  everything.
[2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:13.920]  I mean, it's here.
[2:08:13.920 --> 2:08:17.920]  This is the assault on free speech by the big tech firms
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:20.920]  in the deep state from only in control of a small percentage
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:21.920]  of the government now.
[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:24.920]  And I just think he has to move against this organized rebellion,
[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:26.920]  this mutiny that we see.
[2:08:26.920 --> 2:08:29.920]  I think this is a desperation act by big tech and the Democrats.
[2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:32.920]  But if we don't rise to the occasion, they could win.
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:33.920]  Mike, what do you think?
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:34.920]  Right.
[2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:38.920]  Even this morning, my staff at real.video received an email
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:41.920]  that claimed to be from the police of the city of Berkeley.
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:46.920]  And this email said that we have to take down all Alex Jones videos
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:48.920]  because of violations of the DMG.
[2:08:48.920 --> 2:08:49.920]  See, it's all out of Berkeley.
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:50.920]  That's the real capital.
[2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:51.920]  That's right.
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:53.920]  Now they didn't cite any video, nothing.
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:08:56.920]  So of course, we had a good laugh about that email.
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:08:57.920]  And it could have been a hoax.
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:08:58.920]  I don't know.
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:00.920]  But that's just what they're doing to everybody.
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:02.920]  It's a big intimidation operation.
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:03.920]  Exactly.
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:06.920]  And, you know, look, real.video now has a couple of hundred
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:10.920]  infowars videos and there are more uploaded every hour.
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  They're not going to be able to voluntarily take those down
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:19.920]  because we've got a thousand of our highest videos that we're
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  now going to upload there.
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:22.920]  It was a 35,000.
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:23.920]  They blew away.
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:24.920]  We're ready to handle it.
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:28.920]  But the thing is, as you mentioned, if our bandwidth provider
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:32.920]  bans us, if the components that we use, we use off the shelf
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:35.920]  different components, we rely on different components to do the
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:38.920]  server hosting and the video streaming, many other companies
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:43.920]  involved in those components, if they choose to try to violate
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:46.920]  their terms of service and cut us off, we'll have to seek
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:47.920]  alternatives.
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:49.920]  It's an all out war.
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:50.920]  It's a financial war.
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:51.920]  It's an infrastructure war.
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:54.920]  It's a communications war to say you don't even have the right
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:55.920]  to speak.
[2:09:55.920 --> 2:09:59.920]  And we're supposed to have the same protections that YouTube
[2:09:59.920 --> 2:10:00.920]  has.
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:03.920]  But of course, it will be selectively, it will be targeted
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:06.920]  because we're hosting InfoWars videos now, you see.
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:09.920]  So it's all, it's a double standard.
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:13.920]  You don't have free speech, but the New York Times can hire a
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:17.920]  bigoted, racist, anti-white person.
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:19.920]  And they say, well, that's not racism.
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:20.920]  That's not hate.
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:24.920]  But somehow when you say that babies are born as either a boy
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:29.920]  or a girl and not something in between, then, oh, all of a sudden
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:30.920]  you're attacking transgenders.
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:32.920]  That's hate speech.
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  But when a New York Times staffer says kill white people,
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:37.920]  somehow that's not hate speech.
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:39.920]  So it's gone off the rails, Alex.
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:41.920]  It's completely insane.
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:46.920]  And there are wars against you that I can't even mention.
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:48.920]  Crap behind the scenes stuff going on.
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:51.920]  I mean, I've had conversations with you off the air that I won't
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:53.920]  repeat here of stuff that they tried to, they tried to get me
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:55.920]  to do, you know, against you years ago.
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:56.920]  And I refuse.
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:10:58.920]  And that's when Google banned my website.
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:01.920]  So there's stuff, the war against you is so coordinated.
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:02.920]  It is so criminal.
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.920]  It's so fraudulent.
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:06.920]  And that's why I'm here standing up for your right to speak
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:08.920]  as well as everybody else's.
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:10.920]  Look at the latest New York Times article.
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  A better way to ban Alex Jones.
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:14.920]  Well, they've gone right to it.
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:19.920]  And of course, out of the deep south, try to shut down the New York Times.
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:20.920]  They did it with lawsuits.
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  We had New York Times versus Sullivan.
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:25.920]  The New York Times is now owned by a Mexican kingpin with Chinese
[2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:28.920]  connections is trying to overthrow the First Amendment.
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:31.920]  What a sickening situation for the great lady.
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:34.920]  And where this goes, by the way, I was watching a video of
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:37.920]  Stefan Malano just this morning.
[2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:41.920]  And where this goes, as he said, is you can't even have a conversation
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:44.920]  now with people on the left.
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:45.920]  There's no rationality.
[2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:46.920]  Oh, yeah, that's the news.
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:49.920]  They're saying de-platform anyone interviewing me.
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:54.920]  Now Google's talking about we just may not let Alex Jones on, period.
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:57.920]  Like this is true beyond even a science fiction book.
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:02.920]  Yeah, it's dystopian, but it's also going to lead to probably
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:03.920]  violence by the left.
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:06.920]  I mean, look at the violence that happened in the three cities
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  over the weekend, and yet nobody in the mainstream media reported
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  any of the left-wing anti-fa violence.
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.920]  They pretended that it didn't happen.
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:15.920]  It's incredible.
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:18.920]  I mean, we're living in almost like an alternate reality.
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:19.920]  It is.
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:20.920]  Stay there.
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:21.920]  Stay there.
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:22.920]  Stay there.
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:23.920]  Right there.
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:25.920]  We've got a final comment from you in a moment.
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:28.920]  I'm going to go through Torba joining us down through the next segment.
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:29.920]  Andrewheadsupgab.ai.
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:31.920]  He's had them trying to shut him down.
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:34.920]  They're not just their own companies that operate as utilities.
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:36.920]  They, and then they have double standards.
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:37.920]  They've been trying to shut you down.
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:41.920]  What would you call Andrew this point in time in history we've now reached?
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:43.920]  Alex, it's a really scary point in time history.
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  And I think Matt Drudge a few years ago with that classic interview with you nailed it.
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  We need to stop playing on the left's playgrounds because this is what's going to happen.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:56.920]  They're going to unperson us.
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:00.420]  We need to start building like myself and like Mike are doing and like you're doing with
[2:13:00.420 --> 2:13:01.920]  Info Wars and have been for years.
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:03.920]  We need to build our own platforms.
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:08.920]  The problem is, is that when we do that, as Mike mentioned, we rely on third party payment
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:09.920]  processors.
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:11.920]  We rely on third party hosts.
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:16.920]  And if any of those wheels in the machine decide to pull out the rug from under us,
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:17.920]  what are we going to do?
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:18.920]  We have to build our own.
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:21.920]  We're going to have to rebuild the internet from the ground up here just to be able to
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:22.920]  speak our minds.
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:25.920]  It's insanity.
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:29.920]  One thing's for sure, they're making their move now, aren't they?
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:30.920]  Absolutely.
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:32.920]  They and you are just the start.
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:35.920]  You know, we've been talking about this for over two years now.
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:40.920]  We've been building Gab as a alternative for people to come and speak freely.
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:42.920]  We've said everybody's welcome.
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:45.920]  They tried to malign us and call us a Nazi social network.
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:50.920]  Both Apple and Google have not allowed us to participate in their app stores and they
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:51.920]  have a duopoly.
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:56.920]  There is no free market when it comes to mobile app hardware, mobile app distribution.
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:59.920]  Apple and Google are 98% of the market shares.
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.920]  So that is not a free market when they can not only decide who wins and loses, but also
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:06.920]  who can play the game.
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:08.920]  It's really disgusting and we need to keep building.
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:12.920]  We need to keep fighting back and stop playing on their playgrounds.
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:14.920]  You're absolutely right.
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:18.920]  I've got a new sickening article by Elizabeth Williamson, who's here since she's doing a
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:21.920]  profile of me working with this other Pulitzer Prize winner.
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:25.920]  That's giving peace prizes to Barack Obama that launched all the wars.
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:31.920]  So it would be like being proud of an Iron Cross Hitler gave you.
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:33.920]  But then she goes into how I just want money.
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  I'm telling listeners, oh, my products support me.
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:39.920]  Well, you only had 20 suits against me that Soros is funding.
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:43.920]  You're only trying to completely and absolutely shut me down.
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:47.920]  And you know, you've only got all this going on and we're trying to build our own infrastructure.
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:51.920]  How dare us not be financed by Carlos Slim, the big kingpin.
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:54.920]  We're going to come back to you in just a moment, Andrew Torbring, at your take on this,
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:57.920]  but in closing Mike Adams, it's just sick how these people operate.
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:14:59.920]  Sorry, I'm not Carlos Slim.
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:04.920]  They've got $5 million in Obama money to run the Obama phone program and rip off taxpayers
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:07.920]  and then launder the money back in the New York Times, a globalist intelligence op.
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:09.920]  Sorry, I'm not a criminal.
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:14.920]  Well, again, look at what funds the left wing media for the most part is Big Pharma,
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:20.920]  which poisons our children with mind altering psychotropic drugs, for example, antidepressants
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:26.920]  that have been implicated in many mass shootings, mass drugging, statin drugs, all these drugs.
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:30.920]  That is part of what's destroying the sanity of our society, by the way.
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:32.920]  And what are you offering?
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:36.920]  Oh, health enhancing products that have nutrition and prevention
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:39.920]  that help people heal and live healthier, happier lives.
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:41.920]  Oh, my God, how evil is that?
[2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:44.920]  I'm betting on humanity and I'm betting on free speech.
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  And all the chai comms and all the globalists and all the EUs and all the Hollywoods
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  and all the New York Times can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:52.920]  Stay with us.
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:53.920]  Andrew Torbis straight ahead.
[2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:54.920]  Thanks, Mike Adams.
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:55.920]  It's a no-brainer.
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:15:57.920]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:02.920]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors,
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:05.920]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:07.920]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:10.920]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration.
[2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:11.920]  Big Berkey.
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:15.920]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:20.920]  Call or click 1-877-99 Berkey or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:41.920]  That's 1-877-99 BERKEY.
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:51.920]  That's all folks.
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:52.920]  Stay with us.
[2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:54.920]  That's dyln.co.
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:26.920]  Lincoln was elected to United Nation for the first time.
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:29.920]  The left tried to smear him and went to war with him.
[2:17:29.920 --> 2:17:32.920]  Can President Trump and we come together and save America a second time?
[2:17:32.920 --> 2:17:36.920]  Death of a Nation is the latest film from No. 1 New York Times bestselling author,
[2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:40.920]  Denise DeSousa, and Academy Award-winning producer, Gerald R. Mullen.
[2:17:40.920 --> 2:17:43.920]  Through stunning historical recreations and a searching examination,
[2:17:43.920 --> 2:17:48.920]  Death of a Nation cuts through progressive lives to expose hidden history and explosive truths.
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:53.920]  In theaters nationwide now, more information at Deathofanationmovie.com

[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:25.920]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.920]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email

[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:29.920]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:34.920]  Well now you could do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[2:19:46.920 --> 2:19:52.920]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-bike range, and with your help spreading it,
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:55.920]  and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:01.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:14.920]  We are on the march, the Empire is on the run.
[2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:19.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:26.920]  So they're not just censoring me on these big platforms,
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:30.920]  they're trying to go after every facet of what we do from our email servers,
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:33.920]  to programs we use for social networks.
[2:20:33.920 --> 2:20:37.920]  I mean, they're digging in to stuff that's not even public,
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:41.920]  running intelligence ops, sending emails out to just every business there is,
[2:20:41.920 --> 2:20:45.920]  saying, we know you've got Jones, we're gonna boycott you, and hoping some are actually doing business.
[2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:48.920]  So they go, look and go, the Nazis knocked on the door and said,
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:51.920]  we better not be helping the Jews next door.
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  And you read this bizarre quote, The New York Times is trumpeting,
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  and all these articles against me by this ridiculous senator, Chris Anti-America Murphy,
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  says, InfoWars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies.
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:13.920]  They use the sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:15.920]  That's all they do.
[2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:19.920]  These companies must do more than just take down one website.
[2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:23.920]  Their survival of our democracy depends on it, Senator Chris Murphy,
[2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:26.920]  Democrat of Connecticut and a strident critic of InfoWars.
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:29.920]  That idiot doesn't even know how the web works, calls it a website.
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:33.920]  So it's a multimedia platform, just like CNN reaching people,
[2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:37.920]  and CNNs at the forefront, always tattling on Instagram, still got it, Twitter does,
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:42.920]  but don't worry, Pinterest and MailChimp, they took them down.
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:46.920]  I mean, it's so criminal, it's so anti-American, but the left,
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:54.920]  how did the left get turned into such a monolithic group of anti-free speech monsters?
[2:21:54.920 --> 2:21:59.920]  Well, Alex, I don't know where the turning point came for the left,
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:03.920]  where they turned into monsters, but they used to be pro-free speech,
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:06.920]  and now all of a sudden we see these double standards in this hypocrisy.
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  One of our users, meme America, spent all weekend surfacing anti-white hate speech
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:17.920]  on Twitter by verified accounts, including journalists from BuzzFeed and CNN
[2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:21.920]  and all these other outlets that preach about hate speech.
[2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:24.920]  Oh yeah, that's the culture, it's not just that lady at the New York Times
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:27.920]  saying whites are subhuman, this is the culture.
[2:22:27.920 --> 2:22:32.920]  Exactly, it's hundreds and hundreds of verified accounts that we surfaced
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  over the weekend and took screenshots and archived all of them, and this is okay,
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:38.920]  no one is talking about this, this is totally allowed.
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:41.920]  As long as you're saying something about whites or about Christians
[2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:45.920]  or about Trump supporters or about conservatives or about Alex Jones,
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:48.920]  you're allowed to be hateful, you're allowed to call for death threats,
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:52.920]  you're allowed to say these things, but this is a culture that they've created
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:56.920]  and it's a double standard and it must be exposed and we must fight back.
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:00.920]  By the way, you were a pretty good tech guy, a mid-level out there
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:03.920]  and knew some of the highest level folks in Silicon Valley when you got
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:06.920]  disgusted, I've heard you tell your story.
[2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:10.920]  And WikiLeaks call San Francisco the whole area the imperial cultural elite
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:14.920]  or the cultural imperial elite and it really is their own weird psycho bubble
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:17.920]  and they really think they're going to dominate all of us.
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:20.920]  I mean, these are like super villain characters.
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:24.920]  Absolutely, they're morally superior, they think they're intellectually superior,
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:28.920]  they think they know what is right for society and the direction that society should be
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:31.920]  and they want to tell you how to think, they want to tell you how to vote,
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:35.920]  they want to tell you what you can and cannot talk about, what is real news
[2:23:35.920 --> 2:23:39.920]  and what isn't, they want total control and that's what we're seeing now with the internet
[2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:43.920]  is there, as Matt Drudge said so articurately a couple years ago,
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:46.920]  they're recreating the internet in their image.
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:50.920]  The internet by design routes around censorship and that's why we're going to continue
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:53.920]  building and hopefully others will rise up and continue to build alternatives
[2:23:53.920 --> 2:23:59.920]  so that we can escape the chains of Silicon Valley ideological echo chambers.
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:02.920]  You just said it, I remember that quote from Drudge, it's true.
[2:24:02.920 --> 2:24:06.920]  They're recreating the web in their own image, meaning us in their own image
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:12.920]  and just the hate, the disdain, but what about their scruffy dumbed-down college professor
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:17.920]  or college student anti-foot type that looked like glow-in-the-dark methods
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:22.920]  when they saw that we had a third or more of the people weren't white
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:26.920]  at the pro-liberty rallies in San Francisco in areas, they flipped out.
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:29.920]  It was like they were really having some problems.
[2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:31.920]  Yeah, it destroys their narrative.
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:35.920]  I mean, just like Gab this week alone had 10,000 Kenyans join the site
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:37.920]  because they were being censored.
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:40.920]  An influential blogger in Kenya got banned from Twitter.
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:46.920]  That completely destroys their narrative that Gab is this alt-right white supremacist Nazi website
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:53.920]  Let's be clear, white supremacists can buy and add the newspaper just because you let new black panthers
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:55.920]  or white supremacists be on there, that's because it's free speech.
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  Come in Kenyans, come in Muslims, come in Christians.
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:00.920]  Let's have a real debate here.
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:03.920]  Absolutely, we welcome everybody and we always have.
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:05.920]  We have 500,000 users from around the world.
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:09.920]  I can promise you that not all of them are white, not all of them are Christian
[2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:11.920]  and that's fine, that's a good thing.
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:13.920]  We want healthy debate, we want healthy discourse
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:16.920]  because right now we're stuck in these ideological echo chambers
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:19.920]  where we have narratives forced down our throats with these algorithms
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:23.920]  and you said it best, you know, it's psychological manipulation.
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:29.920]  They are forming this false perception, this alternate reality of what news is
[2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:34.920]  and what important information is and these algorithms have bias.
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:40.920]  They are designed and written by human beings in San Francisco who have far left leanings.
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:41.920]  It's a fact.
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:44.920]  And you've been saying that a long time but notice WikiLeaks said that.
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:49.920]  They said this is San Francisco, a tiny clique trying to rule all of our minds
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:53.920]  and the fact that you can't even say, I think it's wrong that a drag queen
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:57.920]  is in videos doing strip tease dances for three-year-olds,
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:25:59.920]  they call that bullying a drag queen and I'm banned.
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:02.920]  I mean, you lived out there, what's up with the drag queen thing
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:04.920]  because I'm not even against any of these people.
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  I don't care if it's a regular topless dancer or drag queen,
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:09.920]  it shouldn't be three-year-olds putting money in their G-string.
[2:26:09.920 --> 2:26:12.920]  What the hell plan is this?
[2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:17.920]  Well, I mean, it's no surprise that they donated to the Hillary Clinton campaigns
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:19.920]  60 times more than the Trump campaign.
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:23.920]  I think 98% of campaign contributions went to Hillary Clinton.
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:27.920]  You know, you're even having prominent conservatives, prominent libertarians
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:30.920]  that are tech investors that are maybe even contrarian.
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:33.920]  They're not even necessarily right-wing, maybe they're libertarians
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:37.920]  and they're up and leaving because they cannot stand the ideological echo chamber.
[2:26:37.920 --> 2:26:39.920]  It's madness, but it's just...
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:41.920]  So what are they going to do as the hashtag walk away accelerates
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:44.920]  as the numbers of minorities supporting Trump in major polls doubles,
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  even in cooked polls?
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:49.920]  I guess they're going to try to clamp down and then sell the clamp down
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:51.920]  on a strong man of me they built.
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:53.920]  I don't think it's working. Be honest with me, Andrew Torba.
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:57.920]  You're a smart guy, an engineer, have your big social media site.
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:26:59.920]  Do you think they're winning right now?
[2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:01.920]  Because I don't want to be too positive, though.
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:04.920]  This is going to be rough for us, but I don't see this going well.
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:08.920]  If they were winning, they wouldn't have needed to unperson you from the Internet.
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:14.920]  That shows just how powerful we the people are and this movement is global.
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:17.920]  I think we forget it's not only happening in America, it's happening in the UK,
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:19.920]  it's happening across Europe.
[2:27:19.920 --> 2:27:22.920]  There are people that are rising up and speaking truth to power
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:24.920]  and they're going to continue to do so
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:27.920]  and they're going to continue to take their country back, their culture back
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:29.920]  and these elites are not going to stop it.
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  So I think by nature of them banning you from effectively the entire Internet
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:37.920]  except for Gab and maybe one or two other sites at this point,
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:41.920]  it shows that we're actually winning because if they were winning,
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:43.920]  they wouldn't need to do something like that.
[2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:48.920]  Well, they admit it's panicking that minorities are joining the Liberty Movement
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:51.920]  and realizing they're lying and all the minorities we talked to say,
[2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:54.920]  they go check the lies and the lies are so big they're like,
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:56.920]  well, I'm not going to be part of this group.
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:59.920]  They're constantly hearing about racism and being like Candace Owens.
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:04.920]  He had the liberals doxing her and pretending they were right-wingers after her
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  to then scare her into their arms.
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:09.920]  I mean, they're literally psychologically hunting these people.
[2:28:09.920 --> 2:28:15.920]  Absolutely and I think anytime any one of them steps out of their filter bubble
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:20.920]  and says, hey, yeah, I support Trump or hey, I'm a conservative or steps out of line.
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:23.920]  That's when they get attacked and they get all these death threats
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:27.920]  and the racism from the left, it's really insanity
[2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:29.920]  and hopefully a lot of people are waking up from it.
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:30.920]  Do a few more minutes with us.
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:32.920]  I want to talk about the Kenyans joining you.
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:38.920]  Globally, censorship increases in Africa, in Brazil, in France.
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:41.920]  I mean, everywhere this is happening, where the political parties
[2:28:41.920 --> 2:28:44.920]  and the politicians are losing so they crack down on speech.
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:48.920]  And that's how something like Gab can go from being big to ginormous overnight,
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:49.920]  which is what we need.
[2:28:49.920 --> 2:28:54.920]  Stayweathersimplewars.gov

[2:30:55.920 --> 2:30:57.920]  I want to plow into all of this.
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:00.920]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first
[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:03.920]  just encouraging listeners to understand that
[2:31:03.920 --> 2:31:08.920]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
[2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:12.920]  or other material from infowarstore.com
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:15.920]  you are funding the revolution.
[2:31:15.920 --> 2:31:17.920]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[2:31:21.920 --> 2:31:22.920]  I don't want to thank everybody that has,

[2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:28.920]  and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[2:31:28.920 --> 2:31:31.920]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:33.920]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[2:31:33.920 --> 2:31:36.920]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:40.920]  infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.

[2:31:50.920 --> 2:32:19.920]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support.

[2:32:28.920 --> 2:32:30.920]  Regular turmeric root from the store
[2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:33.920]  only contains 1-5% of active ingredients.
[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:38.920]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:42.920]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint,
[2:32:42.920 --> 2:32:44.920]  sage, lemon balm and thyme
[2:32:44.920 --> 2:32:47.920]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:22.920]  In a few years,
[2:33:22.920 --> 2:33:25.920]  the U.S. and A.J. are blown out of their trajectory
[2:33:25.920 --> 2:33:29.920]  into an orbit which freezes his life support systems
[2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:33.920]  and returns A.J. to Earth 25 years later.
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:36.920]  Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum,
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:39.920]  there are false backstage where people are extremely lazing.
[2:33:39.920 --> 2:33:41.920]  The social engineers are there laughing.
[2:33:41.920 --> 2:33:44.920]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:46.920]  is now real.
[2:33:46.920 --> 2:33:48.920]  While the society unravels,
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:52.520]  not knowing how to be men and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:57.760]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling
[2:33:57.760 --> 2:33:59.000]  to be informed.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.020]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[2:34:01.020 --> 2:34:02.020]  It's fulfilling.
[2:34:02.020 --> 2:34:03.020]  Infowars.
[2:34:03.020 --> 2:34:04.020]  Tomorrow's News.
[2:34:04.020 --> 2:34:05.020]  Today.
[2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:07.880]  You are the one they called president?
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:08.880]  I am.
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:11.880]  Neil before us all.
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:27.800]  You are not the president.
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:32.320]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:35.320]  I am the man they're protecting.
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:57.280]  I am the president.
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:34:58.280]  Rodger Stone has joined us.
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:34:59.800]  The big exclusive is here in just a few minutes.
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:04.080]  We're finishing up with Andrew Torb, a computer programmer and engineer that founded GAB.AI
[2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:08.400]  after he saw all the incredible censorship going on and that's why I always have all
[2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:09.400]  these other great people on.
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:11.640]  I feel good having Rudgerport.com out there.
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:13.600]  I feel good having GAB.AI.
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:18.720]  I feel good having the Daily Caller and Tucker Carlson is on vacation this week or you know
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:20.120]  he'd be commenting on all this.
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:23.560]  I feel good having Mike Savage out there, I'm going to be on his show today.
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:30.320]  They have lied and twisted what I've said, never let me clarified, then called for me
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:36.040]  to be censored and now they're accelerating it to going after our infrastructure and here
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:37.040]  is the New York Times.
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:42.240]  They have a neocon, David French writing this for the National Review for the New York Times.
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:47.240]  A better way to ban Alex Jones, sue him and then have an objective term saying he's a
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:54.440]  slanderer and then ban all his speech previous, I mean after that and that's their whole track
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:56.160]  with all of this and then here's the next one.
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:36:03.400]  Oh, New York Times, Elizabeth Williamson, Alex Jones demands, I demand his inforce followers
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:05.160]  rise up and buy more merchandise.
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:10.920]  Yeah, I'd probably plug a minute and a half an hour, every talk show, every 10 minutes
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:14.040]  and the fact that I'm saying, hey, support us, buy products, help us stand against these
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:15.040]  people.
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:16.040]  That's what they don't want.
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:17.040]  They want me out of business.
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:22.560]  They're everywhere saying, ban me, ban me, ban me, shut me down and I'm just like, hey,
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:26.120]  we got t-shirts, we got water filtration, we got non-GMRLM seeds, we got great supple
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:31.000]  mints, we're supporting freedom, we're promoting free market, we're defending your second amendment
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:37.080]  and they know our talking points get out there and we're not dumb like Congress.
[2:36:37.080 --> 2:36:39.760]  We know they're shadow banning all these people and we're trying to rally folks to wake up
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:43.440]  and they're like, he knows China is funding this, he knows we're censoring and this keeps
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:45.560]  happening, we're not going to be here anymore.
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:50.920]  Shut him up thinking you're so stupid that you go, well, I don't like Alex Jones again
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:53.160]  because of the straw man.
[2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:57.040]  I've had a bunch of liberal law firms go over everything we said and they said, wow, we
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:36:59.680]  apologize, you really didn't say all the stuff you said.
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:06.320]  In fact, we think we have cases against them and we do, I'm talking about Megan Kelly and
[2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:07.320]  others.
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:10.840]  I mean, media, you know, what happened, Andrew, don't ask your question about what Trump
[2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:14.400]  should do and we'll let you go and I'll get stoned on here.
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:20.640]  What happened where, I asked this earlier, but they've just gone from lying to being
[2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:26.480]  like terrorist, disrupter, intelligence operations for the big banks and sorrows.
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:30.520]  And then the average conservative is like, oh, the liberals always censor us and are
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:31.520]  being to us.
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:32.960]  No, this is next level.
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:35.040]  This is illegal.
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:40.440]  And finally, Matt Gaetz after being a buffoon and the hearing goes, oh my God, this is donations
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:41.440]  in kind.
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:45.120]  I filed with the Federal Election Commission, they're blocking me and letting everybody
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:46.600]  else post.
[2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:50.440]  Yeah, yeah, these aren't, it isn't a private company argument.
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:51.720]  They say it's open.
[2:37:51.720 --> 2:37:52.720]  You don't violate their rules.
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:56.000]  I have the screenshots of YouTube where it says we were all in good standing when they
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  banned us.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  That's what they can't stand.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  So they just say nebulous stuff, Islamophobia, transphobia, and bullying children.
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:07.320]  Because I said, look at these drag queens shaking their butts and little kids faces.
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:08.640]  What fricking planet is this?
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:10.080]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:13.080]  So what should we do about Trump and where does this end?
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:18.320]  Well, I think we had a good start with Trump when he addressed the shadow banning issue
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:19.320]  on Twitter.
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:22.240]  I believe it was a week and a half ago or so.
[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:24.080]  But the FEC needs to act.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:27.160]  This is direct election interference.
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:32.160]  You know, at first, Big Tech tried to lie about it and tried to cover this stuff up,
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:36.060]  tried to say that it was a conspiracy theory, no shadow banning was happening.
[2:38:36.060 --> 2:38:41.720]  Now they have the Sophist media that is lying and distorting and creating a false premise
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:46.280]  and saying, well, shadow banning is actually defined as only you can see your content and
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:47.600]  no one else in the site can see it.
[2:38:47.600 --> 2:38:48.600]  And that's it.
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:53.040]  Well, there's also lower forms of that, like the quality filter shadow ban, where if it's
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:57.400]  applied to your account, and of course, it's applied to only conservatives, only Trump
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:01.920]  supporters, only influencers in those networks on the right, well, basically you're not showing
[2:39:01.920 --> 2:39:02.920]  up in search results.
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:08.020]  You're not showing up in other fees and different hashtags.
[2:39:08.020 --> 2:39:09.880]  This is direct election interference.
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:14.440]  When you have Republican candidates that are being shadow banned and their Democratic opponents
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:18.960]  have free reign to get their message out on the site, that's a problem.
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:23.760]  So Congress needs to act, President Trump needs to act, the FEC needs to act.
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:29.720]  And we simultaneously also need to be building alternatives like GAB and like others so that
[2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:32.000]  we don't play on their playgrounds anymore.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.440]  All right, brother, I totally agree.
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:35.440]  And I love Trump.
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:38.360]  He's right saying mainstream media is the enemy of the people they admit they are.
[2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:39.360]  They want to get rid of free speech.
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:43.960]  They want to bankrupt the economy for control, but Trump needs to move.
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:45.280]  We need real hearings right now.
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:47.600]  We need emergency hearings.
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:49.020]  This needs to happen right now.
[2:39:49.020 --> 2:39:50.120]  This is incredible.
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:54.000]  This is absolute economic sabotage, economic warfare at siege.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  God bless you.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:00.440]  Thank you so much, GAB.ai and at GAB on Twitter for now.
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:01.440]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:02.440]  You bet.
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:03.440]  Thank you.
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:04.440]  We're going to go to break and come back with Roger Stone.
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  Let me just throw this out here again because the New York Times says, do not buy his product.
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:12.920]  I mean, it's just, you know, he's this terrible person.
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:18.920]  You know, he says he's this gladiator and he needs to be fed if he can fight.
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:22.300]  They cannot stand it.
[2:40:22.300 --> 2:40:27.440]  They do not know what to do.
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:35.440]  They're all owned by horrid corrupt kingpins like Carlos Slim and their religion like
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:41.800]  baby birds born and trained to imprint on hate of America is to destroy America, destroy
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:47.740]  Christians and lead led by weirdo white racists, the New York Times and Asian racists, you
[2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:48.740]  name it.
[2:40:48.740 --> 2:40:50.600]  They are taught that whites are inherently evil.
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:53.760]  The most bizarre whacked out hit Larry and crap.
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:54.760]  It's the same as Hitler.
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:55.760]  He's not just saying whites.
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.320]  I guess he was saying Jews were white or were the bad guys.
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:00.600]  It's just, it's just crazy town.
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:01.600]  They're authoritarian.
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:02.600]  It's easy.
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:04.000]  They're betting on you being dumb.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.160]  They think they're going to win.
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:11.280]  So the number one thing is spread the article, spread the video, spread the links at infowars.com
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:15.560]  forward slash show, sign up for the free newsletter, which we can't send out today because MailChimp
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:16.560]  banned us.
[2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:18.480]  It's all economic warfare.
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:22.480]  But let them know you're going to send a signal and send us a signal that we should continue
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:26.000]  on expanding because if they start contracting us, they're going to really pound us.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.760]  That's their plan as a beta test that they can take us down.
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:30.080]  They can take anybody down.
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:36.600]  This is real racketeering, real organized crime, real bullying because we're open society.
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:39.960]  So foreign money could come in, Chinese money could come in, globalist money.
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:42.840]  They got away with a lot of stuff and now they're like, whoa, Americans are getting
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:43.840]  away from us.
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:48.640]  They're like, well, break their arms and, and make an example out of Alex Jones.
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:52.680]  So other media backs off, well, the Daily Caller and Breitbart and Drudge and World
[2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:56.680]  Net Daily and everybody just unified and all these other talk show house behind us, including
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:41:58.040]  a lot of liberals that are real liberals.
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:02.080]  So I don't think your intimidation of Matt Drudge and Michael Savage worked too well,
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:03.080]  dirtbags.
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:05.840]  I had Michael Savage on three years ago when he had a book coming out.
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:08.120]  He's been a number one New York Times bestseller.
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:12.240]  And it was about Chinese infiltration in the US.
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:17.240]  The book would not be put on shelves by publishers, by the companies, by Barnes and Noble.
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  That was a failure.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:24.240]  They mean business, business.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:26.840]  And me, I'm not rolling over this crap.
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:28.760]  That's not who I am.
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:31.760]  Most other men are like, let's just shell out and be better for us on a bigger car.
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:33.200]  You'll have nothing, idiot.
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:38.240]  You got all this liberty because we had some people before us that would fight to be free
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:43.960]  or at least try to take action in 4warstore.com, a lot of big specials, 10% off of your sign
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:44.960]  up for auto ship.
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:47.320]  And that way you can support us each month, canceling time.
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:48.320]  Just do it.
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:49.320]  Just get in there.
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:42:50.320]  They hate it.
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:51.320]  Double down on us.
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:52.520]  You fund our war bonds.
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:53.520]  You got a commitment.
[2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:55.560]  We'll turbo charge even harder.
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:42:59.880]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage.
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:03.760]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now, if you're not in the market for one of
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:13.000]  our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution, $25, $50, $250, even $500 would
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:18.920]  be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their
[2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:24.560]  campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:29.400]  Hey, how would you like to take n4wars with you wherever you go?

[2:44:14.580 --> 2:44:16.720]  and flax fiber.
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:21.880]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:27.480]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.

[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:46.680]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon

[2:44:57.560 --> 2:45:01.960]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:02.960]  Thanks for holding.
[2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:03.960]  Hey Alex mate.
[2:45:03.960 --> 2:45:07.680]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:12.880]  I remember back when N4wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:17.280]  I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:21.720]  read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using
[2:45:21.720 --> 2:45:25.800]  your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the
[2:45:25.800 --> 2:45:32.680]  X2, the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man, the Real Red Pill, MycoZX Body, it's all amazing.
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:33.680]  Thank you brother.
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:38.320]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:42.720]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:48.040]  you know God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:57.200]  an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:02.400]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home but sometimes supplements
[2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:03.920]  don't work fast enough.
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:08.760]  That's why N4wars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue Line, Super
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:14.880]  Blue Silver Immune Gargle, available in 1oz, 3.5oz and 16oz bottles.

[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:25.800]  like you need to stay clean.

[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:41.160]  a powerful cleansing alternative.

[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:05.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:16.760]  Well, quarterback by CNN and Media Matters, George Soros, the massive purge, not just
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:21.080]  off of these big social networks, but off of every form of business site you can imagine
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:22.080]  is behind.
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:27.040]  The Chinese social score, as they call it, or the mark of the beast is being implemented
[2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:29.360]  on Alex Jones first in America.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:31.720]  I'm not happy it's happening, but I'm honored.
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:37.720]  They're attempting to send me into the fandom zone by depersoning me while humanity is awakening
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:43.280]  and rallying against the corrupt establishment that now, two minutes to midnight, realizes
[2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:57.560]  Bayowoff, a new challenger faces Grendel and will not be so easy as others.
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:00.560]  They see as his villains to be shut to the fandom zone.
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:04.360]  You three criminals have been caught in a further act of seditious treason.
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:09.040]  General Zod, your only feeling was contempt for our society.
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:12.040]  Your only desire was to command.
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:18.280]  Ersa, the only feeling you showed was for your vicious general, your only wish to rule
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:20.280]  that his side.
[2:48:20.280 --> 2:48:27.080]  Don, you are as without thought as you are without voice.
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:33.440]  This council has no hesitation in proclaiming you all guilty.
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:34.440]  Guilty.
[2:48:34.440 --> 2:48:35.440]  Guilty.
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:36.440]  Guilty.
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:42.720]  You spoke out against the jibs and sexual mutilation.
[2:48:42.720 --> 2:48:44.720]  You spoke out for America and freedom.
[2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:45.720]  Now, pay.
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:53.120]  The New York Times says so, even as it prepares to implode, because once their job is finished,
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:56.120]  there will be no need for them anymore.
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:48:58.120]  Prepare yourself for the fandom zone stage.
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  How dare you try to make America great again.
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:12.560]  Anyways, Roger Stone joins us.
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:18.280]  You know, Roger, I can make jokes about it, but if the Republicans don't get fully behind
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:21.560]  going after these people, not just standing up for me, they're screwed.
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:23.360]  This was the test cases I told you three weeks ago.
[2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:28.840]  I said, you watch those Republicans not knowing how to find their ass with both hands in that
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:33.680]  Judiciary Committee, with those lying tech heads in front of them, just green-lighted
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:36.680]  gang raping, and they shadow banned them all the next day.
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:39.320]  Members of Congress, these people think we're idiots.
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:42.640]  They're on the Chai-Com payroll, but Matt Drudge gets it.
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:44.240]  All the Dianne Feinstein's coming out.
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:47.360]  The key is exposing their Chai-Com operatives.
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:48.680]  We have them.
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:49.680]  We have them.
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:52.320]  But if you don't go on the offense, they're going to win, Roger Stone.
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:58.440]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'm kind of reminded of what was once G. Gordon-Liddy's favorite
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:04.200]  saying from the German philosopher Nietzsche, who said, that which does not kill me makes
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:05.200]  me stronger.
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:11.600]  What's amazing to me is the surge in the number of people going to the Infowars.com site to
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:14.520]  watch us live-streaming.
[2:50:14.520 --> 2:50:20.920]  The number of people now signing up for your podcast, the War Room podcast, the Real News
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:28.400]  podcast, the number of people now, the bump in the ratings at like Cloud TV, more people
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:32.720]  watching us, more people listening to us on the radio.
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:33.720]  We were number four.
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:43.280]  We're number three now on iTunes Store, ahead of CNN, about to be Reddit, about to, I mean,
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:44.280]  but here's the problem.
[2:50:44.280 --> 2:50:45.280]  They'll just ban us there.
[2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:47.400]  We're being banned because we're number one, Roger.
[2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:48.400]  There's no question.
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:51.560]  I think people need to understand how sweeping this is.
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:52.560]  This is YouTube.
[2:50:52.560 --> 2:50:53.560]  This is Periscope.
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:54.560]  This is Apple.
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:59.200]  This is iTunes.
[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:00.200]  This is Facebook.
[2:51:00.200 --> 2:51:01.200]  This is Spotify.
[2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:02.200]  I mean, it's a purge.
[2:51:02.200 --> 2:51:03.200]  It's a mugging.
[2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:11.600]  It's the test case because there's no doubt in my mind that if they succeed in shutting
[2:51:11.600 --> 2:51:18.560]  Infowars down, in strangling your First Amendment rights, my First Amendment rights at the War
[2:51:18.560 --> 2:51:24.400]  Room, which has suffered very badly from this because many of our viewers enjoy us on
[2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:27.040]  YouTube, where we are now banned.
[2:51:27.040 --> 2:51:29.720]  That's a good point, by the way.
[2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:34.080]  They've banned other talk show hosts and other podcasts on our platform that have their own
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:35.080]  websites.
[2:51:35.080 --> 2:51:36.080]  They've even banned site.
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:37.080]  Go ahead.
[2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:43.040]  So the point here is that Tucker Carlson and Matt Grudge have been among those who
[2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:45.560]  have stood tall, but they will be next.
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:51.520]  So will Sean Hannity, Laura Ingram, Mike Savage, Rush Limbaugh, all these patriots, all of
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:58.320]  these supporters of freedom are next on the hit list, and they need to get wise to it
[2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:03.000]  because the attack on you is only a beachhead.
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:07.320]  And we know that the government censorship board that was passed at the last minute by
[2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:13.280]  Obama as a part of the defense appropriations got their $43 million in their first chunk
[2:52:13.280 --> 2:52:14.280]  of change.
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:20.560]  And I suspect they are the ones driving this, which I believe Obama gave them the authority
[2:52:20.560 --> 2:52:21.560]  to do.
[2:52:21.560 --> 2:52:22.560]  Well, funny.
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:24.760]  And Trump needs to revoke that, but they think he's ignorant to it.
[2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:29.240]  You have Dem Senator, who he reportedly is on this secret board, demands more conservative
[2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:32.880]  sites as Fox News, everyone banned them, Chris Murphy.
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:38.360]  So and then you've got the reason Democrats circulating plan for government takeover
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:39.360]  of the Internet.
[2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:40.520]  I mean, it's here.
[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:42.720]  This is outrageous authoritarianism.
[2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:43.720]  Good Lord.
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:44.720]  Well, they have to.
[2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:50.040]  It's the only way they can try to level the playing field to beat us in 2018 or 2020.
[2:52:50.040 --> 2:52:53.240]  There's a surge of freedom in the country.
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:52:54.240]  What is Trump?
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:55.240]  What does Trump need to do right now?
[2:52:55.240 --> 2:52:57.320]  Because the New York Times is salivating.
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:52:59.920]  The Washington Post is salivating.
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:03.200]  The Buzzfeed is like a cartoon character of the Nazis.
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:07.080]  I've read Nazi writings where they would talk about shutting down the press.
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:11.120]  This is like more creamy eyed than the Nazis.
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:17.720]  These people have shown themselves to be just lawless, frothing mercenaries, desperate little
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:22.240]  crittins almost paid nothing to servile lapdogs of evil.
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:27.120]  Well, first of all, the president, I think, needs to understand the issue fully and all
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:29.840]  the implications thereof.
[2:53:29.840 --> 2:53:36.160]  That means he needs to get a briefing from the House Republicans who, although there
[2:53:36.160 --> 2:53:41.040]  may have been some flaws in their early arguments, are the only ones out there talking about
[2:53:41.040 --> 2:53:43.520]  this who seem to understand it.
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:48.120]  Perhaps they learned a lesson in the mass shadow ban of over a hundred members of Congress.
[2:53:48.120 --> 2:53:52.960]  It shows that it can be done to everybody and anybody, and they have really...
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:56.240]  This is a selective internet kill switch, a literal mark of the beast.
[2:53:56.240 --> 2:53:59.240]  This is the Chinese social score with the chai comms involved.
[2:53:59.240 --> 2:54:02.320]  Google announcing they're moving to China, helping censor here.
[2:54:02.320 --> 2:54:03.320]  Apple officially...
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:06.280]  What do you make of the chai comms threatening to take over Apple because it's now state
[2:54:06.280 --> 2:54:09.280]  run and sabotaging and if Trump doesn't submit?
[2:54:09.280 --> 2:54:14.760]  I mean, we're already at war and the damn tech companies have decided against us.
[2:54:14.760 --> 2:54:19.360]  Well, they've sold their passcodes in essence to the Chinese for huge dollars.
[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:23.640]  They've sold out their country where they live and where they've been able to prosper
[2:54:23.640 --> 2:54:28.920]  to a Chinese communist government will now use our own data against us or withhold it
[2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:29.920]  from us.
[2:54:29.920 --> 2:54:30.920]  It's outrageous.
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:36.680]  Well, we need a listeners to go completely, and we need to call for antitrust now.
[2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:39.560]  We need to call for emergency hearings for election meddling.
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:44.920]  This is the real election meddling, red handed the tech companies censoring in mass saying
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:48.560]  they will deliver the election to the Democrats.
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:50.000]  This is unbelievable.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:54.160]  They are attacking our elections using the whole Russia thing as a smoke screen, Roger.
[2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:59.000]  Well, and this is the deep state's effort to silence info wars, silence you, silence
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:05.680]  me for the take down of Trump and all of his associates, presumably his son who is innocent
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:11.040]  of any crime, maybe even his son-in-law, yours truly, Alex, there's talk about them
[2:55:11.040 --> 2:55:16.560]  indicting you, which I find ridiculous since you have committed no crimes, but I forgot
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:17.560]  that earlier.
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:18.560]  Mueller asking that.
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:22.440]  They had the New York Times asked me, how much do the Russians pay you?
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:25.160]  You know, how long have you worked for RT and I said, I never worked for RT.
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:26.160]  I haven't been on in years.
[2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:27.160]  And she was like, Oh, really?
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:28.160]  Well, we've got witnesses.
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:30.160]  I was like, Oh, we've got you.
[2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:31.160]  Oh, really?
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:32.160]  Oh, huh?
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:33.160]  Oh, huh?
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:37.880]  Well, you got some meth head or something or some heroin head to say you saw me, you
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:40.280]  know, in bed with Putin, getting peed on or something.
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:44.480]  I mean, that is, I'm telling you these, do you think the New York Times really believe
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:45.840]  that when they said that to me?
[2:55:45.840 --> 2:55:48.800]  I have no idea, but I will say this.
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:55.000]  You have to take what you actually said and either bastardize it or edit it or truncate
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:56:01.400]  it or twist it to put the words in your mouth that the mainstream media has attributed to
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:02.400]  you.
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:07.320]  It's an intellectual mugging the way they have to do this.
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:13.320]  But so they distort what you say, then they use that distortion as the basis for blocking
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:18.360]  you on social media, which you and I have both been predicting now for months.
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:20.400]  It is the night of the long knives.
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:25.400]  And if we are, if we are, if we are first, who's next?
[2:56:25.400 --> 2:56:29.120]  And that's what I'm saying, though, the Democrats didn't even wait a few days on me.
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:31.440]  They're now announcing they want everyone to be platform.
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:32.680]  This is insane.
[2:56:32.680 --> 2:56:37.800]  Why would Warner and Murphy and all of them declare they want us, everybody shut down
[2:56:37.800 --> 2:56:38.800]  now?
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:40.160]  He says, I want hundreds of sites.
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:41.680]  I want Fox News.
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:42.680]  I want it all.
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:45.600]  I mean, that's crazy.
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:48.040]  They're overplaying their hand badly.
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:53.840]  In my opinion, the president needs to understand all of the implications.
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:59.680]  While they may not be shadow beating him, although I wouldn't bet on that, they've got him dialed
[2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:01.640]  back on Twitter, 90%.
[2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:07.720]  They can certainly manipulate the algorithms and they use a hundred computer tricks.
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:10.960]  We shouldn't just say it's that shadow banning.
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:15.680]  And there are many other techniques that are, they are, they are strangling him.
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:19.380]  They don't want those things exposed in a courtroom.
[2:57:19.380 --> 2:57:23.640]  They are vulnerable on monopolistic antitrust practices.
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:29.920]  They're vulnerable on contract law issues because when we went online and signed up,
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:35.760]  and particularly when we paid them for promoted advertisements, they entered into a contract
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:36.760]  with us.
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:40.320]  And they endorsed what we were saying and even gave recommendations of what to do.
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:46.320]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone and Paul Watson, stay with us.
[2:57:46.320 --> 2:57:51.160]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself

[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:19.240]  But because of those who look on and do nothing, if you are receiving this transmission, you
[3:00:19.240 --> 3:00:20.880]  are the resistance.
[3:00:20.880 --> 3:00:26.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:33.320]  Paul Watson's going to be hosting next segment, I'm going to host one segment with him and
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:37.360]  then get out of here for a little while, I'll be on with Mike Savage in about 30 minutes
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:42.640]  and a bunch of other interviews today, I got a whole bunch of them, I just opened the
[3:00:42.640 --> 3:00:47.360]  floodgates, is anybody real?
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:50.400]  Some of these national TV shows want me on, but they want me to go do live satellite feeds
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:52.960]  so I'll do it tomorrow.
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:56.520]  Problem is they lie, they get you there and it's taped, I'm not doing taped, they'll edit
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:00:58.240]  what I say, they're just so evil.
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:02.120]  I'm telling you folks, they have no rules now.
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:08.800]  Look at DrudgeReport.com where the top left-hand corner and they've got senators and the Democrats
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:14.520]  saying shutting down conservative sites that they call a disease is quote the survival
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:18.840]  of our democracy, quote depends on banning sites.
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:24.520]  That is so Orwellian to save our democracy, which we're a republic.
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:30.840]  But regardless, democracy denotes rule of the people, they're saying ban us preemptively
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:35.200]  ahead of the election or we're going to destroy the democracy.
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:38.920]  They mean the corrupt Democratic Party in bed with the chai comms.
[3:01:38.920 --> 3:01:39.920]  What else would you like to add?
[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:41.840]  I know you've got some other big breaking news, Roger.
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  Well, Alex, you're exactly right here.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:47.880]  What happened to the civil libertarians?
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:52.360]  What happened to that stream of liberalism?
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:57.720]  This abridgment of the First Amendment should outrage real liberals.
[3:01:57.720 --> 3:01:59.680]  That's what's so perplexing here.
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:04.840]  They don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says to agree has a right to say it.
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:08.920]  That's the most key element of a free society.
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:11.720]  But I think that they're silencing us is strategic.
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:16.320]  Not only are you a test case, but they plan to try to take Trump down.
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:18.480]  They probably plan to try to take me down.
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:21.520]  They may be planning to take you down.
[3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:24.680]  They are breaking me with legal fees.
[3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:30.720]  My close associate, Kristen Davis, friend of many years, is testifying for the grand
[3:02:30.720 --> 3:02:32.840]  jury voluntarily last week.
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:40.640]  Next week, I did not leak that, neither that she was going or the day, but somebody did.
[3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:42.440]  And she is a friend of mine.
[3:02:42.440 --> 3:02:47.800]  She's aware of no Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or anything of the kind.
[3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:53.120]  It's just like the phony lawsuits against info wars that will, in the end, cost millions
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:54.120]  of dollars.
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:59.200]  It's an effort to frame us based on things you never said.
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:03.200]  In my case, things I never did.
[3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:04.800]  We've got to get Trump.
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  He doesn't want to look like he's meddling in the election.
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:08.880]  It's the Democrats that are doing it.
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:10.680]  That's always when they're playing.
[3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:12.200]  And we've got to move against these people.
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:13.680]  I mean, this is incredible.
[3:03:13.680 --> 3:03:15.080]  They kicked our email off today.
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:20.280]  They kicked our web sprout where we share stuff, a bunch of other stuff.
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:23.080]  And they're sending emails to everybody I know saying, you'll be arrested if you keep
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:25.600]  working with Alex Jones from fake emails.
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:28.120]  So they've got a big harassment campaign going right now.
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:32.120]  Yeah, but this is just the most important beachhead in overall war.
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:36.440]  Look what they've done to Mike Savage, who I think is a real patriot and a good man.
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:41.800]  They have played all kinds of games with him online, trying to limit his reach.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:44.400]  He is a real beacon for freedom, in my opinion.
[3:03:44.400 --> 3:03:48.680]  Well, that's why I told Savage a couple of years ago, we never got around to it.
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:51.720]  I told him, I said, listen, we, he wanted to do it too.
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:55.200]  We'll talk about it on air maybe, but work with me some and then just people get the
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:56.200]  middle of it.
[3:03:56.200 --> 3:03:58.600]  But I mean, I just want to magnify everybody.
[3:03:58.600 --> 3:04:02.400]  And a lot of talk show hosts, other talk shows can't work with me because they're so competitive.
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:05.240]  Savage understood it, but still then some of the corporates didn't like it.
[3:04:05.240 --> 3:04:06.640]  But I just want to promote everybody.
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:07.640]  I don't care who they are.
[3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:12.360]  I don't care if they're a man, a woman, whatever they are, if they're for freedom, that I want
[3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:14.040]  to magnify everybody.
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:15.360]  We're in a war.
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:18.000]  And I think people now have figured that out.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:22.120]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, more important than ever folks to follow you there on your
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:23.120]  own website.

[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:47.340]  I'm going to show you how to download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[3:05:47.340 --> 3:05:51.900]  How they can reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten
[3:05:51.900 --> 3:05:52.900]  info.
[3:05:52.900 --> 3:05:54.600]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[3:05:54.600 --> 3:06:20.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:32.540]  If you go to real Alex Jones, there's a little Twitter thing that Milly Weaver and Gavin
[3:06:32.540 --> 3:06:38.040]  Wentz put out, and that is a new hashtag Snapchat filter to get the word out about
[3:06:38.040 --> 3:06:42.720]  hashtag free speech and free info wars, and I am Alex Jones, some of the top things on
[3:06:42.720 --> 3:06:43.720]  Twitter right now.
[3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:47.960]  It's a little fun little program that's real popular where it puts a piece of tape over
[3:06:47.960 --> 3:06:49.720]  your mouth and says censorship.
[3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:57.600]  When you talk about anything you're talking about, and in the lower corner, it says infowars.com.
[3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:00.680]  So that's the type of things that really reach out to the youth and others.
[3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:05.560]  So go download it right now for free at real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[3:07:05.560 --> 3:07:10.600]  Paul's going to retweet it at Prison Planet on his Twitter as well.
[3:07:10.600 --> 3:07:13.760]  So Paul Joseph Watts is going to be hosting this hour.
[3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:20.120]  I wanted to talk to him a little bit up front about his overall 35,000 foot view about where
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:23.440]  this is going, what they're planning.
[3:07:23.440 --> 3:07:26.720]  Kid Daniels has pointed out that he keeps saying, oh, there's violence by Trump against
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:27.720]  the media.
[3:07:27.720 --> 3:07:30.120]  They're the ones calling for violence against him.
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:36.200]  I'm really concerned about them winding up some crazy person while winding them up.
[3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:39.960]  And I'm also worried about them staging something to make themselves the victims.
[3:07:39.960 --> 3:07:41.320]  That was something I've been saying for months.
[3:07:41.320 --> 3:07:45.400]  Now they're saying, oh, look, somebody threatened us on C-Span.
[3:07:45.400 --> 3:07:47.080]  Brian Stelter has no ratings.
[3:07:47.080 --> 3:07:48.240]  CNN's dead already.
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:51.000]  It's a zombie that wants to claw us into the grave, the Crypt Keeper.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:53.160]  I want no violence against Mueller.
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:58.400]  They're calling for my arrest on MSNBC, the guy that got found in the dead intern in this
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:02.720]  house, Joe Scarborough, in his government offices.
[3:08:02.720 --> 3:08:05.680]  They just shut the whole thing down with their brains bashed out.
[3:08:05.680 --> 3:08:07.760]  He's calling for me to be arrested.
[3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:11.160]  They really entered a new level, and they're just policing around going, why is he still
[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:15.600]  on a Google app and this other app, which, by the way, has gone to number four, number
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:17.200]  three, you name it.
[3:08:17.200 --> 3:08:19.400]  And so now, Paul, they want to police you.
[3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:24.880]  Paul Joseph Watson, number two star of Alex Jones Info Awards, avoid social media purge
[3:08:24.880 --> 3:08:29.840]  for now by John Levine, and it goes on from the rap.
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:35.600]  And so now they're salivating, salivating over you, and of course, they'll never say
[3:08:35.600 --> 3:08:36.600]  what you did.
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:40.560]  If they ban you, they'll maybe say you beat a baby up, like they said about me, and God
[3:08:40.560 --> 3:08:45.000]  not showed where the baby got beat up or, you know, where I was mean to the poor little
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  Muslims.
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:49.600]  So Paul, give us your take on this and what you think is about to happen, because this
[3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:50.600]  is a signal.
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:51.600]  They've been this bold.
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:55.680]  They're testing total de-platforming, total siege, total economic warfare.
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:08:57.240]  This means they're going for broke.
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:08:59.600]  I think trying to take Trump out, what do you think?
[3:08:59.600 --> 3:09:05.040]  Well, this is what they're trying to do, Alex, obviously shifting the Overton window even
[3:09:05.040 --> 3:09:09.240]  further, then probably not going to outright ban a bunch more people immediately.
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:11.640]  They will eventually, obviously, they'll ban everyone.
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:16.480]  But in the short term, this is about changing the Overton window, shifting the Overton window
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:21.560]  to the point where conservatives moderate their opinions, where they moderate their speech
[3:09:21.560 --> 3:09:24.960]  just to ensure the survival of their platforms.
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:26.720]  So again, it's all a power play.
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:31.000]  It's intellectual castration, and you know, it neutralizes them politically before the
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:34.240]  midterms, before the potential reelection of Trump.
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:35.960]  The other thing is LinkedIn.
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:41.000]  They deleted you from LinkedIn, Alex, yesterday, as you know, you don't, you cannot upload
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:42.280]  content to LinkedIn.
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:46.440]  So this whole hate speech argument falls completely flat.
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:52.200]  As Mike Adams is talking about, this is literally communist Chinese style social credit score,
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:55.600]  1984 style unpersoning.
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:09:57.200]  It's politically motivated.
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:09:59.760]  It was coordinated in the same 12 hour period.
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:04.040]  They even got you on Pinterest as well, obviously, a bunch of other platforms.
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:06.640]  This is not nothing to do with hate speech.
[3:10:06.640 --> 3:10:11.440]  That's the biggest lie about all this, because you cannot upload content to LinkedIn.
[3:10:11.440 --> 3:10:15.680]  So imagine if you had someone who has said something controversial on the internet, then
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:20.640]  they get deleted from LinkedIn, then they find it impossible to get a job because they're
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:23.520]  banned from simply being listed as a person.
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:26.040]  And that's exactly what, what China is doing.
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:29.560]  And they say the models worldwide, we have a Google high level whistleblower came out,
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:33.360]  as you know, last week saying the secret search engine they're building for censorship is
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:34.920]  going to be used here.
[3:10:34.920 --> 3:10:36.000]  This is it.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:37.520]  We had WebChimp ban us today.
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:41.600]  We had this web, web sprout ban us.
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:45.480]  That was, that's just a program you use to spread your stuff with your accounts.
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:48.200]  So yes, we're under total economic attack.
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:54.640]  This is true, true beyond ghettos, electronic ghettos that Matt Rudge warned of.
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:10:58.960]  This is true racketeering, not seen since the Nazis.
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:03.800]  Yeah, it's, it's clearly election meddling, in fact, WikiLeaks tweeted out about 20 minutes
[3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:05.600]  ago if they want to go and find it.
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:10.120]  The suspiciously simultaneous censorship of info wars by Google, Apple, Facebook came
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:15.320]  just one week after US Senate Intelligence Committee, Hawke, Mark Warner, Democrat circulated
[3:11:15.320 --> 3:11:20.560]  this policy paper, threatening new regulation against those same media companies.
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:24.960]  Obviously, it happened after Deutsch threatening Facebook and YouTube censors.
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:30.560]  It happened after Quigley literally in a committee meeting with Twitter execs saying, why on
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:33.920]  earth is this PJW tweet at the top of trending hashtags?
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:35.080]  This is fake news.
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:36.200]  It wasn't fake news.
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:38.760]  It was a completely accurate story.
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:43.600]  You cannot even claim it was inaccurate because it was about an airman in New York warning
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:47.160]  de Blasio about radicalization in New York mosques.
[3:11:47.160 --> 3:11:48.160]  He did warn him.
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:49.160]  He sent a letter.
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:50.600]  He posted the letter on Twitter.
[3:11:50.600 --> 3:11:51.600]  We embedded the letter.
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:54.440]  It was a completely factual story.
[3:11:54.440 --> 3:11:57.680]  How do you think de Blasio had any reason to listen to that warning?
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:11:58.680]  Not even the issue.
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:00.960]  The fact was, it wasn't fake news.
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:06.200]  Well, the same e-mom is a great guy and went on Fox News and warned about it.
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:11.080]  I mean, I don't even watch a lot of TV and I'd seen him on Fox News warning.
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:16.400]  So you have specific examples of genuine news that we reported being cited by Democrats
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:22.720]  in congressional hearings as fake news and then used to pressure Twitter to relegate
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:24.520]  us in the algorithm, which they did.
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:26.000]  They said, yep, we've sorted it out.
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  It's gone.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:30.320]  So that's a clear example of how they're lying about this.
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:32.640]  You know, they banned Tommy Robinson on Instagram.
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:35.360]  His Instagram has come back now, by the way.
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:36.440]  You went on his Instagram.
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:37.840]  It's come back up.
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:40.760]  It's literally pictures of his kids and food.
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:42.240]  I mean, this is the level.
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:43.760]  This is unpersoning.
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:49.680]  This is straight out of 1984 communist Chinese social credit score and it's going to impact
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:50.680]  everyone.
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:56.080]  And the thing about YouTube is I posted a tweet about a week ago now pointing out that
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:13:00.960]  when they announced that they were going to relegate, you know, independent media content
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:06.160]  and boost mainstream media content, just by coincidence, the YouTube subscriptions for
[3:13:06.160 --> 3:13:10.360]  CNN, MSNBC, et cetera, started climbing rapidly.
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:12.680]  Their views started climbing rapidly.
[3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:14.840]  It's clear algorithm meddling.
[3:13:14.840 --> 3:13:16.320]  It's election rigging.
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:20.400]  And it's because in the case of YouTube, to be successful on YouTube, you have to have
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:21.400]  a personality.
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:22.400]  Okay.
[3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:23.400]  It takes hard work.
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:27.480]  It takes years to build up an audience because they engage with your personality.
[3:13:27.480 --> 3:13:29.920]  Brian Stelter has no personality.
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:32.360]  Oliver Darcy of CNN has no personality.
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:36.320]  Other than they all literally are the creepiest looking.
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:40.440]  If I was central casting for a creeperzoid, a serial killer or something like that for
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:43.000]  a movie, I mean, you don't need to show him as a clown.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  Just show Brian Stelter.
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:47.800]  I mean, he is a flaming creeperzoid.
[3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:50.320]  And then they're, I love how they bitch about Trump.
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:52.840]  He counter punches them saying he's a Nazi.
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:13:53.840]  He's a criminal.
[3:13:53.840 --> 3:13:54.840]  He's a Russian agent.
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:56.880]  He should be removed saying, you guys are fake news.
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:13:58.880]  You're enemies of American progress.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:00.240]  And then they call for him to be banned.
[3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:02.600]  They call for us to be banned while screeching.
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:05.240]  We're trying to ban them when we're not.
[3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:07.880]  I mean, God, it's ridiculous.
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:08.880]  Exactly.
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:14.680]  The only positive out of this, and it will take years, but these platforms, they're already
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:18.680]  echo chambers of people just shouting at each other or not even listening to each other.
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:22.120]  They're going to become increasingly stale, increasingly boring.
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:24.920]  We're bringing on a ton of young people to our message.
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:26.680]  They're going to avoid those platforms.
[3:14:26.680 --> 3:14:30.560]  And yes, it'll take years, but we're going to have to move to these different platforms
[3:14:30.560 --> 3:14:33.520]  finally and help build the ground up.
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:34.520]  Paul.
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:37.920]  Oh, that dorsi guy, Darcy, is incredible.
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:38.920]  He sends me comments.
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:40.440]  Like, what do you want to make a comment?
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:45.120]  And it's always one minute after he publishes the story, just to like gloat when they're
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:47.640]  the ones openly lobbying for us to be taken down.
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:48.640]  Because no one watches them.
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:49.640]  That's what they are.
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:54.400]  It's a big corporate operating crew to kill free speech, just like universities.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:58.960]  And I have total satisfaction in knowing that they will be defeated.
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:14:59.960]  They will be brought down.
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:01.360]  They will be stopped by their own actions.
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:05.560]  But like you said, Paul, it is one hell of a time to be alive and Republicans need to
[3:15:05.560 --> 3:15:06.560]  wake up.
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:07.960]  People in the UK need to wake up.
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:08.960]  This is historical.
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:10.160]  Infowars.com, newswars.com.
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:12.160]  I want to ask you this question.
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:13.560]  I want you to answer it when you come back.
[3:15:13.560 --> 3:15:14.560]  You're taking over.
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:15.640]  I'm done here.
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:18.200]  Why is Twitter leaving us up for now?
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:22.520]  Is it because they've already gotten called out by Congress a few weeks ago for copper
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:25.640]  shadow banning and they don't want to be on the bandwagon?
[3:15:25.640 --> 3:15:29.280]  And since they were some of the worst censors, they're backing off right now.
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:33.720]  I don't know why, but I'm going to tell you, we've not violated any of their stupid rules.
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:36.960]  God, it's a total one-sided policy and very discriminatory.
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:41.680]  But whatever you do, listeners, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:46.320]  And the new app we launched three weeks ago is now number three in the news apps.
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:50.000]  It was already in the top 30, but it's going to go to number one, I believe, if you downloaded
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:51.280]  and tell folks to download it.
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:52.280]  So do that.
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:53.280]  People power.
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:15:54.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:58.400]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.

[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:19.360]  Okay, so Paul Watts is taking over right now, but Paul, it is Twilight Zone.
[3:20:19.360 --> 3:20:23.960]  I mean, what does it like to be, we've been working together for 15 years, 16 years, to
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:30.280]  be at the very epicenter of global free speech debate, top links all over Drudge every day,
[3:20:30.280 --> 3:20:34.960]  congressional hearings calling us disease, lying about us, and then not showing what
[3:20:34.960 --> 3:20:35.960]  we said.
[3:20:35.960 --> 3:20:41.000]  I mean, there's a rally around us happening right now, but it needs to be bigger.
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  And Trump needs to take action right now.
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:50.120]  I mean, this is wild ahead of these midterms to set the precedent to deny services to patriots
[3:20:50.120 --> 3:20:53.320]  and nationalists across the board, Paul.
[3:20:53.320 --> 3:20:55.880]  This is an amazing, amazing time to be alive.
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:21:00.480]  And I just hope listeners and viewers realize the power that you have individually, they
[3:21:00.480 --> 3:21:06.120]  failed with the big social networks that were meant to spy on you and control you and Google
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:07.120]  to control things.
[3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:11.600]  And when that failed with Hillary, now they're banning free speech in Brazil because patriots
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:12.600]  are getting elected.
[3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:17.880]  The same thing in France, they're panicking and breaking their own algorithms, these sites
[3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:21.240]  on Google, hardly even works now, even though the average adult spends a third of their
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:24.280]  time on a Google system every day.
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:30.040]  The fact that they're having to do this shows the true crisis because people took over the
[3:21:30.040 --> 3:21:35.720]  algorithm and now once a human is an animal, in this classical animal sense, we have free
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:36.720]  will.
[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:41.080]  And once we're willing to go through pain or attacks or whatever and tell the truth,
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:43.680]  there's no putting their system back together again.
[3:21:43.680 --> 3:21:44.960]  A, do you agree with that?
[3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:49.320]  B, what are they going to do now that even a lot of the internal polls show still a big
[3:21:49.320 --> 3:21:51.920]  win for Republicans and people vote and take action?
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:53.160]  What are they going to do, Paul?
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:55.600]  Because this all smells of real desperation.
[3:21:55.600 --> 3:22:01.920]  I mean, jumping the shark, admitting ban info wars, I mean, we are now legendary.
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:06.200]  They're going to try to demonize us and destroy us and everybody is starting to rally to our
[3:22:06.200 --> 3:22:09.480]  cause, though, like they should have because people now get it.
[3:22:09.480 --> 3:22:14.680]  Well, here's the other aspect, Alex, which you might not have heard about a few weeks
[3:22:14.680 --> 3:22:19.360]  ago, Facebook banned accounts because they said they, quote, sought to inflame social
[3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:22.880]  and political tensions in the United States, which is what the left does on a second by
[3:22:22.880 --> 3:22:28.160]  second basis by literally calling to harass Trump supporters and Trump cabinet members.
[3:22:28.160 --> 3:22:30.360]  But this was done after Facebook.
[3:22:30.360 --> 3:22:32.000]  And this is enrolling stone, by the way.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:36.840]  This is a liberal publication by Matt Taibi, who actually defended you.
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:42.360]  Facebook was held in its efforts to wipe out these dangerous memes by the Atlantic Council
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:47.800]  on whose board you'll find confidence inspiring names like Henry Kissinger, former CIA chief
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:52.800]  Michael Hayden, former acting CIA head Michael Morel, and former Porscheira Homeland Security
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:54.760]  chief Michael Chertoff.
[3:22:54.760 --> 3:22:56.920]  So this was the deep state.
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:22:59.600]  This wasn't just social media companies in the far left.
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:05.960]  This was the deep state itself, working with Facebook to ban these pages because they inflamed
[3:23:05.960 --> 3:23:11.160]  political tensions, similar to how, as he said in Brazil, Bolsonaro, who is number one
[3:23:11.160 --> 3:23:12.160]  in the polls.
[3:23:12.160 --> 3:23:13.320]  They call him the Brazilian Trump.
[3:23:13.320 --> 3:23:14.320]  He's probably going to win.
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:17.840]  They banned a network of pages that supported him.
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:22.200]  They banned 30,000 pro-Lupin accounts before the French election.
[3:23:22.200 --> 3:23:23.760]  It worked on that occasion.
[3:23:23.760 --> 3:23:25.560]  But this is a direct link.
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:30.760]  What I want to know is what conversations went on behind the scenes for this to be a
[3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:32.440]  coordinated campaign?
[3:23:32.440 --> 3:23:37.600]  And did they involve the Atlantic Council, given we know those conversations took place
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:41.160]  before Facebook banned these accounts a few weeks ago?
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:43.080]  So it's this whole, oh, it's just a private company.
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:44.080]  No, it isn't.
[3:23:44.080 --> 3:23:45.920]  They're literally working with lawmakers.
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:50.440]  They're working with the deep state itself to crush free speech.
[3:23:50.440 --> 3:23:52.760]  This is not a private company argument.
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:23:57.440]  This is about social media being the new public commons, and that's why we need people like
[3:23:57.440 --> 3:24:02.480]  Brad Parscale to merely tweet about it would be nice and some kind of executive action,
[3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:08.440]  a digital online bill of rights, because this has just got out of control.
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:14.280]  Yeah, I'm going to continue the show because Alex has gone now, but this is an article
[3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:15.280]  out Rolling Stone.
[3:24:15.280 --> 3:24:20.280]  I just mentioned Matt Tavey, beware the slippery slope of Facebook censorship.
[3:24:20.280 --> 3:24:26.040]  He outlines the fact that they were in discussions with deep state with Kissinger, Hayden, Morel,
[3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:31.840]  Chertoff. He continues to say, when Facebook works with the government and want to be star
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:37.880]  chamber organizations like the Atlantic Council to delete sites on national security grounds
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:43.360]  using secret methodology, it opens the door to nightmare possibilities that you'd find
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:45.360]  in dystopian novels.
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:50.760]  Okay, that's not Alex Jones saying that as Matt Tavey of Rolling Stone magazine, somebody
[3:24:50.760 --> 3:24:55.880]  who hates him for wars and hates Alex Jones, but even he came to our defense.
[3:24:55.880 --> 3:25:02.040]  He said the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has always been the
[3:25:02.040 --> 3:25:06.720]  real threat. This is why breaking them up should have long ago become an urgent national
[3:25:06.720 --> 3:25:09.880]  priority. They're a monopoly.
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:14.320]  He continues instead, as was obvious during the Senate hearing with Mark Zuckerberg, politicians
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:18.240]  are more interested in using them to curtail the power of these companies. The platforms
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:22.960]  for their part will cave rather than be regulated. The end game couldn't be clearer. This is
[3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:29.760]  how authoritarian marriages begin and people should be very worried. He mentioned Zuckerberg.
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:34.360]  They asked Zuckerberg to define hate speech in that infamous hearing back a couple of
[3:25:34.360 --> 3:25:39.840]  months ago. He couldn't do it. He couldn't define what hate speech was. So how does Facebook
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:46.100]  know what hate speech is when they ban info wars, when they provide zero specific examples
[3:25:46.100 --> 3:25:50.920]  of what we said to ban info wars? You've got a situation in Europe where the European
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:56.120]  Union, again, a government body, the government of Germany, other governments in Europe are
[3:25:56.120 --> 3:26:01.800]  working with social media companies, not only to censor free speech on social media, but
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:08.120]  then police action is involved. These people get home visits from the police. They're prosecuted
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:13.440]  in Sweden. This is an even bigger problem. They're prosecuted, interrogated if they criticize
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:18.680]  Islamic immigration, for example. And in some cases, literally put in prison. Okay, when
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:24.480]  you've got the government working with big industry to not only quash people's rights,
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:30.640]  but to put them in prison for what they say on the internet, that is not my private company
[3:26:30.640 --> 3:26:37.680]  argument anymore. That is authoritarian political oppression. And it's happening across the
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:44.000]  West. Absolutely incredible. And now as Rolling Stone magazine reports, deep state individuals
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:49.400]  are working with Facebook to crush freedom of speech, to ban pages that quote, inflame
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:55.200]  political tensions. You could say anything inflames political tensions. You have a disagreement
[3:26:55.200 --> 3:27:00.480]  with somebody on Facebook about a political issue that inflames political tensions. It
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:07.520]  could be anything. It's entirely subjective. And that's why this is so dangerous. Breitbart
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:11.560]  reports. By the way, we've got Ezra Levante coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk
[3:27:11.560 --> 3:27:16.800]  about this more rebel media owner. Breitbart reports zero transparency, six questions that
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:22.920]  tech giants refuse to answer about the in four Wars ban. Number one, what content specifically
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:27.000]  from in four Wars Alex Jones was found to be hate speech and otherwise rule breaking.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:34.280]  They did not cite any specific example. Two, when was the decision to ban them made? What
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:39.540]  changed of the course of a few days from when you defended not banning in four Wars content?
[3:27:39.540 --> 3:27:43.800]  Because remember, Facebook came out when CNN was at the height of this lobbying campaign
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:48.200]  to silence their competition. Again, in places like Russia, the government shuts down the
[3:27:48.200 --> 3:27:53.320]  media in America, CNN does it. They asked, they asked Facebook about this. Facebook said,
[3:27:53.320 --> 3:27:58.680]  we support free speech. What changed? What changed Facebook? What secret conversations
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:05.040]  were going on behind the scenes? Question number three remains unanswered. Who made the decision
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:09.440]  to take down in four Wars? It's unlikely that the decision to ban in four Wars was taken
[3:28:09.440 --> 3:28:15.560]  by rank and file content review. Again, all coordinated Spotify, Apple, Pinterest, Facebook,
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:21.400]  Google, YouTube, all coordinated within 12 hours of each other. This was a coordinated
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:27.800]  purge. It wasn't an enforcement of terms of service. That is a lie. Number four, will
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:31.400]  you provide clear guidelines on hate speech, including defining hate speech in a manner
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:37.440]  that is clear to all users? Because at this point, hate speech is anything that they disagree
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:44.120]  with. This is politically motivated censorship. This is the purge we have arrived. We'll be
[3:28:44.120 --> 3:28:48.920]  back in the next segment with rebel media owner Ezra Levant to talk about big tech censorship.

[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:10.120]  is you, the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[3:30:10.120 --> 3:30:14.000]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:18.880]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:23.360]  You are the info war. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:29.240]  than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[3:30:29.240 --> 3:30:34.160]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking

[3:30:39.560 --> 3:30:43.400]  articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening
[3:30:43.400 --> 3:30:49.320]  to. The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward

[3:30:54.000 --> 3:30:59.920]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage. And that's why we need you to go to the site
[3:30:59.920 --> 3:31:04.960]  now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals. Please consider
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:14.160]  a contribution 25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[3:31:14.160 --> 3:31:19.680]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they

[3:31:25.720 --> 3:31:32.400]  with you wherever you go? Well, now you could do just that with the new official info wars

[3:31:55.640 --> 3:32:00.880]  thing was for me like first demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then
[3:32:00.880 --> 3:32:06.120]  sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook
[3:32:06.120 --> 3:32:11.560]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia. And then walla two weeks
[3:32:11.560 --> 3:32:18.000]  later ban info wars completely off of the dozens of major platforms where we were all
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:24.680]  in the top five or top 10 news feeds. Go to info wars.com forward slash show subscribe

[3:32:48.120 --> 3:32:52.480]  reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info. This
[3:32:52.480 --> 3:33:08.000]  is what they don't want you to see. You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from
[3:33:08.000 --> 3:33:15.840]  the info wars.com studios. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host
[3:33:15.840 --> 3:33:18.000]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:25.520]  Back in the most censored news show in the Western Hemisphere. And now I'm delighted
[3:33:25.520 --> 3:33:31.480]  to be joined by my guest Ezra Levant. He is the owner of rebel media, the rebel dot media
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:33.640]  Ezra. Welcome.
[3:33:33.640 --> 3:33:38.440]  Thanks very much. This is a dark day for freedom. And of course they're coming for info wars
[3:33:38.440 --> 3:33:43.520]  today. Tomorrow it'll be Breitbart and the rebel. And after that Fox News.
[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:47.280]  Now I want to get into this Ezra because you did a series of tweets about this yesterday
[3:33:47.280 --> 3:33:51.440]  addressing this. Oh, it's just a private company. They can ban who they like argument. Okay,
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:57.280]  you've got governments working in concert with big tech in Europe to prosecute hate speech.
[3:33:57.280 --> 3:34:00.880]  People literally having a knock on their door from the police. They're prosecuted fines
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:06.720]  sent to prison for what they say on Facebook in on many occasions. You've got MPs in Britain
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:11.600]  with Tommy Robinson having meetings with social media companies demanding his censorship.
[3:34:11.600 --> 3:34:15.920]  You've got democratic lawmakers in the US, Deutsche and Quigley demanding that Facebook,
[3:34:15.920 --> 3:34:20.800]  Twitter, YouTube, censor info wars. Today we've got Democratic Senator Murphy asserting
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:24.960]  that this should just be the beginning and the other conservative news website should
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:29.560]  be censored. Given that this was all done Ezra to info wars within a, you know, 12 hour
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:35.720]  time frame. Was this, this, this wasn't ran. This wasn't enforcement of terms of service.
[3:34:35.720 --> 3:34:40.240]  Was it how likely is it in your view and you tweet about this that in addition to all the
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:45.760]  public lobbying on behalf of CNN, et cetera, that there was private lobbying going on behind
[3:34:45.760 --> 3:34:50.680]  the scenes to have info wars banned. And that that's why this happened in such a small time
[3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:57.600]  frame. Oh, it's not even a question of if it's a it's a certainty. In Canada, there
[3:34:57.600 --> 3:35:03.280]  was a story that leaked out earlier this year. Justin Trudeau, our prime minister, personally
[3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:08.760]  threatened Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. He told her that if she
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:16.200]  did not censor political opinions, conservative opinions that he deemed fake news in advance
[3:35:16.200 --> 3:35:23.480]  of the 2019 Canadian election, if she didn't do that for him, he would do that to her through
[3:35:23.480 --> 3:35:27.480]  regulation. So this was reported in the largest newspaper in Canada, a liberal newspaper
[3:35:27.480 --> 3:35:33.120]  by the way. And and of course, I'm not sure if you've actually watched it, Paul, but a
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:37.760]  parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom, they had a YouTube spokesman and they were
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:42.360]  swarming him. Why won't you ban that? Why won't you ban that? Why do I have to see Tommy
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:47.680]  Robinson this and that? I know Tommy Robinson has done some work with with info wars. So
[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:54.880]  these MPs do not even hide their demand that social media companies act as censors. It's
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:36:00.240]  a very clever move. And I'm not sure if they learned it from China. But there's two ways
[3:36:00.240 --> 3:36:05.040]  to censor someone. You could send a policeman, you could send a lawyer, sort of what they
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:11.000]  did to Tommy Robinson. But that's expensive. And that's embarrassing. And there's processes
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  and appeals. And it's messy. On the other hand, you can just have a company make a private
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:26.800]  decision, no warning, no explanation, no appeal, no puff of smoke, and you just unperson someone.
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:33.200]  And that's what happened in France. Shortly after Brexit, and then Donald Trump was elected
[3:36:33.200 --> 3:36:40.280]  in 2016, the next big election was France. And all of a sudden, Mark Zuckerberg deleted
[3:36:40.280 --> 3:36:49.480]  not one, not 10, not 30, but 30,000 Facebook pages in France that supported Marine Le Pen.
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:54.800]  There was no hearing. We have no transparency. Did Emmanuel Macron just give a list to Zuckerberg?
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:37:00.600]  Does Zuckerberg just use some machine algorithm? We don't know. But imagine if France had tried
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:06.880]  to prosecute 30,000 hate criminals, if they had tried to use the instruments of the state.
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:11.160]  But instead, they just picked up the phone to Zuckerberg and said, do it. And Zuckerberg's
[3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:18.080]  in peril because, of course, Facebook, Google, these companies are constantly being hyper-regulated.
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:22.760]  I think it was Google that was just fined $5 billion by the European Union. So there's
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:29.040]  a quid pro quo. You censor our political enemies, and maybe we won't crack down on your tax
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:34.680]  avoidance. Maybe we won't hold you responsible for hate speech. If you let the Tommy Robinsons
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:39.840]  and the Alex Joneses and the Paul Joseph Watson's of the world continue, well, then
[3:37:39.840 --> 3:37:44.880]  expect a lot of scrutiny, and we may prosecute you corporately for hate speech. So these
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:52.480]  companies, I don't let them off the hook at all. But they are in a crony relationship.
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:58.040]  They are in a symbiosis with government. They do with government's dirty work. Government
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:05.400]  outsources censorship to them and may get unlisted benefits in return.
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:09.840]  The other example of that is in Brazil, where you have Bolsonaro, who they call the Brazilian
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:15.960]  Trump. He's the populace leading in the polls. An entire network of huge pro-Bolsonaro
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:21.440]  accounts shut down by Facebook just a couple of months before their election. This is clearly
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:26.920]  collusion, clearly election meddling. And the other aspect of it is the unpersoning,
[3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:32.400]  the Chinese social credit score aspect of this because Alex Jones has been banned on
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:39.400]  LinkedIn. Okay, this is just a profile of individuals. You cannot upload media content
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:43.920]  to LinkedIn. So that doesn't that throw the whole hate speech argument out of the window
[3:38:43.920 --> 3:38:51.880]  and prove that this was a coordinated tech purge to unperson 1984 style Alex Jones completely
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:56.880]  to then create this mob outrage wave, which would have him de-platformed on every other
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:02.720]  platform. Yeah, I mean, if you remember in 1984, Winston
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:10.120]  was working in the Ministry of Truth where he would change newspaper headlines. Historically,
[3:39:10.120 --> 3:39:15.240]  he would go back and change newspapers so that they were always at war with this country
[3:39:15.240 --> 3:39:23.920]  instead of that country. And they would throw the old stories down the memory hole. That's
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:28.600]  what it was called. They are trying to throw Alex Jones and Inforwards down the memory
[3:39:28.600 --> 3:39:35.760]  hole. What's so incredible is it's entire, his entire repertoire of work. And, you know,
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:40.960]  people can object to this or that. And Facebook might say, well, this post breaks this rule.
[3:39:40.960 --> 3:39:45.920]  And YouTube might say, well, that actually breaks this law. They could. But to throw
[3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:54.880]  more than a decade's his whole body of work out, including countless innocuous or or historically
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:40:00.640]  valuable interviews with political leaders with activists, just to the president at all.
[3:40:00.640 --> 3:40:03.840]  You know, let me share with you. I don't know how many minutes we have. Interrupt me if
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:09.880]  I'm going on too long. There was an ancient Roman concept. I'm going to say it in Latin.
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:19.280]  It means to damn the memory of a political enemy. Sometimes it was an emperor who got
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:23.920]  into a quarrel with his brother, killed his brother. Well, he had to erase not just the
[3:40:23.920 --> 3:40:30.000]  crime but any mention of that person. So any paintings that person's face had to be scraped
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:36.880]  out. Any sculptures had to be destroyed. Any laws passed by that person were annulled.
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:41.760]  It's like the Stalinist tactic of removing someone from a photo. What we're seeing by
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:49.280]  tech companies is a damn ratio. Memoria and soon you'll type in Alex Jones in a Google
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:54.000]  search engine or info wars and maybe bright part and maybe one day Paul Joseph Watson
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:01.120]  and Ezra Levant and nothing will show up and people will say, did that happen? Do I remember
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:06.120]  that right or was it thrown down the memory hole because I can't even read the record
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:11.160]  for myself? I can't even see what was said for myself. Oh, well, it was probably just
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:12.160]  a rumor.
[3:41:12.160 --> 3:41:17.960]  Yeah, who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:22.800]  Meanwhile, this is this gets to the same point. They're literally attempting to amend reality
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:28.360]  in real time. We have this Sarah Jong hired to the New York Times editorial board after
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:33.120]  a series of racist tweets, which the New York Times admitted they'd seen and knew about
[3:41:33.120 --> 3:41:38.440]  before the interview. So they still hired her. She had the right consensus mindset.
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:44.840]  Her Wikipedia page, that controversy, which was in the news for days last week, one of
[3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:50.520]  the biggest stories in America, obviously the biggest issue of her career of her as
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:56.680]  a person. And it's completely excised from her Wikipedia page because it's basically
[3:41:56.680 --> 3:42:00.800]  run by hysterical far left editors. So again, it goes to the heart of they're literally
[3:42:00.800 --> 3:42:06.840]  changing not just history, but the nature of immediate reality itself to try and hide
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:08.440]  their own hypocrisy.
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:13.680]  Yeah, you know, Paul, when I was a student and I was learning about politics and philosophy
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:18.440]  and economics, like a lot of young people, I thought libertarianism was appealing and
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:25.560]  property rights and, you know, like many young people. And so the traditional libertarian
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:29.880]  argument would be, oh, well, these are private companies. If you don't like it, start your
[3:42:29.880 --> 3:42:36.640]  own. But the idea of starting your own Facebook, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, start your own
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:40.720]  Internet, that's about as likely. And I'm borrowing this line from Michael Tracy, who's
[3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:47.200]  a principal leftist on this issue. He says, starting your own Internet is about as possible
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:52.640]  as telling someone in the 1890s, oh, we don't like buying oil from Standard Oil and J.D.
[3:42:52.640 --> 3:42:53.640]  Rockefeller.
[3:42:53.640 --> 3:42:57.720]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue. Info Wars

[3:45:16.640 --> 3:45:22.040]  supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:26.640]  have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[3:45:26.640 --> 3:45:30.800]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to
[3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:35.360]  your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:41.200]  stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:45.720]  of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused

[3:46:57.320 --> 3:47:14.320]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show. News, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones
[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:19.480]  show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:25.320]  We are back live on the most censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere right now with
[3:47:25.320 --> 3:47:34.000]  Ezra LeBan of Rebel Media. A liberal, one of the few real liberals left, no fan of
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:38.520]  info wars, he said, quote, the sheer market power of these companies over information
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:44.120]  flow has always been the real threat. This is why breaking them up should have long ago
[3:47:44.120 --> 3:47:48.640]  become an urgent national priority. Ezra, you were finishing up with a Michael Tracy
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:52.520]  quote there and people say, oh, you're banned on Facebook, you're banned on YouTube, you're
[3:47:52.520 --> 3:47:56.320]  banned on wherever. Why don't you just start your own social media network? Because that's
[3:47:56.320 --> 3:47:59.880]  really simple and easy, isn't it? You don't need much money to do that. You don't need
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:04.280]  much resources. What's your answer to that? Because it's something that's still here.
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:09.280]  It would be like someone 100 years ago saying, you know, the railway, the steel, the coal,
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:14.520]  the oil is all owned by JD Rockefeller. I have to deal with his monopoly and he's busting
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:22.000]  me up. Oh, just start your own railroad. Start your own bank, your own refinery. It's impossible
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:30.680]  to do, but of course, steel, oil, coal, that's all important, but it didn't control our information,
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:40.240]  our mind, our perception, our politics. The dominance by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Mark
[3:48:40.240 --> 3:48:46.240]  Zuckerberg is unparalleled. Their wealth is on the order of JD Rockefeller, but their
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:52.960]  wealth of power over the population is much higher. And it took a rebel president named
[3:48:52.960 --> 3:48:58.840]  Teddy Roosevelt, who was sort of an independent at a bull moose party. It took a rebel president
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:04.920]  to finally bust up the trusts. And I think Donald Trump has some of Teddy Roosevelt's
[3:49:04.920 --> 3:49:11.800]  qualities in him. And more to the point, if Donald Trump doesn't bust up these monopolies,
[3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:17.280]  they will bust him up. That's what the timing here, you know, info wars that Alex Jones
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:22.120]  has been doing it for almost 20 years. But to do this right now, all of the companies
[3:49:22.120 --> 3:49:26.920]  at once, three months before the midterms elections, don't tell me that's a coincidence.
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:35.160]  And this is political. If Donald Trump doesn't stop it, they will make the Democrats win.
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:40.800]  Now, I just want to zoom out as we look at it from this perspective. Since the election,
[3:49:40.800 --> 3:49:45.760]  since November 2016, Milo has been viciously smeared. You know, Alex Jones has been hit
[3:49:45.760 --> 3:49:50.320]  by one nearly a dozen lawsuits at this point. He's now deleted off the Internet. Tommy has
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:54.280]  been imprisoned. You know, people connected to the Trump campaign have been imprisoned.
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:49:59.240]  Lawrence Southern banned from the UK, Breitbart lost most of its advertisers. Trump supporters
[3:49:59.240 --> 3:50:03.440]  up and down the country being physically attacked. This is punishment, isn't it, Ezra? This
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:07.120]  is punishment for Hillary Clinton losing the election.
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:12.880]  Well, absolutely. I mean, the concept of a deep state. I mean, the irony here is so many
[3:50:12.880 --> 3:50:19.160]  of Alex Jones' speculations and fears that were mocked. Well, haven't they come true?
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:24.240]  What we've learned about the CIA and the other intelligence agencies and the FBI setting
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:29.120]  up Donald Trump with a fake dossier. I mean, that's the stuff that if Alex Jones would
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:33.280]  have mused about it two years ago, people would have said, oh, you're crazy. You know,
[3:50:33.280 --> 3:50:38.800]  that and your aliens talk. Well, my God, it's come true. And if Alex Jones would have said,
[3:50:38.800 --> 3:50:46.960]  I predict that all of the social media companies will within 12 hour course of time, all independently
[3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:54.600]  by coincidence, decide to ban and delete everything I've done, damnatio memoriae.
[3:50:54.600 --> 3:50:59.280]  People say, stop with the conspiracy theories. Well, what do you call it when it happens?
[3:50:59.280 --> 3:51:03.760]  It just happened. But the thing is, how do you how do people know one day they go to
[3:51:03.760 --> 3:51:08.280]  a YouTube site and the next time it's not there and they just sort of say, huh, oh,
[3:51:08.280 --> 3:51:12.640]  I guess something happened and they move on. Only people whose volume knobs are turned
[3:51:12.640 --> 3:51:17.160]  way up like you and me and those following closely will even know it. That's the problem
[3:51:17.160 --> 3:51:21.760]  with being unpersoned is that most people say, oh yeah, you know, there used to be some
[3:51:21.760 --> 3:51:25.120]  place I would get some information. I wonder what happened to that guy. Oh, well, I'll
[3:51:25.120 --> 3:51:30.280]  just turn on the young Turks. And that's the thing. The young Turks, in my mind, was sort
[3:51:30.280 --> 3:51:35.720]  of a counterbalance to Alex Jones and Info Wars. They were edgy. They were profane.
[3:51:35.720 --> 3:51:40.680]  They were on the left as Alex Jones and Info Wars are on the right. But the president
[3:51:40.680 --> 3:51:46.600]  of YouTube would pose for glamour shots with the young Turks. They would get massive injections
[3:51:46.600 --> 3:51:53.160]  of venture capital funds. They were the toast of the town. They were not demonetized as
[3:51:53.160 --> 3:52:00.880]  the right was. So it's not a legitimate policy violation. I'm not saying that in every single
[3:52:00.880 --> 3:52:04.920]  video Alex Jones has ever done, he hasn't violated a policy here and there. But this
[3:52:04.920 --> 3:52:09.920]  complete erasing and depersoning, if that were meted out equally, well, we know it's
[3:52:09.920 --> 3:52:15.440]  not. And look at CNN and the New York Times egging on Twitter. They're saying Twitter
[3:52:15.440 --> 3:52:20.560]  is the last company that hasn't blackballed Info Wars. Will they do it? The New York Times
[3:52:20.560 --> 3:52:25.680]  is literally having an online poll. Now, it's going horribly wrong. People are answering
[3:52:25.680 --> 3:52:33.560]  the freedom answer. CNN, lobbying. And Paul, it's not just their business rivals they're
[3:52:33.560 --> 3:52:39.680]  trying to shut up. It's their idea rivals. Because Info Wars, and obviously none of us
[3:52:39.680 --> 3:52:45.200]  agrees with everything on the channel. I mean, I don't watch a lot of it. But it's a dissident
[3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:49.760]  voice. And for God's sakes, allow a dissident voice. Even if you don't like a dissident
[3:52:49.760 --> 3:52:55.960]  voice, allow a dissident voice. CNN, the New York Times, the media party, they are in ideas
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:53:02.200]  cartel and they don't like a dissident voice. And if Alex Jones and Info Wars is as crazy
[3:53:02.200 --> 3:53:07.240]  as they say he is, well, then what are they afraid of? Why don't they allow a dissident
[3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:08.240]  voice?
[3:53:08.240 --> 3:53:13.840]  Exactly. And there's a huge jealousy aspect to this as well, which is based around the
[3:53:13.840 --> 3:53:17.960]  fact that to have a successful presence on a platform like YouTube, you have to have
[3:53:17.960 --> 3:53:22.360]  a personality. You have to be engaging. You have to build up that loyalty and that trust
[3:53:22.360 --> 3:53:26.800]  with your audience so they keep coming back. The mainstream media, the hacks who work for
[3:53:26.800 --> 3:53:31.560]  them don't have personalities. Nobody cares what Brian Stelter has to say. Certainly young
[3:53:31.560 --> 3:53:38.240]  people don't care what he has to say. My demographic is 18 to 35. CNN at this point is what? Over
[3:53:38.240 --> 3:53:43.760]  70. This is what drives their jealousy and their bitter hatred as to why they want to
[3:53:43.760 --> 3:53:49.040]  silence their competition. It's also about removing your opportunity to have a platform
[3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:54.960]  to defend yourself against their constant smears. It's very sinister in the way it works.
[3:53:54.960 --> 3:53:59.760]  I just want you to quickly talk about, you sent me this legal memo earlier on email,
[3:53:59.760 --> 3:54:04.360]  Packingham versus North Carolina. This was a Supreme Court case that determined cyberspace
[3:54:04.360 --> 3:54:09.360]  and social media to be a public square. Is that correct? Expand on that for me.
[3:54:09.360 --> 3:54:15.440]  That's right. I'm not an expert in U.S. constitutional law, but there was a case just in the last
[3:54:15.440 --> 3:54:21.240]  year or so where the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously, it was a unanimous
[3:54:21.240 --> 3:54:25.680]  ruling. There's a lot of rulings in there about how the social media is the town square
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:30.560]  of the day. I won't get into the facts of that case. It was someone who was being banned
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:34.920]  by a state law from having a social media account, but all the judges said, no, you
[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:41.840]  can't do that. And quoting judge after judge on the right and the left, the entire spectrum
[3:54:41.840 --> 3:54:47.160]  of the Supreme Court said social media is the modern town square.
[3:54:47.160 --> 3:54:53.240]  One of the judges, I think it was Alito said, some people live their lives there. So for
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:54:57.760]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, a handful of San Francisco executives to say, no, you're
[3:54:57.760 --> 3:55:03.080]  banned. You're deperson. That may well be a violation of the First Amendment. Don't
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:08.200]  take it from me. Take it from all nine judges on the Supreme Court of the United States.
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:14.120]  I think Alex Jones and Infowars should sue because this is tantamount to a telephone
[3:55:14.120 --> 3:55:18.440]  company calling you up one day and saying, Hey, Paul, we've been listening to your phone
[3:55:18.440 --> 3:55:23.200]  calls on our cell phone company and we don't like what you're saying. We're going to ban
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:26.840]  you from using the phone and all the other phone companies are banning you from using
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:30.520]  the phone and we're deleting your phone number. And if you don't like it, just invent your
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:36.120]  own phone company. That's what it's like when these neutral platforms decide to be editors
[3:55:36.120 --> 3:55:41.520]  and censors, then they're subject to the First Amendment. And I think that Alex Jones and
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:47.040]  Infowars should not go quietly. Not that they ever would, but I think they should sue and
[3:55:47.040 --> 3:55:53.360]  they should find true supporters of free speech, including if there is some version of the ACLU
[3:55:53.360 --> 3:55:55.800]  that hasn't gone silent as a church mouse.
[3:55:55.800 --> 3:56:00.160]  Exactly. I mean, where is the line in the sun? People are already banned on Patreon
[3:56:00.160 --> 3:56:04.520]  from making money for their content. What's next? Are they going to ban bank accounts?
[3:56:04.520 --> 3:56:08.200]  Are they going to ban the ability for people to get mortgages and have houses? I mean,
[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:12.360]  where is the line in the sun here? Just in the final minute, though, tell people about
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:16.880]  where they can find you on Twitter and rebel media. And do we need some kind of executive
[3:56:16.880 --> 3:56:20.520]  action on this? Is that the only solution remaining to us?
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:24.320]  I think if Donald Trump doesn't do it, it's not going to get done. Thanks for the invitation.
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:28.720]  Folks want to follow me. I'm at twitter.com slash Ezra Levant. That's just my name. And
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:33.720]  folks, I'm doing my whole show on this tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern time. If folks want to watch
[3:56:33.720 --> 3:56:39.880]  that, that's at the rebel.media. And I tell you, in five seconds, I'll tell you, don't
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:44.160]  joke about banks. We could not find a single bank in the United Kingdom that would let
[3:56:44.160 --> 3:56:49.560]  us open up an account when Tommy Robinson worked for us. They are already banning us
[3:56:49.560 --> 3:56:52.880]  in financial institutions in the United Kingdom.
[3:56:52.880 --> 3:56:58.040]  Absolutely sinister. All right, we'll leave it there as the rebel.media. Thanks for joining
[3:56:58.040 --> 3:57:00.680]  us. Appreciate it. Thanks, Paul.
[3:57:00.680 --> 3:57:05.680]  All right, there goes Ezra Levant again in the final 40 seconds here. I want to encourage
[3:57:05.680 --> 3:57:10.040]  you to get the products at infowarsstore.com. They haven't banned them yet. Maybe they'll
[3:57:10.040 --> 3:57:14.160]  find some way to prevent us buying the products to sell to you. Maybe that'll be the next
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:19.880]  stage. Please get the info wars app before it's banned. If you can download that app
[3:57:19.880 --> 3:57:24.360]  before it's banned, then at least it's safe on your phone and you can actually use it
[3:57:24.360 --> 3:57:30.240]  at the Google Play Store or on Apple. As long as it remains uncensored, it may not be there
[3:57:30.240 --> 3:57:34.880]  for long. So please right now get the info wars app. That's going to wrap it up for the
[3:57:34.880 --> 3:57:47.280]  show. Owen Shroy is coming up with War Room Breaking News, infowars.com. Don't go away.
