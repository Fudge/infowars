[02:41.280 --> 02:47.720]  dangerous and illegal and illegitimate the criminals are that run our government that
[02:47.720 --> 02:54.440]  on record they prepare for war with veterans gun owners libertarians constitutionalist

[03:44.680 --> 03:48.800]  if you get the FBI manuals that they're giving the local police that about record for five
[03:48.800 --> 03:53.040]  years reported on by the Washington Post you name it we broke it but my point is it's
[03:53.040 --> 03:58.560]  mainstream news they say the veterans are the main enemy and that private property groups
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.280]  I mean it's just incredible treason and we have to have the wake up call that we really
[04:03.280 --> 04:09.200]  do have vicious authoritarians well of course I mean they're taking over they control the

[08:30.200 --> 08:35.600]  kick off a wider war with syria which will bring in russia and possibly china but that's
[08:35.600 --> 08:39.840]  what they want ladies and gentlemen just minutes ago we're going to play the clip here in a
[08:39.840 --> 08:46.960]  moment we were taping it the communist news network had mccain live on there saying we
[08:46.960 --> 08:52.160]  don't want just cruise missile bombardments from our missile cruisers and aircraft carriers
[08:52.160 --> 09:06.560]  i want full bombardment against Assad for the children of course i mean absolutely incredible
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.400]  to see this type of stuff going on and the evidence is mounting that it was staged by
[09:12.400 --> 09:18.240]  the rebels who've been caught three separate times caught on record staging chemical attacks
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.640]  where it came out that it was their chemicals not russian not syrian chemicals and was done
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.240]  for pr and they've been blowing up whole markets full of men women and children as they have
[09:29.240 --> 09:32.920]  outdoor markets there so the most ancient markets in the world so the most ancient continually
[09:32.920 --> 09:39.640]  operated markets in the world over three thousand years old they have been bombing mosque killing
[09:39.640 --> 09:49.800]  hundreds at a time they have been bombing you name it and obama comes out a year ago
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.160]  and says a year ago to the date of last week's chemical attack in damascus in the middle of
[09:55.160 --> 10:00.200]  a crowded city who knows who did it well they know that it's it's hard to figure out he
[10:00.200 --> 10:06.600]  comes out and he says if you do have a chemical attack i will bombard you i am the man of peace
[10:06.600 --> 10:13.480]  i am the prince of peace i am the nobel peace prize winner what a sick joke and then a year
[10:13.480 --> 10:18.720]  later there'd already been one chemical attack there were two more after that and then now
[10:18.720 --> 10:29.680]  you have this big spectacular event targeting civilians and within hours the Assad regime
[10:29.680 --> 10:36.480]  the government says yes send in the u.n inspectors and they say no it's too late then u n inspector
[10:36.480 --> 10:44.400]  show up and get shot at by snipers because this is in a war zone ladies and gentlemen
[10:44.400 --> 10:53.520]  this is in a zone there in syria where there has been over a year of fighting going back
[10:53.520 --> 11:00.920]  with both sides in a proxy war and in the last six months u.s troops have been massing
[11:00.920 --> 11:09.400]  in turkey massing in jordan and infiltrating hundreds of thousands of jihadis with cia
[11:09.400 --> 11:23.000]  and other nato and and mi6 s special air services people behind them with all sorts of tow missiles
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.200]  stinger type missiles heat seeking anti aircraft i mean it is on against russian spitznats that
[11:30.200 --> 11:36.120]  are there advising them so it's a proxy war with nato against russia this is all part
[11:36.120 --> 11:42.840]  of the encircling of russia and it's not america against russia it's america run by nato on
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.800]  record the biggest world narcotics traffickers white slavery traffickers that's kidnapped
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.040]  children's folks on record i mean they run the drugs into europe they run them into the
[11:52.040 --> 11:56.880]  u.s the whole nine yards against the russians who again the russians aren't perfect either
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.360]  i don't live in russia ever been to russia russia has a terrible gangster government
[12:01.360 --> 12:05.800]  culture but they can't even get their act together to be the high tech tyranny that
[12:05.800 --> 12:14.520]  the new world order is and so you've got a hijacked america a hijacked republic and
[12:14.520 --> 12:21.360]  our military being used to back up hardcore even the council on fine relations admits
[12:21.360 --> 12:26.320]  around 60 percent of the jihadi fighters that have been injected in by the west the last
[12:26.320 --> 12:32.320]  two and a half plus years are al-qaeda and we've got videos that we've aired of them
[12:32.320 --> 12:39.280]  with captured tanks flying al-qaeda flags just absolutely murdering blowing up churches
[12:39.280 --> 12:46.280]  chopping christians heads off blowing up synagogues blowing up mosques blowing up churches there
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.320]  are confirmed reports where they stop truck drivers on the road and if you're not a wahabi
[12:51.320 --> 12:58.600]  a sunni they just kill you right there on the spot the west is funding the most radical
[12:58.600 --> 13:04.600]  nasty people in the world to go into there and butcher the place just like laurence
[13:04.600 --> 13:10.120]  of arabia and british intelligence were funded to go into demascus previously and burn the
[13:10.120 --> 13:19.960]  place down and what year did the british go into a demascus and torch it what year what
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.800]  year was that with laurence of arabia the whole point is is that this is amazing what
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.720]  is going on and they're saying it's four children oh look they're nerve-gassed and they put
[13:30.720 --> 13:34.960]  it all over the television whenever western forces kill children you try to put it on
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.040]  your youtube channel or you try to put it on your website they try to shut your site
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.040]  down but whenever they want to war they parade the dead children all over tv and let me tell
[13:44.040 --> 13:49.560]  you folks it really freaks me out to know the evidence is overwhelming that our supposed
[13:49.560 --> 13:56.000]  government run by globalist undoubtedly the evidence is overwhelming because they've been
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.280]  caught doing it before they have the motive they stand to gain so many pieces of evidence
[14:01.280 --> 14:07.760]  that the timing the u.s. troops massing the katari troops massing the saudi troops massing
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.880]  the french troops massing the british troops massing saying they're getting ready to go
[14:11.880 --> 14:19.080]  in and then right on time they say if you use nerve gas chemical weapons we will bombard
[14:19.080 --> 14:24.000]  you and invade you and a sod goes chemical weapons aren't even good against other militaries
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.700]  in civilian areas i have these legally and lawfully i'm not about to use them the russians
[14:29.700 --> 14:34.040]  are at the basis guarding them just in case you try to blow it up you'll kill russian
[14:34.040 --> 14:39.720]  soldiers which has already happened when they cruise missled israel cruise missled about
[14:39.720 --> 14:50.920]  a month and a half ago some of some of the surface to ship missiles that they had there
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.960]  on their coast this is a big deal so back in 1918 a bunch of saudi arabians on camels
[14:59.960 --> 15:05.000]  funded by the british government went in and basically took over syria and murdered tens
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.480]  of thousands as well and it it's just a replay of that go in wreck the place because nobody's
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.000]  allowed to have a country but the new world order and those are countries that that they've
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.680]  already captured and that they're sucking dry we're all occupied by goldman sacks jp
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.760]  morgan the bank of england the roth child the rockefellers the saxcoburg gothers the
[15:26.760 --> 15:32.320]  house of orange they're all intermarried it's all a disgusting joke to these people and
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.400]  the average american just hears all that's that bad guy that that use chemical weapons
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.160]  on those kids all good we're the good guys go go in there and they're going to wreck
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.560]  the place and turn it over to al-qaeda and they're also selling the idea of if anybody
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.720]  has chemical weapons or nuclear weapons other than the new world order you're going to be
[15:50.720 --> 15:59.880]  bombarded you're going to be attacked you're going to be invaded this is global governance
[15:59.880 --> 16:05.720]  it sovereign country sitting there will have the west like libya syria egypt you name it
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.520]  go stage riots fund the opposition with weapons our media will call them demonstrators and
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.840]  activists when they blow up police stations you'll be watching singing in when they kill
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.840]  25 cops in egypt the al-qaeda people and they'll call an activist and it'll show them with
[16:19.840 --> 16:28.480]  machine guns shooting people on their activist i mean this is so sick it is so sick egypt
[16:28.480 --> 16:34.280]  was doing nothing to america libya was doing nothing to america had apologized given billions
[16:34.280 --> 16:39.040]  of reparations signed over the whole country to the big banks they're like that's not enough
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.720]  buddy we're going to take you down now but in the case of egypt that was a western installed
[16:44.720 --> 16:49.480]  group they removed to put in the destabilizing muslim brotherhood and their al-qaeda by the
[16:49.480 --> 16:53.360]  way it's al-qaeda we see the videos we post them we've played them here of them burning
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.960]  down the churches crucifying people beheading people throwing them off roofs killing hundreds
[16:57.960 --> 17:03.000]  of christians a day for the last two years straight burning down churches every day there's
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.600]  not really a church left in egypt the army's promising to rebuild it so obama cut off the
[17:08.600 --> 17:13.040]  funds and i'm not even for foreign aid because because it's only used to put evil people
[17:13.040 --> 17:17.720]  in see as soon as there's not evil in charge then they hold back the money so don't let
[17:17.720 --> 17:20.920]  them have the money for foreign aid because they're only going to use it to put evil people
[17:20.920 --> 17:26.760]  in because the globalists want to bring things down so they can buy it up cheap they're at
[17:26.760 --> 17:33.000]  war with humanity and progress they're the opposite of a renaissance they are a post
[17:33.000 --> 17:41.880]  industrial neo dark ages they are neo feudalistic scientific militarized corporist who are the
[17:41.880 --> 17:48.640]  absolute enemy of all good they are a spirit of evil that's why they dominate it takes
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.840]  a spirit of liberty to challenge them people ask what's the solution it's having a spirit
[17:53.840 --> 17:59.040]  of resistance and a spirit of justice it's becoming virtuous people again it's becoming
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.960]  honorable again if you had the spirit of god in you the spirit of liberty you would be
[18:03.960 --> 18:10.480]  outraged by the homeland security coming out saying gun owners are terrorist and do do documents
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.800]  that are public with judicial watch openly saying the george washington would not be
[18:14.800 --> 18:20.840]  welcome in today's army he was bad literally this is i'm going to cover this and show the
[18:20.840 --> 18:26.920]  document for people watching on tv but if you the fact that you're not outraged by that
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.640]  if you're a new listener you just think it's all funny you have a spirit of being dominated
[18:31.640 --> 18:36.840]  a spirit of not being able to man up and be threatened by tyranny and then automatically
[18:36.840 --> 18:43.440]  spring into action to resist it because you're insecure about yourself i'm not talking to
[18:43.440 --> 18:49.680]  our main listeners i'm talking to folks that live in denial you don't believe in yourself
[18:49.680 --> 18:56.160]  you are nothing but a hedonist at best most people aren't even living they're like jelly
[18:56.160 --> 19:01.800]  fish and so they hear all this talk and feel so overpowered by it they just think well
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.240]  i can't do anything i'll just stand down if you had the spirit of liberty in you you
[19:06.240 --> 19:09.880]  would automatically be resisting in different ways and you would get better and better at
[19:09.880 --> 19:14.880]  resisting and then we would defeat this system very very quickly but you've got to have a
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.840]  fire in the gut a fire in the mind that's what thomas jefferson talked about that's

[24:09.280 --> 24:16.880]  folks I am your host Alex Jones we're back live here let me just read some of the headlines
[24:16.880 --> 24:23.120]  about what's happening in Syria and then I'm going to contrast it with a globalist master
[24:23.120 --> 24:28.920]  plan for the globe that's why they want you dumbed down drug to the GMO the fluoride the
[24:28.920 --> 24:33.840]  aspartame is because if you're really awake and conscious you're going to want to control
[24:33.840 --> 24:38.440]  your own destiny and that and then that gets in the way of the technocrats dominating and
[24:38.440 --> 24:44.080]  controlling the future development of the planet the oligarchs just believe they're
[24:44.080 --> 24:49.040]  entitled to rule and run everything and are completely cold-blooded and all compete with
[24:49.040 --> 24:53.560]  each other on who can be the nastiest and the most evil and when you get rid of checks
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.080]  and balances you turn all of them loose and all of their minions loose to build their
[24:58.080 --> 25:08.200]  own little sub empires of tyranny and mismanagement Assad says accusations that Syria used chemical
[25:08.200 --> 25:14.600]  weapons against logic and he went on to say why on earth when they say they're going to
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.520]  invade us and are looking for an excuse why on earth would I use something against civilians
[25:20.520 --> 25:26.880]  that isn't even good militarily absolutely chemical weapons are only good if thousands
[25:26.880 --> 25:36.200]  of troops are pouring across a line and you can see them and you fly over and spray them
[25:36.200 --> 25:40.680]  they're going to have gas mask and stuff it's a purely I mean all the motives are for the
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.480]  globalist the globalist have a history of staging things a history of lying I'm a Frederick
[25:45.480 --> 25:49.960]  Nietzsche quote here you know he said that which does not kill you only makes you stronger
[25:49.960 --> 25:54.480]  he also said a history of false flags or stage terror attacks used to manipulate the minds
[25:54.480 --> 26:00.760]  of the people and individuals in sanity is rare but in groups parties nations and in
[26:00.760 --> 26:07.720]  larger thoughts it is the rule epochs Frederick Nietzsche absolutely that is so true what he
[26:07.720 --> 26:16.160]  said because it's mass psychology and you're just well everybody else says Assad must die
[26:16.160 --> 26:21.760]  and the average American literally can't even find Syria on a map on record much less name
[26:21.760 --> 26:27.200]  their state capital but they just it's a there's a guy he he wears a suit and tie but he's
[26:27.200 --> 26:31.360]  a little brown so I mean even you know even brown people are like let's kill him because
[26:31.360 --> 26:38.480]  he's different than us and let's let's get behind hurt those kids really can you find
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.520]  Damascus do you know about Damascus do you know where it is do you do you know about
[26:42.520 --> 26:46.440]  the two and a half year proxy war the war crime being committed do you know about the
[26:46.440 --> 26:54.520]  rebels being caught senators bombing Syria responsibility of civilized nations everywhere
[26:54.520 --> 27:01.960]  that's a curtain memo article up on info wars dot com and that's a quote by one of the senators
[27:01.960 --> 27:08.280]  that is the responsibility of civilized nations everywhere to bomb them immediately here's
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.960]  another one Syria's Assad says US military will fail if it intervenes I'm gonna go through
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.560]  some of these quotes the statements made by the politicians in the US and other Western
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.040]  countries represent an insult to common sense and neglect to the public opinion of citizens
[27:22.040 --> 27:26.640]  in those countries it's nonsense first they bring charges and then they collect evidence
[27:26.640 --> 27:31.520]  and it's one of the most powerful countries that does it the US they accuse us on Wednesday
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.160]  and only two days the American leadership announces they've started to collect the evidence
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.680]  they accuse our army of using chemical weapons in the area that's reportedly controlled by
[27:40.680 --> 27:46.120]  the terrorist yes it's on record that area is held by the Al Qaeda forces in fact there
[27:46.120 --> 27:50.920]  is no precise frontline between the army and the insurgents in that area and how can a
[27:50.920 --> 27:54.840]  government use chemical weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction in the area where
[27:54.840 --> 28:00.680]  government troops are concentrated this is against elementary logic well buddy Assad
[28:00.680 --> 28:07.640]  don't don't use logic by the way I misspoke Friday I said Assad's father it came out on
[28:07.640 --> 28:13.600]  telegraph and BBC would send him info our stories his father in law in England and it
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.840]  came out that the regime you know reads our site and and passes it around and says this
[28:17.840 --> 28:23.040]  is the truth listen info I don't just go along with oh Assad thinks I'm telling the truth
[28:23.040 --> 28:26.960]  he must be a good guy I don't think Assad's a good guy he's a lot better than his father
[28:26.960 --> 28:33.760]  he was democratizing the country but that's what allowed the west to infiltrate okay and
[28:33.760 --> 28:39.960]  and I guess his dad did do brutal stuff but I guess it was that or let Saudi Arabia send
[28:39.960 --> 28:43.840]  in jihadis to kill everybody and be about a thousand times worse so it doesn't become
[28:43.840 --> 28:50.240]  a lesser of two evils I'm not going to endorse that idea my point here is that this was a
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.660]  stabilizing force in the region but it's not run by the new world order so it's being
[28:54.660 --> 29:02.360]  taken down and he goes on with very well I mean all I know is I find no fault with with
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.560]  with what they're doing and what they're saying it's the truth from our research our evidence
[29:06.560 --> 29:12.520]  our sources and it continues to turn out that they're telling the truth but it just common
[29:12.520 --> 29:17.360]  sense I don't take Assad's word for it it's an area where battles are going on and then
[29:17.360 --> 29:22.640]  civilians get nerve-gassed and the west is like when they nerve gas we're going to invade
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.600]  they've already invaded with proxy soldiers we come back I'm going to play a clip of McCain
[29:26.600 --> 29:31.160]  then I'm going to give the phone number out I want to talk to active duty military personnel
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.880]  or people that recently got out of the military about the DoD training manual saying extremist
[29:35.880 --> 29:41.240]  founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military it's unbelievable it's a hundred

[33:44.840 --> 33:48.960]  you think about it where you think all this is going and then it'll be another country
[33:48.960 --> 33:53.240]  they'll say oh they did a chemical attack and then and then all the patriots in america
[33:53.240 --> 33:57.880]  the gun owners they did bombings they've all got to be arrested see we told you they're
[33:57.880 --> 34:04.200]  the terrorist that's how this false flag stuff works as niches said a history of false flag
[34:04.200 --> 34:09.760]  attacks used to manipulate the minds of the people and individuals insanity is rare but
[34:09.760 --> 34:17.400]  in groups parties nations and epochs it is the rule frederick niches yes an epochs a
[34:17.400 --> 34:22.600]  mass thought or awakening of thought and i guess you blow up your own battleship attack
[34:22.600 --> 34:29.960]  spain 1898 attack Spanish holdings you you you say the ships are attacked in 64 you go
[34:29.960 --> 34:37.960]  to war with vietnam i mean it's just over and over and over and over and over and sometimes
[34:37.960 --> 34:41.200]  they don't even attack the ships they just said they were attacked like in the case of
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.480]  gulf of tonkin in this case clearly they they killed some kids but then bbc ran photos of
[34:47.480 --> 34:54.520]  dead iraqis from 2003 saying it was the dead syrians and got caught doing it and said oh
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.880]  that was an accident so they could show a big warehouse with hundreds of dead not dozens
[34:58.880 --> 35:02.720]  of dead and then now we don't even know it looks like it wasn't thousands that were killed
[35:02.720 --> 35:08.720]  looks like it was hundreds and it happened in an area that was held by the rebels and
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.440]  it just doesn't matter it's well we got to do something we got to do something a sod's
[35:13.440 --> 35:18.880]  killing his own people obama you know we got to get behind the muslim brotherhood who's
[35:18.880 --> 35:25.080]  blowing up churches and our media won't tell anybody they're the ones attacking and the
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.320]  american people are so dumbed down so lazy that i've seen national polls out where upwards
[35:30.320 --> 35:35.600]  of 70 percent say they don't want to attack syria so i guess in a way actually the public
[35:35.600 --> 35:42.160]  isn't dumbed down but it's still kind of like yeah i'm against it but that's over there
[35:42.160 --> 35:50.720]  you know 7000 miles away or whatever 6000 7000 miles away i mean what's the big deal and
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.080]  this is imagine turning a country over where jews christians muslims of all types live in
[35:55.080 --> 36:01.320]  peace for hundreds of years over to al-qaeda so they could just run around and i watched
[36:01.320 --> 36:05.200]  the videos of these guys with their shaved heads and their al-qaeda beards just murdering
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.000]  men women and children and just getting away with it and our media covers it up and it
[36:09.000 --> 36:17.440]  makes me very angry this morning i went down to the hike and bike trail to jog and driving
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.400]  in i saw little kids getting on school buses like 745 in the morning and they were so innocent
[36:22.400 --> 36:26.840]  they were so sweet i saw group after group lined up with their parents being put on the
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.200]  bus for the first time ribs of what looked like kindergartners and first graders and
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.520]  how innocent they were and how innocent the parents were they all look like children we
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.400]  really are a nation of naive children that's what it is who've had it so good so long we
[36:40.400 --> 36:48.480]  have no idea what's done in our name and what our taxes fund worldwide pure evil pure crystalline
[36:48.480 --> 36:56.840]  evil and i get angry every time i see grips of innocent children as a warrior as any man
[36:56.840 --> 37:03.560]  supposed to be as a defender i fundamentally just see with energy to resist tyranny to
[37:03.560 --> 37:08.040]  the point of i go in a hundred different directions like like like the Tasmanian devil you know
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.920]  out of warner brothers i just cannot understand how people are not fundamentally wounded by
[37:14.920 --> 37:20.920]  what's going on and then spurred to take action they could have a gun to my head and say shut
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.560]  up you're dead i couldn't shut up about tyranny and i just don't get people that don't even
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.560]  care and they they laugh at those of us that care we're weak they're strong that they don't
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.080]  care while everything good about america is being dismantled right now the prosperity
[37:36.080 --> 37:42.400]  the future the individualism collectivism is being brought in i want to hear from military
[37:42.400 --> 37:48.320]  active military army marines navy you name it eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[37:48.320 --> 37:55.760]  thirty one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one and we will get you up and
[37:55.760 --> 38:02.440]  on the air eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one i want to tell you about a couple
[38:02.440 --> 38:06.440]  of sponsors and i'll finish up with the Assad news mentioned the dod training manual extremist
[38:06.440 --> 38:10.720]  founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military i want to ask active duty or people
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.440]  that just got out so they can currently talk about the situation their view on it what is
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.040]  it like because i run into so many special forces people ran into one last night who
[38:20.040 --> 38:24.040]  said oh yeah the special forces community you can always tell them these guys are real
[38:24.040 --> 38:27.480]  versus somebody saying they are really i don't ever run anybody who's being a fake special
[38:27.480 --> 38:31.520]  forces person they just say oh it's horrible that we fund al-qaeda we've known for decades
[38:31.520 --> 38:36.320]  and hated it and it's just absolutely destroyed morale and it's a terrible thing and yeah i
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.160]  know everything he says you know pretty much accurate and we just we're just trying to
[38:40.160 --> 38:45.960]  think what do we do how do we change this america is so immoral the general public can't even
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.520]  understand basic logic it's just what Assad said he's like well you're saying if we use
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.280]  chemical weapons you're going to invade us why would i use it in a civilian area anyways
[38:56.280 --> 39:01.320]  it's it it it defies logic that's what the special forces guys always say to me because
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.280]  you gotta be smart to be involved in all that and be able to run all those codes and have
[39:05.280 --> 39:10.040]  all those missions and you know work 18 hours a day seven days a week sometimes sometimes
[39:10.040 --> 39:14.920]  work three days in a row i mean it's just they know they know that's why they're our
[39:14.920 --> 39:19.080]  biggest group of listeners because they hear this show they know i'm not baloney pushing
[39:19.080 --> 39:25.360]  here i mean we're in trouble ladies and gentlemen the entire federal government's been taken
[39:25.360 --> 39:32.280]  over and spends all their time hiring bizarre weirdo radicals in the billion round weapons
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.960]  procurement who want race war in america that came out mainstream news last week in the
[39:36.960 --> 39:42.920]  atlantic wire that's who they're hiring is weirdo communist and black nationalist and
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.760]  and and and and and just weird muslim radicals that run homeland security i used to hear this
[39:48.760 --> 39:55.000]  stuff and think that's crazy no that's actually who they're getting i'm living in the twilight
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.920]  zone here ladies and gentlemen and and and then the government spends all day demonizing
[40:01.920 --> 40:09.720]  the founding fathers and and private property and homeschooling and they go into state police
[40:09.720 --> 40:13.000]  all over the country with straight face going the christians are your enemy we expect them
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.400]  to attack the homeschoolers are evil and it's just and it's they don't care that a bunch
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.160]  of the state police then in depth resigning or leaving or getting demoted because they're
[40:21.160 --> 40:26.440]  going to build their army against us and they are i mean do you understand this is real this
[40:26.440 --> 40:34.960]  is not a game i've got an hour long army psyops video from 1962 that we've posted on info wars
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.840]  before that they declassified about six seven years ago and you look at how they take over
[40:40.840 --> 40:45.960]  a third world country that's what they're doing here except in the training video the training
[40:45.960 --> 40:51.200]  film it's how to fight communists they're using all those systems to bring in communism but
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.400]  only in the grassroots offshore bankers control it and are exempt from the taxes and the law
[40:56.400 --> 41:02.240]  sucking everything out as a tool to absolutely bankrupt us to make us slaves and i'm sitting
[41:02.240 --> 41:07.640]  here watching the u.s. with basically vampires sucking the blood out and the united states
[41:07.640 --> 41:11.880]  is in a coma right now and the vampires are slurping as hard as they can to get the last
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.760]  bits of blood in the hearts barely beating and the trendies are dancing in the streets
[41:15.760 --> 41:21.800]  begging to fully bring it down folks they have no idea the manifest hell that they're
[41:21.800 --> 41:27.680]  going to bring in and let me tell you we will pay for 53 million abortions we will pay for
[41:27.680 --> 41:32.680]  turning all these countries over to al-qaeda we will pay that and it will all be visited
[41:32.680 --> 41:38.480]  upon us and the globalists even know that that's why they set up a system where they'll
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.640]  get us next and then they play the part of god doing all this it's unbelievable eight
[41:43.640 --> 41:50.240]  hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one briefly with all this craziness going on i

[44:10.540 --> 44:17.920]  excited about the globalist clearly staging a chemical attack in Syria and and now Assad
[44:17.920 --> 44:22.160]  saying we're going to fight there's Russians there it's all part of encircling Russia the
[44:22.160 --> 44:28.200]  Pentagon plans public it's not America attacking Russia through proxies it's the bankers who
[44:28.200 --> 44:33.040]  don't fully run Russia and the thing is Russia could turn itself over the new world order
[44:33.040 --> 44:36.720]  they're not going to back off they're going after the family they're going after the churches
[44:36.720 --> 44:42.080]  this is a corporate takeover a corporate hack of reality a hack of the environment a hack
[44:42.080 --> 44:48.280]  of the global genome not just the homo sapien sapien genome a corporate rewrite a a group
[44:48.280 --> 44:55.400]  playing God hyper intelligent cold-blooded sociopath slash genetic psychopaths inbreeding
[44:55.400 --> 45:01.920]  elite families of every major culture fusing into the fist of Satan I mean that's really
[45:01.920 --> 45:07.640]  the only way I can describe them and they have an absolute drive to hammer humanity
[45:07.640 --> 45:14.840]  and irrevocably damage us that is their spirit you go why why why didn't did every inbred
[45:14.840 --> 45:20.680]  elite do do the same thing on a smaller scale in history every culture had psychode devil
[45:20.680 --> 45:26.560]  kings with huge human sacrifices burning pits full of children skull devil worship burning
[45:26.560 --> 45:31.960]  cities mass murder rape death I mean that's what they do and we always let them take over
[45:31.960 --> 45:37.520]  and run things and bow to them and they always rip our guts out you must not submit to them
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.600]  you must resist them you must stand against them we're under attack I don't know how else
[45:42.600 --> 45:49.360]  I'm supposed to explain this to you drums drums drums in the deep they are coming this is
[45:49.360 --> 45:54.520]  not a game ladies and gentlemen you're in a war you turn the television on you're under
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.240]  attack you put your kids in public school you're under attack you go on a Walmart you're under
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.520]  attack you breathe the air you're under attack heat the GMO you're under attack you drink
[46:03.520 --> 46:08.080]  the water you're under attack it's total attack and then if you're in the military in the
[46:08.080 --> 46:11.840]  new world order in these corporate systems you're under even greater attack you're even
[46:11.840 --> 46:17.320]  more closely watched there's no winning even the top 10 new world order servants will be
[46:17.320 --> 46:23.200]  destroyed by their master if you don't believe in the devil it doesn't matter a mass psychology
[46:23.200 --> 46:34.920]  a mob psychology a mass meme a cognitive mass brain effect a hive mind all the terms the
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.360]  globalists use they're aware of all that and they're programming the subconscious programming
[46:39.360 --> 46:44.280]  the dark wicked archetypes so they control the world because they resonate with it it's
[46:44.280 --> 46:48.800]  who they are you've got to just understand they're evil why did good people always get
[46:48.800 --> 46:54.400]  abused by con artists and criminals because they expect other people to be good they expect
[46:54.400 --> 46:57.920]  other people to be like them why do women get in the car with a serial killer because
[46:57.920 --> 47:05.280]  he's sharp dressed because he looks nice he's well spoken he's sharp dressed it's the same
[47:05.280 --> 47:14.320]  thing we're in a crisis 800 259 9231 we're gonna go to your calls Corey is active army
[47:14.320 --> 47:21.400]  Dave is retired police U.S. Capitol security David's active army in Hawaii Joe Mike's ex
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.920]  army Ranger chemical warfare Iraq we're gonna go to all of you briefly here's McCain on
[47:26.920 --> 47:32.920]  CNN just about an hour ago this is McCain saying hey we don't need just cruise missiles
[47:32.920 --> 47:39.880]  we need to bomb that place up one side now in the other here it is the president Obama
[47:39.880 --> 47:45.280]  the president of the United States over a year ago said that if Bashar Assad use chemical
[47:45.280 --> 47:51.680]  weapons it crosses a red line we know for sure that he's used them at least once oh
[47:51.680 --> 48:00.600]  now here's the second time total I think horrific and if the United States unbelievable by and
[48:00.600 --> 48:09.720]  doesn't take very serious action not just launching some cruise missiles then again our credibility
[48:09.720 --> 48:16.480]  in the world is diminished even more if there's any left a white house full source today tells
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.360]  you then the president has a what is it about singing in like most of their broadcasters
[48:20.360 --> 48:27.800]  are British I'd like to go into England everybody was American it'd be weird I mean I guess we
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.640]  just go back to the queen running America this is what we do here now exactly the other
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.400]  thing that makes me sound smarter doesn't go I mean I could talk in that voice if you
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.920]  like the point is is that let's go to your phone calls and they show before that all
[48:42.920 --> 48:48.320]  the US ships massing and the Russian ships massing I mean this is biblical let's go
[48:48.320 --> 48:53.240]  to Corey in Connecticut is active army then we'll go to everybody else Corey thanks for
[48:53.240 --> 48:55.440]  calling in you're on the air what's your take on all this
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.000]  well what's going on Alex the big take here you got me fired up especially with that
[49:00.000 --> 49:07.000]  McCain message I just love to even call out McCain right out on the air now and say that
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.240]  he's a liar because even back in 06 and 07 for our deployments especially with 10th group
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.640]  special forces needed the chemical warfare guys they were noticing that Missoulle being
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.480]  45 minutes from each section of the border of Syria and Iran was going to be the choke
[49:18.480 --> 49:22.320]  point the funnel point after they got everybody out of Baghdad so I'm going to just call that
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.160]  out and say that's complete garbage because they were funneling the weapons in right through
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.520]  that city they still are but the other issue was that I wanted to bring up in topic I'm
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.560]  going to be shooting a YouTube video tonight about this is a the big warning signal is
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.240]  pretty much military contracting you have to have a contract before you enter into a
[49:39.240 --> 49:44.080]  country and or start sending in companies like Haliburton like with Dick Cheney what
[49:44.080 --> 49:47.880]  he was doing with Iraq but there's a huge issue with that is that those are pretty much
[49:47.880 --> 49:52.960]  the warning signals what companies are already contracted to go into Syria these I mean three
[49:52.960 --> 49:57.520]  six months in advance they have to have the contracts up to get these guys on the ground
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.440]  and even still and currently with Afghanistan and Iraq here you have John McCain state no
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.040]  chemical weapons blah blah blah blah blah were used by Assad while I'm again calling
[50:06.040 --> 50:11.000]  BS on that because if you look today there was another I believe a Twitter account on
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  NSNBC or something like that to where one of the guys from the Al-Nusra front came out
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.680]  literally just a few hours ago and stated that yes we have strongholds that are being
[50:20.680 --> 50:27.240]  held at the Syrian Iraq border and that they are moving them into Syria through Iraq well
[50:27.240 --> 50:31.160]  that's what I was about to say is that it's actually come out in the back of the paper
[50:31.160 --> 50:36.800]  quite a bit that in Jordan and over on the Iraq border and in Turkey that they have US
[50:36.800 --> 50:43.080]  military bases there training the al Qaeda and jihadis to inject them but as you said
[50:43.080 --> 50:49.800]  the main area is out of Iraq and that Israel it came out has ambulances and and and other
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.960]  gear and they're they're in the Golan and are actually helping them as well I mean this
[50:54.960 --> 51:00.760]  they've got Syria surrounded and and it's it's so incredible what a people you know
[51:00.760 --> 51:05.680]  in the military what are they saying about this right right now Alex I even here in
[51:05.680 --> 51:09.600]  the state final I know people are gonna get angry at me but even the 06 levels and above
[51:09.600 --> 51:14.040]  now are starting to really grasp what DHS is doing here right in the state and they're
[51:14.040 --> 51:18.360]  they're pretty much stating that the National Guard is gonna have a secondary portion access
[51:18.360 --> 51:21.920]  to any operations that they're doing that they're going to be running full scale stuff
[51:21.920 --> 51:25.640]  through DHS here in the state of Connecticut and the reason that they held back on that
[51:25.640 --> 51:30.200]  through here in Massachusetts and Rhode Island obviously we have a liberal state up here
[51:30.200 --> 51:34.400]  but the the issue that I see coming up with this is that the fact that DHS is going to
[51:34.400 --> 51:38.920]  take full information and control of domestic to the one rest of it comes to be which these
[51:38.920 --> 51:43.120]  are the operations that they are currently working on here and I've already outspoken
[51:43.120 --> 51:46.640]  about that it's it's actually started bothering myself and other individuals because they're
[51:46.640 --> 51:51.720]  seeing this now happen even up to the 06 level do you think it'll help that my shelf and
[51:51.720 --> 51:56.680]  others for 18 years since I learned of this covert program now that it's coming to a head
[51:56.680 --> 52:00.720]  does it help that we told everybody over and over again and made all these viral films
[52:00.720 --> 52:04.480]  that this was coming that now it's coming that they would use an outside threat they
[52:04.480 --> 52:08.240]  would flip it to domestic groups for those that don't know the military parlance you're
[52:08.240 --> 52:15.480]  using or nomenclature they're openly merging the military now with homeland security and
[52:15.480 --> 52:22.720]  the public training target is gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians not jihadis and
[52:22.720 --> 52:27.980]  the fact is what you're saying is the military is now beginning to really get concerned and
[52:27.980 --> 52:34.400]  realize that this is a treasonous action absolutely Alex and heart to heart everything
[52:34.400 --> 52:38.840]  you're doing I have to say is is on point it is on key you're not you're not over the
[52:38.840 --> 52:42.080]  top when you when you're speaking about this and I you know I really appreciate the way
[52:42.080 --> 52:46.320]  that you present your information and it is true it is working it is helping out people
[52:46.320 --> 52:50.800]  here I'm captain like I said Facebook links anything we could add on to basically help
[52:50.800 --> 52:55.840]  get this message forward that this inaction is being basically taking over our state
[52:55.840 --> 52:59.520]  here and even in New England and all across the country you're absolutely right when you
[52:59.520 --> 53:04.000]  hit that point well God bless you sir I appreciate your call Corey I don't know what the globalists
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.600]  are going to do because more than it's now more than half of the people I walk by in
[53:08.600 --> 53:13.320]  uniform or they're across the street they could be officers enlisted non-commissioned
[53:13.320 --> 53:17.840]  officers they just run over and they say almost everybody we know is awake but then I run
[53:17.840 --> 53:23.560]  into other pockets are not awake it's always veteran people that have been in a while that
[53:23.560 --> 53:26.520]  are awake is the only ones I run into that don't know what's going on or people that
[53:26.520 --> 53:29.920]  just got in and then they're all on a power trip or whatever half the time that's that
[53:29.920 --> 53:33.720]  they've got running checkpoints and stuff but even they start to wake up look here's
[53:33.720 --> 53:37.280]  what's going to happen they're taking over Syria with false flags they've launched every
[53:37.280 --> 53:42.480]  major war with false flags Hitler started World War two with false flags every indicator
[53:42.480 --> 53:47.600]  is they're going to stage big false flags and blame it on the American resistance okay
[53:47.600 --> 53:51.560]  I mean they're saying that gun owners veterans groups are going to start killing police and
[53:51.560 --> 53:56.000]  bombing things they're either going to provocateur mentally ill people to do it but that won't
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.640]  be a big enough body count they'll probably have some of that as well simultaneously
[54:00.640 --> 54:08.080]  some windup toys maybe even mind control type folks that's an old technology but it's probably
[54:08.080 --> 54:14.920]  going to be big nerve gas bio weapon low yield nuke and it'll be hey Alex Jones supporter
[54:14.920 --> 54:18.920]  you already see him getting ready saying the Boston bombers were because of me and you
[54:18.920 --> 54:22.840]  already see him saying I'm behind everything else because I know the program and they know
[54:22.840 --> 54:26.760]  the military is listening to me so there's a good chance when they nuke a city I'm not
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.920]  joking here this is what I really think they may do just studying them 24 seven eat bringing
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.800]  and sleeping this they'll nuke a city and then say Alex Jones was taken to the custody
[54:36.800 --> 54:42.320]  you know the person that we believe nuked it you know John Brown or whatever it is Tom
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.040]  Brown or whatever they'll make up some name you know was getting info to Jones it'll be
[54:46.040 --> 54:52.600]  Jones died in custody he resisted and I guess that's a merciful fate in a way I just feel
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.840]  sorry for everybody has to be left behind and all this stuff and and and that may not happen
[54:56.840 --> 55:01.720]  either they don't even care nuke something say I'm say I'm supporting it I mean I know
[55:01.720 --> 55:06.800]  these people and they know I know them that's why they're so freaked out by us it's not hard
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.840]  to figure this stuff out once you've studied it folks we just happen to have a platform
[55:10.840 --> 55:17.480]  let's talk to David in Hawaii active army then we'll go to Mike and Joe and Dave please
[55:17.480 --> 55:20.760]  everybody stay there I'm gonna get to all of you let's go to David David you're on
[55:20.760 --> 55:27.120]  the air welcome sir hi Dave hi Alex thanks for having me on 23 years in the military
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.600]  army officer you just want to echo what you ask I said you're spot on with a lot of this
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.360]  analysis that you're doing and I just wanted to call and talk about Syria if that's okay
[55:36.360 --> 55:42.040]  yes sir go ahead yeah you're you're exactly right when you go when you make the conclusion
[55:42.040 --> 55:47.840]  that there's absolutely no logical reason for Assad to use chemicals against his own people
[55:47.840 --> 55:52.440]  knowing that he could bring the U.S. possibly to come invade his country it just does not
[55:52.440 --> 55:58.160]  make sense it's not logical and it's not something that he would he would consider
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.280]  unless unless someone was trying to do what you said which is set this up for an opportunity
[56:03.280 --> 56:08.960]  to bring us in to try and legitimize possibly to Syria it just doesn't make sense but what
[56:08.960 --> 56:13.320]  do you think about that no I mean absolutely but so here's my question all the military
[56:13.320 --> 56:16.680]  people I talked to see right through this but the public doesn't know what planet they're
[56:16.680 --> 56:20.760]  on on average so what do you expect to happen here because the word I've got is the reason
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.360]  they haven't already invaded is the is the average officer does know this is pure evil
[56:25.360 --> 56:28.920]  but they've already replaced a lot of top brass to go along with this I mean housing
[56:28.920 --> 56:33.480]  mubarak was brought in was planned four years ago it wouldn't do it so they could he's like
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.160]  I'm not going to destabilize the whole thing and commit these evils and he was a dictator
[56:37.160 --> 56:42.720]  but not you know an overly evil guy this is like really bad so so is there a debate going
[56:42.720 --> 56:48.560]  on in the military about this I think a lot of people are really having the discussion
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.560]  back and forth about it and and I think what they didn't calculate was that Russia was
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.840]  going to take its position and since ships over there started to exercise is it basically
[56:57.840 --> 57:04.360]  saying hey back off there are bodies you invade you've got to deal with us and they the Obama
[57:04.360 --> 57:10.480]  administration did not calculate that aspect of it and and and and and and and and and
[57:10.480 --> 57:13.600]  we're just hitting this put was far on him called them on the broth
[57:13.600 --> 57:16.680]  and now they're sitting back trying to figure out what we're gonna do and I will also like
[57:16.680 --> 57:24.000]  to throw in here I think it's a crime is an absolute crime that we would in interstate
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.420]  would be supporting the terrorists that we were fighting and killing in Iraq and Afghanistan
[57:28.420 --> 57:32.940]  who are now supporting the resistance against Assad it's just that's just a contact and
[57:32.940 --> 57:37.280]  I can't believe our government would do that and it's just this is me and excuse my grandma
[57:37.280 --> 57:42.560]  on the radio and it just frustrates me in my flames that we would now turn around to be finally
[57:42.560 --> 57:48.000]  money and resources to support the very people that are killing me. Absolutely and it's outrageous.
[57:48.000 --> 57:55.600]  God bless you sir. We're going to go to break and come back with who's up next. Dave and then Joe
[57:55.600 --> 58:05.600]  and Mike and Max and everybody else. Folks, this is really evil and it's super dangerous.
[58:05.600 --> 58:10.480]  And here's the problem. John Corzine was the head of Goldman Sachs. Then he became the governor
[58:10.480 --> 58:16.880]  in New Jersey. He made 40 to 1 bets for other people's money at MF Global and lost. You're
[58:16.880 --> 58:20.480]  like, what does that have to do with Assad and this? That's the type of crazies we're dealing with
[58:20.480 --> 58:28.400]  here. They're reckless. They may start a war with Russia. I mean, many analysts I've talked to say
[58:28.400 --> 58:33.520]  we're in more danger of nuclear war than we were back in the so-called Cold War because we've got
[58:33.520 --> 58:38.240]  real crazies running our government right now. I mean, they're nuts, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:43.120 --> 58:47.200]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:19.760]  So does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.640]  Alex Jones. Well, they're beating the war drums up to ramming speed right now and saying that they're
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:34.000]  going to start bombing within days. McCain is literally licking his lips right now. The evidence
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.320]  is overwhelming. This is a false flag. No logic that Assad would in a crowded area attack a area
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.480]  partially held by his forces, partially held by the Al Qaeda rebels. The Russians are putting a
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:52.080]  larger fleet in the United States under globalist control as well. And then, you know why the
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.600]  globalists do stuff like this. They know once a war officially starts, not declared by Congress,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.760]  but once they call it a war, people will just get behind the president. And that will get
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.840]  Obama's approval rating up. They'll give him another peace prize, probably, and they'll put
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.680]  Al Qaeda in charge and our media won't cover the mass murder they engage in. Let's go back to your
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.680]  phone calls. Coming up in about 15 minutes, we got Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us to talk about
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.240]  all this and more. But let's get back to your calls. Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.320]  Dave's retired police, U.S. Capitol Security. Dave in Ohio. What's your take on this situation
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.600]  that's going on? And the DOD training manual saying the founding fathers are extremists
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.680]  and will not be welcome in the military today. The great Alex Jones. How you doing, Alex Jones?
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.560]  Good, sir. You're the great Dave. What's your take on this?
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.720]  Well, yes, sir. I remember Alex, I remember John McCain, John Sidney McCain, the third,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.960]  and Lindsey Graham had a visit on the Fourth of July. They visited the troops in Afghanistan,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.640]  and then they conveniently made a trip to Syria. I was just wondering how convenient
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.800]  is this? And right after that, less than a month, we have this chemical attack. And this visit was
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:07.520]  actually with the rebels. And we all know that the rebels are al-Qaeda. So this smells fishy
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.200]  from the beginning. And I'm just trying to figure out, does anybody remember this? Because American
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.640]  people have a short-term memory. So if you can maybe shed some light on that. And also,
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.520]  John McCain is a communist. I don't know if people realize that or not. When he was captured by the
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.120]  Vietnamese, there's a whole big story about that whole captured thing. You did a big piece on that.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.200]  Absolutely. He turned against the other guys pretty much immediately. He said,
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:38.320]  listen, I'm with you. And he lived out his days at a palatial mansion with prostitutes
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.200]  while all the other guys were tortured, some of them to death. And he's an anti-gun,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.000]  anti-American, total piece of trash. Sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.080]  Yes, he is. The Patriot Summit. This is what I would love to see, Alex. I would love to see a
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.120]  Patriot Summit with the restoration of the Constitution being the topic. What would our
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.120]  founding fathers be doing right now? Well, you know, they're terrorists. What do you make of the
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:07.280]  135-page DOD document judicial watch, Scott? Where they say, and I actually have the quote here,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.320]  that the founding fathers will not be welcome in today's military because they were extremists.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.720]  And it goes on to say, nowadays, the manual explains, instead of dressing in sheets,
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.720]  are publicly espousing hate messages, many extremists will talk of individual liberty,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.880]  state's rights, and how to make the world a better place. So making the world a better place,
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:30.320]  that's pretty, pretty terrorist, isn't it? That would be a terrorist when you're
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.360]  communist country and when your country has been taken over by communists. This is the assertion
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.160]  and this is the declaration that they have made. So, you know, this is the question that I ask
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.560]  myself all the time. What would our founding fathers be doing right now at this moment? I
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.240]  mean, they actually have to be turning over in their grave. They died to ship blood for this
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.400]  country. They'll see what's going on right now. It's just unbelievable. Every time I see something,
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.040]  it just makes my skin crawl because I'm like, wow, like the spirit inside of me is screaming out,
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.200]  what can we do? And they thumb down the American people. The American people have received so
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.400]  much disinformation, low information, that they can't do anything. And it's not their fault.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.200]  Wow, that's it. It's the spirit in you screaming out. That's the best way to describe when you get
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.320]  outraged by this stuff and have a conscience and have discernment. It's outrageous to watch the
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.600]  wicked just commit all these atrocities against innocents and then blame their enemies for the
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:28.000]  atrocities they've done. And then we think about how they're... See, we see all this propaganda
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.280]  and we go, man, that's incredible. That discredits them. But they've got a dumb down constituency
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.920]  that buys it all. And so that's why they're doing that. Very well said, sir. Thank you, Dave.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:45.200]  Dave, let's talk to when we go come back to Joe and then Mike and then Max and others. We're talking

[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:21.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:42.140]  By the way, back in January, we had an article on eFoodWars.com
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.900]  that hacked emails show that Washington
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:50.860]  planned to stage a chemical attack in Syria.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.340]  And I remember when that came out,
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.980]  it turned out it was a real group,
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.260]  but then they tried to spin it.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.260]  And John Harmon just reminded me about that in my ear,
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.460]  literally 30 seconds ago.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.780]  That's why I was almost late coming back there.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.660]  Now there it is, hacked emails reveal Washington approved,
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.260]  planned to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria,
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.180]  Obama administration complicit in war crime.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.220]  Oh my gosh, that was eight months ago.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.700]  And I'd forgotten about that.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.380]  And our article ended up getting picked up
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.460]  by like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph in England and stuff.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.580]  See, I mean, we just fire and forget, folks.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.140]  We break all this huge news and then just forget
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:35.460]  what we even covered in the past and move on.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.540]  But as Assad has said, why would I stage an attack
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.820]  in a crowded city on civilians
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.220]  when the West says they're gonna come bomb us
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.940]  and take over when we're winning the war against al-Qaeda
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.060]  that you've been putting into the country
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.460]  for two and a half years
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.540]  and that are killing the Christians.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.340]  And I took a bunch of active duty calls,
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.620]  three or four of them last hour,
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.260]  really eloquently breaking down
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.740]  that they've been bringing troops into al-Qaeda
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:01.380]  for two and a half years out of Iraq into Syria.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:04.980]  And that's all come out and the main force is al-Qaeda.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.420]  And our government's backing it all over,
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.620]  but we're talking to a Mike, Joe, Jeremy,
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:10.220]  Max and others.
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.340]  A lot of these folks are former,
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:17.300]  we're gonna go to Joe and Mike and Jeremy here in a minute.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.020]  But Max is in Wisconsin, we're gonna go to him first.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.980]  He's active military, wants to talk about Syria
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.540]  because I wanna get active military's take on this.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.300]  Now, this looks like a false flag to me,
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.380]  but the Russians are massing their ships.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.060]  They've got troops there.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.980]  I'm no fan of Assad, but he's like Mubarak,
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:39.420]  not a bad guy compared to al-Qaeda.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.220]  What is your take on what's happening
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.580]  and what are other military people you're talking to?
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.180]  What are they saying about this?
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:51.660]  Hey, Defender of Mankind, I'm part of Conaganda distribution
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.300]  and I'll get right to it.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.780]  Syria is not only a military op,
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:00.780]  but also a Psyop aimed towards the US and the world at large.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.420]  And everything you're saying is pretty much on the money.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.940]  But I'd like to ask if you are aware of Satanic Psyops
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:12.740]  aimed towards young adults slash children here at State Sider?
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.860]  Man, all I know is almost every one of these singers
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.220]  that targets tweenies, like eight, nine, 10-year-old girls.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.180]  It's open Satanism, open orgies.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.220]  I mean, they know, whether you believe in the devil
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.420]  or not, folks, that if they can make you immoral
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.220]  and when you're young, destroy your innocence
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.060]  that you'll probably not develop
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.060]  into a strong spiritual person that's good.
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.740]  They want to destroy you while you're young.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.180]  And yeah, I mean, the whole new world order
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.700]  is a Satanic system.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.300]  So I mean, I'm aware of a lot of it,
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.900]  but I mean, what specifically?
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.620]  Well, I don't know if you've heard of it,
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:51.220]  but all over the country here in the US in the past,
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.060]  let's say 10 years more,
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.380]  often there's been these festivals, music festivals,
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.940]  and they're kind of held in rural,
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:02.580]  highly religious areas.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.580]  And pretty much they have security to restrict normal people
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.820]  bringing in normal drugs.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.700]  Drugs are part of a festival.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.500]  And then like how you often said,
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.620]  the federal people will bring the drugs themselves,
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:21.620]  drugs like 25i, LSD, DMT, and so on and so forth.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:25.820]  And it's very timed out, very coordinated.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.860]  You can see the skulls on the hats,
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.580]  the 666 on the shirts.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.020]  They're pretty overt, like you said,
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:35.580]  with the sunglasses, the buffed up guys,
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:39.260]  and black SUVs, helicopters, the whole nine yards.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.260]  Oh yes, I am actually aware that,
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.580]  this has been declassified, that in the 50s,
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.020]  they rolled out the LSD raw
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.020]  at all the major universities, the CIA did,
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:54.140]  and then they rolled out the way to design it,
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.460]  the ingredients list, the formula.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:02.460]  And then yes, I am aware that a lot
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.900]  of the hardcore hallucinogens are being brought in
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.460]  because they think they've already got the youth
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.020]  so brain scrambled, that then by putting them
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.100]  on this stuff, it'll make them get more scrambled.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.260]  In fact, these drugs are used in mind control,
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.460]  that there's some studies showing that
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.420]  if you're actually aware and awake,
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.900]  limited use could actually boost IQ,
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.700]  depending on the studies you read.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.820]  But for the average dumb down person,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:28.820]  well, I mean, we expose and it became national news
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.860]  with our sources in Minnesota,
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.780]  the police bringing hard drugs to occupy,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.180]  to get them all the young kids on drugs,
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:39.220]  to then make them dealers of the state police in Minnesota.
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.300]  So yes, amazing.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.700]  God bless you, sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:47.700]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Indiana, then Joe and Mike.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.220]  No, no, no, no, Mike's been holding the longest.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.700]  Mike in California, former army,
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.980]  wants to talk about chemical warfare, I'll go ahead, sir.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.100]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:56.940]  Good.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.900]  I served in the National Guard four years
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.820]  and I was the NBC guy for my unit,
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.580]  the Nuclear Biological Chemical Warfare Specialist.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.300]  One of the things that kind of raises the eyeballs me
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.900]  is they haven't disclosed what chemical agent was used,
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.220]  what nerve gas was used.
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.780]  A lot of times that'll give away the signature
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.340]  of who used it because everybody likes
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.740]  their own little flavor if you look at the nerve gas.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.580]  Exactly, and the last three times they did the same thing.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:34.180]  Yeah, exactly, and prior to me going to the advanced part
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.460]  of the training, there was a cliff back in 2002
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:43.100]  that was shown on CNN where an underscored terrorist group
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.740]  was using nerve gas and they showed what it did to a dog
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.300]  and it was all over the place.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.860]  So it does smell kind of fishy,
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:54.060]  especially since Russia is beefing up everything
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.700]  and then you have the snow in things
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.620]  still playing around in the background.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.820]  It's all a setup.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.260]  Well, sir, I mean, here's the issue.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:06.220]  Three times in the last two years,
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.980]  the rebels have been caught later
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.500]  when the signature comes out.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.300]  Even the UN had to admit earlier this year,
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:15.100]  oh, that is the signature of the gas the jihadis have.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.340]  Okay, yeah, they did shoot some videos in Syria
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.620]  showing them training with it,
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.220]  separate from the older dog video,
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.020]  I've seen that terrible video as well
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.740]  with the yellow little mutt dog they kill.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:29.940]  And I mean, the timing of the massing forces,
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:34.740]  the contracts, the foreign troops massing in Jordan,
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:38.420]  in other areas, I mean, this is the big war push
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.660]  to get this invasion going.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.860]  Do we have Dr. Corsi?
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.780]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.620]  We're gonna go to him then.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.620]  We're just getting him on Skype right now.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:51.420]  Anything else you'd like to add, Mike?
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.300]  No, I've been listening to you for actually
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.980]  for like almost seven months now.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.140]  It was a pretty time calling in
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.380]  and you just make a lot of sense man,
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:02.460]  especially my dad was very active with the military.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.460]  He was a special forces in the Marine Corps,
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.860]  better known as force recon.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.420]  So he was privy to a lot of stuff during Vietnam.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.140]  On top of that, he still kept close
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:12.980]  to what was going on.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.100]  He actually had paperwork from the Pentagon
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.620]  two months before Oklahoma City happened,
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.340]  saying it was going to happen.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.700]  Wow, yeah, the Pentagon was definitely involved.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.620]  The Army was, he was a captain by then,
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.380]  Captain McVeigh and Special Forces, they set him up bad.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.020]  And yeah, I've talked to the police,
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:35.980]  the ones they haven't killed.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.260]  I mean, they even know who bombed it.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.700]  And McVeigh thought it was a drill
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.660]  and then really freaked out
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.420]  when they were actually going to bomb the daycare center.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:44.620]  And that's why they decided to set him up.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.300]  Earlier, they were probably going to explain
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.660]  some local Iraqis, but they just went with that.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.100]  Very complex situation.
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:52.940]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.020]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.340]  You ought to get those documents out,
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.340]  do a YouTube with those.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.380]  That's very important.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.180]  All right, I wanted to get for the balance of the hour,
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.660]  Dr. Jerome Corcyon, because I saw an article he did
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:10.260]  for WND.com, World Net Daily, last Friday,
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.740]  about Obama's connections to his cousins
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.740]  and the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.700]  Well, Odinga was made to be the prime minister
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.500]  after they rioted and killed people all over the country.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.740]  And Obama's Senatorial Emails Republic,
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.660]  where he advised him how to do it.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.180]  So yes, Obama is Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:27.620]  But from my research, but that's another cover.
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:28.900]  They're just manipulating that group.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.940]  So I wanted to segue into that briefly,
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.940]  then get Dr. Corcyon, because he's worked in security
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.380]  in the Middle East as a contractor
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.420]  to the State Department and other things,
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.900]  get his take on where all this is going.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.940]  And the chemical attack
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.220]  that I think all the evidence shows was a false flag.
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.900]  Dr. Corcyon has a PhD from Harvard University
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.460]  in political science,
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.700]  and he's currently a senior writer for World Net Daily.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.740]  And he's got a whole bunch of number one
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.980]  New York Times best sellers,
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.860]  and we'll tell you about those as well.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.460]  But Dr. Corcyon, we're going to break in about two minutes.
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:04.340]  Briefly, what is your take on the situation
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.180]  with all this Muslim Brotherhood news coming out
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.100]  in Obama's family?
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:12.620]  Well, I think the bottom line is that the Egyptian government,
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.940]  the current government, the military,
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.780]  have decided to out the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:20.340]  They're prosecuting the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:22.700]  In the process, they want the world to know
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.060]  that the Obama administration is very tightly tied
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.420]  to the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.060]  including in financial ties to the Obama family.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.060]  So the news we're going to talk about
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:40.140]  is news that WND got when it was released
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.220]  by the Egyptian government,
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:46.140]  asking for the United States press to pick up the story.
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.500]  Wow, and you've written quite a few articles on this.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.300]  The latest I saw was on Friday.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.380]  We should check World Net Daily.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.500]  Is there a new article out?
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.860]  And give us the headline, we'll put that on screen.
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.940]  Well, I have a new article out right now today
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:04.860]  that argues from some sources in the Middle East
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:09.100]  that the intention of the Egyptian government
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.140]  when these trials began from the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.660]  is to implicate President Obama directly.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.980]  That's bombshell.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.780]  In a series of financial transactions
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.780]  with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.140]  Oh my gosh, and that just broke at World Net Daily.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.500]  Guys, let's put that up on screen as we go to break.
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.580]  This is huge.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.780]  Well, an article that appeared over the weekend,
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.660]  and then a second article is appearing today.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.220]  Unbelievable, wow.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:39.300]  We're gonna be right back with Dr. Corsi to break this down.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.540]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.980]  Obama is backing the Muslim Brotherhood in Al-Qaeda
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.540]  in not just Syria and Libya,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.340]  but in Egypt to murder all the Christians.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.580]  The word I've got is he has been Muslim Brotherhood
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.220]  and they're blackmailing him basically.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.020]  We'll get Dr. Corsi's take on this.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.180]  I am just blown away by this breaking news.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:02.180]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.580]  that's about to turn your lives upside down
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.940]  in the coming few months.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:12.700]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:13.940]  I'm sure they know it,
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.100]  but they probably know that revealing it on TV
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.380]  will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.860]  But I believe you should be informed about it
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.940]  because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.500]  and everything unravels, only those who know
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.620]  this secret info will survive and thrive.
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:35.500]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.500]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real secret reason
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.100]  why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.620]  And it's not just in response to mass murders
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:50.420]  of preparing for war, it's something much darker.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.340]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:56.100]  before they shut it down.

[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.580]  The experts at Atlas can help you choose a shelter

[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:32.220]  engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:35.100]  then carting to a private bank having it led back at interest,
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.660]  forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.660]  This capitalism was Jefferson correct
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:40.780]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.700]  as a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:43.700]  than a standing army.
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.820]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.460]  that explains our monetary system.

[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.540]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.860]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:59.700]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.260]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book,
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.460]  Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.300]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:11.020]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.900]  be sent directly to the White House
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.860]  at a time when only the president could obtain
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.420]  this world-class healer.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:19.700]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.980]  around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.340]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:27.580]  in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally-occurring
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.700]  compounds that instinctively respond
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.380]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.500]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.900]  to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:41.060]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.020]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:04.860]  ["Monday Through Friday"]
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.660]  Monday through Friday, we're here.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.980]  From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central,
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.860]  we're back weeknight, 7 o'clock.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.020]  InfoWars, nightly news.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.900]  Find out more about that at infowarsnews.com.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.460]  All right, Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:21.900]  for the end of the hour.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.020]  And I knew that he was exposing
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.580]  the whole Muslim Brotherhood situation,
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:25.420]  and that's all coming out.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.540]  But I separately read a whole bunch of books and documents
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.740]  and went and looked it up
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.740]  when Obama was running for president.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:36.060]  And the media says, oh, there's a theory he's a Muslim.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.780]  It's not that if he was just a Muslim,
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.820]  he went to him address in Indonesia,
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.420]  was listed as a Muslim, give speeches in Egypt,
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.580]  saying, I am of your faith, speaks Arabic so good
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.140]  that the Muslims freak out.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.860]  We don't even really know who he is.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.260]  He's definitely not who he says he is.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:54.220]  The point is, is that they're using this info
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.820]  and he is siding with Al Qaeda,
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.260]  with the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.380]  to a level that's even beyond the CIA,
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.800]  playing both sides.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.740]  I mean, this is getting really weird, folks.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.500]  Dr. Corsi, you've got the floor,
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.340]  you documented, we just lost him.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.580]  His Skype's coming back.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:14.140]  Skype's a great thing, it sounds great,
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.540]  but it's great for TV viewers, but it has problems.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:21.140]  This is so amazing to see this going on.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.820]  And I'm wondering geopolitically,
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.380]  all the big banks and the elites funding Obama,
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.220]  what do they think is going to come out of all this?
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:33.780]  What is their in game?
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:41.460]  It's amazing that this type of stuff is going on.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:44.540]  And when we get Dr. Corsi back on the Skype,
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.540]  we will get him to break all that down for us.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.580]  We're gonna get him on the phone line.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.580]  But when you're sitting here looking at all this,
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.660]  it just makes the head spin.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.340]  Because not only is our government funding
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.500]  Al Qaeda publicly, to start war,
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.660]  stage false flags, you name it,
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.700]  they are also using the L.A.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.620]  are also using the Al Qaeda threat
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.460]  to set up a giant domestic military force
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.860]  that openly trains for war with us
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.460]  and doesn't even hide that fact.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.700]  And I just watched the general public
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.900]  go blindly about their business.
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.900]  In every case in history,
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:31.380]  if a political group stands down
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:32.660]  and is politically uninvolved,
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:34.420]  doesn't power their liberties, they will be enslaved.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:36.100]  All right, Doc, we got you.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:38.100]  Break down this incredible news
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.780]  that you've got on the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.460]  about to fully expose Obama.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.700]  This is huge.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:47.220]  Well, let's start out with the story that broke last week.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.620]  The Egyptian government sent out the,
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:53.020]  ahead of the, it was the vice president
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.940]  for the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.460]  Her name was Tahani al-Jibali.
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:02.860]  And she gave a speech and then several interviews
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.460]  in Egyptian television in which she said
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.860]  she wanted the American people to know
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:12.020]  that President Obama's brother was managing the money
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.780]  of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.860]  And that brother is, we've identified as Malik,
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:20.300]  Obama, who is in Kenya.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:24.700]  But the, what Jibali said was very important,
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.780]  that she said, we want to inform the American people
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.420]  that their president's brother, Obama,
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:33.500]  is one of the architects of the major investments
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.740]  of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.300]  She said, we will carry out the law,
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.540]  the Americans will not stop us.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.980]  We need to open the files and begin court sessions.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.300]  She said further that the Obama administration knows
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.260]  they've supported terrorism.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:51.180]  We're going to open these files so the nations know
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.820]  the truth and the Obama administration is exposed
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.780]  that they have collaborated with terrorists.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:01.100]  And it's this reason that the administration fights us.
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.860]  So this is a clear attempt by the Egyptian government
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:07.540]  to out and embarrass the Obama administration
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:10.780]  for supporting the Egyptian Brotherhood in Egypt.
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.020]  You know, I'm, I'm speechless here.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.780]  We have a long 18 minute segment coming up.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.460]  I want to give you the floor as best we can
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:18.940]  to lay all this, this out.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.500]  But I don't just believe what they say.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.700]  I've done so much research like you have.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.620]  I know his cousin Odinga was the treasurer
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:27.500]  for the Brotherhood.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.300]  They burned half the country down.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.900]  Obama advised him in emails.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.100]  As you know, I want you to give people some history.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:37.060]  So this all fits, he and his family would become like
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.540]  the offshore dictators of the Middle East
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.740]  with the Muslim Brotherhood funneling them all the money.
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.540]  My gosh, now it makes sense.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.620]  And also Alex, there's a couple more things
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:48.980]  about this Malik Obama.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:53.980]  One is he is also running money for the Sudanese terrorists.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:59.180]  We have him attending a meeting with the president of Sudan
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:04.020]  who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for Genocide.
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:08.180]  Sudan is a terrorist nation according to the state department
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.500]  and Malik is running the money
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.620]  for this organization in Sudan.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:17.540]  Also Malik Obama has a foundation in the United States.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.380]  Wow.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:21.980]  But one C3 that has operated illegally for two years
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:26.580]  until Lois Lerner retroactively made it all okay at the IRS.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.780]  Sir, when we come back we're gonna give out both the headlines

[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.300]  We need to mirror this information.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:42.380]  This is so huge, folks, because the guy we've got on
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.180]  has been to Kenya, he's been detained there,
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.180]  he knows the players, we're gonna find out how big this is.
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:53.860]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:17.960]  We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.620]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:26.860]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.

[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:30.980]  Folks, I'm going to be honest with you right now.
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:37.980]  I wanted to get Dr. Jerome Corcyon to talk about his article about Obama's cousin being
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:43.460]  Muslim Brotherhood and being connected to the things happening in North Africa.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:49.780]  Because when you look at it, Kenya's right beside Egypt.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:53.140]  And I know that that's the politics that are running.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.780]  But when he brought up the two new articles that I hadn't seen yet that I now have scanned
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:02.740]  over while he was talking, Obama's brother linked to Muslim Brotherhood, evidence, U.S.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:09.940]  government bribed Muslim Brotherhood, now Egypt looks to expose Obama.
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:14.660]  Everything just clicks because I've read Corcy's book, I've read Tarpley's book on it, I've
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.740]  interviewed other people that have been there, I know the history of it.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:21.220]  I don't just get Corcyon to believe him, though I know that he's an honorable guy who tells
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:24.780]  the truth and has broken a lot of big international stories.
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:30.540]  But I just literally had an adrenaline rush, not in a positive way, like being punched
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:36.260]  in the stomach when all this clicked together like the tumblers on a safe, and I immediately
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:40.820]  feared for Dr. Corcy's life, who I know has been threatened before because they're scared
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:41.820]  of him.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:46.940]  And I immediately then saw Syria, Libya in context, and everything kind of clicked.
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.860]  I don't know if he agrees with me, but he's an international crisis manager, political
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:56.060]  science, PhD, Harvard, the big banks, you name it, he's a really smart guy who has all
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.260]  the connections.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:01.460]  But it all kind of came into view here, is he a Muslim extremist, isn't he?
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:06.700]  He's just a profiteer pirate working for big banks and people that want to make money,
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:11.060]  that's why they fund him, to put the jihadis in to loot the Middle East and give all the
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:15.700]  money and property to them because these aren't just allegations from Egypt.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:20.300]  When I was reading your article, I'm like, wait, this has come out before in this country,
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:25.900]  this has come out before in Sudan, it's come out before in Kenya, and then it all clicked.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:30.340]  They're going to burn down the Middle East and hand it all over to themselves as a mafia.
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:36.700]  This is unbelievable, and then the magnitude of the Egyptian military turning against it,
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:41.700]  defending the Christians, CNN calling them when they killed 25 cops, calling them activists,
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.660]  that CNN's involved in this.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:48.180]  Am I right in saying that if this all comes out, Dr. Corsi, this could bring down this
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:50.180]  criminal faction of the New World Order.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:54.020]  You've got the floor, give us the history, all of it, how big this is, do you agree with
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.020]  what I just said?
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:59.260]  Well, I think you're right, Alex, let me detail some of it.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:05.340]  The article I published over the weekend, which shows a document in an Egyptian government
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:11.700]  document that we got out of the Middle East, WND, and what this is is it's a government
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:19.220]  document listing from the Minister of Foreign Affairs the names of Muslim Brotherhood leaders
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:28.140]  in Egypt, and the amount in bribes that they were paid in US dollars by the Obama administration
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:33.100]  with the money sent through the US embassy in Cairo.
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:38.180]  The money paid over to the Morsi government, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:44.740]  handed out to this list of Muslim Brotherhood leaders, and they came in, the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.540]  leaders, and signed for the money.
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:47.540]  It's a receipt.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:56.060]  The amounts of money paid are up to $850,000 a year, and this is an authenticated document.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:03.300]  It's going to be presented at the trials of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo, alleging
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:09.540]  that these Muslim Brotherhood leaders are spies working for Obama being paid by the
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:14.300]  Obama administration, and here's the documentary evidence of it, which we have in advance of
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.180]  the trial through our sources in Cairo.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:19.180]  It's incredible.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:24.900]  I mean, it's a list of the Muslim Brotherhood bad guys being paid hundreds of thousands
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:30.140]  of dollars off the books by the United States government, the Obama administration, through
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:37.100]  our embassy in Cairo paid via the Morsi government.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.340]  This document was obtained when the Morsi government was deposed, and the military went
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.220]  in and occupied the offices.
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.220]  This is unbelievable.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:51.500]  Is this why they're trying to ratchet up the Syria thing right now as a distraction?
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:56.580]  And what do you expect them to do to try to cover this up, and how are things going for
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:02.380]  the democratic socialist communist wing of the New World Order in their takeover of the
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:03.380]  Middle East?
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:08.620]  Well, this is going to be explosive because the Egyptian government has announced in the
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:16.300]  newspapers, and we've incited the newspapers in the Middle East, this newspaper Ale Saroon,
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:20.740]  which published in Egypt over the weekend, that this document existed, and it was going
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.020]  to be introduced at the trials of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Egyptian government has
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:32.780]  come out and said that they want to expose the Obama administration's ties to terrorists,
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.940]  namely the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:40.980]  Remember, the Muslim Brotherhood before the Morsi government came in was outlawed under
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.580]  Mubarak in Egypt.
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.340]  It was an outlaw organization.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:51.980]  When Morsi came in, won the election, brought in the Muslim Brotherhood, Obama celebrated,
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:59.620]  and he said this was a positive development, now it turns out that Obama had been paying,
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:06.060]  administration had been paying Muslim Brotherhood under the table through our embassy in Cairo
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:12.220]  with the cooperation, we even have the receipt with the signed signatures on it, the Muslim
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:16.740]  Brotherhood members that got paid these hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:21.820]  Now, this document is going to be an explosive document all through the Middle East because
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:27.180]  it puts the Obama administration on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood terrorists under
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.180]  the table.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:35.700]  I mean, this makes things like Iran contra-pale in significance compared to the magnitude
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:42.900]  of this behavior, which, when fully documented, I think is going to lead to treason charges.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.220]  I mean, I think it's of that magnitude.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:50.420]  And by the way, I mean, you wrote UNFIT for command, you've done so many things that have
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.220]  ended up deciding presidential elections, you don't toot your own horn, you don't make
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.700]  idle statements like this.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.860]  In fact, I think in the decade I've been interviewing you, Dr. Corsi, I don't think I've ever heard
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.180]  you make both statements like this, but I agree.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.340]  I mean, I was blindsided, I was getting you honest about the Muslim Brotherhood stuff
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.860]  and some funding of it.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:14.580]  But what you brought out now and what's in the Egyptian news is sensational, but I'm
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:18.820]  concerned about what they'll do to distract us from all of this.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:22.900]  And I also want to know, how does this tie into Benghazi, because we know there was a
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.380]  cover up there of the missiles being transferred.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:29.540]  We know elements of the government did not want to back Al Qaeda.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:35.580]  It looks like that Obama and his controllers may be running a rogue operation, and if so,
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.580]  who is behind it?
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:37.740]  I mean, it's not just Obama.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:43.100]  Well, let's first deal with Benghazi because we reported, WND reported, and we've been
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:50.140]  working with Walid Shobat, who is also published alongside WND. Walid is one of our sources.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:56.140]  He's former PLO, Arabic-speaking, and you remember in Benghazi when we ran at WND those
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:04.340]  clips of the latecomers, the second wave of the attack of the terrorists on the Benghazi
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:08.980]  compound, and when they entered, they said, don't shoot at us.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:15.420]  We are on your side. We're from Egypt. Morsi sent us. And in fact, in the tape, even if
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:19.900]  you can't speak Arabic, you can hear them say Morsi because Morsi was the guy.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:29.140]  Now, this is Egyptian terrorists in Libya attacking our embassy in Benghazi. Now, we
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:34.620]  at that time had put it together with the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood, which was
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:42.580]  behind the attacks from Egypt on Benghazi, were angling to try to, with the Morsi government,
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:47.940]  get Obama to release the blind sheik. And we have not ruled out yet that one of the
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:54.580]  theories behind the Benghazi attack was to kidnap Ambassador Stevens and exchange him
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:42:01.740]  for the blind sheik. And it seems like this was kind of a behind-the-scenes backroom
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:10.340]  deal between the Obama administration, perhaps the CIA, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:15.500]  operating with full sanction of the Egyptian government under Morsi. But it would mean
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:23.620]  that, in a sense, we ourselves through the CIA may have been responsible for the attack
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:30.420]  and that we were supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt that sent terrorists to Benghazi
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:36.900]  and Libya to attack the embassy. That's pretty incredible stuff.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:42.100]  Well, exactly. I mean, I had one of those moments. That's why I brought up in Ghazi.
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:46.700]  We're at all crystallized. And I saw that triangle from Kenya and what's already been
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:51.620]  on record and what your book exposed with the documents with Odinga and Obama and emails.
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:56.260]  We'll just have riots and they'll make you part of the government. And then you see worldwide
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:00.700]  what's going on. This is what I want to ask you. We know the big banks are behind Obama,
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:04.940]  the globalist. But geopolitically, I look at what's going on. There's something else
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:07.860]  there. Who do you think Obama really works for?
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:13.660]  Well, I mean, I think it's hard to say. But I mean, first, your idea about money motives,
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:18.460]  that there's money motives here, I think is quite right. Because, you know, you've got
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:24.060]  Obama's brother now managing the money of the Muslim Brotherhood. Don't forget that
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:28.700]  terrorism is big business. So there's a lot of money involved here. A lot of money being
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:35.300]  stolen. Look at that list of bribes. The bribes are being paid $850,000 a year, $750,000
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:36.300]  a year.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.300]  Individually.
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:41.300]  Individually. I mean, that's a lot of money in the Middle East to get $850,000, a lot
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:47.420]  of money anywhere to get $850,000 income tax free, unrecorded. Just here's the cash
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:53.060]  in your pocket, which is the way the Muslim Brotherhood was being paid, the cash through
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:57.860]  the Morsi government after it received the cash from the State Department. But I want
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:03.940]  to go to one of your other points also here, Alex, because what it looks like is that the
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:11.900]  Obama administration is trying to pin these nerve gas attacks on Assad. Now, Russia has
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:17.180]  said increasingly that, you know, there's no evidence that the Assad government is behind
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:24.860]  these nerve gas attacks. And I think the truth is that the evidence is very, very thin that
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:30.340]  the Assad government can be blamed for these attacks. I know there's a drumroll. Obama's
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:36.260]  now got the UN in inspecting, but it's equal probability. And I think it's a pretty good
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:44.380]  evidence that maybe it's the rebels that we're backing who may have launched the nerve attacks.
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:48.500]  And again, that question's not yet, but if you ask what's the false flag, I mean, clearly
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:56.100]  if we can have an invasion of Syria with the US military forces involved or cruise missile
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.660]  attacks, it takes the headlines away from the Obama administration paying the Muslim
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:05.660]  Brotherhood under the carpet through the embassy in Cairo.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:09.180]  But I mean, look, I know there's corrupt forces in the government. It's an empire that wants
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:13.940]  to take over and all the rest of this. But there's a lot of evidence, Israel's working
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:17.460]  with these rebels as well. You've got France really cheerleading when they're using on
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:22.220]  the sidelines. I want to get your take on why that is. And I've had a bunch of special
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:25.980]  forces in military call in last hour and they said, yes, what you're saying is exactly
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:30.460]  what we see going on. But it's been on record. You've got these extremists being staged
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:36.780]  at bases in Iraq and in Turkey. You've had Turkey bombarding them with artillery. And
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:42.380]  this is a two and a half year attempt to cut that country up. And look, if they took a
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:48.220]  sawed out and like put some real Republican, I'd say, okay, whatever, but that's unconstitutional.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:53.300]  This is so immoral. How does Washington and NATO think they're going to get away with
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:58.060]  turning that country or half of it over to Al Qaeda when they're pulling over truck drivers
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:02.100]  who aren't Wahhabist and shooting them in the head on video, cutting Christians heads
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:08.060]  off, blowing up every church? I mean, I really take it personal that the churches, the media,
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:11.460]  even conservative media are not standing up for one of the oldest Christian communities
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:17.020]  in the world. And that CNN's helping cover it up. It makes me realize, man, there's really
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:22.820]  some weird hatred of Christians, not just by the Wahhabist, but by the so-called liberals
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:27.700]  who are really, who really are more criminal than I thought. These are sick freaks. I mean,
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:30.100]  who are these people? Why do they want to do this?
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:34.860]  Well, and remember, one of the early purposes, we've been reporting on this at WND all along,
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:41.540]  that what Ambassador Stevens was doing in Benghazi, and now it appears clear that was
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:48.100]  a CIA compound. There were CIA operatives on the ground that night. The last meeting
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:53.220]  that Stevens had was dinner with one of the diplomatic representatives from Turkey. It
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:47:02.060]  looks like the whole purpose of that compound was to run weapons out of Libya via Turkey
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.060]  to get them into the hand.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.620]  Sure, we both had that info a week after it happened, and now it's been confirmed, which
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:10.820]  just shows how this is all an open secret. That's my point. No one seems to care to hide
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.820]  it anymore.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:17.700]  And also, you know, there are no good guys in this story. I mean, if we, the rebels
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:23.380]  that Obama wants to support are fundamentally al-Qaeda, and many of them come from Libya
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:28.980]  after having attacked our embassy. Remember, Alex, no one has ever been identified by the
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:32.540]  Obama administration as responsible for the Benghazi attack.
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:36.580]  Yeah, they say it's a protest over our First Amendment, and then they arrest the guy that
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:38.220]  put out the video that's protected.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:43.100]  It's the only guy in jail. There's nobody, none of the attackers after all these months
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:48.540]  are in jail in any country in Northern Africa for the Benghazi attack.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.260]  All right, well, listen, listen, I agree with you that if this gets out, this is bigger
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:57.260]  than Benghazi altogether, Benghazi's part of it. But the media is so controlled, they
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:02.900]  call people with rocket launchers and tanks, activists and protesters, and then criticize
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:07.380]  the Egyptian military, which I'm not in some love fest with them either, but compared to
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:11.140]  the radical Muslim Brotherhood running around blowing up churches every day. I mean, what
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.500]  do you expect the military to do?
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:17.820]  Well, that's the problem. You see, the point is here, when you've got Obama lining up on
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:25.220]  the side of Assad, Obama also lined up on the side of Morsi, and he funded the Muslim
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:30.300]  Brotherhood. That's the evidence we've been reporting in WND. It's direct funding in
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:35.820]  the Muslim Brotherhood. Now, when that's going on, that puts Obama on the side of the bad
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:43.060]  guys, puts him on the side of the terrorists. Now, okay, so Obama says, well, Assad's the
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:48.980]  real terrorist, but we're supported. There's no side in this battle in Syria that is anyway
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:56.460] ... Exactly, but Assad didn't start it under common law and common sense. It is a serious
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:59.620]  war crime to start this proxy war with Syria.
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:06.740]  Well, in fact, what we're trying to do, I think here, is to prop up the Syrian rebels
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:10.860]  as if they were freedom fighters. That's what the Obama administration is trying to do.
[01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.340]  As if they were contras.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:17.340]  Right. Well, in fact, this makes the Iran Contra, this whole thing makes Iran Contra
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:19.460]  pale and significant. Oh, yeah.
[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:23.180]  None of this has been through Congress. None of this has been approved. None of the money
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:29.700]  that's going under the table through our embassy to the Muslim Brotherhood. That information
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:36.580]  is so damaging. I think it alone is the centerpiece of an impeachment trial. It's really treasonous.
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:41.420]  Let me ask you this then. Everything's mounting against Obama. His approval rating's plunging.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:46.500]  He's got all his advisors saying we need a false flag in the financial times of London.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:50.860]  Even post they go, gee, a terror attack was your help. Like almost encouraging him. It's
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:55.660]  so thinly veiled, I expect him to pull some big, big staged event.
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:00.700]  Well, that's what I think, you know, the whole, the concern about it's all the hours before
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:07.980]  we attack Syria. As soon as US military are involved in attack on Syria. Well, then you've
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:12.900]  got a situation where, you know, that becomes the news. US has gone to war with Syria.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.940]  And there might actually be real stuff. Iran has come out saying they're going to fire
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:21.820]  scuds at Israel if this starts. So, and then Russia comes in. This could be World War Three.
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:26.140]  How about Russia? Russia's not going to let Assad go down without a fight. And neither
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:32.140]  is Iran. You know, this is Obama taking on Russia directly or indirectly through Assad.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:36.780]  But I mean, it's clearly a direct confrontation. No, the Russians are there. It is a direct,
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:42.740]  direct confrontation. But remember, at the core of this is evidence the Egyptian government's
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:47.860]  going to use the trials on the Muslim Brotherhood. The Obama administration has been paying
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.860]  under the table. You explain what that's going to mean when we come back. I want to take
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:55.380]  a few phone calls. Mark and Joe have been holding, wanting to talk to you and I. This

[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:09.900]  Well, we've only got 6 minutes left with Dr. Jerome Corsi and when you're informed on
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:13.820]  these subjects and you know he doesn't make stuff up, plus I already separately have confirmed
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:19.220]  everything he's saying, it really shakes me up. You'd think I'd be like, oh, we got Obama.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.380]  They wouldn't be doing this unless they thought they could get away with it. I want to take
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:28.260]  two quick calls for you, Dr. Corsi, but as the Egyptians play hardball, getting their
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:32.780]  money cut off. See, I'm against foreign aid like Rand Paul because I know they're only
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:37.340]  going to give it to evil people, but now that it's people trying to fight, you know, a massacre
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:41.620]  of Christians, 30 million hit the streets demanding the military do this. They didn't
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:46.020]  have a choice. It is the will of the people. Crucifying Christians at the presidential
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:51.780]  palace. I mean, people hear this, they're like, really? Yeah, this all's going on and
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:57.100]  our government's behind it, but it's not our government. So my question is, what do
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.020]  you expect them to try to do?
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:05.860]  Well, the easiest solution is from the point of view of the Obama administration is to
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:13.180]  focus news on attacking Syria. I mean, having a war, U.S. military against Syria, of course,
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:18.100]  that escalates almost to a remarkably dangerous level. The violence going on in the Middle
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:22.820]  East, it's unpredictable, but I want to go back to, I mean, people really got to get
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:28.140]  their minds around that we have documentary evidence here. The Egyptians are releasing
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:34.740]  that completely outside the Constitution, much worse than Iran-Contra. The Obama administration
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:41.540]  is sending bribes to Muslim Brotherhood officials in Egypt under the Morsi government through
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:48.180]  our embassy. And remember that Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak had been outlawed as a criminal
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:53.780]  organization, a criminal terrorist organization. It was only after Morsi and Obama supporting
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:56:00.900]  Morsi, Obama welcoming the mother, a Muslim Brotherhood back into play in Egypt. This
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:07.500]  has been an unconstitutional, unauthorized by Congress, beneath the table, supported
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:14.020]  terrorists by the White House. And it's remarkable to find a document that the Egyptians are
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:21.580]  going to use in criminal trials with Muslim Brotherhood perhaps being executed for having
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.420]  taken these bribes from the Obama administration.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.860]  Because that's treason to take money from a foreign government to go around and shoot
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:28.860]  police.
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:34.140]  They're going to be trying to spies. The Muslim Brotherhood will be trying to spies
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:39.100]  in Egypt for taking money from the Obama administration. And the Obama administration
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.940]  has not admitted to the American people that it was paying these bribes.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:45.580]  Well, I mean, I think Obama is going to then, they're going to probably go into Syria now,
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:49.540]  like you said, as a distraction. And Lord knows what else. A new Oklahoma city, a new
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.700]  who knows. We are all in grave danger. Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest. We are linked
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:57:00.180]  through at infowars.com to all of the World Net Daily stories, wnd.com. This is unbelievable.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:04.100]  Real fast, Joe, thanks for holding on. What's your take on all this? What's your comment
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.580]  or question on Syria, the Muslim Brotherhood, all of it? Then we'll go to Mark.
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:13.220]  Hey, Alex, Dr. Corsi, thank you so much. You know what I wanted to say was Army Field
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:20.020]  Manual 3-39-40 is real. They are actually preparing internment camps. I see federal
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:25.260]  dollars, federal equipment being used to take over municipality, police departments, fire
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:31.260]  departments. They've suspended Posse Comitatis. You know what? They take over these municipalities
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:35.420]  with their dollars and with their equipment, and then the municipalities in turn have to
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:40.060]  follow the operations that get dictated from the federal government. You know what? All
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:45.340]  of this is being turned internally against us. What I wanted to ask you guys really was,
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:48.980]  do you think that this is just going to be the excuse? This is going to be the excuse
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:54.500]  of the Syrian... Oh, yeah. I mean, a proxy war with Russia. That's an excuse to bring
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:58.700]  in the martial law and then bring in their socialist agenda. Dr. Corsi.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:03.220]  Well, it's a very frightening scenario. I mean, it's one that has to be taken seriously.
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:08.980]  Clearly, there's federalizing of the state and local police going on. There's no doubt
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:14.420]  about it. And it's not happening for no reason. It's got to be happening for some reason.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:21.740]  This scenario is a very frightening one. Wow. Thank you so much, caller. Dr. Corsi,
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:25.580]  you probably got to leave, or can you do five more minutes to take a few more calls? I'll
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:29.540]  do five more minutes with you, but I do have to leave. I'm getting calls already. No, believe
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:33.060]  me. I can hear them. I can hear them bleeping. Talk to them. We'll be back in one minute.

[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:25.060]  Alex Jones. All right, I'm going to continue with geopolitical
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:28.980]  news and take calls. We've got Greg Pallas popping in for about 20, 30 minutes as well
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:35.100]  with big breaking banking news. But Dr. Jerome, of course, he held over with the massive news
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:40.900]  he was covering to take your calls. Mark, former military, former police, listening
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:47.060]  on XM Channel 244. What's your take on all this and any questions for Dr. Corsi?
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:52.940]  Well, I have a couple of questions for Dr. Corsi. Alex, but one thing I would like to
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:58.060]  make clear is, first of all, let's talk a little bit about history with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:03.660]  Remember the first World Trade Fair bombing? Okay, a lot of people don't understand that
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:11.700]  the blind sheep and others in Ramsey Yousaf and a bunch of others were actually wanted
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:19.140]  by the Egyptian authorities, but actually sought political asylum in the United States.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:24.660]  These are terrorists that we were actually at the time giving asylum in the United States
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:32.100]  too. And their thanks, of course, was to commit terrorist acts in our country. The other thing
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:40.140]  is, I have my own theory, Alex and Dr. Corsi. I believe that what is happening right now
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:46.860]  is you have three forces of globalism cooperating with each other. One, are the International
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:54.380]  Bankster corporate types. Two, are the Muslim Brotherhood and three are the communists.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:02:00.100]  Each wants their own version of globalism. Absolutely. I'm going to get Dr. Corsi's take
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:03.940]  on that. Thank you so much. But that's what I've finally learned studying this. Most
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:08.260]  old-timers already knew it, but now I really get it. The communists want a big government
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:11.060]  because they think they're going to get control. The bankers want a big government because
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:16.740]  it can loot everything they want. And the Muslim Brotherhood types, they want a big government
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:20.740]  and an open system because they want to take it over. Exactly. They all want to have the
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:23.860]  tyranny so they can run it. Dr. Corsi?
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:28.780]  Well, I want to make sure we, the time we've got, I want to stress that your caller is
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:34.140]  absolutely right. You've got to understand the tie here with this blind cheek. This
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:39.180]  blind cheek was Muslim Brotherhood. He was a criminal in our own country, a terrorist
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:43.380]  in our own country. He's the one who led to the bombing, the original bombing of the
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:48.140]  World Trade Center. Not the bombing that took it down, not the airplanes, but the original
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:52.820]  attack. And in fact, the Morsi government wanted him released.
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:56.580]  But of course, Clinton wanted to keep him because it was helpful to take our liberties.
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:01.460]  But it looks to me like Obama administration was willing to cooperate with Morsi. And we've
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:07.500]  got to go back and revisit the Benghazi attack to see if, in fact, one of the purposes was
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:13.580]  to try to capture Ambassador Stevens and hold him as a hostage for exchange with the blind
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:19.180]  cheek. I mean, these things that we're talking about today are treasonous in nature. They've
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:24.100]  been withheld from the American people. They've been withheld by Congress. Everybody's been
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:29.940]  lied to, but the truth is beginning to come out. And the Egyptian government, the point
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:35.980]  I'm stressing in the reports I'm doing since the end of last week on W&D is that the Egyptian
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:42.980]  government has decided to expose Obama. Listen, they're not going to be able to block this
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.260]  because as you said, it's in the Egyptian newspapers. It's on WorldNet Daily. It's on
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:51.140]  M4works.com. In the last 30 seconds we've got, what do you expect them to do then to
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.140]  try to block this?
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:56.940]  Well, that's where I think you're concerned about this whole issue of the nerve gas, which
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:04:02.860]  now is being taken seriously. It was not before being blamed on the Assad government, which
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:07.300]  there's not proof yet this definitive that Assad used the nerve gas.
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:09.740]  Well, the rebels have been caught staging stuff before.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:18.180]  And yet to hurt us into the idea of an attack, U.S. military attack on Syria, putting us
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:24.340]  at war with Syria, that would take the headlines off of these issues. The Obama administration
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:25.940]  does not want to have investigated.
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:29.780]  Well, I hope cooler heads prevail inside the system because this could turn into war with
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:33.860]  Russia as many analysts and you have said, and this is escalating very quickly. And Russia
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:37.540]  says they're going to stand with Assad. Do you think that's talk or do you think they'll
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:38.540]  do it?
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:42.260]  I think Russia's going to stand with Assad. It's like they say they will.
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:44.380]  Just like on 888 with Georgia.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:48.900]  I think we're on the verge of a World War III and people don't realize this.
[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:53.340]  There's the headline. Dr. Corsi, we're on the verge of World War III and people don't
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.660]  don't don't know it. God bless you, sir. Thank you.
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:56.660]  Okay. Thanks, Alex.

[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:34.420]  Okay, we're here at themfullwars.com radio studios and one of our reporters just called
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:40.420]  over here, the 100 yards, not even 100 yards, 60, 70 yards, to tell the studio that John
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:46.420]  Kerry was just on CNN. We had the TV out there on Fox that they're going to send tanks into
[02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:51.040]  the area. That is not confirmed because I need her to walk over here and tell us she
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:56.980]  saw that on there. We have CNN on in the coffee room too. Somebody could just walk over there.
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:01.420]  These cell phones, man, I expect people soon won't even breathe anymore. Your cell phone,
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:05.300]  you'll just have your consciousness downloaded into one and the cell phone will do it all.
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:13.020]  But they said yesterday, the Senate did bombing within two days. So this is unprecedented.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:18.740]  And clearly this is a false flag. The rebels have been caught doing it before. Even Yahoo
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:24.220]  News has reported on that. I'm not a fan of Assad, but compared to the Al Qaeda people
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:29.260]  they're putting in, I mean, it breaks all the rules of war, everything. Now, I wanted
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:34.580]  to get Greg Palast on who works with ABC News, BBC, you name it. There's also a bestselling
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:45.100]  author and filmmaker helped bring down Enron. I wanted to get Greg Palast on to talk about,
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:48.940]  I think I'm going to start having a headset. I can just wear it, just walk around the office
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:53.100]  like a reality show with a camera on it too and the audio. And then when stuff's breaking
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:59.260]  like this, I can just walk around and like go to the other side. In fact, we've got a
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:05.700]  video report here that John Bowne did that we're going to play. A video report he did
[02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:09.700]  because we played this yesterday, but then he pointed out, oh, I had a World War II vet
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:13.340]  when I was out in California almost getting a fight with me when I said we should ban
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:22.100]  guns and arrest people. It was a piece he did to illustrate exactly what's going on with
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.460]  mainly Democratic trendies in California, but even in Texas, in Austin, every one of
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:33.940]  them said, yes, I'm the sign of petition to disarm the American people. So we're going
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:41.980]  to go to your report, John. Here is John Bowne's report on that with the World War II vet
[02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:49.020]  at the end. This is John Bowne with Info Wars Nightly News. Here I am last week asking
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:55.460]  average citizens in Austin, Texas to sign a petition to support gun confiscation. No
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:11:02.460]  one batted an eye. They're going to start arming the TSA in malls and airports and bus
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:08.500]  stations, train stations. So a lot of those guns could go to law abiding TSA agents that
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:15.380]  need them. We'd also like to see those guns go to the TSA agents that need them in the
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:20.740]  airports and in sporting events that they're unarmed right now and they could be in a lot
[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:27.540]  of danger if there's any terrorist activity. Do you support Lee Leffingwell? We've even
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:34.420]  made the joke with him that we would melt the guns down and make him a Robocop uniform
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:42.940]  to go door to door to confiscate those guns. I am totally against people having guns.
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:47.700]  Some of these people actually have firearms and some of them have a good amount of firearms.
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:54.420]  So they're actually safely going door to door and getting those firearms in California.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:59.900]  So that's what we want to support here. Making sure that people are safe because of that.
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:06.420]  Right, absolutely. It's all about safety. Ma'am, do you have a second to sign a petition?
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:11.820]  It's for Peace on the Streets. It's an initiative here in Austin, Texas wide. It's to reduce
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:18.420]  firearms, yeah. And then we'd also like to support Obama's foreign policy by getting
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:23.140]  those guns and getting them into the hands of people that actually can use them and have
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:31.940]  professional experience like searing rebels or the TSA. And just keep our agents safe
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:37.300]  because the TSA is now going into a program where they're going to be armed.
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:43.980]  They're shooting my town in Georgia just yesterday. Oh, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Outside
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:51.860]  of Atlanta. Yeah, well, you're helping. So thank you. You guys interested in signing
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:59.060]  an initiative for Peace on the Streets here in Texas? And what we'd like to do is get
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:07.660]  those guns and get them in the hands of the TSA or, you know, in order for Obama's Syrian
[02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:16.220]  rebel policy over there in Syria to get those in the hands of the Syrian rebels. And rather
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:22.220]  than in the hands of lunatics, you know, that have their Second Amendment rights. We'll
[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:26.820]  go ahead and help out. Appreciate it. All right. Thank you. Take care. Excuse me. Do
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:33.020]  you have a second to sign a petition to keep peace on the streets? Basically, an initiative
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:38.700]  similar to the one in California where they're going door to door getting guns from people
[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:45.020]  with suspicious backgrounds as far as mental evaluations and so on. What we'd like to do
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:53.820]  is right here is fine. But we'd like to do is support Obama's foreign policy initiative
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:14:02.020]  in Syria. Oh, yeah, is that? Yeah. And get those weapons either into the hands of American
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:11.220]  agents like the TSA or into the hands of the Syrian rebels that we support or into the
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:18.380]  hands of some other unmentionables such as al-Qaeda. But we do support them. We support
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:26.020]  our enemy. So it's good to get those to our men and people who need them. Who need them?
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:32.220]  Yeah, absolutely. The TSA, who they're now arming in the airports and so on just to keep
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:41.860]  us safer. Thank you so much. Of course. Take care. A few months ago, I was in California
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:46.820]  with Mark Dice asking the Obama zombies a similar question regarding shutting down gun
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:52.100]  shows. And I had the honor of running into a true patriot, which so far has been a hard
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:58.900]  person to find. Just just to sign a petition for us, Morgan, we could post a national petition
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:05.220]  for what? Basically, we want to close the loophole for the gun shows here locally and
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:11.740]  nationally. We want to do something about the Second Amendment to help Congress know
[02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:17.500]  that the American people stand by them. No, I have to disagree with it. 100 percent. The
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:21.740]  Second Amendment was put in there for a reason. Are you sure, sir? Yes, sir. I'm absolutely
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:30.260]  sure. These guys, if you don't have it, I permit with me a pact. I have no way in hell
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:35.820]  I want anybody telling me I can. Yeah. And don't say that they won't because we've got
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:41.940]  a lion's son of a bitch that will tell you that right in office as president and as governor
[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:45.300]  of both of the state of California. Well, sir, we're trying to get people to sign away the
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:48.740]  Second Amendment today. You sure you don't want to do that? Just sign right here. Oh,
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:53.860]  yeah. Here's the First Amendment. We can knock that one out. The First Amendment is great.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:58.580]  Second Amendment is great. They put them in there for a reason. And it's not for you
[02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:05.140]  or nor me to set back and second guess our forefathers who put it in there. What about
[02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:10.980]  the prohibition? You signed that one? Well, I'm glad they kicked that one out. That there
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:20.260]  was put in, again, not by. It was put in there later. It was an add on. They add on a lot
[02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:24.220]  of bull. And they can do the same thing there. They can come in and say, hey, we're going
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:27.540]  out a lot. It can happen. Well, hopefully I can get the community, the people of the
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:33.860]  community to sign away all of their rights and put them all in the reeducation camps
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:38.780]  is what is what we're going for. And we have we have this has been proposed. Yes, sir.
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:43.980]  It has been proposed. Well, hopefully we'll be victorious. Well, I hope we hope in our
[02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:53.420]  liberal. They have good words. He's gonna wipe my feet. John bound info wars nightly
[02:16:53.420 --> 02:16:58.980]  news. Okay, that's a good report bound put out. You can see the full thing if you're
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.500]  ready to listen up on info wars dot com. You heard a little bit technical difficulties
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:08.260]  as they were feeding CNN over the board earlier is what you heard of your radio listener.
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:12.660]  I ran over and checked all this. Kerry's going to make an announcement the next few hours.
[02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:16.380]  The Secretary of State, Obama's going to be at some event handing out medals. I thought
[02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:21.820]  he was on vacation. But the point is, is that they're definitely going to hand out the medals
[02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:28.460]  and then over patriotic it's for the troops from the halls of Montezuma to the shores
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:36.980]  of Tripoli. We will attack your nation after false flags and hand it over to Al Qaeda E.
[02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:40.780]  So I shouldn't even be joking around about this. This is very, very sick. Greg Palace
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:45.100]  is with us for the next 40 minutes or so. And we're getting him on a bit late. I'm sorry
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:50.780]  about that. We had some technical difficulties. But he joins us. He is, of course, a syndicated
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:54.700]  columnist, documentary filmmaker, bestselling author, Greg Palace dot com. He's worked for
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:18:00.340]  ABC, ABC News. You name it. He broke some of the big banking scandals back in 2002 with
[02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:05.460]  the documents that are planning a global meltdown by design to consolidate power. And he exposes
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:09.940]  the left, the right, all the kleptocratic bankers that are in control of this. But we're going
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:13.220]  to break in two minutes, Greg. We're going to come back and get in to the banking big
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:18.860]  breaking news you've got. But what is your take on lining up against Russia with Syria?
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:22.740]  And I mean, these rebels have been caught staging false flags before. Why are we supposed
[02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:27.700]  to believe them now? Why would Assad nerve gas right in front of the UN so he can be
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:33.660]  blown up? Well, I don't, you know, to me, it looks like these people were gassed. The
[02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:39.260]  question is, of course, who I think it's Assad. He's not exactly a genius, but don't forget.
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:44.220]  No, no, but I believe it. I believe people were gassed, Greg. Yeah, I'm saying, I'm saying,
[02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:50.140]  I don't think he did it. Well, I don't know. I mean, but what we do know is that, you know,
[02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:54.380]  we look, let's remember just like Saddam Hussein, Assad, Saddam Hussein, they all come from
[02:18:54.380 --> 02:19:01.100]  the same Frankenstein factory. You got to go back to the years of Carter and Bush, Democrats
[02:19:01.100 --> 02:19:07.620]  and Republicans putting these guys into positions of power in the Middle East. And then, you
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:11.220]  know, like it often happens when you create Frankenstein's, they get up off the table and
[02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:14.980]  try to kill you or kill someone else. They're out of control. You know, the remote control
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:19.540]  button doesn't always work. And I think that's what we're seeing here is that in a lot of
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:24.020]  the states, you put in Mubarak, that didn't work. We started playing footsie with the
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:29.940]  Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Now we're back with the military. We have a big problem with
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.780]  a lot of the Frankenstein's that came out of the Frankenstein factory. And you know,
[02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:37.780]  I can't tell whether Assad did this or not, you know, but you have to go back to where
[02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:43.460]  did this stuff start? And, you know, who, who put him in office? Who kept him there?
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:47.380]  And don't forget that Obama said he really wanted to cuddle up and talk to Assad when
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:52.380]  he was running in the primaries, democratic primaries. And here we are now.
[02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:58.020]  All right, we're going to come back and we are going to get into the big financial bombshell
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:00.020]  dealing with Larry Summers.
[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:04.940]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the

[02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:03.340]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be
[02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:07.980]  linked to toxins and deficiencies combined. Improving your liver function and restoring
[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:13.020]  your cell's ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health. Listen to the
[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:16.860]  real world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:21.380]  My name is Doug DiDero. For years I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes. This
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:25.940]  was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace. After being on One
[02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:30.980]  World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:38.020]  eyes. This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone. Additionally without
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:43.020]  extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:44.740]  a more attractive figure.
[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:55.740]  Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com. That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:56.740]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:56.740 --> 02:24:11.740]  By the way, John Kerry, aka Frankenstein himself with all that Botox, he used to be a halfway
[02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:17.380]  handsome man, distinguished looking. Now, look at him. He looks like a rubber face, like
[02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:23.500]  a fake face on Halloween. He's got so much Botox or whatever happened to him. Maybe he
[02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:29.340]  had a stroke, I don't know, but man, it's bad. He's going to get up there supposedly
[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:33.020]  in like five minutes. It was going to be an hour ago, then 20 minutes ago, then two hours
[02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:38.820]  from now. But yeah, there's this new rubber face, the new face of John Kerry. Going back
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:44.140]  to Greg Pallas. Greg, I mean, I understand you not taking sides on the whole, you know,
[02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:47.980]  a sod thing, because he's obviously a bad guy, but putting al-Qaeda in is even worse.
[02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:55.700]  Yeah, I mean, look, we did this. We don't forget. Who put in the Mujahideen in Afghanistan
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:25:00.580]  that we have, how many kids, 2,000 kids have died there, fighting the guys that we armed
[02:25:00.580 --> 02:25:01.580]  in the first place?
[02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:04.060]  And a couple thousand from suicide. Well, shifting yours out of that, we'll cover it
[02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:10.420]  as it unfolds. You've got a big story out now on Larry Summers, our new special Treasury
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:14.220]  Secretary. I mean, I think he's the man for the job. If he helped engineer the too big
[02:25:14.220 --> 02:25:20.380]  to fail Ponzi scheme derivatives deals, credit default swaps, why not make him Emperor of
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:21.380]  the Earth?
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:27.420]  Well, because he's not, in my opinion, actually human. My information is that Larry Summers,
[02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:33.260]  who is Obama's first choice for the Federal Reserve Board to take Ben Bernanke's place
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:34.260]  in.
[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:36.820]  Here's Lemmy Winx from South Park.
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:42.100]  Well, I think that he's actually a colony of aliens sent here to turn the human race
[02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:49.460]  into a cheap source of protein. But in all seriousness, Larry Summers is Obama's first
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:55.180]  choice for the head of the Federal Reserve Board to take Bernanke's place. He was Secretary
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:26:02.500]  of Treasury under Clinton, where he with Robert Rubin pushed and created the whole deregulation
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:08.780]  of banking system, turning your bank vaults into roulette wheels. And he's the guy that
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:16.980]  personally, personally body blocked all regulation of the derivatives market, all these financial
[02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:22.260]  toxic assets like synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which we lived without,
[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:26.260]  by the way, for several thousand years. And suddenly we had to have these things, which
[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:29.460]  brought our planet financially to its knees.
[02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:36.740]  So this is Larry Summers. He's kind of the typhoid Mary of economics. And now he's back
[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:44.500]  as Obama's first choice for the Fed. The key thing is, and of course he was Obama's economics
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:48.580]  czar. That worked out really well. We have fewer jobs, fewer people working today than
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:51.540]  we did when Obama took the oath of office.
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:56.260]  So unemployment's down because employment is way down. People just don't have jobs.
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.580]  I was just in Detroit. There's no one's looking for jobs. So they're not in the, technically,
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:05.180]  auto workers out of work are not in the workforce. Okay. So understand what's going on here.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:14.500]  This is Obama's economics czar, Mr. deregulation. Now my story, which I did for, that I was
[02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:22.620]  doing for a BBC television guardian, my story is that I found inside documents, confidential
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:27.700]  documents, which were so unbelievable that I had to fly to Geneva, Switzerland, speak
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:33.180]  to the head of the WTO himself to get confirmation that these things are real. It was documents
[02:27:33.180 --> 02:27:39.860]  in which Timothy Geithner, later to become Secretary of Treasury under Obama, was writing
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:47.340]  to his boss at the time, Larry Summers, of Treasury, saying, reminding him about the
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:52.580]  meetings that they had and that he had to make phone calls to the five most powerful
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:58.700]  bankers in America, the head of Citibank, the head of Goldman Sachs, Merrill, Bank of
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:05.060]  America. He took the five big bankers and he had secret phone calls with them on a scheme
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:12.460]  to blow apart regulation of the banking system worldwide. Now he called it the end game memo
[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:16.740]  as we reached the end game. Well, we're the end game. I don't like the game at all, but
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:20.940]  the end of it was not too pretty. It was extraordinary because you have to understand
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:26.420]  it's illegal. He's not allowed to meet. Larry Summers is not allowed to have private phone
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:32.980]  calls with billionaire bankers to determine what the financial policies of the United
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:36.460]  States should be. Now he can have meetings with bankers. That's legal. You can't have
[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:42.020]  secret meetings with bankers to get their approval and veto and determination of what
[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:46.380]  our policies should be. And in this case, it was deadly because it was a plan to blow
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:53.460]  apart the regulations of banking in 156 nations and they did it in 155 nations. They did it
[02:28:53.460 --> 02:29:01.340]  by abusing the World Trade Organization's trade rules. 156 nations were told by Larry
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:08.340]  Summers and his coterie that unless they opened up their banking sectors to Citibank, Goldman
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:13.580]  Sachs, Bank of America and the rest of the boys that any nation would have their markets
[02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:18.260]  closed to the United States and they'd go bankrupt. And then the rest of the plan was
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:23.420]  to then have all of their investments in those countries pooled like Greece has done into
[02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:28.860]  the toxic derivatives so they could then hijack them and hold them hostage to then pay reparations
[02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:33.860]  to the people that sold them the crud to begin with, correct? Yeah, this is the art since
[02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:37.260]  they started to fire and then they make money on the fire to save. This is how it works.
[02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:41.460]  Wow, this is off the charts. The news today on this show is just unbelievable. Stay there,
[02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:46.060]  break this down technically for us. The articles at GregPalace.com, Vice.com, and we're posting
[02:29:46.060 --> 02:29:50.500]  it right now at infowars.com.
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:57.500]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:50.500 --> 02:31:06.460]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:11.500]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:17.900]  autism, and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we
[02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:24.340]  eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:30.140]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:35.020]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists. By giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:41.300]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio

[02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:09.700]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:16.140]  of information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how
[02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:23.140]  to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing
[02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:28.220]  machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When
[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:32.980]  somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying
[02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:37.180]  it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast you need
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:42.180]  to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they
[02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:49.180]  would not only endorse but demand a war. All of another one, another plane to take.
[02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:20.180]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. I will interrupt my liners. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.180 --> 02:33:26.620]  No scripting around here, ladies and gentlemen. You know, I'm on the air so much as I live
[02:33:26.620 --> 02:33:32.180]  on the radio. I'm more self-conscious when I'm walking around the streets of Austin,
[02:33:32.180 --> 02:33:38.060]  Texas, or New York City than I am on the radio or giving a speech to thousands. That's when
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:43.420]  you know you're a veteran of broadcast, 18 years on the air, doing as much as 10 hours
[02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:48.380]  of broadcast a day at some times. I'll do about four hours a day right now. But there
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:52.860]  is just so much going on in the world, so much happening. We're going to go back to
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:58.420]  Greg Palast here in just a moment with his big breaking news, but just briefly getting
[02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:05.260]  back to what I was saying before the liner came in. We are live from the infoworks.com
[02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:09.220]  studios here in Austin, Texas. Yes, that is accurate. Tomorrow, I'm going to go ahead
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:15.300]  and announce in a video press release, but also here live on the radio, the particulars
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:24.020]  of the Obama deception too, when it will go on pre-sale and when it will premiere on
[02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:31.020]  prisonplanet.tv and when the DVDs will actually ship out to everybody. And my problem is I'm
[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:37.540]  always so busy doing the radio show, so busy doing the nightly news, running the crew,
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:43.500]  doing research, the business end of things to fund this operation that I make these viral
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:50.500]  films that get seen five, 10, 20, 30, 40 plus million times. The average film has seen about
[02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:55.780]  five million times on YouTube, just on one platform, but we've done the math. Obama deception,
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:35:03.580]  the first one, you can say well over 40 million, well over 40 million. It had over 20 million
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:07.540]  views on its Google account before they stopped when people use Google and then see the numbers
[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:12.980]  and then shot us out, but it's still up on Google video, remember Google video. And that's
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:17.220]  my point, it's got like 13 million on one and 5 million on other and 3 million on other
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:20.660]  and 2 million on other and 1 million on other and a half million on another and a million
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:26.660]  on another. 40 million people conservatively saw that film for free, but it's the seed
[02:35:26.660 --> 02:35:33.060]  money of the people that buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts that support our sponsors
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:38.980]  that allows us to make films like this. I've been up here seven days a week, seven days
[02:35:38.980 --> 02:35:44.260]  a week the last few weeks at least, six days a week the few months before that and I'm
[02:35:44.260 --> 02:35:48.980]  going to be up here except for a few days I'm going to take off with my children pretty
[02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:56.180]  much continually to get this film done. The problem is I'll have it done and then I'll
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:59.860]  have like two, three weeks to promote it, but I need to line up doing radio interviews,
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:04.580]  TV and everybody's helped get it out there to people and everybody to buy the DVD to
[02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:09.140]  have good high quality high def showings, we're having on Blu-ray too in your area.
[02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:12.980]  I want to try to set up some impromptu deal where we can mail out copies to people and
[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:16.820]  authorize them to put it in local theaters. It's very easy and I'm going back to Greg
[02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:20.580]  in a minute, I just want to plug this. It's very easy, the problem is just the logistics
[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:23.940]  of telling people how to do it and telling them how to not get ripped off too because
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:28.660]  some theaters will rip you off. Yeah, you can rent a theater that seats $500 for $3,000.
[02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:33.220]  No, no, no folks, you can go to theaters now and then you have the letter authorizing you
[02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:38.900]  to play a film on DVD with the big projectors where you can have 500 people there and they
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:44.180]  sign you up and as soon as a third of the tickets are sold it pays for itself and then
[02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:49.940]  you make all the money after it. That's how it's supposed to work and they know with popular films
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:55.540]  that's how that works. That's actually what happened with Obama 2016 but I'm already kind
[02:36:55.540 --> 02:37:00.420]  of making the announcement today. I'll make it tomorrow officially. It's just that I really
[02:37:00.420 --> 02:37:04.420]  want to expose the globalists and it's not that Obama is anything but a puppet but through
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:09.220]  people waking up to Obama being a fraud they can wake up to all the rest of the fraud and this is
[02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:13.220]  going to be three times more powerful than the first Obama deception. Speaking of funding,
[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:19.940]  I'm going to Greg Paulus. We are a launchpad for all these journalists, all these good people in
[02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:25.460]  Congress, members of parliament in England, the EU parliament, liberal, conservative, libertarian.
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:30.260]  If you love justice, this is the broadcast for you. If you love truth, if you love getting the hard
[02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:35.860]  answers and the breaking news, this is it. But we need your support and we sell the best books,
[02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:40.500]  the best videos, the best t-shirts, info, our store.com, great ways to wake up other people.
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:46.020]  We have the pro-peer water filtration systems that are the best gravity-fed stainless steel
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:50.980]  system out there. It's what I and my family use. Blows away the competition in side-by-side
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:56.820]  comparisons. The fluoride, the glyphosate cuts it out. So important to do this. We have the lowest
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:38:04.980]  price on their whole line and we go 10% off with promo code water, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:09.620]  Go there and there's a lot of other great water filter systems as well,
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:13.860]  like the Livestraw and other systems. We have the seed center to plant your late summer
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:19.940]  fall garden from fruit trees to you name it. It's all there, infowarstore.com,
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:26.980]  promoting high-quality products at very low prices and funding a free people's news system.
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:32.420]  We are powered by the truth here at infowars.com, ladies and gentlemen, and we're powered by
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:37.540]  patriots like you, so thank you for the support. All right, now going back to Greg Palast, who
[02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:42.820]  again with the Guardian, BBC, does stuff for Vice, you name it. He's all over the place and we're
[02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:46.260]  always honored to have him here with us and he's pointed out by the way, I'm not bragging,
[02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:50.100]  I'm just pointing this out that sometimes he can't get a story out, infowars will cover it
[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:54.980]  here in the U.S. There's not many of those places out there, but Greg's another truly independent,
[02:38:54.980 --> 02:39:00.420]  formerly a top federal fraud investigator and now he just does that as a freelance guy. Get
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:06.180]  into this memo, break it down, what it means and other things that are happening geopolitically
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:10.420]  in the financial markets, what's happening with interest rates, what your big sources are saying
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:16.100]  is really going to happen with the economy and then, is this the end of Obama? Will the establishment
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:21.380]  flush him? Go ahead. I don't know if they're going to be done with Obama. They haven't wiped,
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:26.980]  yes, I don't know if they're going to flush him. I think that he puts in Larry Summers, he's done
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:34.100]  their job. Again, I want to go back and just tuned in. Larry Summers is the first choice,
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:40.260]  Obama's made it clear to replace Ben Bernanke as head of the Federal Reserve Board. Again,
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:44.900]  Larry Summers was Secretary of Treasury under Clinton, he was Robert Rubin's assistant,
[02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:49.860]  he was the guy that pushed hard for the elimination of all banking protections and
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:54.980]  regulations. It was like eliminating the cops on the beats on the banks so that we ended up with
[02:39:54.980 --> 02:40:00.740]  investment bank casinos mixed with your piggy bank commercial banks and we saw the disaster.
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:05.940]  It was Summers who stopped any regulation of the derivatives trade and of course Obama made him
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:12.660]  our economic czar and that worked out very wonderfully. Now, the Obama had also picked
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:19.780]  Robert Rubin's protege, Tim Geithner to be his Secretary of Treasury. I got my hands on a memo.
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:24.180]  It was so explosive, I literally had a flight to Geneva, Switzerland to confirm
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:28.500]  that it was the real thing that someone wasn't putting me on. I do have to worry about that
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:34.660]  and what it is, it's called the end game memo. Tim Geithner who would become Secretary of Treasury
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:41.060]  writes to Larry Summers, Secretary of the Treasury and says, okay, it's the end game. Now, you got
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:47.940]  to remember to call the boys, the boys being the five biggest bankers in America, Citibank,
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:55.620]  Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill, we had so the five big bankers. Now, what were they,
[02:40:55.620 --> 02:40:58.660]  why do you have to call them? And first of all, by the way, their phone numbers were in there and
[02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:05.380]  Alex, you would love this. I actually called Reid, the CEO of Citibank, later became chairman,
[02:41:05.380 --> 02:41:09.540]  and got him directly. No Secretary, nothing. These are the private phone numbers. Now,
[02:41:09.540 --> 02:41:14.900]  by my rules at BBC, I had to say who I was and as soon as he found out I wasn't Larry Summers or
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:19.700]  Robert Rubin, clicky hung up and all the phone numbers were changed. By the way, it included
[02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:25.540]  the private phone, the personal phone of John Corzine, who is now facing criminal charges for
[02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:31.300]  felony financial fraud. You know, you are like the original wiki leaker, but you do it out in
[02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:35.460]  the open. In fact, I want to shift gears before we go back into this. I've got to ask this before I
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:41.140]  forget. If they are trying to put a signs in jail and saying killing with drones on Fox News now,
[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:47.780]  if they're getting away with all this stuff, and they tried what six years ago, when you were
[02:41:47.780 --> 02:41:52.020]  investigating chemical plants to actually have you put in jail as a terrorist for filming critical
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:56.820]  infrastructure when you were working for ABC News. But I mean, this whole attack on the press,
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:02.100]  you're kind of like one of the original wiki leakers. How have you survived?
[02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:08.900]  That's a good question. I was charged under the anti-terrorism rules by Homeland Security
[02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:16.340]  for investigating exon chemical plants. And I've obviously, this is an internal document,
[02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:20.980]  an internal document of the Treasury Department, which is confidential, under the rules by which
[02:42:20.980 --> 02:42:29.460]  they are attacking Snowden and Manning. I guess I am, I'm liable too. And now I work with the same
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:34.980]  organization, The Guardian, as a wiki that produced wiki leaks and the Snowden reports.
[02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:40.340]  Greenwald, yeah. Well, I'm willing, you know, I'm facing, you know, we'll see what happens.
[02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:44.740]  You've got, you've got gigantic wave-o's. Well, let's put this way. I didn't know
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:47.860]  what else I was going to do with it, except make it public. My main concern, of course,
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:52.820]  is always what does it mean? The reason I get these documents that they're often highly technical.
[02:42:52.820 --> 02:43:00.100]  And in this case, what it was, was how can the big boys, the five bankers, working with Larry
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:06.180]  Summers and Tim Geithner and Robert Rubin, how could they possibly eliminate banking regulations
[02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:13.140]  in 156 nations at one time in one moment? How do you know they could come in and get governments
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:17.380]  to invest all the pension funds and things in their garbage to then hold everyone hostage?
[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:22.820]  That's clearly from my research, what they've done. Right. And can you elaborate on that?
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:26.660]  Yes. And what's happened is in this memo, the first step was to make that practice legal.
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:31.540]  Remember, that was illegal. Derivatives, first of all, transferring capital between borders,
[02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:36.100]  instant manipulation of currencies. That type of thing was completely illegal. Banks weren't
[02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:42.020]  allowed to bet on the movements of interest. So this is LIBOR gas part two. Right. So this was,
[02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:46.580]  this is completely illegal activity. So how do you legalize what was previously criminal?
[02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:51.220]  What you do is you change the international law, which is the World Trade Organization's
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:57.060]  general agreement on tariff and trade. And they use something called the financial services
[02:43:57.060 --> 02:44:02.900]  agreement, an obstruc weird document that was previously about simple things like trading.
[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:07.860]  Like if we had someone fix an airplane, a Boeing airplane, another country, that's international
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:12.820]  trade. Suddenly they decide, okay, we're going to put in derivatives into this, that if you want
[02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:17.540]  to sell us your bananas, this they told to Ecuador, for example, I spoke to the president of Ecuador,
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:22.900]  by the way, about this. They said, if you want to sell us your bananas, then you're going to have
[02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:27.780]  to agree to open your banking sector to JP Morgan and its derivatives, because we're going to buy
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:32.980]  your bananas with derivatives. And they say, well, we, what do we do? We can't eat derivatives.
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:37.860]  They say, well, try to eat all your bananas, baby. So Ecuador signed and then they went bankrupt and
[02:44:37.860 --> 02:44:45.060]  the streets erupted into violence. Argentina signed, they blew up into riots. Greece signed,
[02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:52.180]  and Greece ended up working currency swap deals with Goldman Sachs as a way to hide their deficit.
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:58.820]  When that came out, Greece ended up in flames, 25% unemployment. JP Morgan did the same
[02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:06.420]  derivatives trick with Spain, 26.3% official unemployment. Can you imagine? 26% official
[02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:14.260]  unemployment to Alex? So this is all coming out of this massive decriminalization of banking
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:20.900]  shenanigans involving derivatives trade, currency manipulation, and all being done through this
[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:26.340]  document called the financial services agreement. Basically, if you want to sell anything to the
[02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:30.980]  United States, the biggest market in the world, then you better open up, you better open up your
[02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:38.820]  bank vaults and your treasuries to Goldman Sachs and the rest of the boys. And there was one nation,
[02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:44.020]  Alex, that resisted out of 156 nations. One nation refused. Iceland.
[02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:51.700]  Unfortunately, Iceland melted as you know. No, Brazil, a guy named Lula took over. He was.
[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:58.900]  Oh, absolutely. They refused. They refused after the deal had been set up. Right. But in the case
[02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:03.860]  of Brazil, they said no up front. That's right. They said Brazil said was the only, the only
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:09.460]  one out of 156 nations say no, no, no derivatives here. You can't move capital in and out of our
[02:46:09.460 --> 02:46:14.580]  country like it, like, you know, in two seconds on a push of a button. And what happened was that
[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:21.860]  Brazil, Brazil ended up being the only nation in the Western hemisphere to not go under during the
[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:26.500]  financial crisis. I mean, the US obviously suffered enormously, but you know, you went from Mexico,
[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:30.740]  Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador, you name it. And again, this is their design. They come in,
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:34.900]  they take over, they flood everything with their counterfeit stuff, implode your economy using it,
[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:38.980]  and then come in and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar with the derivatives
[02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:44.020]  that your country's just gone bankrupt guaranteeing. Well, in fact, just so you know that in the case
[02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:49.060]  of Brazil, I got another note from the European Union threatening them saying, you don't sign
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:54.340]  this thing, baby, and you can suck your own orange juice. You know, most minute made orange juice
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:59.780]  comes from Brazil. And so they were going to try to bring Brazil to its knees. But later,
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:06.020]  they had to let Brazil go because they basically because Brazil is huge and it survived the crash
[02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:10.580]  because it didn't sign onto this crap. They let it go for a while because it's the only thing holding
[02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:16.260]  us up. Absolutely. That's why I've got a Brazil soccer t-shirt. So good for them. I want to expand
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:21.380]  on something here with you though. This is globalism, where they're above the law, their tax exempt,
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:28.500]  they write the regulations. Obama raised the cost of carbon a few weeks ago that's paid partially
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:36.980]  into his own mercantile holdings in Al Gore's in a microwave regulation subsection on microwave
[02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:44.740]  ovens. That's an example of how under the WTO and all this obscure stuff, they're already governing us
[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:49.460]  by getting our countries to sign onto this. So that's what the new world order is,
[02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:54.500]  is a bunch of kleptocratic above the law mega corporations that are totally lawless,
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:48:01.220]  looting everyone and they now brag world government oven for Goldman Sachs. So my question to you is,
[02:48:01.220 --> 02:48:07.540]  how are they doing? Because this is coming out, but they still don't get in trouble.
[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:13.700]  Well, this is a very good point. I mean, as I said on a recent show, who's going to tell
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:18.500]  Goldman Sachs and who's going to tell Larry Summers, spread them and read them their rights?
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:22.420]  Who's going to bust them? Eric Holder? I mean, this is one of the problems is that remember,
[02:48:22.420 --> 02:48:28.180]  this is the Federal Reserve, which is what Larry Summers is being set up to take over,
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:32.900]  is part of our police force over the financial community. So you're talking about turning the
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:39.700]  mob over to, you know, giving the mob the status of chief of police. There is the problem is,
[02:48:39.700 --> 02:48:45.460]  these are supposed to be our regulators. This is scary stuff. These are the regulators,
[02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:48.740]  and they're having secret meetings with the people they're supposed to be regulating.
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:52.100]  It's against the law. I don't know what to do, scream, holler, turn purple. I mean,
[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:56.420]  all I can do is put these documents up. In fact, it was so evil and so weird that
[02:48:56.420 --> 02:49:00.660]  Summers would be making these illegal phone calls that I had, you know, that like I said,
[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:06.020]  it flew to Europe. By the way, I talked to a member of the cabinet, Joe Stiglitz was at the time,
[02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:13.620]  the chairman of the president's council of economists. So he was invited into the cabinet
[02:49:13.620 --> 02:49:18.740]  meetings where Summers would turn to Reuben and they were talking about deregulating the financial
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:23.140]  markets. And he said, well, what would Goldman think of this? And he said, at every meeting he
[02:49:23.140 --> 02:49:27.780]  went to the cabinet, it was Summers saying to Reuben, what would Goldman think? What would Goldman
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:34.100]  Sachs think? And finally, Stiglitz said, don't you think it's improper to be asking what Goldman
[02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:39.220]  Sachs thinks of a US policy? Isn't it important to find out what the facts are? What's the best
[02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:43.700]  for the American public? We didn't, you know, like, and they looked at him. I mean, Summers and Reuben
[02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:47.940]  looked at him like, what did you do? The seem too many episodes of the West Wing are just falling
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:53.780]  off a watermelon truck, you know? So when Stiglitz, so Stiglitz was disinvited from the cabinet of
[02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:58.740]  the United States because he didn't want, he didn't care what Goldman thought of the policies. He
[02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:03.780]  was wondering what the American people would think of the policies. Let me ask you this question.
[02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:07.780]  Isn't it their hubris though? Because at a certain point you got Corazon making 40 to
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:14.260]  one bets with other people's money. These guys are so arrogant, so hoodspub filled. They have
[02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:19.780]  such bravada. I guess hubris would be the best word I'm looking for. That, you know, it's like
[02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:24.180]  Hitler invading Russia or something. I mean, at a certain point, won't they bring themselves down?
[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:29.780]  Well, unfortunately, I wish that that were true. Sometimes individually, like guys like Corazon,
[02:50:29.780 --> 02:50:34.340]  who was on the list of the secret for the secret contacts, he's, I think, going to end up in
[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:39.380]  prison because he broke a rule of the game. He started stealing money from his fellows in the
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:45.380]  club. He started taking their money. Oh, just like Madoff broke the rules. You break the code.
[02:50:45.380 --> 02:50:50.180]  You break the code and then forget it. They're going to throw away the key. So Corazon broke
[02:50:50.180 --> 02:50:55.460]  their code. But what he didn't do is, you know, he never exposed their big game. So for example...
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:50:58.660]  I tell you what, stay there. I'm going to come back. Let's hear about the big game with Greg

[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:25.380]  Okay folks, about a minute ago John Kerry started giving his speech. We've got a DVR in there.
[02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:28.740]  It's going live right now but we're going to back it up to the start. Do you have it backed up yet
[02:54:28.740 --> 02:54:36.820]  guys? Do you have it backed up guys? Okay, we're going to go back to Greg Palast here in just a
[02:54:36.820 --> 02:54:41.380]  moment. In fact, Greg, I'm going to be talking to you again, taping some stuff for Obama Deception
[02:54:41.380 --> 02:54:45.940]  2. We're going to be reconnecting with you but finishing up with the point while we queue up
[02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:51.540]  this carry. Finishing up with the point, I just saw he said it's unequivocal, total evidence,
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:57.300]  they nerve gas. This is WMD. This is anthrax at the at the at the UN with Colin Powell.
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:03.060]  This is horrible. Another war, ladies and gentlemen, but going back to finishing the point
[02:55:03.060 --> 02:55:08.500]  that you were going to make when we came back from break about how big a situation this is and
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:12.500]  how Corzine broke the rule, finish up with that for us and other key points.
[02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:19.460]  Well, so what's happened is that, yes, as I said, Larry Summers, Obama's choice for Federal Reserve
[02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:24.740]  Board chief to take Bernanke's place was constantly saying in cabinet meetings, what would Goldman
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:29.380]  think? In other words, policy should be determined based on what Goldman Sachs wants. That's the
[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:33.060]  game. That's how you play the game. So the question, and by the way, I got that from a member of the
[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:37.140]  cabinet, Joe Stiglitz, who was horrified, said, what do you mean? Why are we asking about Goldman
[02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:44.420]  Sachs? How about the American people? Joe America, right? No, can't do that. So, you know, the problem
[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:50.020]  is, once they decriminalized under this scheme, under the end game memo, the end of the game was
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:56.340]  to decriminalize activities such as selling and operating, using currency derivatives to move
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:56:02.340]  capital across countries to hide capital and to manipulate currencies and interest rates.
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:06.900]  And the problem is, of course, it blows up. Now, in the case of Greece, Goldman Sachs
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:15.700]  worked to deal secretly with the Greek government to hide, to use euro swaps. It's a complex
[02:56:15.700 --> 02:56:20.820]  transaction, to use euro derivatives to hide their government deficits. When this fraud was
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:28.020]  uncovered, the Greek economy exploded and imploded. Goldman Sachs received a fee of $400 million
[02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:32.820]  for what, you know, I used to be, like I said, I was a fraud investigator. In the old good old days,
[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:38.020]  we used to handcuff people for doing that. The fraud upon the market of that order, billions of
[02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:44.980]  dollars with all these massive unemployment, that's usually, you know... And now they're gonna reward
[02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:48.500]  Summers with making them the head of the Treasury. Do you think that's gonna happen?
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:55.460]  Head of the Fed? I... The head of the Fed, yeah. It's 50-50. Obviously, Obama's dying to do this
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:56:59.220]  for his bank... Right, I'm in head of the Fed. I always flip stuff around in my head.
[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:04.500]  But, you know, it's like, I think that there's gonna be a lot of... All this crap of mine is
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:08.740]  coming up. They know that there are a lot of senators who are gonna stick this thing on his
[02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:14.580]  face at his appointment, at his confirmation hearings. Remember, Obama named him Economic
[02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:19.780]  Tsar as opposed to Secretary of the Treasury because he didn't want Summers to go through a
[02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:24.740]  confirmation process. How's this guy who's basically mobbed up gonna get through a confirmation?
[02:57:24.740 --> 02:57:28.660]  Absolutely. Well, listen, Greg, thank you so much. We're gonna talk to you in about 15 minutes
[02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:33.380]  for Obama's exception, too. Thank you so much, sir. You're very welcome. Good luck. Thank you.
[02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:38.020]  GregPalest.com. Folks, I can hardly talk right now. I'm gonna come back from break and play what
[02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:42.740]  I just saw during the break. Kerry out there saying, unquestionably, they launched the chemical
[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:46.900]  attack with no evidence. And I haven't even seen the rest of the speech. They're all in there
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:51.060]  watching it live right now. I'm about to throw up because they've already just blown up all those
[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:56.180]  churches and put al-Qaeda in there, and they're trying to overthrow Egypt. They've overthrown Libya
[02:57:56.180 --> 02:58:00.100]  and they're taking our rights away using these al-Qaeda people they run. They've given them
[02:58:00.100 --> 02:58:04.740]  heat-seeking missiles. And just what I saw two minutes of it, they're going to start bombing
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:11.540]  the daylights out of Syria. And Russia's there with ships. And I know I feel so sick. These
[02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:16.180]  bankers are crazy. This could turn into World War III with the Russians. The Russian ships are
[02:58:16.180 --> 02:58:19.540]  there up against the U.S. ships, but they're not U.S. ships. They might as well have an
[02:58:20.900 --> 02:58:25.460]  all-seeing eye pyramid on them. I mean, we're a captured country, and it makes me so sick. So
[02:58:25.460 --> 02:58:30.180]  I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive. I'm going to come back and play part of the Kerry
[02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:37.300]  speech. Truly, truly disgusting. If your station doesn't carry it, infowords.com forward slash
[02:58:37.300 --> 02:58:46.100]  show for the audio and video feeds right now. Pray for peace, folks. Pray for justice, and pray
[02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:50.020]  for the little children of Syria, having their heads chopped off by al-Qaeda.
[02:58:50.020 --> 02:58:56.980]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all
[02:58:56.980 --> 02:59:03.620]  caused by infectious pathogens. Fortunately, a simple, safe, and effective alternative exists.

[03:00:16.340 --> 03:00:22.340]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:46.340 --> 03:01:04.100]  Let's go to the beginning of the speech here. Let's just play it, play it from the start.
[03:01:04.100 --> 03:01:07.300]  Here is Kerry just minutes ago. He's still going right now.
[03:01:07.300 --> 03:01:10.340]  All right, the Secretary of State is now at the State Department.
[03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:24.340]  The security team have been reviewing the situation in Syria and today I want to provide an update on our efforts as we consider our response to the use of chemical weapons.
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:34.340]  What we saw in Syria last week should shock the conscience of the world. It defies any code of morality. Let me be clear.
[03:01:34.340 --> 03:01:44.340]  The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children, and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity.
[03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:56.340]  By any standard, it is inexcusable and despite the excuses and equivocations that some have manufactured, it is undeniable.
[03:01:56.340 --> 03:02:06.340]  The meaning of this attack goes beyond the conflict in Syria itself and that conflict has already brought so much terrible suffering.
[03:02:06.340 --> 03:02:16.340]  This is about the large-scale indiscriminate use of weapons that the civilized world long ago decided must never be used at all.
[03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:22.340]  A conviction shared even by countries that agree on the rules.
[03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:28.340]  There is a clear reason that the world has banned entirely the use of chemical weapons.
[03:02:28.340 --> 03:02:38.340]  There is a reason the international community has set a clear standard and why many countries have taken major steps to eradicate these weapons.
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:48.340]  There is a reason why President Obama has made it such a priority to stop the proliferation of these weapons and lock them down where they do exist.
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:58.340]  There is a reason why President Obama has made clear to the Assad regime that this international norm cannot be violated without consequences.
[03:02:58.340 --> 03:03:17.340]  And there is a reason why no matter what you believe about Syria, all nations who believe in the cause of our common humanity must stand up to assure that there is accountability for the use of chemical weapons so that it never happens again.
[03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:30.340]  Last night, after speaking with foreign ministers from around the world about the gravity of this situation, I went back and I watched the videos that anybody can watch in the social media.
[03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:49.340]  Now watch them one more gut-wrenching time. It is really hard to express in words the human suffering that they lay out before us. As a father, I can't get the image out of my head of the man who murdered his dead child, willing while chaos swirled around him.
[03:03:49.340 --> 03:04:02.340]  The images of entire families dead in their beds without a drop of blood, a million of their physical wounds, bodies, all the dead living in spasms, human suffering that we can never ignore.
[03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:20.340]  You could claim that an attack of this staggering scale could be contrived or fabricated, needs to check their conscience, and their own world comes.
[03:04:20.340 --> 03:04:36.340]  So I also want to underscore that while investigators are gathering additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscience, and guided by common sense.
[03:04:36.340 --> 03:04:37.340]  And powered by peer BS.
[03:04:37.340 --> 03:04:42.340]  The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those in the country.
[03:04:42.340 --> 03:04:45.340]  I'm going to analyze this all in a special report tonight.
[03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:46.340]  The first hand of the courts tonight.
[03:04:46.340 --> 03:04:47.340]  The humanitarian organization's right.
[03:04:47.340 --> 03:04:48.340]  What are you going to bring on the ground?
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:53.340]  I'm going to analyze the whole stinking speech tonight in Full Wars Nightly News.
[03:04:53.340 --> 03:05:18.340]  After Paul Watson does the main news portion of the transmission, I will analyze the entire steaming pile.
