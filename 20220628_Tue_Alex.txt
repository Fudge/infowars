[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:21.000 --> 00:50.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  I guess the pandemic's over.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  What's wrong, sir? You like killing babies? You love killing babies?
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  Yeah, I fucking love killing babies.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  You love killing babies, huh?
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  Love that, don't you? You love that.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Sir, stay calm. Stay calm, sir.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Drew would beat his ass so fast.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Stay calm, sir.
[01:10.000 --> 01:21.000]  Uh-oh, Savannah's going now. You don't much work.
[01:21.000 --> 01:31.000]  Savannah Hernandez is in his face now.
[01:31.000 --> 01:47.000]  Go continue to kill babies in your death bowl.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  Oh, they're getting swarmed by demonic freaks.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  Nobody wants to have sex with these women, I can tell you.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  No need for abortions with them.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  These women are the opposite of Niagara.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  Look at the harpies.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  Where do they find these people?
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  This is the pro-abortion movement, encapsulated right here.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  They say they want to fight for women's voices.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  They want to fight for women's rights.
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  It's all scrambled. It's all scrambled.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  Retreat from the death cult zombies for a moment.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  We're here to ask women why this is important to them,
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  because we want women to be heard, not men.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  I think everybody deserves the right to choose.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  It's too important to not be here.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  So your sign says, guns kill, abortions save lives.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  Can you explain that to me?
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  Absolutely.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Save abortions, save lives.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Honesty, making abortions non-accessible for women
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  and people of different ages doesn't stop abortions.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  So women, what's the person that has a uterus?
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  People that have uterus.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  So a woman?
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.000]  Anyone who has uterus.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  Can men get pregnant as well?
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  Anybody with a uterus can get pregnant.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  So men can't get pregnant.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  Some men, if they have uterus, can get pregnant.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  How can a man have uterus?
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.000]  How can a man have uterus?
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.000]  I'm going to give a call with a litmus test to sing,
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  men can have babies.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  All right, y'all.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  So we are over here.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  We're advocating for men who have uteruses,
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  for men to get abortions, because this is 2022,
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  and we have reached peace science.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  Guns kill, but abortions save lives,
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  even though 70 million babies have been killed in the womb.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Can somebody explain this to me,
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  because I don't really understand it.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  We're going to move on.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Thank you so much for speaking with us today.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  We actually do really appreciate it.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  We're going to move on.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  But I want to talk to those choice women,
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  and maybe find common ground
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  on why you think the way that you do.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  I think that abortion is murder.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  And what do you view abortion as?
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  A woman's choice.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  All right.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  So what's the big message today?
[03:52.000 --> 03:53.000]  Why are you guys out here?
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  Have you had any abortions at all?
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  I have not.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  I know many people.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  OK, so how does that apply to you
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  if you've never had an abortion?
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  Why does that matter to you?
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  Do you plan on ever having an abortion ever?
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  I should be able to have an abortion.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  OK, but you've never had an abortion.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  OK, so what is your...
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  How does it make sense?
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  Are you the type of individual that was for the vaccine,
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  that was for mandates across the United States of America?
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  Yes or no?
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  Yes.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  You were.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  You don't not see the correlation there,
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  how it's my body, my choice when it comes to murdering babies,
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  but not when it comes to forced mandated vaccines?
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  I may.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  Nobody would really know what they would do
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  unless they're in that situation.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  I used to be polite when I was younger growing up.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  I thought that that was sad.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  I thought I considered it a commitment.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  And then I grew up.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  And I...
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  So which biological fact or scientific fact led you to believe
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  that it's not a human?
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  It's not.
[04:57.000 --> 05:20.000]  So if fetus is not a human...
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.

[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  As worldwide civilization is collapsed by design.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live,
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  June 28th, Tuesday broadcast.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  We got some big guests coming up today.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  At the bottom of the hour, Drew Hernandez,
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  working with, of course, Savannah Hernandez,
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  got the shocking footage, live footage,
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  of the pro-abortionist out front of the Supreme Court this weekend.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  Saying they love Satan, they love killing babies,
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  and bullying and attacking them.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  That's gone viral on Tucker Carlson.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  You name it, just tens of millions of views
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  spreading all across the internet as people see what monsters they are.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Drew Hernandez is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  He's also been on the Texas, New Mexico,
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  Arizona, and California borders quite a bit with Savannah lately.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  They work for separate news agencies and they're not married, by the way.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  They both have the last name, Hernandez.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  And he's going to be joining us to talk about both those huge big issues
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  at the bottom of the hour here in about 30 minutes from now,
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  or 25 minutes from now.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  Jim Brewer, one of my favorite comedians, politically incorrect,
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  demonized and attacked by the left,
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  he's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour today
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  to just talk about how crazy this world is
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  and tell some of his amazing, politically incorrect jokes.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  That is in the third hour today.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  And then Wayne Allen Root will be hosting and doing a fabulous job,
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  as usual, in the fourth hour.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  Head of the great Owen Schreuer,
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  he'll be coming in to host the war room at 3 p.m. Central
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  on the verboten, forbidden, attacked, demonized, censored, lied about,
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  embattled, in full-wars TV slash radio network
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  Okay.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  Next hour, I'm going to cover all the news and all the war
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  and the economy and the drag queen pedophile time
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  and the pedophile parades and all the latest developments there
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  and so much more.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  The latest to cover up in Uvalde,
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  it's going to be a jam-packed second hour.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  So I'm not going to even tell you what's coming up in the second hour,
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  other than it's official now, we told you it was coming.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  They're not just saying new pandemics are coming,
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  they say they're here, monkeypox, blue states are already preparing
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  for new lockdowns, we've got all of that information to go over.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  But the first big thing I want to hit is this,
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  because it's not just a tragedy, not just preventable,
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  but it's a perfect example of how the corporate media is able to cover stuff up
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  and here's some examples.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  And I haven't asked the crew to do this yet,
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  but I want to go ahead and do this.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  See if there's a master list in the San Antonio newspaper
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  or the Uvalde newspaper or a Brownsville newspaper
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  or the Houston paper, I'm not sure.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  I'm sure somebody's had to have created a list,
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  because as a newsman, I'm here six, seven days a week reading the news
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.000]  and I can tell you this, every week, every week,
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  they find a tractor trailer in Texas alone,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  also found in Arizona and California, New Mexico,
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 dead people in it
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  and it almost never even makes national news when it's 10, 15, 20,
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  because the police usually get there in the 100-degree heat
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  when they've only been locked up for a few hours,
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  so only half of them die.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  This time, almost all of them are dead.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  When they got in the truck, 43 were dead,
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  hours later, 50 are dead,
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  and the numbers are it's about to go up,
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  there could have been as many as they haven't released the shit
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  as 100 people packed in there.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  Now, what does the news not tell you about this?
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  The state police report it, it's in local papers,
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  but never hits national news.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  Why in the hell are they locked up in the tractor trailer?
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  Was it Don Johnson in Machete,
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  who goes around the Texas border wearing his cowboy hat,
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  talking like a redneck, shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach?
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  That never happened, it's not going on,
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  but there were a string of racial attack crimes
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  against white people after that movie came out
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  because folks actually believed white people were shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  You know who's killing Hispanics at the border?
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  The Mexican drug cartels and coyote smugglers.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  Again, why is no one asking why do they keep finding
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  10, 20, 40, 50 dead people on a weekly basis
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  in the middle of nowhere, miles over the border?
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  Because the cartels make them pay part of the money up front
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  and then when they get across the border,
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  they're supposed to be paid more money.
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  And a lot of times they hold the people hostage,
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  they take their cell phones, they get their cell phone codes,
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  that's the county's dude,
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  and then they call their families and they say,
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  your brother or your sister or your son or your daughter
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  is locked up in this tractor trailer and it's 100 degrees
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  and if you don't pay me $10,000, I'm gonna kill them.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  And then the cartels get in, aim machine guns at the people,
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  bring the people off of paid,
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  and then they lock it up and kill the people.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  They drive them out in the middle of nowhere
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  and they pull over and they get out and they leave
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  and they murder them, murder them,
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  murder them in a horrible death of burning up to death
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  at 130 degree temperature inside those tractor trailers.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  With people crying and screaming and beating
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  and sometimes they're as young as 10 years old.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  Hell, the county's killed children younger than that.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  Now, are they gonna call for banning 18-wheelers
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  or tractor trailers because of this?
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  Because they're using a tractor trailer as a cage.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  How about that water cash things?
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  They are, I forgot to get a water.
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  They are using that tractor trailer as a cage
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  to murder them as a weapon.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  So we've all heard the cases of where the mother
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  straps in her two-year-old and one-year-old
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  at the child safety seats.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  It's happened quite a few times.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  They're always on Prozac type drugs
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  and they drive them into a river or lake
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  and kill their children.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  And even though the mothers are mentally ill,
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  they give them life in prison and I think they should.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  Why is it national news when somebody kills two people
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  in their car by drowning them?
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  But why when you burn somebody up to death?
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Do they not point out how they're murdering them?
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  They just go, we don't know why they were stuck in a trailer.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  We don't know why we keep finding them dead in trailers.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  We don't know why.
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  The Calities also, when they take you across,
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  if you don't pay them, they'll just shoot you.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  You'll find thousands of dead bodies in each town
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  every year along the Texas-Mexico border.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.000]  Tens of thousands dead every year
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  and it doesn't even become a blip on the radar screen.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  Severed heads, people tortured to death, people hung.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  Dead bodies everywhere.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  Dead bodies everywhere.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  And the media always plays dumb.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  Well, maybe it was just too hot for them in there
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  and that's why they all died.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  And certainly that's happened in a few of the cases.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  But in the lion's share, they are locked in there.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  Why does the person pull over, leave them locked up and leave?
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  Because they want to send a message to the people they're smuggling.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  If you don't pay up when we call, you are dead.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  And that, my friends, as Paul Harvey would say,
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  is the rest of the story.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  So now it's 50 dead at least on a side road outside San Antonio
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  dumped off because they didn't pay the other half the money
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  or it didn't get delivered.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  And that is Biden's collapse border.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  That is the ugliness of an open border.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  And I have reports here today where the Biden Justice Department
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  is letting people out of jail with no present time
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  who are delivering pounds of fentanyl
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  enough to kill tens of thousands of people per pound.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  So you think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  You think about when 19 children get killed
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  because the police stand out for 77 minutes
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  and wouldn't let the parents go in any of Aldi.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  It's the biggest story on earth and every gun owner is to blame
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  according to the media, the enemy of the people.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  But when it's tractor trailers being found every week,
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  and when I say every week, we're trying to find out the numbers.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  I see it in the news. I live in Texas.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  I read it every week.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  I see another tractor trailer full of dead people
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  or half of them are alive, half of them are dead,
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  some died at the hospital.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  And so that's the brutalness of the Mexican cartels.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  That's the brutalness of the third world.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  And then our own government is trying to turn us into that
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  and shaking their finger at us when we want guns to protect ourselves
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  that we're the bad people.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  It's preposterous.
[15:57.000 --> 16:26.000]  Back in FullWars.com.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  God's watching. The children are counting on us.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  and your prayer and your financial support
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  because without you,
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  InfoWars would not be here.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWars
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  The globalists are making their move.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  Their great reset is here.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  They're coming for your children.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  They're coming for your free speech.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  They're coming for your privacy.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  and have your representative in government
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  The new film, the seminal film,
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  the most important documentary ever made in my view,
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  2000 Mules, is now available on DVD with expanded extras
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  at infowarsstore.com.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  at infowarsstore.com.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  They're planning to run the same scams again.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  This film can stop them if you take action.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  You see it every year.
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over,
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  understanding this and knowing this.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  that allows you to keep more of your money.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  in the last few years.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,

[18:52.000 --> 19:17.000]  833-904-285.

[19:57.000 --> 20:23.000]  while getting great products.
[20:23.000 --> 20:34.000]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  Journalist Drew Hernandez ran into people like this
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  over the weekend. Here's how it went.
[20:39.000 --> 21:08.000]  It's not a lie until it takes its first breath.
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.000]  I guess the pandemic's over.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  What's wrong, sir? You like killing babies?
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  You love killing babies?
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  Yes, I love killing babies.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  Drew Hernandez shot the footage you just saw.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  He's an investigative reporter and host of Turning Point USA's Frontlines.
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  We're happy to have him join us now. Drew, thanks so much for coming on.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  So the rhetoric even a year ago was my body, my choice.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  It was a bodily autonomy question. It was a libertarian question.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  The guy in the Pete Buttigieg t-shirt just told you he loves killing babies,
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  and the rest of them were saying the same thing.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  This seems like a big change.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  Well, Tucker, it's the absolute truth.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  This is a death cult, whether it's corporate America,
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  whether it's politicians or these so-called activists and protesters,
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  and the rioters.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  At the end of the day, this is a death cult.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  These people want to murder babies, a human being.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  And it's interesting because they refuse to call a baby inside of the womb a baby, right?
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  But you see in that clip, he openly says it's a baby.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  They always say it's a fetus.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  But because he's telling the truth, that's a demon speaking.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  These are evil people.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  They want to be able to murder babies wherever you see it across the United States.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  And I've been on the ground covering all of this for Turning Point USA
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  about a week and a half ago in DC.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  And immediately after the decision was announced, Tucker,
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  we saw the NPCs on the left lose their minds and start crying,
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  and the pro-life individuals outside of the Supreme Court erupt in cheers.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  But within minutes, Tucker,
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  Congresswoman AOC spawned out of nowhere in front of the Supreme Court
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  and started calling the Supreme Court illegitimate
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  and calling for people to take to the streets and saying that voting is not enough.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  And within hours, we saw all of this violent rioting across the United States,
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  and particularly in Los Angeles as well,
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  where a rioter was literally found with a makeshift flamethrower.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  That's fiery, but mostly peaceful for you.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  I'll tell you that right now.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  But this is all about murdering babies at the end of the day.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  Killing makes them feel like God. It's why they love war.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  Joe Hernandez, I appreciate you're taking that footage for us. Thank you.
[23:12.000 --> 23:17.000]  And the footage you're talking about was them live with us Saturday
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  with a special emergency report we did for two hours
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  that we cannot air live during the weekday shows.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  It's our own radio and TV stations.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  You can't have all the cussing and profanity there.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  We have to do it live Internet only when we go on the ground like that
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  to show you because you can't be aired.
[23:34.000 --> 23:40.000]  So profane, the full two hours is at band.video.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  It's the Saturday emergency broadcast reporters attacked
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  by blood thirsty pro-abortion activists in D.C.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  Find that video at band.video.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  Joe Hernandez joins us next segment to talk about
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  the fact that the left doesn't care about life.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  It sees humans as a commodity, whether it's abortion
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  or whether it's human trafficking in the open border
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  or whether it's the fentanyl pouring across.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  This is a culture of death with the poisoned vaccines, all of it.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  He'll be joining us. And I asked the crew just to look up San Antonio
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  in the last year and tractor trailers pull a dead people
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  and we got a whole stack of news right there, not to mention
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  San Antonio, but towns all over South Texas and on the border.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  It is a weekly occurrence.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  This 50 dead is the highest number yet.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.000]  That's why it's getting attention.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  I guess next time I'll have to be 100 dead before this becomes news.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  But I remember a decade ago one of the Austin City Council members,
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  a big Latino activist, his brother got indicted and busted
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  for having a dungeon in the basement of his house in Austin
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  where they would hold illegal aliens, migrants,
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  and torture them because they hadn't paid enough money.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  That's the type of people running the La Reconquista.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  They're not trying to reconquer Texas or Mexico.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.000]  They are organized crime, working with people like Pelosi
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  who said MS-13 are God's children
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  and wouldn't even decry them four years ago.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  Wouldn't even say they were bad people.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  Four years ago they said there are no caravans,
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  there is no replacement migration, it's a fake story.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  Now they say get used to it.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's 10 times the numbers coming in under Trump.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Double what was coming in under Obama.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  It's unbelievable.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  They have officially broken the border.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  They are officially turning us into a failed state.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  And you've got not dozens, but more than 50 food processing plants
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  that have blown up or burned up in the last few months.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  Same thing is happening in Europe.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  You have all of these different crops failing.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  You have farms that can't even harvest their crops
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  because they don't have the fuel, the money for it.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  We have police that can't respond to crimes
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  because their fuel budget is over.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  They don't have the money for their fuel.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  This is what a failed state looks like.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  This is by design.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  I'll be talking more about this,
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  but I want to put out a win-win here.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  We need funds to run this operation.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  Everybody should have storable food.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  Even if you've never done it before,
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  it lasts more than a decade.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  It's high quality.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  It's ready to ship.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  It's the lowest price you're going to find.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  PrepareToDay.com.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  With the war, with the collapsed borders,
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  with the inflation, with all the uncertainty,
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  the only thing you can do that's certain
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  is get high-quality, storable food
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  while the price is lower than it will be in the future.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  And you can say hands down with the inflation
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  that's already here and coming.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  As I told you 30-plus months ago,
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  I said you will see food prices absolutely explode
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  across the world.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  So again, PrepareToDay.com.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, PrepareToDay.com
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  is a one-stop shop,
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  instead of just having it on InfoWars,
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  a one-stop shop where you can go
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  and you can get all the best storable food ready to ship.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  You can get all the greatest preparedness items
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  to survive while I was ready to ship.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Water filtration, air filtration,
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  highest rated at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  on the air filtration and water filtration.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  There are hundreds of amazing items there.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  And then 20, 30% of that,
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  because there's not much profit in it,
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  because we're selling at very competitive prices,
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  goes to fund this operation and keep us on air.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  You need to get prepared. You need to get ready.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  And InfoWars is the tip of the spear in the information war.
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  So keep us on air while you get prepared.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  One month, three months, boogie packs, one year,
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  specialty food packs, everything,
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  PrepareToDay.com, water filtration,
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  water treatment and storage, first aid,
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  fire starting and protection, emergency power,
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  and so much more at PrepareToday.com.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  And everything on the site
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  is ready to ship to you in stock.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  So many of the other places, folks,
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  get your orders, sit on them and then try to fulfill them.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  We don't sell storable food.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  We don't sell air filters or water filters or anything
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  unless it's in stock.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  That's why for the last three and a half months,
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  did you hear me promote storable food?
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  Did you hear me promote air filters, water filters?
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  The answer is no, because it was all sold out.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  But our big supplier, my patriot,
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  bought massive amounts of the biggest distributor in the U.S.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  It's their site, their template, they're running it.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  You're ordering directly.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  It comes right to you.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  It's just, we get the credit at PrepareToday.com.

[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  and so much more at InfowarStore.
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.000]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  And it goes like this.
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  If your boat is going towards the rocks,
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  But also, try to row away.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish.
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  And it's the same thing with our immune system.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  God helps those who help themselves.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  at InfowarStore.com.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Like the ultimate immune support pack,

[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  We have the Traffecta Special,
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  three of the best-selling items for 50% off.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  And X2 sold out so important for your immune system
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  back in stock for 40% off for a limited time
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  because you have limited supplies.
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  In fact, one of these items, we only have 2,000 bottles of.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  So the ultimate sale will probably be over just a few days.
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  Take advantage of this and boost your immune system now
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  to protect yourself and your family at InfowarStore.com.
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  in government FEMA camps.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family,
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming,
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  but you can help them by having an abundance
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  of storable foods and water filtration.

[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  and of course Part 1, Part 2,
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  and now the new Part 3 of COVIDland.
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  Get them separate, get them together,
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  massively discounted at InfowarStore.com.
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.000]  But everyone needs to have 2,000 mules in their library
[31:53.000 --> 31:56.000]  so the globalists can't censor it.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  InfowarStore.com to get 2,000 mules today.
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  out of the thousands of great items
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  at InfowarStore.com all the storable food.

[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  with what's coming and what is already unfolding
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  with global food shortages.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  I told you over two years ago
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  the globalists are going to have massive inflation
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  and food shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  They have designed this.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  The way to beat them is to buy food now
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  before your dollar is even more devalued.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  We are ready to ship to you right now
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  at PrepareToday.com and not just storeable food,
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  hundreds of the highest quality,
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  survival and preparedness items in stock
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  at low prices ready to ship to you right now
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  at PrepareToday.com.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  You can also use the URL
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  PrepareWithAlex.com and it takes you there.
[32:58.000 --> 33:17.000]  Take action.
[33:28.000 --> 33:35.000]  We do know this.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  There's compelling evidence
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  that the law enforcement response
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  to the attack at Rob Elementary
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  was an abject failure
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  and antithetical to everything we've learned
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  over the last two decades
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  since the Columbine Massacre.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  Three minutes after the subject entered the West Building,
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  there was sufficient number of armed officers
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  wearing body armor
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  to isolate, distract and neutralize the subject.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  The only thing stopping the hallway
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  of dedicated officers from any room 111
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  and 112 was the on-scene commander
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  who decided to place the lives of officers
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  before the lives of children.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  The officers had weapons.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  The children had none.
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  The officers had body armor.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  The children had none.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  The officers had training.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  The subject had none.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  One error, 14 minutes and 8 seconds.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  That's how long the children waited
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  and the teachers waited
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  in rooms 111 to be rescued.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  And while they waited,
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  the on-seat commander waited for radio and rifles.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  Then he waited for shields.
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  Then he waited for SWAT.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  Lastly, he waited for a key that was never needed.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  The post-call of mind doctrine
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  is clear and compelling and unambiguous.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Stop the killing.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  Stop the dying.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  That's the head of the Texas State Police,
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  Steve McGraw, testifying
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  to the legislature on what's happening.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  And I'm going to get into this war next hour,
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  but I want to bring it up to Drew Hernandez
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  because he has reported extensively in the war zone
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  that is the Texas and Arizona borders particularly
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  in depth for us for years.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  We've been down there with him many times.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  And this is a subject I want to raise here.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  I don't want to just harp, like I normally do,
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  on how demonic the pro-abortion people are,
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  how they hate babies, or how they say they love Satan.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  That's important, but not the key.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  I don't want to just talk about,
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  oh, look, another 50 dead illegals locked up to die
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  in a tractor trailer another week goes by
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  and another tragedy.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's all interconnected.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  We hear a lot about white privilege in this country,
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  which is a made-up Marxist term
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  to turn us all against each other,
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  but I'll tell you where there is privilege.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  If you can make it out of your mother's womb,
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  you get more rights, and you have the privilege
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  of not being killed, and it being against the law.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  And if you had a tractor trailer of citizens,
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  whether they were Hispanic, black, white, Asian,
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  and if, say, in Wisconsin, they found a tractor trailer
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  full of 50 black people dead,
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  or 50 Hispanic citizens dead,
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  or 50 white people dead, or a mix of people,
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  it would be the end of the world,
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  and we know everything about it, and who locked them in there,
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  who helped their families ransom for money.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  But because it's illegal aliens, a permanent underclass,
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  migrants being brought in by the Caudes
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  and the money being lauded by the Democratic Party
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  with the broken border by design,
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  they're not human, ladies and gentlemen,
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  according to the very people that are using them
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  and letting them use children as a free ticket
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  into this country, in many cases,
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  that aren't any relation to them.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  So I'm going to play this clip and go to Drew Hernandez
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  for the balance of the hour,
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  but this clip's from making the rounds this week.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Joe Rogan sent it to me this weekend.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  I meant to get to it. Now it's viral.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Now it's everywhere. It's Mike Judge's new
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  Bebison Butthead movie. I haven't seen it yet,
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  but I've seen this clip of white privilege,
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  and Bebison Butthead are obviously total morons,
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  and they got accused of about 75,
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  these fictional characters that my friend Mike Judge created
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  decades ago, 30-something years ago,
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  and they're told by the professor,
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  you have privilege because you're white.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  You can commit crimes. You can do whatever you want.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Of course, that's not true.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  National statistics show that police are twice as likely,
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  per capita, per 1,000 whites, 1,000 blacks,
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  twice as likely to shoot whites.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  Why is that? Are they out to kill whites? No.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  They know that if they make a mistake,
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  particularly in a black home, they'll be crucified and fired
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  and probably put in prison, or they go to a domestic dispute
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  or a shootout, so they slow-roll,
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  and then you have the highest crime rates in the black area
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  because they can't carry out law enforcement.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's the main cause.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  So again, yeah, there's white privilege.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  You're twice as likely to be shot by police,
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  but not because they're hunting white people
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  because they actually respond, which is a form of discrimination,
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  but only because they get discriminated against
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  and are scared to go into the black areas.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  So that's the reality here of the white privilege,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  is it's a mixed bag, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  and it's 10-to-1 black-on-white crime
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  because there are some racist black people
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  that think white people deserve to be robbed and killed
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  just because they're white, and the left promotes that.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  So that's the reality of the white privilege.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  There's privilege if you're a citizen
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  and you live in this country and you get found dead,
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  the media will cover it, but they don't want it covered
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  because they are busting the border
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  and smuggling millions of people in,
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  and so if you're one of these new, permanent underclass
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  being brought in by the Democratic Party,
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  you aren't treated as human,
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  and that's the real Democratic Party privilege.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  They have armed guards, they have police,
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  they don't want citizens to have them,
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  or you are. There's a Leap Privilege,
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Bilderberg Group, Davos Group,
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  World Economic Forum Group, Privilege,
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  and then there's all the rest of us
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  being turned against each other and played off.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  But here is the babes and butthead piece.
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  This is a classic example of white privilege,
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  and you both have it.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  Uh, what's that?
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  Anyone want to fill them in?
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Um, yeah, I'll do it.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  Okay, so white privilege is when white people,
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  particularly men, automatically assume
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  they can take whatever they want,
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  and they never have to worry about getting stopped
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  by the police, and they have the inside track
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  for any job they...
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  I've got this one, Asia.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  They have the inside track for any job they want.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  Exactly, Gage.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  Thank you for that.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  That's white privilege.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  Whoa, and we have that?
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  You sure do.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  I see.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Whoa, I never realize this stuff.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  Yeah, you've really opened up my eyes.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  Well, I'm glad we've been able to enlighten you.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  The real question is,
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  do you think you'll be acting differently from now on?
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  Uh, I guarantee it.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too, yeah.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  Hepicide, please.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  We have white privilege.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  Hey.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Don't worry, it's okay.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  We automatically assume we can take what we want,
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  and we don't have to worry about the police.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  It's okay, you didn't know.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  Me neither.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  Let's stop now.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  This is what we were taught, sir.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  We're subverting existing paradigms.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  This rules.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad we went to college.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  Now I have the skills for today's workplace.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Well, let's see.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  What should we take next?
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  Let's take that car.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  Um, but that's a police car.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  Beavis, you dumbass. Didn't you hear?
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  We don't have to worry about getting stopped by the police.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Oh, yeah.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  Okay, Beavis, let's tear ass.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  That was cool.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  Don't move!
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  Uh, sir, maybe you didn't know, but we have white privilege.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  Get your hands where I can see them!
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  I think the problem is you're just uneducated.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Yeah, we're going to get jobs on Wall Street.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  Jordan, and as we will this a little bit in the next hour,
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  I appreciate him joining us.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  Jordan, we're going to be getting into so many of the big topics out there,
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  but what's your overall view on the point I just made about,
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  there's the elitist privilege, and there's the rest of us.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  Nancy Pelosi's husband, they won't release the squad car footage,
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  the body cams, you got to run over somebody reportedly,
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  but because he is married to Nancy Pelosi, that story's being killed.
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.000]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me and shout out to the Info Warrior Gator chat right now.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  I'm in the chat and they just, they love you, Alex,
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  and they love what you're doing and just want to encourage you.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  There's millions of people out there that love you guys,
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  but to go to your point, the Democrats have always been racist.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  You and I both know this.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  They're the pro-save slavery party.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  They're the anti-civil rights movement party.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  They're the ones that have always wanted to oppose minorities.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  So right now it makes sense to me that they're the pro-CRT critical race theory party,
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  where they're literally engineering racism in our universities in Hollywood,
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  across the board in corporate America, where they, the ones are pushing the racism.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  And it's always these racist white liberals that turn around and tell someone like me,
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  I'll use their terminology, a person of color that I'm oppressed and I'm poor
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  and I can't do anything on my own and I should just listen to them.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  And even when I'm on the street with people like Savannah Hernandez,
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Savannah Hernandez trying to report, it's always these white liberals that are telling us
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  to shut up and telling people not to talk to us.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  So they're the real racist, Alex. They always have been and they always will be.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  That's right. They're the self-appointed gods over to Saul and we're sick of it.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Hernandez, stay there. We'll be right back.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.000]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed.
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  But also try to row away. You can't just sit there like a jellyfish.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  And it's the same thing with our immune system.

[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the new world order
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  than the Alex Jones was right shirt, exclusively available at infowarstore.com.

[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,

[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  infowarstore.com, 2000 mules.
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:07.000 --> 47:28.000]  The last three years, Drew Hernandez has exploded on the scene as one of the most
[47:28.000 --> 47:34.000]  trepid fearless reporters covering Antifa, Riots, the border, you name it.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  He's a good friend of mine now. We've gone on the road quite a bit together.
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.000]  He also teams up with Savannah Hernandez and they're just really kicking ass.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  He works with Turning Point USA.
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  She works with Truth Social and they also work with Info Wars and the live feed they shot,
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  they were with us Saturday for two hours, has gone viral and tens of millions of people
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  have seen different clips from those two hours.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  That is success.
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  The reason I report that to viewers and listeners is you need to know Info Wars and Drew Hernandez
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  and all the people we work with are fighting hard and putting ourselves in the line to
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  expose this evil and we appreciate your support and your word of mouth, but it's you sharing
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  the articles from his Twitter and sharing the videos from Bandot Video and his videos
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  that is getting it through the censors and really showing the ugly face of the New World Order.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  So I want to get into Roe v. Wade. I want to get into the summer rage.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  I want to get into the border that you just returned from a few weeks ago that you were
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  telling me on air and off air is just worse than ever than we were even down there a few months ago.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  So I want to hit all that, but you're a really articulate guy.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  I respect your world view.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  What would you call this period we're in right now?
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  And with 133 days out from the election, with everybody turning against the left and Democrats,
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  what do you expect them to pull to try to salvage themselves?
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  Big picture, what is Drew Hernandez telling his wife and family?
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  You know, when you're sitting around the table, what do you really think is about to happen?
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  Because I have a sense of optimism.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  People are waking up and humanity is finding its soul again.
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.000]  But also I feel a lot of rural anxiety knowing the enemy's got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  Well, number one, Alex, from a biblical perspective, I'll give you that first.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  I think right now we're living in a generation and an era and a time frame right now in the timeline
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  in God's universe and God's creation where this is total depravity.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  We've seen this in cycles.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  We've seen it in Rome and in Corinth.
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  If you study biblical history as well, we have seen superpowers go through
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  total depravity and a societal reprobate mind.
[49:31.000 --> 49:38.000]  Now, what that means from a biblical perspective is God gives over societies to a reprobate and a depraved mind.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  What that means is someone loses their moral compass.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  They lose all sanity.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  They lose the entire ability to discern right from wrong.
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  And that is a consequence that is a judgment according to Romans chapter one based off of a society
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  suppressing the truth of God himself.
[49:54.000 --> 50:01.000]  So as a default, you get total depravity, total lawlessness, zero morality, all void of morality,
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  and some of the distinct, I guess we can call marks of that society when you read Romans chapter one is
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  a total disrespect of society against one another, liars, cheaters, backstabbers, murderers.
[50:13.000 --> 50:20.000]  The list goes on, but then it turns into open, normalized homosexuality and then total confusion.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  If anyone's questioning what I'm saying, just go read Romans chapter one for yourself.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  And it's literally like you're watching info wars in real time.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  Why? Because we're covering this as it's happening in real time.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  And the Bible told us that all this was going to take place.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  So the good news is the gospel is always alive and it's always well,
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.000]  and it's always going to have the power to save anybody on the verge of dying and going straight to hell.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  Now, does that mean that that's going to happen?
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  Are we going to see a mass revival?
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  Are we going to see just a mass collapse of the United States of America?
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  We saw that in Rome, they disperse, they're not lasting forever,
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  and we can't sit here and think America can last forever as well because God is always on the throne.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  And at the end of the day, he's going to do what he wants to do.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  He's going to judge America when he is going to judge America.
[51:07.000 --> 51:14.000]  And right now, I will say this, Roe v. Wade and the collapse of it and the pushback and the justices having the courage
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  to strike it down, we know it's going to go back down to the states.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  But Alex, you and I both know that that is a glimpse of hope, that is a ray of light.
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  A lot of people are seeing that there is hope in this country.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  I think that is the momentum.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  I was talking about this with Owen on the war room the day that it broke,
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  and I told him this is the momentum that we need moving forward.
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  I think the justices that have the courage to do this set the example.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  They set the tone.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  They set the energy.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  They set the momentum for other Americans and pro-life, just patriotic, pro-human individuals
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  in the United States of America and worldwide to continue with this momentum pushing forward,
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  whether you're in the world of education, entertainment, news, media, wherever it is.
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  Or if you're just a loving, responsible mother or father at home and you're watching everything that's unfolding,
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  this is the momentum we needed.
[52:05.000 --> 52:06.000]  We cannot let this stop.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  We cannot let these people continue to threaten us.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  We cannot let these people continue to intimidate us because if we do, that is how we lose.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  And I'm not calling for violence.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  We can legislatively continue to push back.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  And I think the Supreme Court set that example very clearly.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  And we cannot let this momentum fade away, Alex.
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  You and I both know that.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Beautifully eloquent.
[52:25.000 --> 52:31.000]  And we should talk about your story because it's really for people to be able to think about what their destiny could be.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  You're a super articulate guy.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  I mean, the first time I ever saw you covering something, I said, man, this guy is a natural.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  And now you're very prominent.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  You're reaching millions of people a day.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  What were you doing before?
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  Because I know you told me this before, I forget the whole story.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  God convicted your heart to get involved.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  Can you remind me?
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  I know that you told me the story.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  But what got you in the game?
[52:51.000 --> 53:00.000]  I know there's so many people out there that are just as smart as I am or smarter like you who are on the fence or on the sideline.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  Something makes you get in the game.
[53:02.000 --> 53:09.000]  And I know there's people out there of every race, color and creed watching that could do just as great of things as I've done or you've done or others have done.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  But they haven't taken that step.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.000]  And that's what I'm all about is getting people to take that step.
[53:14.000 --> 53:20.000]  And that's one of my things I'm most proud of is that so many proud people say, hey, you got me involved.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  You got me to take action.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  I think that's really info war's greatest contribution is getting people to take action.
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  But what was your awakening like?
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  Or were you already awake?
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  What happened?
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  Well, number one, Alex, I became a born again Christian on February 1, 2012.
[53:34.000 --> 53:40.000]  Christ radically changed my heart, my mind, my spirit opened up my eyes to what the world is really doing.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  And how the world is really functioning on a spiritual level.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  There is evil.
[53:44.000 --> 53:51.000]  There is a real devil just as God is real, but God is more powerful, opening up my eyes to the spiritual aspects of things.
[53:51.000 --> 53:58.000]  And then being able to take a look at the world from a biblical worldview, everything begins to stabilize and makes sense.
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.000]  But I didn't start getting fully politically engaged until after the election of Donald Trump.
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  And the reason why is because all of the wiki leaks that came out, all the intel drops, even info wars was putting stuff out,
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  hearing that Hillary Clinton was essentially going to do what President Puppet Biden is doing right now.
[54:17.000 --> 54:25.000]  Open borders, collapsing the economy, just putting Americans in a place where they are controllable and nasty stabilization.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  All these things were coming out.
[54:27.000 --> 54:36.000]  And I saw all the lies that were taking place during the 2016 election where they would call Trump a racist and a liar, a hater of Mexicans and brown people.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  On CNN, I would watch that.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  And then at night, by day, I would watch that.
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.000]  And then by night, I would go watch Trump's rallies and listen to his message.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  Never heard a single thing about hating brown people or any racist rhetoric.
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  It was always pro-America, pro-life, pro-individual, pro-America, pro-patriotic.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  He was trying to unify.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  Pro-America unification.
[54:59.000 --> 55:08.000]  But seeing that we almost came on the verge of losing the country in 2016, kind of like where we are right now, like I said,
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  that's what really engaged me as a born-again Christian because, number one, I know that I have the power of the Holy Spirit.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  I have the power of the Word of God.
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  He lives in me.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  He literally works through me.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  He does all that he can through me.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  If I'm just submissive and obedient to him, I'm not perfect.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  I'll never claim to be that.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  Only Christ is.
[55:26.000 --> 55:33.000]  But I knew that if something could change and God could use me to do something that now was definitely the time.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  I mean, it's always the time.
[55:34.000 --> 55:42.000]  But for me, I just saw that our country is on the verge of something very evil and satanic.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  And I just wanted to get involved with whatever God wanted me to get involved with.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  I never had any plans of being a reporter.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Never had any plans of covering riots.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  Never had any plans.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  I was a youth pastor, a pastor in a local church in Southern California.
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  And that's what I was doing, focusing on them, teaching the Bible and kind of showing them the world around them from a biblical worldview.
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.000]  But then this just all unloaded and God had a different plan for me.
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  So I guess to answer your question, this is a very loaded answer.
[56:09.000 --> 56:25.000]  Knowing and understanding the urgency of darkness rising and attacking the current and the next generation is what really amplified me to move forward with the truth and obedience to God to opposed tyranny that I saw on the horizon.
[56:25.000 --> 56:32.000]  So I think in God's plan, I mean, he's never done with us just like he's not done with you, Alex and everyone else that's listening right now.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  I know he has a lot more in store.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  And I think this is just the beginning and we'll see where this goes.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  Man, I couldn't say any better and it is that sense of urgency.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  And just like Trump brought them out of the woodwork.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  Now this Roe v. Wade bigger than Trump is going to make them take the mask off and they've done that.
[56:49.000 --> 57:00.000]  I want to talk about what you witnessed at these anti-life rallies and what you witnessed at the border and what you think's coming up with the election.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  Drew Hernandez is our guest with us some of the next hour.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  And then we're going to open the phones up to balance the broadcast.
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  The comedian we had on at a family emergency season is going to come on next week.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  We totally understand.
[57:12.000 --> 57:20.000]  So we're going to have several hours of calls after Drew leaves us, at least an hour and a half of calls, and a bunch of news I haven't broken yet.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  Next hour, hour number two with Drew Hernandez, just a wonderful guy.
[57:24.000 --> 57:31.000]  And I'm going to tell the story next hour when we talk about this, but I get really upset looking at the people that serve Satan, how they're like mutants.
[57:31.000 --> 57:37.000]  They're very depressed about it, but then God says to me, look at all the great people you get to know who are on the other side, who are awake.
[57:37.000 --> 57:43.000]  And when you know people that know God and know justice, they're just alive and beautiful and smart and articulate.
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  You see the people that aren't, they're dead inside.
[57:45.000 --> 58:12.000]  You can see the choice that needs to be made.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  60% off.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  Then the Trapecta immune support, 50% off on immune support X2 and D3 gummies.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  And then 40% off on X2.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  Now just the X2 alone is the missing link with most people.
[58:39.000 --> 58:44.000]  Highest quality deep breath crystal iodine beyond critical for immune system in your whole body.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  It's 40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[59:15.000 --> 59:23.000]  Decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[59:23.000 --> 59:34.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[59:34.000 --> 59:43.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[59:43.000 --> 59:49.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[59:52.000 --> 59:57.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  All right, I want Dr. Hernandez to elaborate on the big picture of the spiritual warfare we're in.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Then we're going to look at something we were talking about during the break.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  He said, hey, I said, I got a lot of questions, but what do you want to get into next?
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  He said, well, I want to get into how the real insurrection is happening while they have this J6 hearing.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  But that's in about six minutes.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  This little short segment drew more about the spiritual warfare.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Absolutely. And I think America, I know the listeners understand this.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  I mean, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against palatial, spiritual hosts of wickedness that are in the heavenly places.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  If you say, people understand this and we know this.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  And I'm sure a lot of viewers have heard that verse quoted many times and have kind of felt like, yes, you know,
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  they have this image in their mind of witchcraft and seeing all these demonic things or like the exorcist movie.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  And those things are real.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  They're definitely real.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  But when you see it in the political sphere and people like Owen Troyer, Savannah Hernandez,
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  or anyone that's been to one of these pro-death, I mean, I said this on Tucker Carlson last night.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  This is literally a death cult.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  These people worship mulloch.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  They worship death.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  They worship murder.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  They not only worship it, they praise it and they celebrate it openly in the streets out in broad daylight.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  They don't do it just that night when they're out riding and committing mass violence to be able to murder babies.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  They do this out in broad daylight.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  I mean, here's some footage of when I was out in front of the Capitol.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  This is literally the moment Roe v. Wade was announced to be overturned.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  And these people were crying, losing their minds, getting hysterical, acting like it was literally the end of the world.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  These people have been manipulated and indoctrinated because they have no idea why they believe what they believe.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  But this is the spiritual aspect of things.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  I mean, really think about it.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  How can one be so blind to something so obvious and open according to science, facts, and logic?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  These people will never call a baby inside of the womb a baby.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  They'll always call it a fetus.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  And the reason why is because they deny logic, reason, and facts, and science.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Now, the reason is, as I said at the beginning of the segment with Alex, is this is total depravity on full display.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  People have lost their minds.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  They have literally lost their minds over something that they cannot see.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  This is the best teaching moment for anyone that's ever seen the Bible or have questioned Romans chapter one or Jesus's words where it says,
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  lawlessness will abound or God will give people over to a reprobate mind or a debased mind.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  You could take a look at the Greek and you unpack it and see what the definitions are.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  And they're very clear people losing all morality, losing the ability to discern, losing all form of having the ability to see what's right or wrong.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  But when you see it in real time, people begin to wake up and you take a look at this footage and you could only see that God is truly a human being.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  That is true.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And God is literally telling the truth about what we are seeing in humanity right now.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  I mean, look around you.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Look at the Massey stabilization.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  That's just one aspect.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  I mean, think about the New World Order.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Alex has been covering this for decades, but God has told us that a New World Order would come a one world banking system, a one world economy,
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  a one world military system, a one world government.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  We have seen all of this in the book of Revelation to be foretold for the past 2000 years in the New Testament.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Okay, so we've been seeing this all unfold.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  And I think, and this is just my own personal opinion, according to the Bible, I think post 2020 with the pandemic, I think the needle has moved forward.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  I think a lot of theologians and Bible teachers have always questioned and asked how in the world can a New World Order rise?
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  How in the world can a one world religion rise?
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  How in the world can a one system economy where a mark of the beast is on the forearm or the wrist or the forehead, where the entire world is in unison,
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  worshiping one man, a false prophet, and a part of a one world economy and a religion?
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  A lot of theologians have questioned how in the world that could happen because the technology never existed.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  But right now, post 2020, we have surely seen the microchips have always been in development.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  They've always been put out in the news.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Alex has been covering this for decades.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  But I think post 2020 with the so-called pandemic, the scandemic, we saw the entire globe in unison.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  The entire globe was in unison and ready to literally bend the knee to tyranny in the name of safety and security.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  So I think right now we're living in the end times like the Bible foretold.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  We are seeing probably on the horizon of seeing the antichrist soon and everything that the Bible foretold.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  And you will watch it all unfold here live on info wars and band.video.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Perfectly said.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Drew Hernandez, stay there.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Because the globalist aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  It's now out in the open.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos group.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  That's watching the children counting on us.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  And the hard charger Dr. Hernandez is with us talking about an eloquent man of courage.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Again, it's just getting to know all these great people in the fight against tyranny is the best part of it.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Drew, you were making the point we were talking a few breaks ago that you wanted to get into J6 and that show trial.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Currently with all the left actually involved in insurrection.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  And now we have the sergeant of arms that was supposed to testify today dies there last night.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  They're being very mysterious about how he died.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  This is getting weirder and weirder and weirder.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  They're claiming that Trump tried to do a coup on January 6th with myself and others.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  That's not true.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Heard nothing about that.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  Try to stop it.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  But meanwhile, they're trying to use J6 to outlaw their political opposition.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  So that's where you wanted to go next.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  I'm glad you wanted to go there.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  What is your view on that?
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Well, number one, this is a Soviet style show trial.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  I mean, they've been using Soviet tactics.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  You know this for decades.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  I mean, they infiltrate groups.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  They run the psyops.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  They manipulate the minds of people.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  And then they run their PR, their propaganda campaigns.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  And I think right now we're in midterms and you and I both know this Alex that the Democrats and the left are desperate.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Okay, I truly believe they are desperate.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  But they also know that they have power and the ability to manipulate the minds of millions of people because they own the media.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  They control the media.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  They control Hollywood.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  They control all these levers of society.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  So they're going to use them to the best of their ability to radicalize people with the most radical messages.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  What have we seen in 2022, Alex, in this midterm year?
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  They went from the J6 show trial.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  This has been developing all 2021 since it happened all last year.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  And now they've went to the anti-LGBT to they're going to come after you.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  They're going to come after all the gay people.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  They're going to take away your rights to be able to mutilate the genitals of children.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  They're going to take away your rights to be able to do whatever you want as an LGBTQ person.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  They then go to Uvalde.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  They try and exploit that.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  You see Beto show up to Uvalde when there's a shooting.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  All of a sudden all these mass shootings start taking place across the country.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  And then the media mobilizes to be able to amplify that message.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And then they run with the anti-2A and the pro-gun control narrative where their mass hysteria,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  where Beto shows up to Uvalde less than 24 hours to stick his finger and Greg Abbott's face as a political stunt to push that narrative.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  So it's one thing after another.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And what I'm saying is it's all an attempt to further manipulate the minds of their base because they're getting desperate.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Now what I want people to understand is this is definitely an intentional agenda.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  And the reason why they do that is because they know that there are still people out there that literally just believe this stuff.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And unfortunately that's truly the case.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And I hope that humanity continues to rise.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  But it's so ridiculous because they're saying, oh, there's this mass insurrection and white supremacy.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  That's the other issue that they go after as well.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  White supremacy is on the rise and all brown and black people are threatened by it in the United States of America and worldwide.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  The J6 insurrectionists, even though there were people just standing outside of the Capitol just doing nothing.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  They go after all these people, but they're silent after Roe v. Wade gets overturned.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And there's literally an attempted insurrection at the Arizona State Capitol when the legislators are in session talking about abortion legislation
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  and the rioters are outside banging on the windows attempting to breach the Capitol.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  I totally agree.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  So here's the question.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  I'm serious.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  I respect you.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  You're a smart guy.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  That's why I'm wargaming this.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  I'm going to help the phones up after you leave asking, what are they going to pull next?
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  We need to get ahead of this.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  What do you see them pulling next?
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  It's hard to tell, Alex.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  We've seen them try and play every single card.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Now, when I say this, I just want people to be on the lookout.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I don't want to radicalize anybody.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  I'm not calling for violence or anything, but just be on the lookout for some kind of event that is going to be just the catalyst to amplifying the base.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  I think Roe v. Wade could have been it, but we didn't see the entire base come out in full force.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  We didn't see BLM come out in full force.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  We didn't see all of them.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  I think sometimes it could be another black man or black woman being shot.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  It could be something that comes out that just amplifies everyone and a total summer of rage.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  A gay pride parade being car bombed.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  It could be anything.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  It could be, like I'm saying, Alex, they could go to anything.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  They could stage it.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  It could send someone with a Trump hat to go punch a black person in a face or they could just exploit another shooting that takes place.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  They go to every single one of these.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  So my guess, Alex, is it could literally be any one of these things, some kind of staged hate crime.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  The playbook is always the same.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  But we know that the small it was trying to do, but he got caught.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Absolutely.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Because now I want to talk about the reason why why do they do this, Alex?
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Like why do they run these little psyops?
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Why do they run these little false flags?
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Why do they exploit dead kids?
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Why do they take every single one of these little narratives that they try and use and manipulate the minds of people in the mainstream media?
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  They do this because they simply know that they can.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And because we've come to a place in this country where we've allowed this psychotic media to just further propagate the minds of millions of people with lies, pure lies and slander.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  They go after anyone that's telling the truth.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Now, we have to continue to wake up other Americans, whether it's your neighbors or your coworkers, find a way to communicate to them the truth,
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  because there are people out there that have lost their minds entirely.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And there are people out there, Alex, that I think are just way too far gone.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  It will literally take God to unlock their minds.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  I asked Gavin McGinnis.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  Can be awakened.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  I asked Gavin McGinnis five years ago, or five and a half years ago, when Trump got elected.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  I said, what is the peak of leftist insanity?
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  He said, there is no peak.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  They'll just keep going and going and going.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  So what are they exactly like?
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  How crazy is it going to get?
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I think it's going to get as crazy as they want it to get because they know they can do whatever they want.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  I mean, think about it, Alex.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  You are dealing right now with the deep state.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  You've been dealing with the deep state, but you are literally at point blank range.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  They're trying to throw your life and own destroyer's life away for the rest of eternity because you were standing outside of the Capitol on J6.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  But what I'm saying is these people know that they can do this.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  They are in the FBI.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  They're in the NSA.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  They're in the CIA.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  They're in the federal government.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  They're in education.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  They're in Hollywood.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  They're K through 12, not just our universities.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  These people are inside of everything.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Okay.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  And they've been empowered because they know that if they come out and do something violent or dangerous, that big brother is going to be there to give them a slap on the wrist and make it appear like there is going to be accountability.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  But they're all on the same side.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  People sit there and they want.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  I know the viewers get this, but if there's anyone sitting back wondering like, why are these people allowed to continue to do this?
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Why is it that a Trump supporter or a conservative or just like a real classical liberal like Alex Jones or Tim Pool says something slightly out of the narrative?
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Automatically, they're a white supremacist.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Automatically, they're tainted and enemy.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Automatically, they are canceled.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Automatically, they are painted with a laser that they're to be taken out and not listened to because this is a regime.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  This is history repeating itself.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  This is what totalitarians do.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  This is what the communists have done.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  This is what the socialists have done.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  Any opposition that comes out against their regime, their news media machine or anyone that is not authorized, they silence, they shut them up and they cancel them.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  This is what we are seeing in the United States of America.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Communism isn't coming.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Globalism isn't coming.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Socialism isn't on its way, Alex.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  It's freaking here.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's here. It's now.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  And we have to push back and wake people up to that reality.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  You're absolutely right. People have to understand.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  And that's the point I was going to make before the show today, and I didn't make it, is folks, the New World Order isn't coming.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  It's here and they wouldn't be trying to silence us if we weren't powerless.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  If we just stand up, hold the line, or nonviolent, but tell the truth under Christ's light, they will lose.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  They're doing all of this because they sense their end is near.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Absolutely.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  I mean, right now, the so-called left can't even define what a woman is, but all of a sudden they can when it comes to murdering and slaughtering babies.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  All of a sudden, they can define basic biology again, and when you talk to them on the ground, it's clear that these people have lost their minds.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  That's right. A man can have a baby, but we can't say a nine-month-old baby one day from term isn't a human.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  People see that. They see the fraud of that.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Because they're psychotic. They're absolutely psychotic.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  And I just want to leave your viewers with some hope before I launch out of here, Alex.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Let God use you, take the truth, engage the culture peacefully, logistically, logically, and accurately with the truth, and just see what happens.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  I mean, what does it look like when God parachutes a born-again Christian or a truth seeker in just total darkness?
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  That's always been my heart. That's always been my mind. And people could take a look at my life and say, wow, well, maybe that's what it looks like.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  And I want to see what God does in everybody else's life as well.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  So thank you, Alex.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Thank you, Dr. Hernandez. That's so beautiful.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  We're God's special forces that he's injecting into this as a test. Thank you so much. We love you, brother.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  Phone calls and news coming up. Thank you, Drew.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  The National Suisse's new film 2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.

[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  But as bad as things are we still have time to prepare and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean healthy water even in the event of your taps getting shut off and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.

[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-900-4285.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  I'm gonna fly.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  I'm gonna fly.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  I'm gonna fly.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Alright now I'm gonna open the phones up for the next hour and 40 minutes. We have the number out right now.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.960]  And I want to take calls from first-time callers,
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:46.280]  long-time callers, callers that agree,
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.240]  callers that disagree, you name it, free-for-all.
[1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:53.320]  And I've actually been getting better at just going to your call,
[1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:56.200]  giving you a minute, move the next person to the next person's ready.
[1:20:56.200 --> 1:20:58.600]  So when you hear me say your name and where you're calling from,
[1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:00.280]  you're going on air.
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:04.920]  You hear that, the phone system does that when they put you on,
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:07.320]  it goes, and you're on air.
[1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:09.800]  We're going to hear from you for 60 seconds,
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:11.640]  and we're going to go to the next person,
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:16.920]  and I'm going to take 30, 40, 50 phone calls in the next hour and a half,
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:19.800]  and I'm about to give you that number here in just a moment.
[1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:26.600]  You know, I am busier than a one-legged man in an asking contest.
[1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:30.600]  This whole world is just getting so crazy right out in the open.
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:34.600]  And we've got world government being announced,
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:36.280]  we've got Mark of the Beast being announced,
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:38.360]  we've got implantable microchips being announced.
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:40.760]  I mean, you talk about vindication,
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:44.600]  but I don't care about being vindicated.
[1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:46.760]  I just want to stop this.
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:52.440]  And they know as their system comes into fruition,
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:54.520]  as their new world order unfolds,
[1:21:56.920 --> 1:22:00.520]  the people that have been exposing it have great credibility,
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:02.920]  and that's why we've got to be censored.
[1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:06.600]  So when we sit here and we talk about all the things
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:07.880]  that are unfolding and happening,
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:11.560]  we talk about how epic they are,
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:15.640]  out of all the different political movements
[1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:18.600]  and all the different genres of entertainment
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:20.920]  and all the different distractions.
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:24.520]  It's info wars and a few other organizations
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:27.720]  that are super popular because they're telling the truth
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:33.480]  that are actually discussing what the problem is.
[1:22:35.320 --> 1:22:37.400]  There are prescriptions for every disease.
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:40.200]  There are cures for diseases.
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:43.000]  There are things we know work,
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:48.360]  or you know gasoline works in a car that's designed for gasoline,
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:53.480]  and diesel works in a truck or tractor that's designed for diesel.
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:59.160]  And what we're saying and what we're doing and what we're covering
[1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:02.200]  and the guests we have and the calls
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:05.400]  is all about understanding that and being involved
[1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:08.600]  and being informed and stopping the tyranny and promoting the freedom.
[1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:12.200]  So I have a real problem with getting up here
[1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:14.200]  and telling you how prominent info wars is.
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:16.440]  Because it sounds like I'm telling this audience
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:20.200]  how fancy I am or how famous I am or how great we are.
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:21.400]  It's the opposite of that.
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:24.520]  I'm telling you what a target I am,
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:27.480]  not to say I'm a victim, but to say,
[1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:29.880]  hey, we're over the target.
[1:23:30.520 --> 1:23:34.200]  We figured out how to beat these people.
[1:23:35.320 --> 1:23:38.680]  We've got their number.
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:42.840]  We've got their modus operandi.
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:44.920]  We know who they are.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:47.320]  We know what their plan is.
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:49.800]  And we know who they are.
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:52.920]  And we know how to stop them.
[1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:55.320]  So I'll say it.
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:23:58.120]  Bolsonaro's amazing.
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:23:58.840]  Trump's amazing.
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:00.520]  DeSantis is amazing.
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:02.360]  Victor Arban is incredible.
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:03.240]  You're incredible.
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:06.920]  Tucker Carlson is over the top, great.
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:09.400]  Joe Rogan's really getting awesome, going the right direction.
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:16.760]  But nine times out of ten, it is info wars
[1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:24.760]  that progenerates that is the first to break through
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:28.040]  with the key intelligence and the key information
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:30.040]  that changes the whole game plan.
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:34.840]  And I am blown away to be here and to be in that position.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.080]  And I am incredibly honored.
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:45.160]  And I quite frankly am ashamed that I ever get upset.
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:47.560]  And I ever get down.
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:54.040]  Because I asked for this fight 28 years ago when I got on air.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.640]  And I believed in God and I believe in humanity.
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:24:58.840]  I believe in you.
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:00.680]  And all I've seen in this fight
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:04.200]  is God give us victory when we take action.
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:09.800]  So I'll say to the audience, info wars is paid off.
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:12.200]  Info wars is won.
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:16.040]  Info wars has had the greatest success of any organization
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:19.640]  or group in the history of the modern world
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:21.640]  in the fight against the new world order.
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:24.120]  And I tell you that good news
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:30.360]  because the good news is you took action.
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:34.200]  You spread the word, you prayed, you financially supported
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:39.400]  and it hit triple cherries on the slot machine.
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:41.640]  Not a big gambler, but doesn't triple cherries mean
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:43.640]  you know, the big payout.
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:47.000]  So you did it, folks.
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:50.360]  And so now more than ever, I got to tell you,
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:53.320]  and I'm not bitching and I'm not complaining.
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:55.320]  We'll go to your calls next time.
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:56.120]  We'll get the number up.
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:01.560]  But I'm not up here telling you how important we are
[1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:02.520]  to impress you.
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.120]  I'm telling you, we're important.
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:06.920]  We're winning the battle together.
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:13.320]  And man, are we under attack and I didn't know how bad
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:15.160]  our finances were even three months ago.
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:17.880]  But I brought in some outside accounting firms
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:21.160]  to give us the full projection and the big donations
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:23.480]  we had come in, the small donations and all of it
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:28.920]  barely put us into the black with supply chain breakdown
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:30.600]  problems, everything in the future.
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.000]  We will be in the red again within two months.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:33.960]  And I'm not complaining.
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:35.480]  It's all in God's hands.
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:38.040]  I just don't God says, you know, trust in God,
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:39.960]  but tie up your camel, trust in God,
[1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:41.320]  but roll away from the rocks.
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:42.600]  I mean, I get that.
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:45.400]  And I don't want to be just mindlessly here saying,
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:47.800]  well, I'm sure right when I'm about to have to lay off
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:49.880]  half the crew and turn the lights off,
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:53.080]  I'm sure just God will just give it to me again.
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:55.560]  No. And this is key.
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:59.240]  I've got to fight with everything I've got.
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:00.840]  I've got to work hard.
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:02.120]  I've got to do the shows.
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:03.720]  I've got to do special broadcasts.
[1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:05.000]  I've got to do interviews.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:06.200]  I've got to do accounting.
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:08.840]  I've got to work hard about what are hot products that are great
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:10.920]  that people want that we get at a good price.
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:16.200]  I've got to bust my butt with everything I got.
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:19.560]  And then I've experienced this hundreds of times in my life,
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:23.480]  if not thousands, God will then intervene
[1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:25.000]  and take me across the threshold.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.960]  But every time God takes me right to the moment of oblivion
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.240]  to prove it's God.
[1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:32.840]  And I go back to the widow's mind.
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:34.680]  I forget what book of the Bible is.
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:38.920]  We got to print up the widow's mind, the Bible story.
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:41.800]  I'm going to cover that next segment.
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:45.880]  And then I'll go to the calls where there's this prophet
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:47.720]  and he's in the town and he's hungry.
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:50.040]  And he goes to the widow and her starving child.
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:51.080]  He says, I'm hungry.
[1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:53.240]  And because they believe in God,
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:55.640]  they take the little bit of oil,
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:56.520]  a little bit of grain they have,
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:58.120]  and they bake him a little biscuit.
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:01.000]  And they go hungry that night.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.560]  But then every day the oil and the grain
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:07.000]  is replenished for them after that.
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:09.560]  And I'd sit there in Sunday school and hear that.
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:10.600]  So that sounds stupid.
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:17.320]  But what it is is a spiritual archetype of how God works.
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:18.680]  And it's totally true.
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:22.360]  God wants to push us right to the edge to make us stronger,
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:24.200]  to build us up, to fight the enemy,
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.240]  and to see whatever we can take as hard as it is.
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:30.040]  And then if we're truthful and we're faithful
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:34.600]  and we execute, right at the moment we're sinking,
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:37.080]  God reaches a hand down and pulls us back out.
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:40.040]  Until some cases where that's not the case,
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:42.680]  we're gonna be an example to be persecuted and that's fine.
[1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:46.120]  Jesus and many other cases or examples of that.
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:47.720]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:50.520]  But please keep spreading the word and keep supporting us
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:52.200]  and infowarstore.com.
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:54.200]  All right, I'll give the number out when we come back.
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:55.400]  And we're gonna go right to your phone call.
[1:28:55.400 --> 1:28:56.040]  Stay with us.
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:59.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months,
[1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:02.440]  we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:04.280]  and hit humanity extremely hard.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.600]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening
[1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:11.880]  to the sound of my voice protect yourselves and your families
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:13.560]  to the greatest extent possible.
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:15.400]  And these two new sales do that.
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:17.480]  We have the ultimate immune support,
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:20.200]  60% off when you get these four items together.
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:24.920]  The immune support, X2, D3 gummies, and multivitamin.
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:28.520]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[1:29:28.520 --> 1:29:30.920]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:31.800]  60% off.
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:35.080]  Then the Trafecta immune support, 50% off
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:37.960]  on immune support, X2, and D3 gummies.
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:41.400]  And then 40% off on X2, now back in stock
[1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:43.240]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:45.880]  Now just the X2 alone is the missing link
[1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:49.160]  with most people, highest quality deep breath crystal iodine
[1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:51.880]  beyond critical for immune system in your whole body.
[1:29:51.880 --> 1:29:53.720]  It's 40% off back in stock.
[1:29:53.720 --> 1:29:56.360]  But get four of the products together for 60% off.
[1:29:57.560 --> 1:30:00.920]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old.
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:01.880]  And it goes like this.
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:05.080]  Trust in God with tie up your camel.
[1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:07.560]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:09.880]  Pray to God but row away from the rocks.
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:11.960]  If your boat is going towards the rocks,
[1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:14.360]  pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed.
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:16.200]  But also try to row away.
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:17.640]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish.
[1:30:17.640 --> 1:30:19.880]  And it's the same thing with our immune system.
[1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:22.040]  God helps those who help themselves.
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:24.760]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now
[1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:26.200]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:28.440]  Like the ultimate immune support back

[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:34.360]  We have the Traffecta Special,

[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:40.040]  And X2 sold out so important virmian system

[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:44.360]  because you have limited supplies.
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:48.360]  In fact, one of these items, we only have 2,000 bottles of.
[1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:51.400]  So the ultimate sale will probably be over just a few days.
[1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:53.720]  Take advantage of this and boost your immune system now
[1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:57.320]  and protect yourself and your family at infowarstore.com.

[1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:21.800]  Now there is not a weight.
[1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:25.320]  Almost every other storeable food distributor is completely out
[1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:28.280]  and will not have more food for months if ever.
[1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:31.160]  And the prices are exploding.
[1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:33.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself
[1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:36.520]  from your family and not be dependent on the system.
[1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:38.440]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.

[1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:42.520]  storable food and a whole spectrum of other preparedness

[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:05.000]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.040]  Needs to support info wars and band.video.
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:10.440]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:11.720]  I'm going to do that right now.
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:15.720]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:19.480]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:20.920]  like Savannah Hernandez.
[1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:24.760]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:27.000]  because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.880]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man
[1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:31.400]  and because of this platform.
[1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:34.440]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:35.800]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:39.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.880]  and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:45.160]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:47.080]  and band.video for granted
[1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:49.560]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:52.280]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[1:32:52.280 --> 1:32:53.720]  So go check out the store.
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:54.840]  Go support their store.
[1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:56.360]  Go support info wars.
[1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:57.720]  Leave a donation right now.
[1:32:57.720 --> 1:33:24.280]  Don't wait until leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:27.080]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:30.120]  you are the resistance.
[1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:32.840]  So we now know it's a five to three good versus evil.
[1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:33.640]  It's all out of the open.
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:35.080]  People are waking up big time.
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:36.760]  I'm going to give the number out and be going to your calls
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:40.600]  for the next hour and a half on any subject you want to cover,
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:41.720]  any topic you want to hit.
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:43.400]  I love the wildcard nature of it.
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:50.840]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:54.360]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:34:02.520]  Any subject, any topic, 877-789-2539, but don't be offended if I hang up on you quick
[1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:07.400]  because I'm going to be going to you quick and get you on air, 877-789-2539.
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:10.120]  Let me finish up with what I was saying and then go to your calls.
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:15.080]  And with this King 1777-16, this is the new international version they printed me
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.480]  that will be going over here with the widows.
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:20.280]  My story I was telling from memory and probably butchering.
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:26.600]  You're not a prominent figure and that's actually a blessing.
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:28.920]  To be famous is actually got a lot of negatives.
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:29.960]  I am.
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:31.560]  I'm infamous.
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:37.640]  And when I travel the country and when I go places, I get a gauge of what's happening.
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:43.160]  Mostly positive comments before Trump got elected, but I'd walk through an airport,
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:46.760]  maybe shake 10 hands on the way to the plane before Trump.
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:51.480]  And then Trump gets in and I shake 100 hands going to the plane in the airport,
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:55.960]  but two people come over and say F.E. Russian age and I hope you go to prison.
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:04.600]  Now, when I travel the country and the world, I have to wear a ball cap and put my head down
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:11.480]  and not talk or I get mobbed with people who want nautographs and photos and then more come
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:12.760]  and there's 30 people around me.
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:20.120]  Doesn't matter if I'm in Florida, New York, Hawaii, Texas, it doesn't matter.
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:24.200]  And again, I want to explain it's not Alex Jones saying, oh, I'm famous.
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:26.680]  That is not we're saying you're not famous.
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:29.240]  So you don't know how many people are awake.
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:30.280]  You don't have a gauge.
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:31.320]  I'm a sensor.
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:38.280]  I'm a canary in the coal mine and ladies and gentlemen, I'm getting 10 times the
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:46.760]  support I ever got everywhere if I'm with my family at a at a pool at a hotel in Hawaii
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:58.760]  for a vacation and I'm walking from where we've got chairs to get lunch at a restaurant.
[1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:01.960]  I'm walking and people are Alex Jones.
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:02.680]  We love you.
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:03.400]  They're jumping up.
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:05.160]  I can't even get where I'm going.
[1:36:05.160 --> 1:36:06.360]  So I'm walking.
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:08.120]  I can't even get where I'm going.
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:13.160]  So we're sunglasses in a hat, not because I'm against our fans, but because I've got to go
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:17.400]  get the fish and chips and the cheeseburger or whatever.
[1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:19.000]  And my daughter's grilled cheese for lunch.
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:21.720]  So let me give you the good news.
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:23.640]  America.
[1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:28.920]  I haven't traveled out the U.S. in a while, but I can tell you America is on fire.
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:32.120]  You go check into the hotel.
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:35.320]  Both the people checking you were listeners.
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:37.640]  The bell hops a listener.
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:40.120]  The guy that valets your car is a listener.
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:42.040]  You go to dinner that night.
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:43.960]  The waiter is a listener.
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:46.520]  The bartender comes over as a listener.
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:50.280]  And they're not just a passive listener like I heard your show a few days ago.
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:51.800]  I wonder where you were today.
[1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:54.040]  Always doing a great job, but when are you going back?
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:37:05.640]  So when I say we're 10 times more popular than we were a few years ago, I don't know where it's
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:09.000]  happening or where it's going on or where it's going down.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:10.360]  But let me give you the good news.
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.040]  I don't go downtown Austin now and get Custet and Yeldette.
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:17.480]  I have people asking for autograph.
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:22.840]  People are turning against the system like never before.
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:25.080]  And I'm a bellwether in that.
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:29.320]  And I'm here to tell you we are winning massively.
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:31.640]  It is staggering.
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:36.360]  Staggering.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:40.440]  Imagine you pull up to a hotel.
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:45.560]  A populous hotel.
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:46.600]  Not five stars.
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:49.480]  It's been a nice hotel, but like three and a half stars.
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.600]  Normal big hotel.
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:54.520]  You open the car door of your Malibu.
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:37:57.800]  And they go, Mr. Jones, great to have you.
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:37:58.920]  I'm a big fan, by the way.
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:00.200]  You thank you very much, sir.
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:01.800]  Give him a $20 bill to close the door.
[1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:02.760]  You're walking in.
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:04.120]  Alex, we love you.
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:05.000]  Did you get almost coming?
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:05.800]  No, we just love you.
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:07.000]  We were just talking about you today.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:11.320]  You walk in.
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:13.640]  Everyone at the checkout counters, the listener,
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:15.800]  the people behind you, almost all of them are like,
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:16.440]  we love you.
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:26.600]  Then you're walking to your room past the concierge.
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:29.160]  And he goes, excuse me, ma'am.
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:32.280]  And he gets up and goes, me and my brother and my father,
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:33.160]  we love you.
[1:38:33.160 --> 1:38:33.960]  We love you.
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:34.600]  Well, thank you.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:36.520]  I think we're going to probably book some excursions
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:37.000]  while we're here.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:37.800]  Thank you.
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.840]  And then the bellhop comes to your room.
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:43.880]  I'm like, look, I don't want your $20.
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.480]  Alex, me and my wife just love you.
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:45.880]  Thank you.
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:48.120]  I'm like, I go, oh, really, you're a listener.
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:49.000]  How long have you been listening?
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.360]  I've been listening about five years.
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:55.640]  Then you order room service the next day.
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:01.240]  And a Hawaiian woman shows up who can hardly speak even
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:01.640]  good English.
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:03.480]  I guess some folks don't speak English there.
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:04.680]  And she's like, I'm a big listener.
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:05.160]  We love you.
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:07.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've blown the enemy.
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:09.320]  They are totally screwed.
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:16.440]  I mean, if you saw what I have seen, you would be so positive
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:21.000]  right now, because believe me, they've screwed up.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.960]  The New World Order has screwed the pooch, as they say.
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:26.680]  I'm going to stop talking about that.
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.360]  I'm going to go to break, come back with your calls.
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  But let me, let me hit this because I mentioned it.
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:31.080]  Here it is.
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:37.240]  Here it is, King 17, 716, New International Version.
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:39.880]  Sometime later, the brook dried up.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:40.920]  It's a drought.
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:43.000]  There had been no rain in the land.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.080]  And the word of the Lord came to him.
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:50.440]  Go at once to, I can't pronounce this,
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:56.120]  Zeraphah, in the region of Sidon and stay there.
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:39:59.000]  I've directed a widow there to supply with food.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.520]  So he went to Zeraphah, when he came to the town gate,
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:05.320]  a widow was there gathering sticks.
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:09.000]  He called her and asked, would you bring me a little water
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:10.920]  and a jar so I may drink?
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:15.560]  As he was going to get it, he called and bring me
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:17.640]  please a piece of bread, please.
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.160]  Twelve, as surely as the Lord God lives, she replied,
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:27.880]  I do not have any bread, only a handful of flour and a jar
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:29.960]  and a little olive oil in a jug.
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:31.720]  I am gathering a few sticks to take home
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:33.880]  and make a meal for myself and my son
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:37.080]  that we may eat it and die during a famine.
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:41.480]  Elijah, he said to her, don't be afraid.
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:44.840]  Go home and do as you have said.
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:47.560]  But first make a small loaf of bread for me
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:50.360]  from what you have and bring it to me
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:53.720]  and then make something for yourself and for your son.
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.040]  For that is what the Lord God of Israel says.
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:04.040]  The jar of flour with it be used and the jug of oil
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:07.800]  will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:09.560]  to the land and it continues.
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:13.800]  She went away and did as Elijah told her.
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:18.920]  She was there with food every day for Elijah
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:22.040]  to the woman or family for the jar of flour
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:25.000]  was not used up, the jug of oil did not run dry
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:29.160]  in keeping with the word the Lord spoken by Elijah.
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:31.240]  And folks, I have experienced this.
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.800]  I have literally experienced this.
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:37.800]  And it goes on from there.
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:41.160]  That brings tears to my eyes because it's absolutely true
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:45.640]  and that's a kind of dumbed down version of the whole thing.
[1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:47.240]  But this is metaphysical.
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:50.520]  We have unlimited power in the universe.
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:51.960]  We can do anything.
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:55.480]  We are in an embryonic larval stage right now
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:57.320]  and we're about to do incredible things.
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:02.440]  And Satan and his minions will not have any more power
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.440]  over us soon, but we first have to go through this test.
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:07.640]  But let me give you the good news.
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:11.320]  I've been all over the country and I can tell you,
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:14.760]  the people are awake, the people know the truth
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:17.960]  and the truth is rising and the enemy is in trouble.
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:22.920]  And all the mark of the beast and all the microchips
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:26.360]  and all the social credit scores and all the forced
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:30.440]  inoculations and carbon taxes are about making you poor
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:32.600]  and desperate so they can control you
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:36.360]  because they're weak and they're broken and they will pay.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.680]  We're going to come right back and go to Steve,
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:44.360]  Julio, Kyle, Jason, Ginger, Seth, Mike, Alex, Jay and others.

[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:09.720]  available at Infowarsstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:14.600]  health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:20.920]  relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:27.160]  by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:32.520]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:38.040]  up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:43.720]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:49.640]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, organic Skolcap, and

[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:41.480]  God's in control. All right, I'm going to take five calls in this 11-minute segment.
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:45.400]  I'm going to go to Steve and Julio. I'm going to go to the order the calls are received.
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:48.520]  Steve in South Carolina, you're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:54.520]  Hey, thank you, Alex. I just want to say the biggest issue in this country is still for
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:59.480]  January 6th. There's people that are in a gulag who have no freedoms, no right to talk to their
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:03.800]  families, no right to talk to their lawyers, and not even the people that are just in jail
[1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:08.920]  and still fighting. There's people like me who lost their career just for simply going there,
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:14.040]  just for simply being on the capital steps of the capital building and being peaceful and
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:19.320]  protesting. And January 6th, well, why were people there? Because they stole the election.
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:25.640]  I feel like these are two issues that the public is starting to kind of fade away with the election
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:30.600]  and January 6th. There are people, lives that are still being affected, and it's the biggest
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:35.000]  trees and it's stealing the election, Alex. And people really need to know how important these
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:39.560]  two issues are. I totally agree with you. One of the videos I have, I want to get to, if we can
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:45.480]  take calls and do it, is the Gateway Punnigot video at someoneinforwards.com as well, where the
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:49.640]  proud boys were in a Zoom meeting saying, we're going to be peaceful. We're going to try to stop
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:54.200]  any violence at the capital. We're going to try to stop any antifa attacks, which is what I'd
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:49:00.280]  heard. People were there to stop any antifa attacks. And so it's all them planning to be non-violent.
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:06.440]  So where is the planning for a violent attack? Very well said. God bless you. You're absolutely
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:13.320]  right. Julio in Colorado. Julio, welcome. Well, Alejandro, I tell you what, this is going to be
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:22.520]  a unique fall for not only the U.S. but Europe as we descend into an energy crisis. Yesterday,
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:30.440]  I thought it was shrewd, sophisticated, probably purposely done by the President of France,
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:38.040]  Manuel Macron, who in Germany at the G7 went up. He said Saudi Arabia can't produce more oil,
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:44.440]  which is a total lie. Well, not only that, but I believe it's going to be set up to where not
[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:50.600]  only France but the rest of the world are going to put pressure on the United States to produce
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:57.480]  more oil. When the U.S. won't produce more oil, it will be the perfect setup for the United States
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:50:02.680]  to be the fall guy, to lose everything that goes with... Well, it's not your opinion. They're already
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:07.480]  blaming the U.S. So I love how the globalist ordered Biden to shut off the power and then they
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:13.480]  turn around and get mad at him. No 100%. I mean, as you've said, as many people have said for
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:19.160]  several years now, Biden, his administration, are set up to be the perfect fall guy. If you
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:23.960]  watch that video closely, I mean, Biden looks like a deer in a headlight, but it was the reaction
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:28.600]  of Jake Sullivan, the body language of Jake Sullivan, the same Jake Sullivan who was slapped in
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:35.720]  the face verbally by the Communist Chinese in Alaska and in Italy. He looks done. Again,
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:42.440]  it's setting up to where Germany, places like Schalke, places like Berlin, they're gonna have
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:48.440]  to pay up the wall for their energy, for their heating costs, for their AC at the tail end of
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:53.960]  the summer... Yeah, nobody is buying Julio that the Russians caused this. If they were to blame,
[1:50:53.960 --> 1:51:00.200]  that's great. I'd expose them. This is globalist, global warming, carbon tax, great reset policy.
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:04.840]  Thank you so much. Great callers. I can talk to Julio for an hour, but we gotta get to everybody.
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:09.160]  Let's go to Kyle in Nebraska. We're on the order received. Kyle, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:15.000]  God bless your brother. Welcome. Hey, I just wanted to say,
[1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:21.560]  finish in the last of my stockpile of Extend-A-Wise, if that tells you how much I bought.
[1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:29.480]  Love you. I'm getting ready to open up some new ultimate fish oil and the krill oil,
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:36.040]  those two things there, and then your your store list and your bodies. If people just took those
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:43.800]  four, life would change for everybody. The products we sell really are amazing. That's
[1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:48.120]  what keeps us on air, which is even more amazing. I hear you, brother. What's your view on Democrats
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:55.560]  gaslighting us? So basically, it's their currency. If they're 100% currency, after they stole it and
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:52:04.040]  got away with it, then the 90 billion in Afghanistan of all of our equipment, they knew that was it.
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:10.120]  They knew we were a conquered state. That was it. And now their gaslighting is just like you used
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:18.600]  to say, pissing in her face. And until we stop covering what they're doing and only cover solutions
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:25.240]  daily, meaning talking to sheriffs, talking to, I mean, just pure solutions. I just believe,
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:31.000]  brother, that if it's only solutions here on out and no more showing a mirror.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:35.160]  No, Carl, I totally agree. It's a paradox. I want to expose what they're doing, but I want to have
[1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:40.840]  solutions as well. That's how they always get us on these stabilizers. They keep changing the subject
[1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:48.600]  with new attacks. How do you balance that? I believe that you put a mirror up to it as if,
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:53.320]  you know, I say the first 30 minutes, you put a mirror up to what they're doing.
[1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:59.640]  Then the next hour, the double time, you measure it out and you say, these are the solutions to
[1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:04.120]  what we just showed. Beautifully said. Thank you, Carl. All right, let's go to Alabama.
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:07.480]  Let's go to Alabama. Let's talk to Ginger. Ginger, welcome.
[1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:14.440]  Yes. Hi, Alex. I wanted to follow up on Romans one. So basically what this is saying in layman's
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:20.200]  terms is that once God gives you over to a reprobate mind, you have lost your chance to be saved.
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:24.840]  He has blinded your eyes and he has hardened your heart. And there are many types of reprobates in
[1:53:24.840 --> 1:53:30.440]  the world. They can be false prophets, pedophiles, rapists, murderers, and also sodomites. Once
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:35.000]  you're in lust with a member of the same sex, you're a reprobate and cannot be saved. That's
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:40.520]  what Romans one says. People are not born this way. Once you have rejected God, once too many times,
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:45.080]  he rejects you. Just like the Pharisees, they were reprobates. And that's why Jesus told them
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:49.320]  that their father was the devil. Once you're a child of God, you are always a child of God.
[1:53:49.320 --> 1:53:53.640]  But once you are a child of the devil, you are always a child of the devil. That's what you're
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:59.240]  seeing on TV right now with all the protests about Roe v. Wade and the pride parade. I mean,
[1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:03.480]  just ask yourself, why didn't God send soul winners into Sodom and Gomorrah? Because they
[1:54:03.480 --> 1:54:08.600]  could not be saved. The reprobates are in charge right now, and they are all demon-filled statements.
[1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:14.440]  Well, they're certainly acting like demons, and you're right. But I'm a sinner. I've done
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:18.760]  bad things, and God forgave me. I think a lot of these people, I don't want to debate you
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:23.080]  theologically, but I mean, I think God can always change your heart, but you're right.
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:29.720]  God does turn people over to great delusions. Yes, exactly. And just like in the end times,
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:35.320]  there are going to be people that he puts the veil over their eyes where they cannot believe.
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:39.800]  There are people out there that cannot believe because God has done this to them,
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:44.680]  because they have rejected him once too many times, just like Pharaoh. He was given chance
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:50.200]  after chance after chance, and eventually God hardened his heart against him because Pharaoh
[1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:58.040]  hardened his heart against him first. So it's not something that God wants to do, but once we reject
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:03.800]  God too once too many times, he's going to reject us. That's why people need to find Jesus right now.
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:09.080]  Absolutely, Ginger. Thank you. Thank you so much. Let's go to Mike in Florida. Mike in Florida,
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:15.880]  go ahead. You're on the air. Alex, longtime listener, longtime caller, Air Force veteran,
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:20.360]  17-year listener. I want to give everybody an info or tip on how I've woken people up
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:25.480]  over the last 17 years with your content. Everybody, Alex, even people that are asleep,
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:29.560]  they have hot butts. So whether it's abortion, whether it's banking, whether it's Ukraine,
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:35.480]  whatever the thing is, people go to band.video, go to the search bar, type in the topic that
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:39.560]  they are interested in, and you're going to see a plethora of videos pop up that Alex has put out
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:43.880]  and other people have put out. Send them those videos, send them over and over and over again.
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:47.960]  I guarantee you that you will wake people up doing it that way. That's a successful
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:52.280]  strategy, Alex. I've been doing since you lost it. No, no, I hear you, bro. That's why we built
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:57.480]  band.video. We're putting up our resistance. The truth is there. It's up to the people to
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:03.240]  spread it. You're absolutely right. Absolutely. And thank you for the X2. I take the X2 Selenium,
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:10.520]  the Ultra 12. The Turbo Force is great. The Ultra 12 is great. And that's what you have to do when
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:15.480]  you're really awake is you need to decalcify that pineal gland and have your system really running
[1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:20.040]  on high octane fuel. And that's what the supplements at infowarstore.com will do for you.
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:23.960]  Thank you, brother. I appreciate your call, Mike. I want to just say this to listeners.
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:30.120]  I cannot describe to you what the iodine conspiracy is. You have to research. It would
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:36.360]  take hours to get into. We've covered it probably 50 times, but absolutely. X2 takes two weeks to
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:40.600]  kick in on average. Some folks, it doesn't know weeks. Some in three weeks on average is about
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:45.960]  15 days. You'll feel sick for a couple of days when you've done it for 15 days. And then it's
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:52.760]  just like when I forget to take deep breath crystal iodine, I feel it. It is so essential
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:59.000]  to everything electrochemically. X2 is 40% off, and it's about to settle out. We'll have more

[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:52.920]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:57:52.920 --> 1:57:57.400]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick feeling because
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:03.800]  I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it. And now everything I've talked about is going to become
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:09.880]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:15.720]  documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth,
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:22.520]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:26.760]  move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's watching
[1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:31.080]  the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:35.560]  and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here. I want
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:40.840]  you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has
[1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:45.480]  a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you
[1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:50.200]  now to redouble your efforts. The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here.
[1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:55.160]  They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency. They're coming
[1:58:55.160 --> 1:59:01.480]  for your national sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:07.240]  They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy. And ladies and gentlemen,
[1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:11.880]  they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government that you and
[1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:17.400]  your fellow Americans choose. The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary
[1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:24.760]  ever made in my view, 2000 mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at info wars
[1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:32.360]  store.com. You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarstore.com.

[1:59:37.080 --> 1:59:41.080]  to bring these criminals to justice. If they're planning to run the same scams again,
[1:59:41.080 --> 1:59:55.160]  this film can stop them if you take action infowarstore.com 2000 mules leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:59:55.160 --> 2:00:13.880]  My eyes are blind, but I can see the snowflakes glistening on the trees.
[2:00:25.160 --> 2:00:35.320]  The sun, the sun no longer stands in front of me.
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:45.880]  I feel, I feel no place in me.
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:53.240]  What a time to be alive. What a time to be conscious. What a time to be here with me right now.
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:59.800]  This will last for a term day. All right, we took six phone calls in a 10 minute segment, a record.
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:04.440]  We are getting back to my old days, 20 something years ago, taking a lot of phone calls and we're
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:11.000]  doing it again right now. So the order they are received, let's go ahead and talk to
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:22.040]  Kellan in Colorado. Kellan, you're on the air. Welcome. Hi, Kellan, you're on the air.
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:28.840]  All right, Kellan's not there. Hi, Kellan. We love you. Let's go ahead and take another call then.
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:33.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Minnesota. Jay, thanks for holding your on the air. Go ahead.
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:39.560]  Hello? Yes, sir. Good to talk to you and you're doing an amazing job. I don't need to tell you
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:45.320]  that because you already know. But I'm just wondering why is it not being more talked about,
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:50.360]  that component that's going in the diesel engine oil, and when that shortage hits,
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:56.360]  the food's like done, like starting like in a couple weeks. That's right. If you look at all
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:01.320]  the numbers, I didn't want to say this on air, but all the numbers show total collapse. I mean,
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:08.360]  they are deliberately post-industrial world sabotaging our civilization. It's in 2030 right now.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:12.760]  That's what it is. I mean, we're always looking for more false flags. There
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:18.040]  are no more false flags. Once that happens, it's over. That's right. The globalists know
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:23.000]  the false flags don't work, so they're just cutting the energy off. Right. And that's
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.840]  what's going to happen. And I'm wondering why you're not putting this out there. Why are we not
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:31.560]  talking about this? I mean, I don't know. Tell people you're on air. I totally agree with you.
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:37.000]  I have a stack of news on it. Tell us what's going to happen. People need to go out. They need to buy
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:42.760]  food. They need to be stocking. They, I mean, everything you can do as far as solar panels to
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:48.680]  have energy, anything you can do is what you need to be preparing right now because this is coming.
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:54.280]  And then China's just going to invade and it's over. There's nothing left. I mean, that's what's
[2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:59.720]  going to happen. Times out. Brother, I totally agree. Once the bottom drops out, people are going
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:06.040]  to be wishing they got prepared and ready. You are totally right. Absolutely. Preparation is
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:11.160]  everything. Right now, preparation is key and people just don't see it. They keep talking about
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:17.320]  all we could do this. We could do that. What you can do for yourself right now and your family
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:21.320]  is what you need to do right now. You don't have another day to even waste.
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:26.280]  I agree. People should go to preparetoday.com, preparetoday.com, the highest quality swirble
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:31.640]  food, water filters, air filtration, ready to ship right now, preparetoday.com. Thank you, Jay.
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:35.560]  Let's jam in one more call before we go to break. We're going to get to everybody here today. This
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:40.920]  is amazing. Let's go ahead and we're going to go to break. I don't want to cut a caller off to one
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:45.720]  minute. We're going to go to break. We're going to come back and the order these calls are received.
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:52.760]  Jason in Texas, you're going to be up next. We come back in a 60 second break. Then we're going
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:58.360]  to go to Chris in Canada in Ontario. We're going to go to all these callers that are patiently
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:08.200]  holding right now here on this live June 28, 2022 live Tuesday broadcast. Yeah, I mean,
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:14.760]  I'm not an economist, but I know how to look at the numbers and we're inside the new world order.
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:21.160]  We're in where we are inside the deindustrialization right now. We are inside their takeover and
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:25.480]  so it's a two pronged attack in my view. We get prepared to take care of ourselves
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:31.320]  while we warn others about what the new world order has done to them and how they get it down
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:35.720]  to stop them. It's that simple. All right, we'll be right back on the other side of your phone
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:45.240]  calls. Bam, bam, bam. We're taking them 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex and in the next hour,

[2:06:00.600 --> 2:06:06.200]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:14.200]  I hear people talking bad about the truth. Slavery didn't destroy the black family.
[2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:18.760]  Do you know that we were still getting married through slavery, jumping the broom in secret,
[2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:23.480]  even under punishment of death? We were married during reconstruction. We were married during
[2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:29.400]  civil rights. When do you begin to see the rise of the single parented black female household?
[2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:35.160]  1970. After they killed Dr. King, the United States government said we must neutralize
[2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:40.680]  the black power base. And they determined that the black power base was the black family.
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:47.560]  It was independent black skilled men and women who finance King, finance Mr. Garvey, finance Mr.
[2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:52.120]  Muhammad, finance Snick and core the freedom riders in the city movement. So they said,
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:55.720]  if we want to crush the black struggle, we got to crush the black family. So guess what they
[2:06:55.720 --> 2:07:02.600]  did in 1970 King, 1068. In 1970, they came into the black communities and deindustrialized our
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:08.360]  city centers. In 1970, they started shutting down the factories. Remember, up until the 50s and 60s,
[2:07:08.360 --> 2:07:12.520]  you didn't need a college degree to get a decent job. Many of us got grandparents who worked in
[2:07:12.520 --> 2:07:17.320]  factories their whole life and live better lives that we're living now with two and three degrees.
[2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:21.960]  They could work in their same neighborhood and everybody worked for the factory. Good retirement,
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:26.840]  pension, benefits, medical. They started shutting down the factories in 1970. And then they went
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:31.640]  into the high schools and did what? Started deindustrializing the inner city high schools
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:37.000]  up until 1970. You could graduate from almost any school in New York, certified as a plumber,
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:42.920]  certified as an electrician, certified as a carpenter, auto body, brick mason, a welder.
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:47.880]  They took all those programs out. These are the skills that pays the bills, gentlemen,
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:52.600]  as long as you have a skill, you can always feed your family. But if all you got is college degrees,
[2:07:52.600 --> 2:07:57.080]  you might end up in an unemployment line. Why? Because the skills that we learn in college
[2:07:57.080 --> 2:08:03.320]  are not necessarily marketable to other black people. I'm a psychologist. Ain't too many black
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:08.200]  people running around looking for psychologists to reveal all the skeletons in their closet.
[2:08:08.200 --> 2:08:11.240]  Yeah, you'd rather talk to a white person. Exactly. So they started sending us to college
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:16.360]  instead of teaching us how to work with our hands. That was the 70s. That was the economic
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:23.800]  castration of the black male. Now let's go to 1980. The CIA comes in, cocaine import agency.
[2:08:23.800 --> 2:08:28.280]  They drop off crack. So now the unemployed black man who has always been a breadwinner,
[2:08:28.280 --> 2:08:34.120]  Envy, even then slavery, we were less Dr. Umar Johnson want to get him on the show,
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:38.280]  but that's exactly true. They want us all off the land. They want to control us all.
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:42.760]  And was beta tested with black folks to break up their families is now being done against
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.880]  everybody. And that's the reality we're here talking about today. The system doesn't want us
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:54.280]  to be discussing a post human world. All right, let's go to your phone calls. Let's talk to a
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:09:01.720]  caller in Texas. Let's talk to Jason in Texas. Jason, welcome. Hey, thanks, Alex. Yeah, these
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:06.680]  people aren't done with the false flag. That's all I can say. We'll be seeing more of those.
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:11.880]  They're probably going to pull some type of Las Vegas type thing or maybe another 9 11.
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:18.040]  But they're on the move. Yeah, over 100 and something. Processing plants stolen. So, you know,
[2:09:18.040 --> 2:09:23.800]  are burned down. They're all going to be our food is already short. So get on in fours and
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:34.280]  buy storage of food or anywhere. Um, yeah, he got the Russian troops being invited to Venezuela.
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:40.680]  And I think they're just going to surround us all these Ukraine. That's the total, you know,
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:45.720]  that's nothing. I totally agree with you. This is the
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:53.400]  globalist takedown of our civilization. So I guess, yeah, all we can do is prepare,
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:58.120]  get everyone together. You know, don't mind what's on the TV and all this weird crap and
[2:09:59.160 --> 2:10:04.760]  yeah, just be just be prepared, everyone. Well, you're right, Jason. It's all a giant
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:11.160]  distraction. What else can folks do? Yeah, order food from info or is there my patriot?
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:14.840]  Anything else? Go get your ammo. Two places they've closed down.
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:18.920]  If you haven't known that Lake City ammo and Winchester.
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:24.840]  So it's all going to shut down, brother. We're under attack. God bless you. We're here fighting back.
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:30.440]  All right, let's talk to caller in Canada. Let's talk to Chris in Ontario. Chris, you're on the
[2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:34.840]  air. Thank you for calling. How you doing, Alex? First time caller. Love you, buddy. I'll get right
[2:10:34.840 --> 2:10:40.840]  to it. There's some new documents. They're not new from stuff, the crime.net silent weapons for
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:47.000]  quiet wars and the iron mountain report from NASA really good. Just like the agenda 21 from Rio
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:53.880]  de Janeiro, et cetera. The UN weapons confiscation in America that was on a Christopher Green AMTV.
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:11:00.280]  He showed that. State Department of random 7277. It's amazing. Yeah. So it's just a lot more
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:05.880]  information of what's coming down the pipe. That's crazy. You know, it's official US government policy
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:11.720]  to take our food, take our guns, take our children. I mean, it's happening now. It was crazy as we're
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:17.080]  living it. We're now in that time folks warned about brother. That is correct. It was right on the
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:24.120]  NASA website for that. And then just inflammation, the unemployment rate, the house foreclosures,
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:30.360]  even here in Canada. It's getting pretty bad. They just took our guns. True. Oh, he's an idiot.
[2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:34.440]  Yeah, we pretty much have like Chris Guy, but he's known like the globalist as well.
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:40.360]  He's been pretty silent the last like four or five months down here. I haven't heard much of him.
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:45.720]  And then there's like packing and they're holding people from the protest in Ottawa.
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:52.120]  So it's just a brother. I appreciate your calling. God bless you. Let's go ahead now and let's go to
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:57.480]  Arthur. Let's talk to a caller in Texas. Arthur, you're on the air.
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:05.400]  Alex. Yes, sir. Yes, I've got two each of all three founders coins for each of my two grandsons.
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:10.360]  Brother, without you, it would be on air right now. So thank you. You bet for their birthdays.
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:18.360]  Thank you. I've got a big question. What facts do we actually have that a large maybe even a huge
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:24.120]  percentage of the so called COVID vaccines are nothing more than sailing. They've actually
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:30.840]  got studies and test out that mainly red states got delivered the poison shot and the blue states
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:39.240]  got the sailing. Yeah, this indicates a master plan of distribution. In other words, they're
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:47.640]  earmarking it to certain areas, the one or the other. Absolutely. So what do you what do you
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:53.640]  think we do or what do you see the master plan? We got to we got to get these facts on paper and
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:13:01.000]  out there so that people know. Now the irony is you're lucky if you got the sailing, but I've
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:07.640]  got a grandson that was brow beaten and finally getting it. He's in the Marine Corps. I've got
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:15.960]  other close relatives that have had the vaccine or whatever they had. And at some point, we've got
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:21.240]  to that's got to break open. So I think I heard you mentioned that David, I could said that maybe
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:29.400]  as much as 96% of the this is a while back a couple months ago that 96% of these vaccines,
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:34.200]  these hundreds of millions that have been produced are nothing but sailing. They are. It's a test
[2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:40.280]  of killing select groups. Yeah, they're controlling the battlefield casualties. Absolutely. I was at
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:47.800]  a wedding, though, Saturday, and there was only like 40 people there. And five or six people there
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:54.040]  took the shot and got super sick. Yeah, and they were all medical workers. So some and some have
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:59.640]  had no no effects. And they're probably selectively hitting the military, because I know a bunch of
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:03.960]  military got really sick from it. They're selectively hitting our key people with it. Yeah, here's the
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:11.000]  thing. These vaccine manufacturers, they're compartmentalize the manufacturing into the
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:15.480]  end of the business, they know probably what's going into these lots. And I'm sure they're lot
[2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:20.680]  numbered. And then they send them to the distribution, they have no idea what's in
[2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:28.360]  the shot or the lots, but they know where they're going. But somebody at that company knows both
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:34.760]  sides. They know the whole picture. Well, imagine they're totally complicit. So so so let me try
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:40.920]  to answer that as best I can. Gregory said a report I forget the name of it like three months ago
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:46.040]  that got a couple million views that I forget the exact headline, but it's like evidence shows
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:52.200]  deadly vaccines being targeted to red states. And that report actually shows the statistics
[2:14:52.200 --> 2:14:56.360]  and the groups in the studies are through great point. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:01.640]  All right. We just took a bunch more calls. They're all bringing up incredible points.
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:05.320]  We're going to go to break. We're going to come back. We're going to go to Heath.
[2:15:06.440 --> 2:15:14.600]  We're going to go to Alice, Manuel, Adrian, Sam, Johnson, Justin, you name it.
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:20.520]  In the order they are received. They found the report. Go put it back on screen.
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:26.520]  That's the report. Evidence that U.S. government targeted red states with deadly
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:33.880]  batches of vaccines. I'm going to take that report from January. Gosh, that's six months ago. Time
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:41.320]  flies. And I'm going to have that posted under the live show feed of the live show today. So I'm
[2:15:41.320 --> 2:15:47.080]  going to have that posted the front page of the flashback to info wars.com. Go look at it. It's
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:51.080]  got all the documents, but the caller just mentioned Arthur. Thank you for bringing that up. We're
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:16:03.880]  right back. At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all. And if we
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:10.840]  don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse. But as bad as things are, we still have time
[2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:17.320]  to prepare. And that alone is something to be grateful for. A gravity water filter will provide
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:23.960]  you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off. And having your own
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:29.400]  food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps. And if you've already
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:34.760]  stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:40.760]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:48.760]  an abundance of storable foods and water filtration. Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[2:20:00.360 --> 2:20:16.280]  of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:24.280 --> 2:20:26.680]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to hit a story
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:32.280]  that he reported on that is so insane, makes my head spin for the Washington Examiner. I'll tell
[2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:37.400]  you about it when we come back. Right now, we're talking to the callers. The order the calls have
[2:20:37.400 --> 2:20:43.080]  been received here. The first caller is Sam in Tennessee. Sam, welcome and thanks for calling.
[2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:48.840]  Howdy, Mr. Jones. Thank you for taking my call. It's my first time getting all the way through
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:52.280]  to you, so I appreciate it. Good to have you, brother. Glad you're here.
[2:20:52.280 --> 2:20:58.840]  Yes. I want to give you two short Bible verses, and if you like what I have to say here, I would
[2:20:58.840 --> 2:21:02.920]  pray you let me give you a little more analysis of the Four Horsemen after that.
[2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:10.760]  The first one is, I meant this for you a couple of months ago. I just couldn't get through to you.
[2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:15.560]  It almost seems like you were a little overwhelmed and depressed at the time, and so this was just
[2:21:15.560 --> 2:21:21.800]  to kind of strengthen you a little bit. It was out of Matthew chapter 24 and it says, and accept
[2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:26.760]  those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved, but for the elect to take those
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:33.080]  days shall be shortened. It just seemed to me like then you felt things were kind of hopeless,
[2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:39.160]  and here's the thing. In a way, they are hopeless, but if you notice that key word,
[2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:44.760]  you know, if right there, if these days were not shortened, these days are going to be shortened,
[2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:50.520]  so they're not hopeless. God's still in control, so that one was for you because you just seemed
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  a little overwhelmed at one point. I hope that helps. The second one, I heard a caller say something
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:02.040]  about the delusion, and I just kind of wanted to answer that a little bit. This is out of Second
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:09.640]  Thessalonians chapter 2, because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved,
[2:22:09.640 --> 2:22:14.120]  and for this cause, God shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe alive.
[2:22:14.680 --> 2:22:19.400]  So I found it interesting when we get to the end times of God that sends the strong delusion,
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:24.840]  right? But there's a reason for it, because they lost the love for the truth. So if somebody
[2:22:24.840 --> 2:22:31.240]  doesn't like truth, that's a dangerous spot to be in. Doesn't it translate because you hated
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:36.920]  God and the truth? God turns you over to a strong delusion. Yes, sir. Yes. So those are the two
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:41.480]  short ones. Will you humor me for a little bit longer when I go ahead into the four horsemen?
[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:47.400]  Okay, thank you, sir. So in Revelation chapter 6, the seven seals are beginning to be open.
[2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:53.160]  The first four, and I can comment on all the six in that chapter, but the first four are your four
[2:22:53.160 --> 2:22:58.120]  horsemen, commonly known. You have a white horse, a red horse, a black horse, and then a pale horse.
[2:22:58.120 --> 2:23:04.280]  Now, that's obviously symbolic, but when you run into something like that, it's helpful to go look
[2:23:04.280 --> 2:23:09.560]  for somewhere else in the Bible that gives you a little more explanation. There's a Bible repeats
[2:23:09.560 --> 2:23:17.720]  itself. Yes, and so we see something like this in Zechariah chapter 6. You have four chariots,
[2:23:17.720 --> 2:23:21.720]  one pulled by white horses, one pulled by red horses, one pulled by black horses, and then
[2:23:21.720 --> 2:23:27.080]  one pulled by grizzled and bay horses. It's almost the same thing. And Zechariah asks the
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:32.360]  angel a direct question. What are they? And the angel replies, these are four spirits that stand
[2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:37.160]  before the Lord in heaven and then go out into the earth. So I don't think it's necessarily
[2:23:37.160 --> 2:23:43.800]  unreasonable to read the four horsemen in that same light as four spirits. So let's take a look
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:48.600]  at that first horseman. He's the white horse. He's given a bow and a crown, and he goes forth
[2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:54.120]  into the earth and conquers. Now, my first observation there is the word war is not mentioned,
[2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:59.400]  and I think that is significant because war is mentioned for the fourth horseman. So it's not
[2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:05.000]  like it's out of context, right? Now, in the Greek, the word crown there is Stefanos,
[2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:10.600]  which is the victor's crown. In other words, this guy is not a king. He doesn't have a diazium.
[2:24:11.240 --> 2:24:18.120]  And I want to point out, if we may hop languages one more time, the Latin word for crown is corona.
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:23.320]  So if I can reread this, you have a spirit that stands before the Lord in heaven, has given a
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:30.680]  crown, or given a corona, goes out into the world and conquers without a war. Okay? So there's that
[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:36.440]  one. The next horse, he's the red horse. He takes peace from the earth and people begin killing
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:41.720]  one another, yet again, without a war. Could that sound like ripe? Could that sound like rising
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:47.080]  murder rate? Now, we've been broad and coincidental up to this point. The third horseman gets very
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:54.680]  specific. I'm just going to go straight to a translation here. A measure of wheat that's
[2:24:54.680 --> 2:25:00.440]  roughly a quart, and if you take the Greek word, join, it can translate it. For a denarius,
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:07.400]  that's a silver coin, and Matthew 20 is equivalent to a day's wage. So a measure of a quart of wheat
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:12.360]  for a day's wage, three quarts of barley for a day's wage, do not hurt the oil and the wine.
[2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:18.920]  Now, much of the Bible is Israel specific. So do we have a scenario where wheat could
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:27.240]  cost a day's wage in Israel, let's say roughly 150 shekels, and the oil and the wine is not hurt?
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:32.680]  Well, 70% of their wheat supply comes from Ukraine and Russia. Their oils and their grapes
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:39.800]  is grown domestically. Now, they did buy a lot of wheat prior to Russia joining that war. However,
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:45.720]  their reserves will only last them through the month of June. Now, I don't know if they'll get
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:51.400]  more supplies, but let's just say I'm watching that because the fourth horseman is the one where
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:57.240]  you lose a quarter of the earth due to famine, due to disease, due to the beast of the earth,
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:03.720]  and due to war. And you can't deny that's being implemented now. Yes, sir. Absolutely. I swear
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:08.440]  these globalists are reading the book of Revelation as a how-to. Well, does the Bible say that God
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:15.000]  will make the wicked fulfill prophecy? Yes, sir. I've seen it many times. And I'm reading the
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:20.440]  book of Revelation right now as what's next. And I could keep going for quite some time,
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:26.040]  but this is a call-in show, so I will let you choose. But I just wanted to make sure that you
[2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:31.640]  saw the book of Revelation like that. I've heard several people comment on the four horsemen,
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:37.240]  but I hope that I gave a very lucid analysis. You did. Thank you, Sam. Amazing. We spent six
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:42.280]  minutes with you, but I wanted you to get your point out. Heath in Maine, you got two minutes. Go
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:48.440]  ahead. Hey, Mr. Jones. Welcome, Heath. Yeah, thank you for taking my call again. I just want to
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:53.240]  thank you real quick for setting the standard of courage. And I want to speak in Revelation real
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:58.440]  quick, so I have like three or four verses. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:04.200]  and to overcome them. And then it says, drop down, it says, here is the patience and the faith
[2:27:04.200 --> 2:27:09.240]  of the saints. And then the COVID temperature, you know how they scan your forehead and your
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:15.640]  right hand? And instead, he caused all both in great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:20.680]  a mark in their right hand and in the forehead. So there was that. And now with the abortion that's
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:26.040]  going on, if you read in, I'm flipping through the Bible here, Psalms chapter two, it says,
[2:27:26.040 --> 2:27:30.120]  why do the heathen rage? And that's what they're doing. The heathen are out there raging. And when
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:35.080]  the people imagine a vain thing, the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:41.000]  together against the Lord and against his anointed, that's us saying, let us break their bands,
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:46.680]  usutter and cast away their cords from us. He that sits in the heavens shall laugh and the Lord
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:51.720]  shall have them in derision. And let's see, what is it? Amos, you're talking about censorship of
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:57.640]  infal wars possibly going under. It says in 811 here in Amos, behold the days come, saith the Lord
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:03.320]  God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:08.040]  but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea and from north to
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:13.480]  even the east. They shall run to the end to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it. So
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:18.440]  if it's God's will, I hope infal war stays on because when you got censored off the social
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:22.760]  media platforms, I was lost for years. And then I found you again. So I want to end this.
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:28.680]  Brother, you made amazing points and the Bible is being fulfilled and no one can deny it. Thank you
[2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:33.320]  so much for the call. He's amazing. All these colors have been incredible. You notice it's all
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:38.680]  biblical because it's the enemy. People say, why are you so biblical now? Because it's all being
[2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:44.680]  fulfilled now. The enemy knows this and they understand it's spiritual. They want you to
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:49.800]  attack. Only spiritual defense can protect us. I got a few minutes of your phone calls

[2:31:53.160 --> 2:32:00.520]  infowarstore.com. 2000 mules. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:32:00.520 --> 2:32:05.160]  Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[2:32:05.160 --> 2:32:10.600]  patrons can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:17.000]  Shroyer. SuperMell Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:22.040]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:28.200]  that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[2:32:28.200 --> 2:32:33.400]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact,
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:37.240]  each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:40.680]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just how
[2:32:40.680 --> 2:32:46.600]  it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:33:00.680]  yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it. Leading a frontal assault on the
[2:33:00.680 --> 2:33:14.760]  lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to
[2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:22.040]  you live from the front lines of the info war. So I have hundreds of incredible news articles
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:26.920]  that illustrate this period. But I'm taking your phone calls because they're more important the
[2:33:26.920 --> 2:33:33.160]  different angles you take us in. But here's just a few of the articles I've got here in the stack
[2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:39.320]  today. Now we would talk 10 years ago about the globalist want to ban beef and ban anything that
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:45.320]  has carbon and make you eat bugs. He'll say they're not we're not gonna eat bugs. Jones just shut up.
[2:33:48.200 --> 2:33:54.120]  Canadian company pledges has produced 2 billion bugs per year for human consumption
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:34:00.680]  because the IMF and the World Bank are funding that while funding taxes on cows because they
[2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:10.600]  fart and the idea that methane out of a cow's bad that's what helps form our atmosphere.
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:15.640]  This is alien folks. This is anti human. This is destructive. It has to be rejected. They're
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:21.480]  trying to normalize dystopia. All right, let's go to your phone calls because we've taken a record
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:26.200]  number of calls today. I'm doing what I said I would do. It's great radio. It's informative. The
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:31.400]  angles you take us in are amazing. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:38.120]  10 callers on hold and I will get to every one of you before our guest host in the fourth hour
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:44.920]  when Helen Rood takes over. Let's talk to Alice. Let's take a call in Arkansas from Alice. Alice,
[2:34:44.920 --> 2:34:52.200]  welcome. Hello, Alex. I want to talk about the Supreme Court decision Roe versus Wade. I'm very,
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:57.480]  very upset that everybody thinks that was a victory. It was not a victory. I think you just
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:03.960]  fell back into the trap and the Supreme Court has once again shirked its responsibility and I point
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:11.560]  you over to, well, I want to also say that they shirked the responsibility by passing it to the
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:17.720]  states because it did not stop abortion at all. It's going to continue and then it lulls everybody
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:23.320]  back to sleep who are in the safer states and the fight kind of gets diminished a little bit
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:28.280]  because people are only concerned with themselves mostly and they'll just relax and think, you
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:36.280]  know, well, we're safe. And I want to point out that in Jeremiah 1.5, God said, I knew you and
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:42.360]  you as a person. Before you reformed your mother's womb. Before you, please don't interrupt me.
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:48.360]  I've really been through hell trying to get through to you. I knew you and you as a person
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:55.560]  entitled to full life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness under the Constitution and Bill of
[2:35:55.560 --> 2:36:01.640]  Rights that currently stands. And if you research the Mayflower contract, you will see that this
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:09.160]  is a Christian nation formed on the Bible and the Ten Commandments of the Bible formed our
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:15.720]  Constitution and Bill of Rights. And God said, I knew you before I put you in your mother's belly.
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:21.320]  So all that's happening when you are in your mother's belly, you are already a person entitled
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:28.360]  to full constitutional rights. All that's happening is your container is being built on you so you
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:37.160]  can come out of that womb and walk around on the planet and therefore that person is being murdered
[2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:43.320]  and is being violated under their constitutional rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:47.800]  Well, let's just be clear. I wasn't being mean. I quote the Bible verse. I agree with you.
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:51.960]  And I hear what you're saying. But I think overall it's made a left man because we're saying abortion
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:57.160]  is murder and it's wrong. The battle is not won. The war is not won. But I think it's positive
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:37:01.960]  that the Supreme Court did this. You don't think so? Absolutely. Do not think so because it further
[2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:08.200]  divided our country into blue states and red states. What were they supposed to do then? Were they
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:14.360]  supposed to say abortion was okay? Let me finish speaking, Alec. Ma'am, I'm asking a question
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:18.920]  because we're here together. We're talking. You just talked for two minutes. What were they supposed
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:25.080]  to do? What I'm saying, when you further divide a nation between blue states and red states,
[2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:31.480]  a house divided will not stand. That comes from Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ also said that
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:40.040]  my people have foreborn to fight. They became as women. And that is not a compliment. That is a
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:45.480]  disgrace. And this country will not survive another two years waiting for a new election.
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:50.760]  This country will go down before that. And in the meantime, what about all those babies that
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:56.920]  are being butchered? So this is just another scenario making people think that we have had
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:38:01.160]  a victory when we have not. Okay, Alice, we heard you say that. I appreciate your call.
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:04.840]  The reason I was able to go to you is so I want to call her quickly. I'm not cutting you off
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:10.040]  ago the next person. Thank you. I'm not saying you're all wrong about that either. Let's talk to
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:19.480]  Adrian in California. Go ahead, Adrian. Hello. Hello. So I'm a medical researcher. And I've
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:27.000]  discovered the true cause of COVID-19 and how it all works. So the vaccines change people's DNA
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:31.080]  and the stability of their system. This is called genetic engineering. But genetic engineering
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:37.240]  doesn't really work because the body normally rejects any changes to DNA. The body corrects
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:42.360]  its own DNA sequence always. So in order for the vaccine to work on people, they had to suppress
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:47.400]  people's immune system response. They did this by including a species of parasites called
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:52.680]  stronguloides in the vaccine. These parasites are called threadworms. They're very common and
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:59.320]  they're impossible to detect in the body. Out of 100 tests, 75 come back negative.
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:04.680]  They're one of the few species that are impossible to accurately test for. That's why COVID tests
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:11.720]  never really work. And so nearly all the cases of stronguloides or threadworms cause no clear
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:18.280]  symptoms. They're all asymptomatic, just the same way COVID-19 is. The vaccine has the parasites
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:23.160]  in them. So people who get vaccinated, their bodies begin to produce the larva of threadworms
[2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:29.560]  in their cells. So the body will not attack itself. And this leads to people adapting to the
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:35.480]  COVID and to the parasites in their body. So they use the parasite like a virus vector
[2:39:35.480 --> 2:39:41.000]  as the carrier to your body to accept it. I want to say I've studied everything you say. You're
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:46.120]  a very good expert on all the signs of this. I have to compliment you on that. This is also why
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:51.800]  ivermectin kills COVID because ivermectin kills parasites. We've got a mainstream article. Put
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:57.480]  that back up saying that. Yeah. Wow, that's powerful. Yeah. So these threadworms, the species
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:01.080]  are called threadworms. This should be blasted everywhere. If the world finds out that the
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:06.280]  threadworms are in our food, in our water, this is what they're doing to suppress people's immune
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:11.960]  systems. The threadworms lead to stuff like cancer and all these other kind of stuff, reproductive
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:18.120]  harm. People are sterilized by this. So the threadworms kill people by eating their vitamins
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:25.160]  and minerals. They cause malnutrition. So what you're doing, providing vitamins and supplements
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:30.600]  that people are being deprived of, that's really good. People need to really stock up on exactly
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:36.280]  the... I've studied the chemicals that you're including in your products and that's exactly what people
[2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:45.960]  need. Also, Dr. Zelenko. Dr. Zelenko, you had him on your show. His products also have very good
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:51.960]  effects. All right, Adrian, amazing points. We're going to look into it. Thank you. Incredible.
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:58.040]  Thank you. We've got to move forward into the next person. Let's go to Sean in Michigan then
[2:40:58.040 --> 2:41:07.480]  Justin. Sean, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. Welcome. Can you hear me? I can. Okay. I got a hospice
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:18.280]  story, but not a happy one. My father-in-law died about, well, 13 years ago. He was really sick
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:25.400]  for a long time, got real skinny, real bony, and then we were there, hospice was there,
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:33.640]  and then he just died, and his body turned purple. They pronounced him dead. We were just trying to
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:40.280]  decide what we're going to do next. My wife and her sisters were there, and then he just gets up in
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:48.920]  bed, still all purple and veiny all over his body, and he grabs their hands and looks at them,
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:55.560]  and I swear to God, he was scared to death, and then he just laid down again and died,
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:03.640]  and they pronounced him dead again. I believe you. That happens. So I asked the nurse, I said,
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:11.160]  does this happen? And she goes, nope. So I'm not sure everybody knows where they're going to go,
[2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:17.080]  and since we're getting close to the end here, I don't know, your end could be today in a car
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:23.400]  crash, but people better be thinking about where you're going to go and be ready. That's why,
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:29.480]  that's why I was calling. I love your show. Sean, I love you, and I appreciate your call.
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:34.360]  All right, we're going to break, and I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven calls,
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:39.640]  and I'm going to take every one of them before Wayne Allen Root takes over. Wow. Turning the
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:45.800]  listeners loose is incredible. These callers, I mean, I'm just blown away right now, and I can't
[2:42:45.800 --> 2:42:51.800]  wait to come back in four minutes and take more of your calls straight ahead. Infowars.com. Don't
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:43:00.760]  share that site. Don't spread that link. The internet and talk radio are on fire with the
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:05.320]  slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually
[2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:11.720]  very sick feeling because I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it. And now everything I've talked
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:17.960]  about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:24.680]  policy reports and documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:31.720]  the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:35.960]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:39.960]  watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:45.000]  of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, Infowars would not be here.

[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:09.080]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:14.040]  the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:18.280]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:21.800]  for calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:26.520]  quick plug out for one of the product. The XTube does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.

[2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:27.480]  To house migrant children, kidnapped children in North Carolina neighborhood.
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:29.800]  They don't have parents. Nobody. They're brought in.
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:36.440]  They're dumped on the U.S. and now the federal government decides where these kidnapped children
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:45.160]  go. Mass child trafficking out in the open. Speaking of that, Gislett Maxwell just 30
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:50.760]  minutes ago was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:54.200]  to sexually abuse minors. That's who these people are.
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:48:00.920]  Wow. Total soul is evil. Manuel in California. Manuel, welcome.
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:06.760]  Hey Alex, how you doing? Good brother. I just want to go over the spiritual
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:11.880]  aspect and it seems like mankind's kind of going back to the Old Testament
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:16.520]  and you mentioned several times in the movie The Exorcist and how that demon-possessed child.
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:21.160]  You're seeing these people at these protests and stuff and so on. It's like they're right out of
[2:48:21.160 --> 2:48:26.440]  the movie. Now in the beginning of the movie there's a statue and the ruins. This guy is
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:33.800]  excavating and his name is Pazuzu. It's a real statue. It wasn't a prop and it's a chimera.
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:39.320]  It looks like a demon. It has a head of a lion, horns of power, wings of an eagle, the talons
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:45.240]  for its feet, and a serpent for its tail. And the people that worshiped it, they sacrificed
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:50.760]  their children to it. Not so he would help raise their crops, but so he wouldn't destroy them
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:55.160]  because he was a mobster. He was a gangster. He used the blood of those children as protection
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:49:04.520]  money. Now you fast forward thousands of years to now. The biggest world plague was what? A virus
[2:49:04.520 --> 2:49:10.360]  that's a chimera. Several viruses put together and we're at the time of the biggest human child
[2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:17.800]  sacrifice. Just our own country. We've sacrificed 63 million children. That's more than the population
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:23.480]  of Canada. They don't have like 40 million people there. Now if you can bring up a picture of a
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:31.160]  statue in front of the New York UN building, guess what? It's a chimera. A large lion or a
[2:49:31.160 --> 2:49:38.600]  jaguar with the wings of an eagle and the tail of a serpent. I thought God made man in his image.
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:42.440]  So what is it with these civilizations and certain people that worship this beast?
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:50.520]  It seems like we are going back to the Old Testament and they're wiping away the New Testament
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:56.840]  like the Christianity and, you know, I mean, it's hard to say in words, but now you're totally
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:00.920]  right, brother. I appreciate your call. Great points. We'll put it all on screen. You're
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:05.160]  absolutely dead on. Thank you. All right. Justin in Florida, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:13.080]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? Yes, sir. Go ahead. I just wanted to personally come over here and say
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:20.760]  thank you for waking me up. I'm a 20 year old black male and you can see the media,
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:24.440]  like a lot of people my age, we look at the media and it makes us feel so much emotion
[2:50:25.160 --> 2:50:29.880]  and it's negative, very negative emotions because I once felt some type of way about
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:38.200]  white people and cops, but you, I've, I watched your shows and I put two or two together because
[2:50:38.200 --> 2:50:44.360]  I grew up in a Christian household and this is all a setup for everybody to be divided.
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:48.200]  Exactly. It doesn't mean white people are perfect. It doesn't mean cops are perfect,
[2:50:48.200 --> 2:50:52.600]  but it means they're manipulating us. And Alex, they try to make you look so bad, man.
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:57.080]  Oh, I can't even look for you on YouTube and show people because they have so much bad things
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:51:02.760]  that you don't see nothing real. And I, every time I sit down with people, they think I'm weird
[2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:08.200]  because I will try to explain to them like, guys, realize we're not fighting humans. We're fighting
[2:51:08.200 --> 2:51:13.720]  demons. Like we're in a spiritual warfare right now. And if we don't get ourselves together,
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:18.040]  we're not going to make it. That's right. We all have our differences and nobody's perfect,
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:24.280]  but if we don't get together, we're done. Exactly. And so I was, I really appreciate you, man. You
[2:51:24.280 --> 2:51:29.560]  are, you're a hero. I look up to you, man. I appreciate you, brother. So what's your view,
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:36.040]  Justin, on the demonic influence that's happening? Well, I know for people my age, they honestly
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:41.960]  really reject a lot. I was born in 2000. So me growing up in a Christian household,
[2:51:41.960 --> 2:51:47.800]  God was more prevalent back in the day. In 2022, people in my age, we don't talk about God.
[2:51:47.800 --> 2:51:53.560]  They don't care about God. It's nothing about God. Everything is very immoral. And then it's
[2:51:53.560 --> 2:52:00.200]  scary because it feels like we're back in Sodom and Gomorrah. And so I try to explain to people
[2:52:00.200 --> 2:52:05.000]  what's going on, but people say, oh, we're just humans. Nothing's going to happen. People always
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:13.240]  prophesy the end, you know, but we, if you look into the Bible, Alex, you see everything is happening
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:18.920]  and it's scary to think at my 20 year old mind that it's happening, but everybody needs to know
[2:52:18.920 --> 2:52:23.400]  that this is what's happening. You're right. World government, Margaret the Beast, it's all happening.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:32.520]  It's scary, man. And I pray for those. I feel honestly sad for people who reject just doing
[2:52:32.520 --> 2:52:39.240]  their own research. I'm going right now to school to be EMT because I feel like it's necessary
[2:52:39.240 --> 2:52:43.400]  for things that might be needed when whatever happens, happens. I want to be able to at least
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:48.920]  help, but I feel bad for those people who are not awake and know what's going on in the world.
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:52.440]  It's a beautiful job to be an EMT brother and we love you and we appreciate you. Thank you.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:58.920]  Wow. My biggest frustration is all these great callers. Can you imagine who couldn't get through
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:05.640]  today? So I just got to shut up and take calls. Next up, Dave in Missouri, Dave, you're on the
[2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:10.760]  ear. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, it's an honor to talk to you. Honored to talk to you, sir. Go ahead.
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:16.760]  I would like to know what do you believe happened Christmas morning, 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee
[2:53:16.760 --> 2:53:20.920]  outside the AT&T building? I don't know what happened with that bombing. I mean,
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:27.880]  I don't believe the official story of course. Exactly. But I don't know what happened. What
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:34.600]  do you think? I think that it was an inside job to cover up evidence that the NSA swept up
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:40.920]  for election fraud. Well, they said that's where they were storing it. That's the main theory. Yeah.
[2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:46.280]  The echelon equipment, of course, echelon equipment is 50 years old now. The modern stuff,
[2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:50.760]  you know, maybe the guys knew too much and they just put him in the RV
[2:53:51.720 --> 2:53:59.080]  so they have some DNA to clean up. But I'm just curious if you knew maybe or you had a theory
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:04.760]  that was better than mine. Brother, I'll be honest. I don't know. Doesn't make sense. It's crazy. I
[2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:08.840]  think they should be investigated. Thank you so much, Nicole. All right, let's talk to
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:16.840]  Ty in South Carolina. Ty, go ahead. Hey, hey, hey, what up? What up? Welcome.
[2:54:18.120 --> 2:54:21.000]  Hey, it's a pleasure being on your show. I just wanted to talk about
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:25.480]  the real Manchurian candidates and that is the children of God. Like,
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:30.360]  there's so many people across the globe that's waiting to be activated. I was on a prayer call
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:35.640]  with my wife and at the end of the call, they unmuted everybody's phone and everybody just
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:41.080]  was praising and praising. Then it was a beautiful sound and, you know, it just reminds me that
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:45.560]  everything's going to be all right. This is a fixed fight and now is the time to get off the fence,
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:50.760]  join a church. It don't matter what the nomination, join a church. Surround yourself with
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:57.320]  golly people and, you know, watch sermons, listen to gospel music, just get fired up because
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:02.040]  now is the time for us to be activated. It's no matter what they do, the fight is fixed.
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:05.560]  You're right, brother. We got to run into God. We got to run to God.
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:09.960]  That's right. I mean, God wants to do a new thing. I mean, it doesn't matter if you've got
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:15.160]  tattoos, you smoke weed or whatever. God wants all of those people to come together, you know,
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:21.000]  by yourself we're strong, but together we're unstoppable. So get around some good golly people.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:25.480]  I mean, even if you, you can't find any, be that one, be that light for everybody else.
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:29.720]  Well, Ty, let me back you up here. Why is the enemy so scared of Christians? Why are they scared of
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:34.680]  church? Not the church is perfect, but it could happen there. It's the detonator. They know we've
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:40.440]  got the answer. And if we unify under God, it's over. Right. And that's, that's, that's where I
[2:55:40.440 --> 2:55:45.080]  was getting at because I strayed away from God for a, for a while. I, you know, I studied all types
[2:55:45.080 --> 2:55:50.280]  of religions, just trying to find, trying to put it all together, but, but seeing the, the human
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:54.680]  attacks on Christianity, that just was like, wait, there's got to be something there. And a lot of
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:59.000]  people threw the baby out with the bathwater, you know, just doing their own research and Jesus
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:03.640]  wasn't real and all of this stuff. But, you know, that's why, because it's, it's divine.
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:06.840]  I totally agree. It's so real because they're coming after it.
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:11.400]  Right. Right. And that's, that's what, that's what made the switch clip to my mind. It's like,
[2:56:11.400 --> 2:56:16.840]  man, this was so fake. Why are they still vehemently like, you can talk about any religion. You can
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:22.520]  talk about Islam, Buddhism, you know, you can't really say anything about Jews or Muslims, but
[2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:27.080]  Christians is fair game on social media and in the media and on movies and everything.
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:29.240]  No, they're scared of Jesus, brother. They're scared.
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:34.760]  Yeah. And you know, we are his arms. So we got to activate, you know, get fired up, get off the
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:39.240]  fence. I mean, we are in the army of God. You got to stretch the stuff. We had that probably
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:43.720]  and nothing because when I, when I finally turned to God, that's when everything I wanted
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:50.840]  or everything I needed opened up for me. Exactly. I had all girlfriends every day of the week
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:55.240]  and everything had a perfect body and I was totally unhappy. As soon as I got God,
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:56:58.200]  I was totally happy. Beautiful said. And, and look,
[2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:02.360]  I don't just say this. These have been the most incredible calls ever.

[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:13.880]  I've been under attack, but I'm going to get it done where we just take three calls, three hours
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:20.440]  of calls. No breaks because they don't want us coming together. They don't want us sitting here
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:29.880]  and talking. The enemy hates it. I'm going to break. Go to John and Texas. Last call. John,
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:34.600]  John, stay there. Don't hang up. And then we have Alan Roots going to take over.

[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:38.120]  are our tell brother, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Quickly, I was reading the article today
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:45.720]  about that black security guard was killed in the shooting in Buffalo, New York. Yes. And he invented
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:51.960]  a car that ran out of water. He had a YouTube video I typed the same and put water power car
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:58.760]  and video popped up. And people are saying now that he was the real target of that shooting.
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:03.080]  They had to shoot a few extra people to make it look good, but that he was the real target
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:09.320]  that they get rid of him. I saw that we should look that up. I should look more into that.
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:17.400]  And the same with the you've all been shooting dead. That that thinks thinks the heck to that,
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:22.040]  uh, that they're not talking about that kid where he got the gun and they're not talking about, hey,
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:27.080]  where's the dealer? What do you know? Supposedly bought a dealer. None of it, you know, well,
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:32.840]  the state police in Texas admit you've all needs a total takeover, a total lie. They don't know
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:39.880]  what even happened in your vaulting. So it's fair game to ask questions about any of it because we
[3:01:39.880 --> 3:01:46.360]  don't know. They would have that police chief. I mean, what's his politics? Was he a far lefty too?
[3:01:46.360 --> 3:01:54.440]  Or what, you know, the whole thing's very suspicious. They need to look into it a lot closer. Both
[3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:58.440]  those shootings, they need to look into them real close, Alex. I agree. What else do you think's
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:04.680]  going on? All the only other thing I can say is all them people out there, the Anna, the
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:09.560]  pro-abortion people and everything, they're just our version of the Kymer Rouge. You look at them
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:13.640]  and they're just as crazy as the, what the Kymer Rouge war in Cambodia and God help us if they
[3:02:13.640 --> 3:02:18.520]  ever get a hold of our control of our guns where we can't defend ourselves against. Well, the good
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:23.080]  news is they could ban guns tomorrow. They're not getting them. And that's the real checkmate
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:29.400]  problem they've got. But we've got to use information, the truth, free speech now more than ever.
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:34.360]  So we don't get that point. John, thank you so much, sir. All right. Wayne Allen,
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:38.600]  Roots about to take over. I'm just going to throw this out there. PrepareToday.com.

[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:41.720]  system booster with immune support, vitamin D3 gummies, X2 and multivitamin highest quality.

[3:04:49.240 --> 3:04:53.240]  or AAA 2533139. Wayne Allen Root straight ahead.
[3:05:02.280 --> 3:05:06.280]  I want to say BrainForce is great. I want to say TurboForce is amazing. It is.
[3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:12.520]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it.
[3:05:12.520 --> 3:05:18.440]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[3:05:18.440 --> 3:05:22.760]  the cleanest, the best out there. Crill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:27.480]  And I'm sorry. You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The Crill is hallucinogenic.
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:30.840]  It's so good. In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[3:05:30.840 --> 3:05:36.760]  I eat five capillots of Crill Oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[3:05:37.160 --> 3:05:41.880]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[3:05:44.680 --> 3:05:48.440]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the
[3:05:48.440 --> 3:05:51.800]  best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[3:05:51.800 --> 3:06:01.880]  Impore Sword.
[3:06:01.880 --> 3:06:08.040]  All right, Wade Allen Roots, otherwise known as War. Here's the guest host for Alex Jones,
[3:06:08.040 --> 3:06:12.680]  as I do on Tuesdays at 12. Doing great to be with you. I'm going to start this show
[3:06:13.240 --> 3:06:18.520]  in a very different way because I've got a stack of news in front of me that I want to get to
[3:06:18.520 --> 3:06:23.000]  that's all so important. The country's falling apart. We're headed into economic collapse,
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:28.440]  food collapse, supply chain collapse, gasoline and oil collapse. A lot of things to talk about.
[3:06:28.440 --> 3:06:34.600]  So this seems kind of trite, not that important. And yet I think it's very important enough to
[3:06:34.600 --> 3:06:41.080]  open the show. And I hope I catch the attention of Howard Stern because you know what they say
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:45.720]  when you try and sue, you have to have standing. If you don't have standing, they won't let the
[3:06:45.720 --> 3:06:53.320]  lawsuits go through. I have standing because I was the world's biggest Howard Stern fan when I was,
[3:06:53.320 --> 3:07:00.520]  I don't know, between 16 and 26 years old for about a 10 year period as a kid and a young
[3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:06.520]  adult in New York. I loved listening to Howard Stern. He was a comedian. He had nothing to do
[3:07:06.520 --> 3:07:14.600]  with politics. The only way he touched on politics was he was like me, a common sense, blue collar,
[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:21.080]  middle class, I'm a son of a butcher at SOB. And he was like that kind of guy. And we had the same
[3:07:21.080 --> 3:07:26.120]  background. We're both Jewish. And I went to an all black middle school, all black high school,
[3:07:26.120 --> 3:07:30.840]  Mount Vernon, New York on the Bronx borderline. He went to an all black high school called
[3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:36.840]  Roosevelt High School in Long Island, New York. So we have the exact same background. I started
[3:07:36.840 --> 3:07:43.800]  out like him as kind of a skinny, Jewish, pale, misfit, getting beat up in an all black high school
[3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:47.640]  in middle school. That's how he started out. Of course, he never got out of that phase. He's
[3:07:47.640 --> 3:07:52.200]  still a nerd, still a skinny nerd who gets beat up if he was ever in an all black high school.
[3:07:52.200 --> 3:07:57.800]  I turned into a tough guy because I became friends with a bunch of Italian guys who went to the
[3:07:57.800 --> 3:08:04.120]  high school. It was 90% black and about 9% Italian and me, Jew and one or two Asians.
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:10.520]  And I fell in with a very Italian, Fonzarelli crowd, the Fonz, and they taught me to be tough
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:16.920]  and rough and fight and fight back. And everybody I fought, I won. And then they respected me
[3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:21.000]  and I won their respect and nobody ever touched me the rest of my life. So I wound up
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:26.120]  with kind of a different background in the end than Howard Stern. But at least I felt like he
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:33.480]  was one of me and I felt like I was one of him. And he had my pulse of what's going on in the
[3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:38.280]  world. And I would listen to him and go, that's right. That's right. And that's funny. And that's
[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:45.560]  funny. And I noticed that too about somebody he was making fun of. And all of a sudden,
[3:08:47.640 --> 3:08:53.160]  Howard divorces his wife and he marries a gorgeous blonde actress model.
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:59.880]  And I guarantee you she's a liberal from Hollywood. And he becomes a liberal from
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:06.200]  Hollywood. She took his balls away. She cut his balls right off. And this guy becomes a liberal
[3:09:06.200 --> 3:09:13.320]  from Hollywood. By the way, just like Joe Scarborough, MSNBC, what is it? Micah Brzezinski
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:18.600]  cut his balls off. And he went from a Republican congressman to basically a rat,
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:23.480]  think, traitor, socialist slash communist. And that's because no matter how moderate you are,
[3:09:24.520 --> 3:09:29.880]  if you attack Trump and you defend the Democrat Party, you're in bed with snakes and evil people
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:34.280]  and demons and the devil and communists. It doesn't matter that you're a moderate,
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:37.320]  you're in bed with them and you're giving them power and they're bad people.
[3:09:39.240 --> 3:09:44.280]  Same exact, and I have a very dry throat from allergy here in Las Vegas. It's 110 degrees
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:48.520]  and like 2% humidity. So my throat gets a little dry. So if I drink a little bit,
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:54.280]  no, I'm not Marco Rubio. No problems. I just need to keep my throat wet in order to do a one hour
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:10:02.200]  show without coughing here from allergies. But same thing with, by the way, Arnold Schwarzenegger
[3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:08.200]  was my hero. He was the greatest Republican conservative, legal immigrant who loved America
[3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:13.320]  and made a big success and lived the American dream and was a huge Republican, became governor
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.680]  of California as a Republican, was against the legal immigration. And then somehow his wife and
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:25.480]  the Kennedy family brainwashed him or maybe after he dumped his wife, the new chicks he was dating
[3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:29.320]  in Hollywood. And I say that word chick as a funny thing because it's Hollywood gals.
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:33.640]  And I lived in Hollywood for 13 years and I was single and I was dating. And so they were
[3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:39.400]  Hollywood babes, Hollywood chicks, as the liberal guys call them there. And they brainwashed him
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:45.000]  too. And pretty soon, you don't ever wind up getting in bed with these gorgeous models and
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:49.880]  actresses unless you're a big liberal, commie, bleeding hard, pro-abortion, pro-immigration
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:55.880]  loser. So the pretty girls and the Kennedy family helped to ruin Arnold Schwarzenegger
[3:10:55.880 --> 3:11:01.480]  and Michael Brzezinski helped to ruin Joe Scarborough. And I believe the gal that's married
[3:11:01.480 --> 3:11:06.680]  to Howard Stern whose name escapes me. She's a gorgeous blonde model actress and she ruined
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:10.920]  him. They all got their balls cut off and they forgot everything they ever believed in and they
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:15.560]  got rid of all their common sense. And Howard Stern is no longer funny. He's no longer listenable.
[3:11:15.560 --> 3:11:18.760]  The things he says are horrible. I don't know if listenable is a word or not,
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:23.000]  but it's impossible to listen to him if you're a common sense person. And who are the guys who
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:29.480]  made Howard Stern who he was? He's lost his way. He's lost his roots. Okay, guys like me,
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:35.960]  it was all young, macho, common sense, blue collar, middle class, men who liked Stern,
[3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:41.560]  who are almost always Republican or certainly independent conservative leaning or right center.
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:47.720]  And he has now become a raving liberal socialist communist loser. Nothing out of his mouth makes
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:53.240]  any sense. And he's not funny anymore. First of all, liberalism isn't funny. Only conservatism
[3:11:53.240 --> 3:11:59.560]  is funny. He's not funny. Got no sense of humor. You've lost it all. So I'm issuing you a challenge,
[3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:04.760]  Howard Stern. Wayne Root will debate you anytime, anywhere on your show, on my show,
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:08.440]  the Wade Allen Root Show, three hours nationwide each night. On this show,
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:12.840]  right here on the Alex Jones show, I'll debate you. I'll take you on any platform.
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:17.400]  You are wrong about Trump. You're wrong about America for four years under Trump.
[3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:21.720]  You're wrong about Biden. You're wrong about the economy. You're wrong about the Supreme Court.
[3:12:21.720 --> 3:12:26.040]  You're wrong about Roe vs. Wade. You're wrong about the Electoral College. And most of all,
[3:12:26.040 --> 3:12:31.800]  you're wrong about COVID and the COVID vaccine that's killing literally thousands of people a day
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:37.880]  all over America, including actors and actresses and musicians, famous rock stars and athletes,
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:43.000]  NBA player, NFL player last week. How about Danny Bottaducci walking with a cane,
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:47.960]  half his face frozen in paralysis. How about Justin Bieber, half his face frozen in paralysis,
[3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:53.320]  stomach problems, his wife, many stroke. These are all people that clearly in Hollywood got
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:58.200]  vaccinated and now their lives are either ruined or severely damaged. Howard Stern,
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:02.760]  you're wrong about everything. He hid in his house now for two years. He's so deathly afraid of
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:07.400]  COVID. He's afraid of the world. And the problem is when you hide in your house, you're not speaking
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:13.720]  to the people that made you great. All the young guys like I was 25 years ago, 30 years ago,
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:20.520]  you know, you're speaking to just your liberal, clueless wife from Hollywood who knows nothing
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:25.240]  at all about the real world. You know, the very definition of actress is they're in the make-believe
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:30.040]  world. They're in the fantasy world. And that's your wife, your little rich spoiled brat who knows
[3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:34.840]  nothing about anything that anyone could identify with who would ever listen to your humor. You
[3:13:34.840 --> 3:13:39.240]  don't have a humor anymore. You've ruined your life. You screwed everything up. No one's listening
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:43.400]  to you. You're on serious satellite radio. No one could tell us even five people listening.
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:47.320]  Sirius already gave you a billion dollars, so they can't fire you. They'd lose face,
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:51.160]  and their stock would go to zero because they gave up a billion dollars for nothing.
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:55.400]  But I guarantee you, your audience is down to nothing. No woman would listen to you. Your
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:14:01.080]  only humor is guys' humor. And guys are all conservative Republican NFL macho guys.
[3:14:01.080 --> 3:14:04.760]  None of them are listening to anything you say anymore, Howard Stern. So I challenge you,
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:09.480]  I'd like to wake you up. I'd like to bring you back. I don't hate you. I do think you've gone
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:13.960]  for one of my heroes to a schmuck. But I don't hate you. I think you could be brought back.
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:18.200]  Your balls have been cut off. Look, I've got them in the corner. Maybe I can give them back to you
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:23.480]  to bait me, Howard Stern. I'll rip you to shreds on COVID, on COVID vaccines,
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:27.240]  on your idiotic musings about the Supreme Court. And sure enough, I went into this
[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:32.840]  root rant. I call it, you know, I'm weighing on the root. And this is my rant about Howard Stern
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:37.720]  to start my show yesterday, my national radio show. Sure enough, what's the story in today's
[3:14:37.720 --> 3:14:42.600]  New York Post? Howard Stern says he wants to run for president of the United States.
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:47.080]  You know, the brain dead comedian who's gone liberal that no one listens to anymore says the
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:51.640]  most inane, clueless things in the world now thinks he should be president of the United States.
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:56.920]  So he's a psychopath with an ego the size of Texas, who no one listens to, you know,
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:15:00.760]  he's musing to himself. And he says he'd only run for president of Trump runs,
[3:15:00.760 --> 3:15:04.840]  because he's beat Trump. Let me tell you something, Howard Stern. I did run for president of the
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:10.040]  United States. 2008. Look it up. I was on the ballot. I was on the presidential ticket of the
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:15.960]  Libertarian Party. And hey, I got 500,000 votes. I think it was about 550,000 votes. Give or take
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:22.200]  a few thou. You wouldn't get five votes. At least I got 500,000. You would get zero. You've got
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:26.040]  nobody on your side. You know, the men don't like you anymore. They think everything you say is
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:30.120]  stupid. And the women never liked you and always thought you were sexist. You made some of the
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:35.800]  most anti gay, anti women, anti black racist comments in the history of the world. If anyone
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:40.360]  ever goes back to look at and listen to what you said, you'd be canceled out by this culture.
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:45.000]  Anyway, the very people you're now appealing to makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Howard Stern,
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:49.800]  I challenge you anytime. Mano Mano, you and me, we'll be right back. Wayne on the route,

[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:06.840]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way,
[3:17:06.840 --> 3:17:09.180]  pray to God but row away from the rocks.
[3:17:09.180 --> 3:17:11.300]  If your boat is going towards the rocks,
[3:17:11.300 --> 3:17:13.680]  pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed.
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:15.480]  Also, try to row away.
[3:17:15.480 --> 3:17:16.940]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish.
[3:17:16.940 --> 3:17:19.120]  And it's the same thing with our immune system.

[3:17:47.560 --> 3:17:50.680]  So the ultimate sale will probably be over just a few days.

[3:17:59.780 --> 3:18:03.180]  is a few years of hard times for us all.
[3:18:03.180 --> 3:18:05.160]  And if we don't turn it around soon,
[3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:07.440]  then it will only get worse.
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:11.840]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[3:18:11.840 --> 3:18:14.760]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.

[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:24.840]  And having your own food will save you
[3:18:24.840 --> 3:18:28.160]  from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.

[3:18:39.480 --> 3:18:42.480]  but you can help them by having an abundance

[3:18:56.200 --> 3:18:59.560]  The internet and talk radio are on fire
[3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:01.720]  with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[3:19:01.720 --> 3:19:03.800]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[3:19:03.800 --> 3:19:05.400]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:07.640]  because I knew this was coming.
[3:19:07.640 --> 3:19:11.600]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:14.080]  is gonna become more important than ever
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:16.840]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore
[3:19:16.840 --> 3:19:19.320]  in policy reports and documents.
[3:19:19.320 --> 3:19:21.080]  It's now out in the open.
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:25.160]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:27.520]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:30.600]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:31.680]  They're making their move
[3:19:31.680 --> 3:19:33.800]  because they know they're behind schedule.
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:34.720]  We're gonna win this thing.
[3:19:34.720 --> 3:19:37.080]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:38.600]  I just wanna thank the viewers and listeners
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:40.480]  for your word of mouth and your prayer
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:41.440]  and your financial support
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:44.120]  because without you, info wars would not be here.
[3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:46.000]  So I want you to really internalize the fact
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:47.840]  that you are the info war
[3:19:47.840 --> 3:19:50.560]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:52.560]  So I wanna thank you and salute you again
[3:19:52.560 --> 3:19:56.080]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:00.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:20:00.240 --> 3:20:07.720]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.720 --> 3:20:11.720]  One, two, three.
[3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:13.480]  Wait on the route, I am back.
[3:20:13.480 --> 3:20:14.960]  Yes, host of the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:16.400]  Come on, Stern.
[3:20:16.400 --> 3:20:17.960]  Come on, Howard Stern.
[3:20:17.960 --> 3:20:19.200]  Wait on the route, it's waiting for you.
[3:20:19.200 --> 3:20:20.280]  Come on, baby.
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:21.960]  Let's go, let's go.
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:24.040]  Root and Stern, one on one.
[3:20:24.040 --> 3:20:25.840]  No, I was his biggest fan
[3:20:25.840 --> 3:20:27.720]  and I do think he's a schmuck now
[3:20:27.720 --> 3:20:28.720]  and he's gone Hollywood
[3:20:28.720 --> 3:20:30.840]  and he's a liberal schmuck and putts
[3:20:30.840 --> 3:20:32.000]  and he's ruined his career
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:32.840]  and nobody listens to him.
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:35.080]  He's a husband, just like Pink.
[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:36.600]  Pink's another husband.
[3:20:36.600 --> 3:20:38.400]  When was the last time she was on the air?
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:39.360]  What did she say the other day?
[3:20:39.360 --> 3:20:42.760]  If you're my fan and you believe in Roe Pierce's wade
[3:20:42.760 --> 3:20:44.520]  and you believe the government should be inside
[3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:46.560]  a woman's choice of a woman's body,
[3:20:46.560 --> 3:20:48.200]  go to hell and go f yourself.
[3:20:48.200 --> 3:20:50.040]  I don't want you to listen to me anymore.
[3:20:50.040 --> 3:20:53.760]  This is what you're dealing with, mental illness, you know?
[3:20:53.760 --> 3:20:55.600]  I don't know if Stern is mentally ill.
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:20:58.680]  What Stern is is delusional and naive
[3:20:58.680 --> 3:21:00.240]  and of course his balls have been cut off
[3:21:00.240 --> 3:21:03.040]  by his gorgeous blonde actress wife.
[3:21:03.040 --> 3:21:04.000]  But you know, thank God,
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:06.720]  I've got a gorgeous blonde wife as well
[3:21:06.720 --> 3:21:08.040]  who I just married last November
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:11.600]  and she's a raving conservative Texas gun shooter.
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:15.620]  And so I got the right kind of gorgeous blonde wife, Howard.
[3:21:15.620 --> 3:21:16.920]  You got the wrong kind, man.
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:21.920]  Hollywood liberal women are just clueless, clueless.
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:23.760]  The rest of the world doesn't listen to a word they say.
[3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:25.680]  Unfortunately, you gotta be in bed with her every night
[3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:26.640]  so you have to listen.
[3:21:26.640 --> 3:21:28.000]  And that's what happened, Howard Stern.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:29.480]  There it is in a nutshell.
[3:21:29.480 --> 3:21:31.080]  Let's talk about some other issues
[3:21:31.080 --> 3:21:32.400]  going on in the world today.
[3:21:33.400 --> 3:21:34.800]  So you know a truck was found.
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:37.920]  The death toll is now up to 50 illegal aliens
[3:21:37.920 --> 3:21:40.040]  in Texas near San Antonio.
[3:21:40.040 --> 3:21:42.520]  They cooked to death in a truck.
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:46.360]  Now as a Jew, I wanna say this reminds me of the Holocaust.
[3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:49.000]  It reminds me of Jews being gassed
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:51.640]  in the gas houses of the Holocaust.
[3:21:51.640 --> 3:21:55.280]  And the fact that the news media is not blaming Biden,
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:21:59.360]  this only happened because Biden left the border open.
[3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:01.360]  And Biden has a deal in my opinion,
[3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:04.520]  a dirty deal with the Mexican drug cartels.
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:06.600]  They're paying for all the Democrat candidates.
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:09.320]  They're giving offshore money to offshore bank accounts.
[3:22:09.320 --> 3:22:10.720]  Democrats are getting rich.
[3:22:10.720 --> 3:22:13.340]  They're funding Democrat campaigns in the open.
[3:22:13.340 --> 3:22:16.320]  The drug cartels have billions and billions of dollars
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:20.240]  coming in a day, not a year, a day.
[3:22:20.240 --> 3:22:22.480]  And we now have the most open, lawless border
[3:22:22.480 --> 3:22:23.680]  in the history of the world.
[3:22:23.680 --> 3:22:25.880]  And I'm telling you, someone's got a piece of it.
[3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:28.800]  And the Mexican drug cartels, smart businessmen like me,
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:32.560]  every business I'm in, I give a 10% finders fee
[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:35.440]  to anybody who makes me rich, you deserve 10%.
[3:22:35.440 --> 3:22:36.480]  So guess what?
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:39.000]  They're giving 10% of their billions per day
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:41.880]  to the Biden crime family and the Clinton crime family
[3:22:41.880 --> 3:22:45.120]  and the Obama crime family and the John Kerry crime family
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:47.820]  and all the Democrat senators and congressmen
[3:22:47.820 --> 3:22:50.440]  who make this open border possible.
[3:22:50.440 --> 3:22:51.720]  This is a joke.
[3:22:51.720 --> 3:22:54.080]  The two biggest jokes in America today,
[3:22:54.080 --> 3:22:57.000]  travesties that should be on Saturday Night Live
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:22:58.840]  would be who in their right mind
[3:22:58.840 --> 3:23:00.320]  would allow the border to be open,
[3:23:00.320 --> 3:23:01.860]  would want the border to be open,
[3:23:01.860 --> 3:23:03.960]  would want to encourage all of you to come in.
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:05.840]  Who in their right mind would be a traffic cop,
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:07.720]  a school crossing guard and say,
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:10.760]  look, there's millions of illegals, dirt poor,
[3:23:10.760 --> 3:23:12.460]  who want to bankrupt America.
[3:23:12.460 --> 3:23:14.940]  Many of them criminals let out of the worst prisons
[3:23:14.940 --> 3:23:17.320]  around the world, many of them with diseases,
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:19.860]  many of them with COVID and they're gonna come on in,
[3:23:19.860 --> 3:23:21.920]  let's let them in, let's wave them all in
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:24.600]  and some of them will die in sweltering,
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:27.840]  horrible heat like a sauna, 130 degrees
[3:23:27.840 --> 3:23:30.360]  and they suffocate inside a truck
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:34.760]  like the Holocaust and my Jewish people being gassed.
[3:23:34.760 --> 3:23:37.280]  It's disgusting, it's horrifying
[3:23:37.280 --> 3:23:39.200]  and someone's gotta take the blame
[3:23:39.200 --> 3:23:42.200]  and the blame should go to the Mexican drug cartel
[3:23:42.200 --> 3:23:44.560]  and the madman who leaves our border open
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:46.880]  that allows all this and encourages all this
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:50.520]  and empowers all this, Joe Biden and the Biden crime family
[3:23:50.520 --> 3:23:54.360]  and the Democrat party, the blame falls squarely
[3:23:54.360 --> 3:23:56.280]  at your feet and he doesn't want to take the blame,
[3:23:56.280 --> 3:23:58.720]  well, he should take the blame, it's your fault.
[3:23:58.720 --> 3:24:00.720]  All right, onto some more topics
[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:04.120]  as I talk about Joe Biden, this story is out,
[3:24:04.120 --> 3:24:09.120]  the Biden economy, durable goods orders stagnate
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:15.080]  and a manufacturing index drops far below expectations.
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:17.600]  All right, we got it with the border boys, we got it.
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:19.440]  Let's move on to the next topic,
[3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:22.400]  enough with the border b-roll, it's Biden's fault,
[3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:25.940]  it's Biden's border and Biden should take responsibility
[3:24:25.940 --> 3:24:28.160]  but it's Biden's economy too,
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:30.200]  Trump was president almost two years ago,
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:31.440]  it's got nothing to do with Trump,
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:32.720]  he had four of the greatest years
[3:24:32.720 --> 3:24:35.840]  in the history of America until with the one exception
[3:24:35.840 --> 3:24:38.640]  of the COVID nightmare pandemic began,
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:41.160]  right at the moment he won the trade war with China,
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:43.200]  you think that's a coincidence,
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:45.600]  at that exact moment he won the trade war,
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:48.600]  all of a sudden COVID came to America from China
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:50.240]  and they ruined the American economy
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:51.400]  and put millions out of work
[3:24:51.400 --> 3:24:53.000]  and destroyed millions of businesses,
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.800]  up until then the greatest economy maybe ever
[3:24:55.800 --> 3:24:57.360]  in the history of the United States,
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:24:59.400]  certainly one of the two greatest in modern history
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:02.640]  with Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump
[3:25:02.640 --> 3:25:04.680]  and now the economy is collapsing,
[3:25:04.680 --> 3:25:08.840]  durable goods orders stagnate, manufacturing index drops
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:13.560]  way below expectations, US manufacturing PMI
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:17.520]  fell dramatically from 57 to 52.4,
[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:21.720]  this drop well below market expectations of 56
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:24.000]  and now points to the slowest growth
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  and the steepest drop in factory activity in many years,
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:31.200]  the economy is being destroyed,
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:33.960]  at the same time that's happening Goldman Sachs
[3:25:33.960 --> 3:25:37.720]  finally admits large cuts to earnings are imminent,
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:39.360]  all the companies are doing great,
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:43.280]  that was left over from the Trump wonderful economy
[3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:46.760]  but they're all about to announce terrible earnings cuts,
[3:25:46.760 --> 3:25:49.120]  not says Wayne Root says Goldman Sachs
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:54.040]  and the Exxon CEO warns that consumers will pay
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:25:57.360]  for this hasty energy transition.
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:00.560]  In other words, Joe Biden has admitted now twice,
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:03.640]  maybe even three times in the last month,
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:06.960]  remember he's a brain dead zombie puppet with dementia
[3:26:06.960 --> 3:26:07.960]  who doesn't know what he's saying,
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:10.160]  dribbles on himself who probably wears diapers
[3:26:10.160 --> 3:26:12.280]  and gets his poo poo change in the basement
[3:26:12.280 --> 3:26:14.600]  by his wife who he thinks is his sister
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:17.000]  and so Joe Biden doesn't even know what he's saying anymore
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  when you have dementia, you have diarrhea in the mouth
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:23.440]  and you very often say things that you would never admit
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:27.240]  or never say in public if you were a smart polished politician
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:31.480]  but dementia takes away all that wall of fear
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:33.840]  and you're able to say whatever comes to mind
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:37.600]  and Biden has admitted several times in the last month
[3:26:37.600 --> 3:26:41.480]  that this is good, inflation with gas is good
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:44.040]  because it'll get people off of gasoline
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:48.240]  and off of fossil fuel and get us to the next stage
[3:26:48.240 --> 3:26:50.600]  of the American economy, that's literally
[3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:54.640]  what Joe Biden said, what did Hitler once say?
[3:26:54.640 --> 3:26:56.280]  And I'm not comparing Biden to Hitler,
[3:26:56.280 --> 3:26:58.040]  I'm not making that comparison, I'm a Jew
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:00.720]  and I understand that he's not in charge of the Holocaust
[3:27:00.720 --> 3:27:04.040]  but I will say that Hitler once said that,
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:06.880]  what was it, I think I missed my point,
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:09.360]  I've got so much on my mind, oh, Hitler once said
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:11.720]  I'm gonna kill all the Jews and nobody believed him
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:15.200]  and he killed all the Jews, when Biden says out loud
[3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:18.760]  that I'm making a transition on purpose with inflation
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:20.600]  to get you off of fossil fuels
[3:27:20.600 --> 3:27:23.320]  and stop you from using gasoline in your car,
[3:27:23.320 --> 3:27:26.080]  you should believe him, just like my Jewish people
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:29.040]  should have believed it, my grandparents were smart,
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:31.720]  they got out, they came to America
[3:27:31.720 --> 3:27:35.320]  before Hitler started the Holocaust, smart people
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:38.840]  and a lot of people just didn't believe it would ever happen.
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:43.000]  I'm telling you, this man, Biden, is telegraphing
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:44.720]  what the people behind him,
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:46.400]  cause he's incapable of doing anything,
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:50.200]  what his handlers are promising him that they're doing,
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:52.440]  which is getting us all off of fossil fuel.
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:56.240]  And even Bill Maher, one of the great liberal
[3:27:56.240 --> 3:27:59.000]  commentators in America, but one with common sense,
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:01.960]  said the other day that Joe Biden's made a tragic mistake,
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:04.440]  he's in such a hurry to get us off of fossil fuel,
[3:28:04.440 --> 3:28:07.920]  but there is no other product waiting on the other side,
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:10.560]  there is no transition product.
[3:28:10.560 --> 3:28:14.120]  If you had something waiting, that worked, that might be okay,
[3:28:14.120 --> 3:28:16.000]  but if you get rid of coal, you get rid of fracking,
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:19.240]  you get rid of oil, you get rid of everything that works,
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:22.640]  you get rid of nuclear, liberals don't want nuclear either,
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:25.120]  nuclear is the only answer if you replace fossil fuel,
[3:28:25.120 --> 3:28:27.080]  but if you get rid of all of that,
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:29.240]  and there's nothing waiting on the other side,
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:32.240]  but pathetic green energy that fails every time
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:34.640]  and costs so much more than fossil fuel,
[3:28:34.640 --> 3:28:37.280]  at that point, you bankrupt the United States
[3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:38.680]  and you collapse your economy,
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:40.520]  and that's just what China wants,
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:42.200]  and who does China own?
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:44.360]  China owns the Biden crime family,
[3:28:44.360 --> 3:28:47.120]  and Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, there it is,
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:49.080]  it all makes sense now, Wayne Alleroot,

[3:31:43.280 --> 3:31:45.200]  whether you need this or not, you need it.
[3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:47.440]  Before it was just a backup plan and insurance,
[3:31:47.440 --> 3:31:49.560]  this is an insurance, this is survival.

[3:31:56.200 --> 3:31:57.600]  There's an old bed of one saying
[3:31:57.600 --> 3:32:01.240]  that's thousands of years old, and it goes like this.
[3:32:01.240 --> 3:32:04.320]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[3:32:04.320 --> 3:32:06.160]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way,
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:08.520]  pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:10.640]  If your boat is going towards the rocks,
[3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:13.000]  pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed,
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:14.880]  but also try to row away.
[3:32:14.880 --> 3:32:16.320]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish,
[3:32:16.320 --> 3:32:18.480]  and it's the same thing with our immune system.

[3:32:56.920 --> 3:32:59.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:32:59.760 --> 3:33:03.320]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:09.320]  Welcome back to the show, Alex Jones show, guest hosting.
[3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:11.160]  Again, on Tuesdays, it's 12 noon, I do that,
[3:33:11.160 --> 3:33:12.960]  although I will be off next Tuesday.
[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:14.760]  I'm taking a very well earned vacation,
[3:33:14.760 --> 3:33:17.760]  my first actual vacation since my honeymoon,
[3:33:17.760 --> 3:33:20.160]  and only my second vacation since last summer,
[3:33:20.160 --> 3:33:23.160]  and I cannot wait, I cannot wait to get out of the Vegas heat
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:25.360]  and get to a beautiful place that's cool,
[3:33:25.360 --> 3:33:27.560]  and I'm not going to be able to get out of the Vegas heat
[3:33:27.560 --> 3:33:29.560]  and get to a beautiful place that's cool,
[3:33:29.560 --> 3:33:31.960]  and I'm not going to be able to get out of the Vegas heat
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:33.600]  and get to a beautiful place that's cool,
[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:35.280]  and I'll miss my one Tuesday,
[3:33:35.280 --> 3:33:37.480]  and then I'll be right back with you the following Tuesday,
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:40.520]  but I heard Alex Jones in a commercial just now,
[3:33:40.520 --> 3:33:42.240]  commercial for vitamins,
[3:33:42.240 --> 3:33:44.160]  talking about God helps those who help themselves.
[3:33:44.160 --> 3:33:47.160]  You know, I love Alex, and that's my favorite saying.
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:48.960]  I didn't know Alex loves that saying too,
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:50.720]  God helps those who help themselves.
[3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:52.480]  I gotta tell you a funny joke that I always thought
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:54.720]  was one of my favorite jokes of all time.
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:56.480]  You know, the flood waters are rising,
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:58.280]  and a guy is running for his life,
[3:33:58.280 --> 3:33:59.920]  and he's going higher and higher and higher,
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:02.040]  finally gets to the top of a 20-story building,
[3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:05.000]  and it keeps rising, the floods rising, rising,
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:06.920]  and he keeps saying, don't worry about me,
[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:08.600]  God's going to save me, everything will be okay,
[3:34:08.600 --> 3:34:11.240]  he's praying on his knees, God save me, God save me,
[3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:13.000]  I know it'll be okay, you're going to save me,
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:14.800]  and a guy comes along in a rowboat,
[3:34:14.800 --> 3:34:16.160]  and he says, come on in, I'll save you,
[3:34:16.160 --> 3:34:17.440]  and he says, no, I'm waiting for God,
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:19.480]  don't worry about me, God'll save me.
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:21.760]  Second guy comes in a rowboat the next day,
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:23.880]  and he says, don't worry about me, God will save me,
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:25.960]  I don't need your rowboat, third guy comes in a rowboat,
[3:34:25.960 --> 3:34:28.680]  third day, he says, don't worry about me, you go,
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:30.560]  I don't need a rowboat, God will save me,
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:32.720]  on the fourth day, the flood waters get higher,
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:34.800]  and he drowns, and he gets up to heaven,
[3:34:34.800 --> 3:34:37.480]  he says, God, where were you, why didn't you save me,
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:40.960]  and God says, a schmuck, I sent you three rowboats,
[3:34:40.960 --> 3:34:43.920]  and I've always thought, that's one of the best
[3:34:43.920 --> 3:34:47.520]  jokes of all time, and so true, you like that, bizarre,
[3:34:47.520 --> 3:34:51.560]  and so true, because I think it applies to America,
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:55.160]  America is going under, we're in economic collapse soon,
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:34:58.360]  we're in food collapse, we're in border collapse,
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:01.120]  we're in energy collapse, it's a disaster,
[3:35:01.120 --> 3:35:04.000]  supply chain collapse, I believe because of the vaccines,
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:06.040]  we'll soon be in military collapse,
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:09.680]  the soldiers will all be dead in sick bay, quit, fired,
[3:35:09.680 --> 3:35:11.840]  you name it, we're in pilot collapse,
[3:35:11.840 --> 3:35:14.760]  look at the travel delays and cancellations every day,
[3:35:14.760 --> 3:35:17.320]  and especially on weekends, and especially on holidays,
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:19.440]  wait till you see coming up on July 4th,
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:22.240]  nightmares because of the vaccine,
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:25.160]  and so, and we're in health collapse because of the vaccine,
[3:35:25.160 --> 3:35:28.520]  and so people say to me, don't worry Wayne, God's got us,
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:32.560]  God will save America, maybe God is sending you rowboats,
[3:35:32.560 --> 3:35:34.240]  maybe the rowboats, Wayne Root,
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:35.640]  maybe the rowboats, Donald Trump,
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:37.320]  maybe the rowboats, Alex Jones,
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:40.160]  maybe the rowboat is Ron DeSantis,
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:42.080]  Governor DeSantis of Florida,
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:45.560]  but in the end, God works through people,
[3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:49.040]  God wants you to take it into your hands,
[3:35:49.040 --> 3:35:52.600]  and have some balls, and fight for this country,
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:56.600]  don't sit back and go to church and say I'm waiting for God
[3:35:56.600 --> 3:35:59.480]  to save it, because maybe God sent you
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:03.080]  some people who can save it if you get behind them,
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:05.000]  you don't sit around and wait,
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:06.520]  you know, it's like the guy in the middle of the road,
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:09.440]  he says, don't worry as the traffic whizzes by,
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  God will save me, God's not gonna let me get hit by a car,
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:14.720]  and the next thing you know, a car smashes him,
[3:36:14.720 --> 3:36:16.200]  and he's a pancake, you know,
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:17.800]  because God, if you meet him in heaven,
[3:36:17.800 --> 3:36:20.200]  you know what he'd say, why don't you move your legs
[3:36:20.200 --> 3:36:22.520]  and get to the other side of the road, you idiot,
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:24.320]  same thing as that roadboat story,
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:27.640]  we are responsible for our own lives,
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:30.280]  God helps those who help themselves,
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:33.240]  God works through all of us, I'm a Jew to Christ,
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:35.960]  as my savior 32 years ago, I believe very strongly
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:38.440]  in my savior and God, Jesus Christ,
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:41.480]  but I also believe he works through me and you,
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:44.040]  and God didn't save us in World War II,
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:46.320]  we saved us in World War II,
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:49.000]  George S. Patton, who was a son of a, you know what,
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:50.720]  saved us in World War II,
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:54.360]  vicious generals saved us in World War II,
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:36:56.160]  God was working through them,
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:58.800]  and who saved us for the four years before Biden,
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:02.040]  from the disaster of eight years of Obama,
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:03.920]  and the disaster of what should have been,
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:05.920]  and could have been four years of Hillary,
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:08.640]  finishing the job and destroying America once and for all,
[3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:10.360]  who saved us Donald Trump,
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:12.520]  Donald Trump's a bit of a barbarian,
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:14.680]  you don't like his tweets, they're too vicious,
[3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:16.760]  look at the Bible, the Bible's filled
[3:37:16.760 --> 3:37:19.640]  with vicious people sent by God to save us
[3:37:19.640 --> 3:37:22.400]  and to save the Jews, they're not nice guys,
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:24.560]  they kill people, they smite people,
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:29.560]  Donald Trump was a barbarian sent by God to save us,
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:30.960]  you don't wait around for God,
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:33.960]  God sends people with his message,
[3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:35.880]  so there are people you need to follow.
[3:37:35.880 --> 3:37:38.080]  Now, I wrote a book by the way,
[3:37:38.080 --> 3:37:39.520]  I wanna mention it real quick,
[3:37:39.520 --> 3:37:42.000]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book,
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.480]  you can get it at Amazon, Barnes & Noble,
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:46.280]  or you can go to my website and learn more as well,
[3:37:46.280 --> 3:37:50.680]  rootforamerica.com, R-O-O-T, rootforamerica.com,
[3:37:50.680 --> 3:37:52.520]  you can find my national radio show
[3:37:52.520 --> 3:37:54.520]  at rootforamerica.com as well,
[3:37:54.520 --> 3:37:56.520]  there's my site up on the screen,
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:37:59.840]  my book gives you the power, the ability,
[3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:03.520]  the wherewithal, it empowers you to take down
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:07.320]  all the woke up, woke companies and the woke CEOs
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:09.680]  on your own, you're not waiting for God,
[3:38:09.680 --> 3:38:13.080]  God's working through you, God gives you the strength
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:15.800]  and the power and the relentlessness
[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:20.400]  and the tenacity to fight, and the energy to fight,
[3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:21.760]  look at me, I'm a high energy guy,
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:23.320]  right, energy through the roof,
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:25.360]  I give the credit to God, God gave me the energy,
[3:38:25.360 --> 3:38:27.880]  but now he expects me to do the fighting
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:29.320]  and to lead with that energy,
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:31.120]  and this book is one of the ways I lead,
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:33.960]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book
[3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:36.280]  is a way to use civil disobedience
[3:38:36.280 --> 3:38:38.320]  to go after the companies and scare them
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:40.680]  and intimidate them and shake them
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:42.240]  and make them come to their senses
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:45.240]  and stop supporting programs, policies
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:47.080]  that destroy the United States of America.
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:50.280]  Now there's, I think there's 54 companies that have announced
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:52.280]  they're willing to pay for their employees
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:54.440]  to have abortions, to leave the state
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:57.280]  and go to another state if their state doesn't allow it
[3:38:57.280 --> 3:39:00.080]  and they'll pay for the trip and the travel expenses
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:03.120]  and the actual abortion itself, how disgusting.
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:04.960]  It's none of their business to do that,
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:07.200]  it's disgusting that they're participating
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:09.960]  in the personal murder of their employees' baby.
[3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:12.440]  So we've gotta shut these companies down,
[3:39:12.440 --> 3:39:15.080]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book shows you
[3:39:15.080 --> 3:39:18.000]  how it gives you their names, phone numbers, emails,
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.680]  social media accounts, you can actually go after them.
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:22.160]  So we're gonna make sure you knew that.
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:26.000]  I also mentioned on this show a while back,
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:27.880]  and I think again last week,
[3:39:27.880 --> 3:39:31.480]  my idea that America needs to separate,
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:34.680]  we need a divorce, I don't wanna call it a secession
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:36.720]  because of course liberals will say,
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:39.400]  Wayne Roots advocating for civil war,
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:41.960]  secessions like the North against the South
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:44.000]  will know actually it's liberals
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:45.760]  that desperately wanna civil war.
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:47.840]  As a matter of fact, the funniest part of this week
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:49.560]  is after Roe versus Wade,
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:51.600]  did you see the reaction of liberals?
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:53.400]  They're burning, they're fire bombing,
[3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:54.920]  they're destroying churches,
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:39:57.160]  they're going after Supreme Court nominees,
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:39:58.160]  they'd like to see them dead,
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:39:59.840]  they'd like to destroy the Supreme Court,
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:01.760]  they'd like to burn their houses to the ground,
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:04.320]  they're burning pro-life pregnancy centers,
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:06.000]  they're screaming epitaphs,
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.960]  they're wearing shirts that say I love to murder babies,
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:11.560]  they're walking around with flamethrowers in Los Angeles,
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:12.720]  getting arrested by the police
[3:40:12.720 --> 3:40:14.640]  while threatening police with a flamethrower.
[3:40:14.640 --> 3:40:18.240]  They're all crazy and I believe possessed by the devil,
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:19.520]  I really do believe.
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:23.360]  Remember, their favorite book, Rules for Radicals
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:25.680]  by Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals,
[3:40:25.680 --> 3:40:28.160]  and if you open the book, it's the liberal playbook,
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.360]  they all use it and it's dedicated to the devil Lucifer.
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:34.360]  They are all with the devil, they're crazy people,
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:37.240]  and everything they want is the destruction of America
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:39.880]  and the murder of babies, they wanna murder babies
[3:40:39.880 --> 3:40:42.160]  by opening the border and letting pedophiles in,
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:44.400]  they wanna murder babies by forcing them
[3:40:44.400 --> 3:40:46.240]  to take COVID vaccines,
[3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:48.720]  they wanna make the lightest possible sentences
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:50.640]  for pedophiles like the most recent
[3:40:50.640 --> 3:40:53.680]  Democrat, liberal, Supreme Court justice who said,
[3:40:53.680 --> 3:40:55.440]  she doesn't even know the definition of a woman,
[3:40:55.440 --> 3:40:57.800]  and in her 10 cases with pedophiles,
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:40:59.960]  she gives them the lightest possible sentences,
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:03.480]  their whole life is destroying children and destroying life.
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:05.080]  These people are, oh, and don't forget,
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:07.040]  with abortion they wanna kill a baby
[3:41:07.040 --> 3:41:10.280]  till the moment of birth or beyond the moment of birth.
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:13.400]  They're the ones who have a war against women,
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:16.480]  after all, half of all babies are female babies,
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:19.800]  so they're killing women, and of course, don't forget,
[3:41:19.800 --> 3:41:22.360]  there's a tampon shortage in the United States of America,
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:24.520]  thank you Joe Biden, the war on women,
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:27.240]  don't forget that they want men posing as women
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:29.560]  to be in women's bathrooms, women's locker rooms,
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:31.520]  your daughter's motel room on the road,
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:33.360]  as she plays in our sports event,
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:35.080]  they want them to take your daughter's place
[3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:37.360]  and take a reward away and take her scholarship away,
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:39.000]  there's your war against women,
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:41.320]  but I did say the answer is divorce,
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:45.200]  not secession, divorce, every state needs to go,
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:47.520]  red states one way, blue states the other,
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:50.040]  we can't stand you anymore, we can't take you anymore,
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:51.480]  we want nothing to do with you anymore,
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:53.400]  I'm not listening to your orders anymore,
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:41:58.040]  and sure enough, NBC News has a story out
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:01.320]  that the Roe versus Wade decision,
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:04.080]  the war between the states over abortion
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:08.400]  will create a kind of secession in the United States
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:11.800]  of America, a division of blue versus red,
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:14.880]  just as I predicted and just as I said on my show,
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:16.960]  right after the Roe v. Wade decision,
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:21.520]  I said this will further push liberals to leave red states
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:23.600]  and conservatives to leave blue states,
[3:42:23.600 --> 3:42:25.400]  and this country will be further divided
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:28.600]  and we will have basically a secession,
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:31.240]  which I call a divorce, a separation
[3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:32.960]  of the United States of America,
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:35.000]  the actual title of the article by NBC,
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:36.840]  there's another war between the states
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:40.760]  coming over abortion before the Civil War,
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:43.520]  northern and southern states did battle over slaves,
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:46.120]  once again, something legal in one state is illegal
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:49.520]  in a state next door, this is the coming divorce
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:52.400]  that I predicted, Wayne Allyn Root, we'll be right back.
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:42:59.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months,
[3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:01.640]  we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[3:43:01.640 --> 3:43:04.160]  and hit humanity extremely hard,
[3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:07.840]  it is beyond critical that everyone listening

[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:12.800]  and your families to the greatest extent possible,
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:14.720]  and these two new sales do that.

[3:43:55.840 --> 3:44:00.760]  If I had to describe with just one word,
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:04.880]  the brainwashing, the mind control,
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:09.880]  the asleep prince that the general public is in,
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:14.560]  the best word would actually be the people are lost,
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:18.400]  just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare,
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:19.920]  you're in a horror, you get knocked out
[3:44:19.920 --> 3:44:22.440]  and you've lost your bearings
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:27.440]  because you are totally dizzy and confused,
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:28.960]  you have a concussion,
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:30.240]  and that's what the globalists have done,
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:32.840]  they have stunned us, they have put us
[3:44:32.840 --> 3:44:35.520]  into a position of not knowing our bearings,
[3:44:35.520 --> 3:44:37.080]  and then Klaus Schwab recently came out
[3:44:37.080 --> 3:44:39.480]  and gave him speech, he called the great new narrative,
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:41.760]  where he brags how the public is lost,
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:44.560]  how the culture in the media has been driven
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:46.280]  to make sure the people are all alone,
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:44:49.360]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff,
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:51.000]  that's what the great reset is,
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:52.640]  they need darkness to thrive,
[3:44:52.640 --> 3:44:55.480]  the light lives at nfowars.com.
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:44:59.800]  The internet and talk radio are on fire
[3:44:59.800 --> 3:45:01.960]  with the slogan, Alex Jones was right,
[3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:04.080]  people ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:05.640]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling
[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:09.400]  because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it,
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:11.840]  and now everything I've talked about
[3:45:11.840 --> 3:45:14.320]  is gonna become more important than ever
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:17.080]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore
[3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:19.560]  in policy reports and documents,
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:22.960]  it's now out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:25.440]  that they rule the earth,
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:27.800]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group,
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:30.880]  so now the fight's out in the open,
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:31.960]  they're making their move
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:34.080]  because they know they're behind schedule,
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:35.000]  we're gonna win this thing,
[3:45:35.000 --> 3:45:37.360]  God's watching, the children are counting on us,
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:38.880]  I just wanna thank the viewers and listeners
[3:45:38.880 --> 3:45:40.760]  for your word of mouth and your prayer
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:41.720]  and your financial support,
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:44.400]  because without you, info wars would not be here,
[3:45:44.400 --> 3:45:46.280]  I just want you to really internalize the fact
[3:45:46.280 --> 3:45:48.120]  that you are the info war,
[3:45:48.120 --> 3:45:50.840]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance,
[3:45:50.840 --> 3:45:52.840]  so I wanna thank you and salute you again
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:56.400]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:45:59.640]  Look at that, everybody else is just like yellow or clear,
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:01.080]  that's because it's been denayed here,
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:03.280]  it's been worked out, we didn't do that.
[3:46:04.640 --> 3:46:06.760]  You think I would metaphysically
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:09.160]  tell you something, this is the very best I can get,
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:11.320]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[3:46:11.320 --> 3:46:14.360]  I will only give you the maximum best info,
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:16.840]  the maximum truth, the maximum product,
[3:46:16.840 --> 3:46:20.440]  because I want that good will.
[3:46:20.440 --> 3:46:22.200]  What I do to you, I do to myself,
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:24.000]  don't you get the big secret?
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:26.520]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[3:46:26.520 --> 3:46:28.360]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:30.560]  And this little jewel right here,
[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:35.560]  is solid liquid consciousness.
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:41.000]  Look it up, find out
[3:46:42.920 --> 3:46:44.720]  how even the FDA and the government
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:46.400]  had met some fish oil is incredible.
[3:46:46.400 --> 3:46:49.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:51.720]  is take the fish oil or krill oil,
[3:46:51.720 --> 3:46:53.200]  just like our information's dynamite,
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:55.120]  so are our products in 4store.com.
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:01.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:03.740]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:13.680]  All right, Wayne Alleroot, welcome back to the show,
[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:16.120]  otherwise known as War, Wayne Alleroot, get it?
[3:47:16.120 --> 3:47:18.960]  And that's my real birth name, Wayne Alleroot.
[3:47:18.960 --> 3:47:21.240]  I was born from the day I was born,
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:23.320]  and I believe we're at war right now.
[3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:24.840]  And I'm trying to avoid a civil war,
[3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:26.640]  don't let any liberals take my words
[3:47:26.640 --> 3:47:29.160]  and misuse them and take them out of context.
[3:47:29.160 --> 3:47:31.400]  I'm trying to not espouse violence,
[3:47:31.400 --> 3:47:33.280]  I'm trying to avoid a revolution,
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:36.760]  I'm trying to avoid a civil war with my idea for a divorce,
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:39.360]  a national separation, right versus left.
[3:47:39.360 --> 3:47:41.400]  And NBC News agrees with me,
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:43.480]  they've not come out and said it's clear
[3:47:43.480 --> 3:47:46.160]  that we're dividing a nation so badly
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:47.600]  that it can't be put back together
[3:47:47.600 --> 3:47:49.760]  and it's right against left and it's state against state.
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:52.080]  It's happening, and so why not embrace it?
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:47:53.000]  Why go against it?
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:54.760]  There's no reason why I have to listen
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:56.480]  to all the liberal claptrap
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:00.520]  and the communist ideology of the Chinese communist state
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:02.960]  of California, I don't need to listen to that anymore.
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:05.280]  And they don't have to be with me and be a conservative.
[3:48:05.280 --> 3:48:06.760]  They can go their way, I'll go my way,
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:07.960]  it's time for a division.
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:10.280]  You might call it the capitalist states of America,
[3:48:10.280 --> 3:48:12.840]  you might call it the patriot states of America,
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:15.320]  you might call it the socialist states of America.
[3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:17.480]  On the other side, there's gonna be some sort
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:20.000]  of a division coming, there's gonna be no other choice
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:22.280]  if you want to avoid violence and a civil war.
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:24.640]  And I want to avoid violence and a civil war.
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:26.980]  I don't want brother against brother in the streets,
[3:48:26.980 --> 3:48:28.200]  I really don't.
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:32.320]  So many wonderful emails coming from all of you.
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:34.080]  When I say wainroute at gmail.com,
[3:48:34.080 --> 3:48:34.920]  I love to hear from you.
[3:48:34.920 --> 3:48:38.520]  So many wonderful emails, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:40.840]  I appreciate it, I got a special one.
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:44.160]  I want to reach you, David, David says, hi Wayne,
[3:48:44.160 --> 3:48:45.560]  I'm always excited on Tuesdays
[3:48:45.560 --> 3:48:47.340]  because I know you're on the fourth hour.
[3:48:47.340 --> 3:48:49.240]  Never before have I heard anyone speak
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:52.400]  and I agree with every single word, that's you.
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:55.080]  Wayne, I agree with your every word the week before last,
[3:48:55.080 --> 3:48:57.440]  when you said we're not gonna make it to 2024,
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:48:58.680]  I totally agree.
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:49:01.580]  Having the real president of the United States, Donald Trump,
[3:49:01.580 --> 3:49:04.440]  as speaker of the house is your best idea.
[3:49:04.440 --> 3:49:06.780]  He should impeach and try them all.
[3:49:06.780 --> 3:49:08.160]  Please keep up the great work,
[3:49:08.160 --> 3:49:09.680]  please tell the real president,
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:11.920]  he must come out and say he was lied to
[3:49:11.920 --> 3:49:14.320]  and the shots are lethal injections.
[3:49:14.320 --> 3:49:15.520]  Also, we still love him.
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:18.680]  Tell him, thank you for overturning Roe versus Wade,
[3:49:18.680 --> 3:49:21.440]  just like you said you would in 2016.
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:24.400]  The Roeboat analogy spot on, I'm gonna buy your book,
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:25.520]  I love you brother, David.
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:28.420]  So great stuff, thank you, David, really appreciate it.
[3:49:28.420 --> 3:49:32.040]  Very nice, very nice, love my fans.
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:34.400]  I want to read you a couple things
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:36.560]  and then I'll close the show with one more reminder
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:40.340]  of my message and my challenge to Howard Stern.
[3:49:40.340 --> 3:49:43.160]  Come on Stern, I'm waiting for you anytime, anywhere.
[3:49:43.160 --> 3:49:44.940]  I'll take you, let's go.
[3:49:44.940 --> 3:49:48.200]  He couldn't box his way, let alone debate his way
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:50.440]  out of a paper bag and you're not gonna be able
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:52.840]  to debate your way out of a debate with me, my friend.
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:55.200]  Not gonna happen, cause I got the facts on my side
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:57.800]  about the greatest economic president of our lifetime,
[3:49:57.800 --> 3:49:59.800]  Donald Trump, the greatest man for the middle class
[3:49:59.800 --> 3:50:02.120]  in our lifetime, President Trump, the greatest man
[3:50:02.120 --> 3:50:04.680]  for black and Hispanic jobs in our lifetime.
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:07.600]  President Trump, the greatest man for female jobs,
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:09.800]  talking about loving war against women.
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:12.600]  This is the war against women, they can't get a job,
[3:50:12.600 --> 3:50:14.300]  inflation's destroying their wages,
[3:50:14.300 --> 3:50:15.560]  that's the war against women.
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:18.240]  And when he talks about the Supreme Court in Roe versus Wade,
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:20.200]  he sounds like a complete ignorant idiot
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:24.440]  who's been fed a rack of lies by a gorgeous blonde
[3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:27.080]  actress model, oh yeah, that's his wife.
[3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:30.000]  He's got his balls cut off by his gorgeous blonde wife.
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:32.080]  Hey, you're not thinking with your brain anymore,
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:34.600]  not this one, Howard, you're thinking with that one.
[3:50:34.600 --> 3:50:37.400]  My God, and most importantly, don't forget,
[3:50:37.400 --> 3:50:41.560]  he's hidden his house for two years, he hides from COVID.
[3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:43.280]  I don't think he's seen Robert Quivers,
[3:50:43.280 --> 3:50:45.800]  but Robin Quivers, his co-host physically
[3:50:45.800 --> 3:50:48.400]  in the same space as him for two years.
[3:50:48.400 --> 3:50:52.160]  The guy doesn't go anywhere without masks surrounding his face.
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:55.000]  It's embarrassing, it's ridiculous, it's a joke,
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:58.040]  it's a self-imposed exile lockdown.
[3:50:58.040 --> 3:51:01.240]  But here's some quotes about the Biden economy.
[3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:05.040]  Business leader optimism hits a record low amid soaring
[3:51:05.040 --> 3:51:07.400]  inflation and labor shortages.
[3:51:07.400 --> 3:51:14.040]  Biden administration reports shows massive fossil fuel
[3:51:14.040 --> 3:51:16.480]  industry job losses.
[3:51:16.480 --> 3:51:18.640]  Soaring inflation and crashing rates
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:22.080]  are sparking truckings, great purge.
[3:51:22.080 --> 3:51:26.320]  Collapse continues on abated supply chain problems,
[3:51:26.320 --> 3:51:30.080]  interrupting company operations all across America.
[3:51:30.080 --> 3:51:32.600]  That brings me to my closing argument.
[3:51:32.600 --> 3:51:36.200]  Are we on the verge of a complete economic collapse?
[3:51:36.200 --> 3:51:38.280]  And I would argue yes.
[3:51:38.280 --> 3:51:42.600]  Number one, farmland is barren all over the Midwest.
[3:51:42.600 --> 3:51:45.040]  They can't afford to plant the crops
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:47.720]  because fertilizer prices have gone through the roof
[3:51:47.720 --> 3:51:50.160]  and the farmers don't have the money to plant them.
[3:51:50.160 --> 3:51:52.600]  Number two, if they manage to plant them,
[3:51:52.600 --> 3:51:54.640]  they don't have the money to harvest them
[3:51:54.640 --> 3:51:57.880]  because the cost of diesel fuel has gone through the roof
[3:51:57.880 --> 3:52:00.920]  and therefore they have no money to operate their farm
[3:52:00.920 --> 3:52:03.160]  machinery that does the harvesting.
[3:52:03.160 --> 3:52:06.680]  Number two, how many food plants and food manufacturing
[3:52:06.680 --> 3:52:10.200]  facilities have burned to the ground in the past year?
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:13.080]  And the answer is, I believe over 100.
[3:52:13.080 --> 3:52:16.120]  It's a mind-numbing number.
[3:52:16.120 --> 3:52:17.600]  Why are they burning to the ground?
[3:52:17.600 --> 3:52:21.880]  Obviously, liberal, psycho, environmental Nazis
[3:52:21.880 --> 3:52:23.800]  have decided to burn them to the ground
[3:52:23.800 --> 3:52:29.000]  so all of us can eat peas and chickpeas and broccoli
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:33.160]  and grass and figs for the rest of our lives
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:35.400]  and maybe throw in tofu for dessert.
[3:52:35.400 --> 3:52:37.000]  But the end result is they're trying
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:38.800]  to make our life miserable and make
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:42.240]  us all live in fairness, misery, just like Cuba,
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:44.200]  just like every communist country in history.
[3:52:44.200 --> 3:52:45.760]  How about the trucking companies?
[3:52:45.760 --> 3:52:47.160]  They're all going out of business.
[3:52:47.160 --> 3:52:49.840]  Hundreds per week, who's going to deliver the food?
[3:52:49.840 --> 3:52:53.400]  I was on the road this morning in my beloved Las Vegas.
[3:52:53.400 --> 3:52:57.360]  And I must have passed 15 food trucks or beverage trucks
[3:52:57.360 --> 3:53:00.280]  or liquor trucks, beer trucks, all of that
[3:53:00.280 --> 3:53:02.360]  in a short little five-minute trip.
[3:53:02.360 --> 3:53:04.640]  15 trucks, they supply casinos.
[3:53:04.640 --> 3:53:05.680]  They supply restaurants.
[3:53:05.680 --> 3:53:06.480]  They supply bars.
[3:53:06.480 --> 3:53:07.480]  They supply nightclubs.
[3:53:07.480 --> 3:53:08.440]  They supply supermarkets.
[3:53:08.440 --> 3:53:09.680]  They supply bodegas.
[3:53:09.680 --> 3:53:11.200]  Without trucks, we have nothing.
[3:53:11.200 --> 3:53:13.080]  Well, the truckers can't afford the diesel.
[3:53:13.080 --> 3:53:13.800]  They're going broke.
[3:53:13.800 --> 3:53:18.600]  One truck generally uses like $1,000 to $2,000 worth
[3:53:18.600 --> 3:53:21.680]  of fuel a day, an 18-wheeler, a day.
[3:53:21.680 --> 3:53:24.080]  And some of these trucking firms have 1,000 trucks.
[3:53:24.080 --> 3:53:25.200]  They're going bankrupt.
[3:53:25.200 --> 3:53:26.520]  They're all going out of business.
[3:53:26.520 --> 3:53:29.040]  There's no point in going to work each day to lose money.
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:30.760]  If the truckers go out of business
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:32.920]  and there's no more truckers, guess what happens?
[3:53:32.920 --> 3:53:33.920]  America collapses.
[3:53:33.920 --> 3:53:35.160]  The economy collapses.
[3:53:35.160 --> 3:53:36.200]  We all starve to death.
[3:53:36.200 --> 3:53:38.600]  And by the way, that's obviously their goal,
[3:53:38.600 --> 3:53:42.120]  because they wanted to vaccinate all the truckers.
[3:53:42.120 --> 3:53:46.160]  That's why in Canada, they had that amazing trucker convoy.
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:48.840]  They didn't want to be vaccinated and die or be sick
[3:53:48.840 --> 3:53:49.960]  and be disabled.
[3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:52.760]  Steve Kirsch is one of the most brilliant guys in America
[3:53:52.760 --> 3:53:53.720]  on the COVID vaccine.
[3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:55.040]  He's looked at all the stats.
[3:53:55.040 --> 3:53:57.880]  He says over 750,000 Americans are
[3:53:57.880 --> 3:54:00.640]  dead directly from the COVID vaccine.
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:04.680]  But more importantly, 5 million are disabled
[3:54:04.680 --> 3:54:06.320]  and can never work again.
[3:54:06.320 --> 3:54:09.600]  5 million extra Americans are on disability
[3:54:09.600 --> 3:54:11.080]  and can never work again.
[3:54:11.080 --> 3:54:15.480]  He says his numbers from doing studies on the COVID vaccine.
[3:54:15.480 --> 3:54:17.880]  If you gave that vaccine to every trucker,
[3:54:17.880 --> 3:54:21.240]  there'd be no truckers left, even if you lost only a third
[3:54:21.240 --> 3:54:24.160]  of the truckers, or only half of the truckers.
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:26.120]  There'd be no one left to deliver the goods
[3:54:26.120 --> 3:54:27.200]  in the United States of America.
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:29.840]  That's exactly what's happening with the pilots.
[3:54:29.840 --> 3:54:32.240]  The truckers were independent contractors.
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:34.360]  But the pilots work for the airline,
[3:54:34.360 --> 3:54:36.600]  and they have to do what the airline tells them to do.
[3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:39.240]  So the pilots did not have a big fight about it,
[3:54:39.240 --> 3:54:41.080]  and most of them took the vaccine.
[3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:42.760]  Now, they're sick, they're dying,
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:46.680]  and the ones who didn't take it are enough, maybe 30%,
[3:54:46.680 --> 3:54:48.440]  that there's no one left to fly the planes.
[3:54:48.440 --> 3:54:50.320]  And each weekend, it's a travel nightmare,
[3:54:50.320 --> 3:54:52.760]  and each day, thousands of flights are canceled
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:55.160]  and delayed on weekends, tens of thousands.
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:54:57.040]  This is not a problem that's going away.
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:54:58.640]  Take two years to train a pilot,
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:00.080]  and they're gonna have to lower the standards,
[3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:01.600]  so you're gonna see lots of crashes.
[3:55:01.600 --> 3:55:03.280]  Do you realize we have the safest airline industry
[3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:04.120]  in the world?
[3:55:04.120 --> 3:55:05.960]  Do you realize there's never a crash anymore?
[3:55:05.960 --> 3:55:08.720]  Knock on wood ever of a major commercial airline?
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:09.920]  How many years has it been?
[3:55:09.920 --> 3:55:11.720]  Do you have any idea when they lower the standards
[3:55:11.720 --> 3:55:13.160]  to get new pilots in quickly,
[3:55:13.160 --> 3:55:17.440]  and they let people who have substandard minds, brains,
[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:19.280]  they pass the SATs with, you know,
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:21.480]  signing their signature and never got a word right,
[3:55:21.480 --> 3:55:22.680]  now you're gonna let them in,
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:24.360]  because we need diversity,
[3:55:24.360 --> 3:55:28.440]  because we need new people at any level of incompetence.
[3:55:28.440 --> 3:55:30.600]  There's gonna be plane crashes left and right
[3:55:30.600 --> 3:55:31.440]  two years from now.
[3:55:31.440 --> 3:55:33.560]  Until then, there's gonna be a travel nightmare
[3:55:33.560 --> 3:55:35.160]  every day and every weekend,
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:37.280]  like you can't believe, and it's only getting worse,
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:39.200]  as more pilots and flight crews get sick,
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:42.920]  or die, or quit rather than take the vaccine.
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:45.480]  Let's also talk about the diesel fuel shortage.
[3:55:45.480 --> 3:55:47.320]  So even if the truckers want it to go,
[3:55:47.320 --> 3:55:49.240]  they can't afford to go,
[3:55:49.240 --> 3:55:51.400]  because A, they can't afford the diesel fuel,
[3:55:51.400 --> 3:55:54.880]  and B, the shortage means some trucks will not have gas,
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:57.600]  so they can't leave their garage.
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:01.560]  Diesel engine oil about to run out completely
[3:56:01.560 --> 3:56:02.680]  in a matter of eight weeks,
[3:56:02.680 --> 3:56:04.720]  unless we find a very quick replacement.
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:06.560]  Maybe we will, I don't know,
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:08.720]  but if we don't, the trucks are very slowly
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:10.680]  all gonna begin to stop running,
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:12.720]  and there's gonna be no one to deliver anything.
[3:56:12.720 --> 3:56:15.520]  The insanity of the Green New Deal,
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:17.640]  there is no energy option out there
[3:56:17.640 --> 3:56:20.520]  to replace quote unquote, dirty fossil fuel,
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:23.200]  and your electric bill is gonna triple and quadruple,
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:24.480]  and the gas you put in your car
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:26.040]  is gonna go to $10 a gallon.
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:28.880]  This will kill and tank the economy.
[3:56:28.880 --> 3:56:30.960]  How about environmental Nazis,
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:32.240]  who while this is all happening,
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:35.480]  wanna block 3,500 drilling permits
[3:56:35.480 --> 3:56:37.600]  that are already issued on federal lands,
[3:56:37.600 --> 3:56:39.760]  and they're suing in court and tying them up.
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:42.000]  This is the insanity of the left.
[3:56:42.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  Grocery prices out of control, crime out of control.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:48.720]  Vaccine mandate, citizens dying out of control.
[3:56:48.720 --> 3:56:51.840]  No employees to fill the jobs because of the vaccines,
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:53.360]  and a lot of people are sick,
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:55.880]  and a lot of people who will not take a job,
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:56:58.000]  because they will not be vaccinated.
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:57:00.400]  I've got even more here about the economic collapse.
[3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:01.720]  It goes on and on.
[3:57:01.720 --> 3:57:05.000]  It's coming, be prepared, get food security,
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:06.320]  make sure you have extra gas,
[3:57:06.320 --> 3:57:07.800]  make sure you have generators,
[3:57:07.800 --> 3:57:10.080]  make sure you have water filtration systems.
[3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:11.920]  Get ready, because it's gonna get rough.
[3:57:11.920 --> 3:57:14.640]  Wayne Allyn Root, rootforamerica.com,
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:16.640]  my email, wainrootedgmail.com,
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:18.480]  and Howard Stern, I challenge you,
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:20.160]  I'm coming for you, I want you,
[3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:23.080]  I want a piece, let's debate, anywhere, anytime.
[3:57:23.080 --> 3:57:25.280]  Let's go, Stern, anywhere, anytime.
[3:57:25.280 --> 3:57:27.360]  I'll take you on, you're wrong about everything,
[3:57:27.360 --> 3:57:28.560]  and I'll prove it.
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:30.960]  We'll see you next week, or actually in two weeks.
[3:57:30.960 --> 3:57:31.800]  Bye-bye.
[3:57:31.800 --> 3:57:47.720]  The Globalist are making their move,
[3:57:47.720 --> 3:57:49.640]  their great reset is here.
[3:57:49.640 --> 3:57:51.160]  They're coming for your children,
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:53.480]  they're coming for the value of your currency,
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:55.600]  they're coming for your national sovereignty,
[3:57:55.600 --> 3:57:57.920]  they're coming for your very bodies
[3:57:57.920 --> 3:58:00.280]  with their biomedical tyranny,
[3:58:00.280 --> 3:58:02.600]  they're coming for your free speech,
[3:58:02.600 --> 3:58:05.080]  they're coming for your privacy,
[3:58:05.080 --> 3:58:07.640]  and ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right
[3:58:07.640 --> 3:58:10.160]  to vote and have your representative in government
[3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:12.880]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[3:58:12.880 --> 3:58:14.600]  The new film, the seminal film,
[3:58:14.600 --> 3:58:17.520]  the most important documentary ever made in my view,

[3:58:37.640 --> 3:58:39.800]  They're planning to run the same scams again,
[3:58:39.800 --> 3:58:42.160]  this film can stop them if you take action.

[3:58:46.080 --> 3:58:48.520]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[3:58:48.520 --> 3:58:51.040]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[3:58:51.040 --> 3:58:53.400]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe,
[3:58:53.400 --> 3:58:55.200]  I was barely holding onto a jaw,
[3:58:55.200 --> 3:58:57.880]  and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[3:58:57.880 --> 3:59:00.520]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[3:59:00.520 --> 3:59:02.400]  the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[3:59:02.400 --> 3:59:04.720]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew,
[3:59:04.720 --> 3:59:06.600]  you had with a deep burn source,
[3:59:06.600 --> 3:59:08.480]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[3:59:08.480 --> 3:59:11.640]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[3:59:11.640 --> 3:59:15.120]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:59:15.120 --> 3:59:18.040]  I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[3:59:18.040 --> 3:59:20.840]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[3:59:20.840 --> 3:59:23.040]  I got my health back and I religiously took
[3:59:23.040 --> 3:59:24.480]  basically all of your supplements.
[3:59:24.480 --> 3:59:26.840]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:59:26.840 --> 3:59:28.680]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[3:59:28.680 --> 3:59:30.880]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:59:30.880 --> 3:59:32.160]  It's amazing, it works.
[3:59:32.160 --> 3:59:34.760]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean,
[3:59:34.760 --> 3:59:37.240]  we have to break free of the globalist system,
[3:59:37.240 --> 3:59:39.800]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health
[3:59:39.800 --> 3:59:40.880]  into our own hands.
[3:59:40.880 --> 3:59:42.080]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:59:42.080 --> 3:59:44.360]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[3:59:47.760 --> 3:59:50.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:59:50.560 --> 3:59:57.560]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
