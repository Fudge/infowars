[00:00.000 --> 00:16.160]  Joe Rogan, you may have heard about this, you made comments about young people getting
[00:16.160 --> 00:18.560]  vaccinated, getting a lot of buzz.
[00:18.560 --> 00:22.360]  He said, if you're like 21 years old and you say to me, should I get vaccinated?
[00:22.360 --> 00:23.360]  I say no.
[00:23.360 --> 00:27.640]  I just said, I don't think that if you're a young, healthy person that you need it.
[00:27.640 --> 00:30.640]  Your argument was, you need it for other people.
[00:30.640 --> 00:33.560]  So you say young, healthy people should get vaccinated?
[00:33.560 --> 00:34.560]  Absolutely.
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.800]  A top Washington Post investigative journalist has come out and pointed out what Dr. Francis
[00:39.800 --> 00:43.680]  Boyle and others said on the show a year ago, but with the evidence that Fauci is covering
[00:43.680 --> 00:48.160]  up the Luhan Lab leak because he was running the Security Legal Operations there, which
[00:48.160 --> 00:49.400]  is documented.
[00:49.400 --> 00:53.800]  But the fact is the Washington Post has come out with this, that means big changes are
[00:53.800 --> 00:54.800]  afoot.
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.560]  Robert Redfield, who is the CDC director at the time, a trained virologist, he says,
[00:58.560 --> 01:04.400]  I took a look at this virus and I concluded that it's so powerful that it must have been
[01:04.400 --> 01:05.720]  evolved in a lab setting.
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.400]  And he pointed to the gain of function research and they called him a racist, a conspiracy
[01:08.400 --> 01:09.880]  theorist and all the rest.
[01:09.880 --> 01:15.880]  The godfather of that industry, the head of the pyramid, is a guy you may have heard
[01:15.880 --> 01:17.240]  of called Anthony Fauci.
[01:17.240 --> 01:23.800]  Anthony Fauci, the hero of the pandemic, is the most important person in the world
[01:23.800 --> 01:26.200]  of gain of function research there is.
[01:26.200 --> 01:31.080]  In other words, he is not just him, there's Francis Collins at the NIH and some other people,
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.840]  but basically he is the one dispersing all of the grants for this.
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.720]  He is the one who pushed to turn it back on after Obama turned it back off.
[01:38.720 --> 01:40.320]  That's a whole other crazy story.
[01:40.320 --> 01:42.800]  He turned it back on without really consulting the White House.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.800]  That's breaking news.
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.800]  Gain of function experiments and what that means are experiments that make the virus
[01:48.800 --> 01:51.720]  more dangerous or more deadly.
[01:51.720 --> 01:56.480]  It's a sort of research that we don't do in Canada that is frowned upon in most parts
[01:56.480 --> 01:57.480]  of the world.
[01:57.480 --> 02:02.360]  A former spy chief says the lab ideas shouldn't be dismissed as conspiracy.
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.080]  It's an engineered escapee from the Wuhan Institute.
[02:06.080 --> 02:13.760]  It was the result of an accident and that the virus is the consequence of gain function
[02:13.760 --> 02:14.760]  experiments.
[02:14.760 --> 02:17.400]  And now it's a two-front war.
[02:17.400 --> 02:23.560]  First it was against COVID-19 and I'm not trying to excuse the Chinese government.
[02:23.560 --> 02:25.080]  This was a predictable leak.
[02:25.080 --> 02:27.280]  I've been saying that for years.
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.920]  And then China, this communist dictatorship covered it up right from the very get-go.
[02:32.920 --> 02:35.800]  Clearly a crime against humanity.
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.080]  They could have brought it under control immediately and they did not.
[02:40.080 --> 02:49.520]  Of 500,000 U.S. troops who were forcibly inoculated with the original Franken shots, 11,000 were
[02:49.520 --> 02:57.080]  killed and 100,000 were disabled and those were healthy young men and women in our armed
[02:57.080 --> 02:59.760]  forces.
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.240]  Just extrapolate when they're going to give these Franken shots to everyone.
[03:04.240 --> 03:07.560]  There are seven and a half plus million people on this planet.
[03:07.560 --> 03:12.040]  The globalists see themselves as guardians of the earth, guardians of the galaxy and
[03:12.040 --> 03:19.560]  that they are doing an emergency stunning, poisoning, dumbing down and then culling of
[03:19.560 --> 03:20.560]  the human population.
[03:20.560 --> 03:25.280]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero and that's going to
[03:25.280 --> 03:32.720]  be based on the number of people, the services, each person choosing on average, the energy
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.640]  on average for each service and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[03:38.640 --> 03:44.360]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[03:44.360 --> 03:48.360]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[03:48.360 --> 03:52.360]  That's back from a high school algebra but let's take a look.
[03:52.360 --> 03:57.120]  And they have decided that they own the world because they created all this digital made-up
[03:57.120 --> 04:02.000]  garbage and now they need to get us in debt, they need to get rid of our local economies,
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.880]  they need to bankrupt us and put us into a position of total control.
[04:08.880 --> 04:15.600]  After the second dose at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect ranging
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.160]  from severe chills to fevers.
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.080]  So are these vaccines safe?
[04:24.080 --> 04:25.080]  Well the...
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.440]  Brandy Parker McFadden is confined to her hospital bed at Vanderbilt.
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.440]  Can you walk like this?
[04:31.440 --> 04:32.440]  I can walk.
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.960]  Less than 24 hours after receiving her second Pfizer COVID shot, she explains she lost her
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.800]  ability to move from her shoulders down.
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.920]  I thought maybe if anything I'd probably get flu-like symptoms because I'd already had
[04:44.920 --> 04:50.960]  COVID but I never in a million years thought I would never be able to get up and go to
[04:50.960 --> 04:51.960]  the bathroom.
[04:51.960 --> 05:00.880]  The globalists are moving us into a post-human world.
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.680]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[05:05.680 --> 05:08.400]  from beta testing to operational.
[05:08.400 --> 05:13.160]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.160]  takeover.
[05:14.160 --> 05:17.560]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.200]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.160]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.760]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.480]  If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it.
[05:30.480 --> 05:35.040]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others
[05:35.040 --> 05:36.440]  is absolutely essential.
[05:36.440 --> 05:41.120]  And at the same time supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on
[05:41.120 --> 05:45.480]  air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding
[05:45.480 --> 05:46.480]  our operation.
[05:46.480 --> 05:47.480]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:47.480 --> 05:48.480]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[05:48.480 --> 05:54.280]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are
[05:54.280 --> 05:56.760]  back in like bodies, vasobites and others.
[05:56.760 --> 06:22.120]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of The Resistance.
[06:26.920 --> 06:32.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:32.920 --> 06:39.200]  Okay, if I discovered that let's say in North Austin, I'm broadcasting from Austin, Texas,
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.040]  there was a field with a thousand dead bodies buried in it recently.
[06:43.040 --> 06:46.520]  I would not stay on air right now, I would just go off air and I would go to the police
[06:46.520 --> 06:48.040]  department right now.
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.280]  I wouldn't talk about how there's a field with a thousand dead bodies in it because
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.880]  that's such a magnitude that it's not just something you sit there and basically commentate
[06:58.880 --> 07:00.800]  on like it's a football game.
[07:00.800 --> 07:10.680]  But I have officially reached that point here on air where I officially cannot just go on
[07:10.680 --> 07:15.400]  doing this radio show anymore.
[07:15.400 --> 07:21.160]  The crimes of the globalists are so out in the open that the response of just talking
[07:21.160 --> 07:24.880]  about it is not what you can do.
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.440]  You got to do more and I don't know what I'm going to do but I'm just saying they've crossed
[07:30.440 --> 07:38.520]  the Rubicon and I sit here every day reading with top scientists, the most respect to their
[07:38.520 --> 07:43.800]  fields have been saying and I've been watching what they warned about starting 14, 15 months
[07:43.800 --> 07:52.160]  ago in February of 2020 come true.
[07:52.160 --> 08:00.240]  Take December 1 document now five, six months ago with Wolfgang Wudarg, one of the heads
[08:00.240 --> 08:08.840]  of the major EU advisory commissions and the former head of Pfizer, scroll down there
[08:08.840 --> 08:16.280]  and see both their names, Michael Yedon, former chief scientist at Pfizer over their vaccine
[08:16.280 --> 08:22.160]  program saying you must not release the Pfizer vaccine, it's experimental.
[08:22.160 --> 08:28.080]  We've looked at the protein that it supposedly trains your body to have an autoimmune response
[08:28.080 --> 08:35.480]  to and when your body goes and attacks that it's going to attack the brain, it's going
[08:35.480 --> 08:45.400]  to attack the uterus, it's going to attack the plaque buildup and the cells in your heart
[08:45.400 --> 08:52.600]  and cardiovascular system and they said we don't know how or why you do this, 101 this
[08:52.600 --> 09:00.640]  will do this, you tested hundreds of previous mRNA vaccines on every animal you can imagine
[09:00.640 --> 09:10.160]  poultry, pigs, cows, lab rats, everything and you know it caused autoimmune responses
[09:10.160 --> 09:18.680]  in them and caused brain frog, brain damage, heart attacks, strokes and infertility in
[09:18.680 --> 09:25.360]  the females, why are you doing this, this is insane and Yedon was in the news again
[09:25.360 --> 09:31.520]  this week saying this is a depopulation bio weapon, he's now confirmed it's killing masses
[09:31.520 --> 09:38.560]  of people which we already know, so I'm just sitting here calmly while the UN and Bill
[09:38.560 --> 09:44.080]  Gates and Klaus Schwab who are on record saying they want to depopulate the earth have gotten
[09:44.080 --> 09:50.880]  liability protection from all the major nations, a bunch of countries have banned their vaccines
[09:50.880 --> 09:57.120]  and top scientists five and a half, six months ago said exactly what was going to happen
[09:57.120 --> 10:05.200]  and then it gets worse, it gets worse, this stuff is coming in so fast, I got in here
[10:05.200 --> 10:09.400]  45 minutes for the show time, I've been doing research at home, I was reading over stacks
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.560]  of news, I sent the guys to print and then a national talk show host, that's not name
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.920]  dropping, that's a senate to me, sent me this text message, he said have you seen those
[10:18.920 --> 10:25.880]  assault research on how the vaccines are now causing an attack on the cardiovascular and
[10:25.880 --> 10:29.520]  the proteins and I said no I haven't seen that, I said please send it to me, so he sent
[10:29.520 --> 10:39.920]  it to me, so it shows how people are on the job doing the research and my god, I read
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.760]  this and it's the exact same thing Wolfgang Wodart said except it's now a major study
[10:44.760 --> 10:51.480]  of people that took the damn things and it's causing massive heart attacks and massive
[10:51.480 --> 10:57.280]  strokes and massive cardiovascular shutdown and it's all written dryly about what it does
[10:57.280 --> 11:04.080]  and they go oopsie, oopsie daisy, it's not what's in the virus that's killing everybody,
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.840]  it's the spike protein delivery system which is what everybody said on this show and what
[11:09.840 --> 11:24.440]  Dr. Francis Boyle said 14 months ago, he said you cannot have a vaccine with a common cold
[11:24.440 --> 11:31.440]  the coronavirus because the coronavirus is a basic protein in most of your body and so
[11:31.440 --> 11:37.320]  just like peanut allergies weren't around till the 80s and then they grew in a peanut
[11:37.320 --> 11:43.480]  protein measles, mumps, rubella shots and then you saw people had an autoimmune response
[11:43.480 --> 11:47.320]  to that like a bee sting, once you get allergic to a bee sting they can kill you, I used to
[11:47.320 --> 11:50.560]  laugh at people that were scared of bees, I finally got attacked by a swarm when I was
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.360]  like 20 years old and now I got hit by one, I got to get an epi-pen, I swell up and can't
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.640]  breathe, well it's the same damn thing with peanuts because your body has an autoimmune
[11:59.640 --> 12:03.920]  response because it's not just getting a learning immunity from measles, mumps, rubella viruses
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.240]  but peanuts and now they don't grow on peanuts anymore so it's just people born in the 80s
[12:09.240 --> 12:16.320]  up until like 2005 they stopped doing peanut allergy, growing stuff on peanuts, the vaccines
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.120]  they grow the attenuated viruses on there or they grow them on the peanut and they radiate
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.920]  on the other ways to attenuate them, that's old fashioned vaccines, it's the same thing
[12:26.920 --> 12:35.160]  here so I'm just stating it very very slowly, this system, it doesn't matter if it is the
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.880]  virus vector vaccines, it doesn't matter if it's the mRNA vaccines, they're all programming
[12:39.880 --> 12:47.360]  the cells to have an autoimmune response to the protein that is in a virus, they're not
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.680]  creating it for the actual RNA of the overall virus, the scientists that looked at this
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.680]  said this looks like depopulation to us, this isn't going to protect you from a cold
[12:56.680 --> 13:04.840]  virus or an ammonia virus or an influenza virus, this is going to attack the protein
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.920]  and they said well here let's look where this protein is, okay it's in your cardiovascular
[13:08.920 --> 13:16.200]  system, your heart, your brain, your lungs, all the vessels in the heart, it's in the
[13:16.200 --> 13:25.200]  placenta, it's in the uterus monthly when the woman grows, the bed that the zygote
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.400]  sits in and then forms a placenta, that's when a woman doesn't get pregnant, she sloughs
[13:29.400 --> 13:36.680]  that off each month and grows a fresh fertilized bed and it's going to attack a bunch of other
[13:36.680 --> 13:43.000]  areas and sure as hell it's doing it, it's attacking fast growing cells in the body and
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.520]  we're one of the fastest growing cells in the body, well it's the skin but what else,
[13:48.520 --> 13:54.080]  the testicles, testicles are growing sperm constantly and that's why it's coming out
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.480]  that suddenly men are basically becoming infertile, they're testicles are shriveling
[13:58.480 --> 14:05.000]  up, God they hit us and they hit us super hard, it's on, they didn't save on the earth,
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.640]  they had to do it, they launched the attack and it gets worse, when they inject you with
[14:09.640 --> 14:15.840]  these it makes your body go in and produce what even MPR the Wall Street Journal say,
[14:15.840 --> 14:24.080]  oh scientists warn this will cause super viruses and shedding and now that's Chicago Tribune,
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.320]  okay yeah professors and scientists found people are shedding and so it's great, you'll
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.880]  get immunity now but you won't because it's synthetic and so even if you try to stay away
[14:34.880 --> 14:39.000]  now and that's why 80 year old, 90 year old women are having menstrual cycles, it's why
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.080]  they're importing everywhere that suddenly men are sterile, their testicles will swell
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.560]  up and they'll never have kids again, it just eats your testicles and that's why it's
[14:47.560 --> 14:55.200]  eating women's uteruses, it's causing a huge autoimmune response, I mean it's incredible
[14:55.200 --> 15:03.280]  and it's all happening right now and because they got everybody to get into the fear and
[15:03.280 --> 15:07.520]  wear the mask and be scared and take the shots, they know as many people as they get to take
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.320]  the shot will Stockholm syndrome, people are very weak minded now, we ever have a delusional
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.280]  world population especially in the west, they won't say they got hit, they won't admit they
[15:16.280 --> 15:21.680]  got hit, no no they'll defend it and take more, I've showed you all the paralyzed people
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.000]  on TV black and white and they're like I'll do it again, I'm paralyzed but I just think
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.200]  we should all take it and the government needs more funding, so CDC just needs more money
[15:32.200 --> 15:38.080]  that's why I'm paralyzed, it's an accident, remember that HBO show about pimps, I forget
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.680]  the name of it, and he's run over, cigarette burns, beat her up, she's in the hospital with
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.440]  pimps there, she's like baby I'm gonna get up quick, get back to work for you, I'm sorry
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.320]  you beat me up and gouged my eye out and the mother looks at the pimps and goes what have
[15:50.320 --> 15:55.680]  you done to my baby, people love Stockholm syndrome, they love being slapped around out
[15:55.680 --> 16:02.000]  of their teeth and knocked out my bill gates, I'm up here working on a Thursday night in
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something, I am so blessed and honored to work with this
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.360]  incredible crew that has come together over the years and it's truly an answer to prayer
[16:11.360 --> 16:15.280]  and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners of this show, I want you
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.040]  to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic,
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.920]  white, black, it doesn't matter you got red blood, and if you love freedom and justice
[16:23.920 --> 16:29.160]  and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.760]  been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and as crazy as your things
[16:33.760 --> 16:38.760]  are, I want to keep working under the future, but again that's really up to you and up to
[16:38.760 --> 16:44.360]  God, so please I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.760]  us, but again that's up to you and your relationship with God, I just want to thank you all for
[16:48.760 --> 16:52.880]  the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to pray
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.160]  to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to
[16:57.160 --> 17:00.240]  continue to support Him for the worse, God bless.
[17:00.240 --> 17:14.960]  One answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:14.960 --> 17:27.840]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[17:27.840 --> 17:37.680]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share.

[17:56.320 --> 18:06.200]  This entire new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete,
[18:06.200 --> 18:10.960]  making you a domesticated animal they control, they want to censor you, they want to dump
[18:10.960 --> 18:15.200]  you down, they want to poison you and they want to control your ability to take care
[18:15.200 --> 18:16.680]  of yourself.
[18:16.680 --> 18:21.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the info war more than ever and you can do
[18:21.680 --> 18:26.400]  it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[19:00.640 --> 19:03.240]  CNN has almost no viewers.
[19:03.240 --> 19:08.320]  The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the world as a pack of anti-free
[19:08.320 --> 19:09.320]  speech liars.
[19:09.320 --> 19:12.760]  But that doesn't mean that they don't have power, just like the Southern Prairie Law
[19:12.760 --> 19:14.240]  Center that's just as bad.
[19:14.240 --> 19:18.440]  They represent the globalist, the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and
[19:18.440 --> 19:22.720]  back's common as China and its death camps, and they back bringing those similar systems
[19:22.720 --> 19:28.080]  here to America and they've even officially called the ADL for my arrest for my speech
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.680]  and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested for free speech as well.
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.560]  These are very, very dangerous times.
[19:33.560 --> 19:35.120]  They don't want us to be on air.
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.920]  You funding our operation is critical, you make it easy at infowarstore.com with amazing
[19:39.920 --> 19:44.960]  products like water filtration, air filtration, non-geoma heirloom seeds, t-shirts, books,

[19:55.080 --> 20:03.160]  air despite what the pirates want.
[20:03.160 --> 20:29.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:29.160 --> 20:55.840]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, May 2nd, Global Transmission.
[20:55.840 --> 21:24.240]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, May 2nd, Global Transmission.
[21:24.240 --> 21:50.640]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, May 2nd, Global Transmission.
[21:50.640 --> 22:20.440]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, May 2nd, Global Transmission.
[22:21.400 --> 22:32.240]  When you read the documents and you know what's about to happen and then you witness it for
[22:32.240 --> 22:37.720]  yourself, it's incredible.
[22:37.720 --> 22:41.880]  I'll tell a story about that later if I have time when I try to take my four-year-old
[22:41.880 --> 22:47.360]  daughter to the botanical gardens today in Zilker Park.
[22:47.360 --> 22:51.040]  Before I got there I meant, you know what?
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.960]  I saw that smirkanish CNN piece where he said, make people have vaccine passports to have
[22:55.960 --> 23:01.080]  access to any museums or city buildings and then make it free for folks to do it first
[23:01.080 --> 23:04.880]  but then make it basically regulatory and bully people into it and I said, I bet when
[23:04.880 --> 23:09.200]  we get there, I bet there's people blocking the gates even though the COVID thing is supposedly
[23:09.200 --> 23:10.200]  over.
[23:10.200 --> 23:14.800]  It won't be and when we got there, they said, you can only register online to come to the
[23:14.800 --> 23:20.080]  big giant, you know, 30, 40-acre botanical garden that's in the middle of Zilker Park.
[23:20.080 --> 23:25.400]  You know, the guy a hundred years ago gave free to the city, place I've been going since
[23:25.400 --> 23:26.400]  I was a kid.
[23:26.400 --> 23:32.720]  I guess I'm telling the story now and I walk up and there's the two green-haired women
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.960]  and they're with my daughter and she wanted to go see the koi fish and the lady said,
[23:37.960 --> 23:40.200]  oh, do you have your reservation?
[23:40.200 --> 23:41.920]  And I said, well, she never had reservations.
[23:41.920 --> 23:48.040]  She just come in and go, she goes, well, you got to have a reservation and I said, let
[23:48.040 --> 23:49.440]  me guess and you're full.
[23:49.440 --> 23:54.280]  She said, that's right, we only allow a certain amount in now.
[23:54.280 --> 23:59.360]  Now I remember reading The Nature Conservancy 25 years ago when they were proposing taking
[23:59.360 --> 24:06.280]  over Zilker Park and another state park that had just become a state park that was probably
[24:06.280 --> 24:10.880]  owned, Hamilton Pool outside Austin, Texas, a place I really liked that I took girlfriends
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.520]  in high school and in college and it was The Nature Conservancy talking about the whole
[24:15.520 --> 24:20.680]  country and the world and they said, just like we've done in Bali and other areas, we're
[24:20.680 --> 24:26.280]  just going to make all the state parks and things off limits.
[24:26.280 --> 24:29.560]  Once computers get up to a level of track everybody and then we're going to say that
[24:29.560 --> 24:32.960]  national parks as well can only have limited amounts because there's too many people and
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.360]  that's how we'll train the public if they only get a few visits in their lifetime to
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.040]  places like this.
[24:41.040 --> 24:46.360]  Now that has officially now been done at Hamilton Pool, there's a two-year waiting list to even
[24:46.360 --> 24:55.600]  get in to see it, it's a cenote, a caved-in cave with a waterfall and you can't go there
[24:55.600 --> 24:56.600]  anymore.
[24:56.600 --> 24:57.600]  They only allow a few people in a day.
[24:57.600 --> 25:05.760]  Now that's all about power and control and I happen to have that advisory board report,
[25:05.760 --> 25:11.240]  remember two weeks ago Fox News reported, Biden says you only get five pounds of beef a year
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.240]  according to his eco plan.
[25:12.240 --> 25:16.960]  Well, that's the official advisory group from the UN, he signed on to that policy until
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.320]  he wants to implement their policies and in their official list of policies, it's get
[25:21.320 --> 25:27.960]  rid of your cat and dog or tax you, what is it, five thousand pounds a year in the UK.
[25:27.960 --> 25:34.600]  That's like eight thousand dollars here and that you'll only get five pounds of beef.
[25:34.600 --> 25:38.560]  I've got newscasts I'll play for you where they're now announcing they're going to take
[25:38.560 --> 25:44.080]  your cat and dog away in the UK, who's about three years ahead of us and you're like, oh
[25:44.080 --> 25:46.920]  they won't take my cat and dog, they won't take my beef, oh really, did you stay in your
[25:46.920 --> 25:51.200]  house when they locked you down, did you wear the damn mask, did you submit to the system,
[25:51.200 --> 26:00.000]  yes you will until you decide to say no and realize things only get worse until you start
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.440]  saying no.
[26:03.440 --> 26:07.440]  They want an authoritarian model and they believe that you're so domesticated and stupid
[26:07.440 --> 26:13.760]  you'll put up with it and it's about total control, they have bills introduced in two
[26:13.760 --> 26:24.920]  states to make you have a license to have a garden now, not just ban, all livestock.
[26:24.920 --> 26:30.520]  I'm going to show you that, you see all these stacks over here, all these stacks of news
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.560]  aren't props, every one of these is nightmare serious, okay, every one of these is nightmare
[26:36.560 --> 26:43.400]  serious, you see this, written in 1974 the year I was born, the man decades later became
[26:43.400 --> 26:50.280]  the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, Paul Ehrlich and Ann Ehrlich worked for the
[26:50.280 --> 26:54.320]  Rockefeller Foundation, they wrote more than 20 books calling for world government and
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.760]  total human depopulation saving human species as a disease that should be completely eradicated,
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.640]  you might want to read EcoScience, I read the whole thing, oh there's a new book you
[27:04.640 --> 27:09.720]  can read that's a lot shorter which is completely out of the open and that's COVID-19 the great
[27:09.720 --> 27:15.480]  reset by Klaus Schwab, he already had it written right before the whole operation he's running
[27:15.480 --> 27:25.280]  and all the world leaders wear the little pin that is a sun symbol rainbow swastika and
[27:25.280 --> 27:30.840]  it shows the total takeover, in fact guys go to this tweet and print me the actual subpage,
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.400]  I want to show people the wheel of death and Bill Gates is wearing it and all the other
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.760]  world leaders are wearing it, the UN chiefs are wearing it, the UK prime minister, the
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.600]  French president are all wearing it, they all wear it and it's the great reset, great
[27:45.600 --> 27:58.440]  reset and it is a manifesto of a post human world, oh and here's the other big thing you
[27:58.440 --> 28:01.600]  might want to know, in fact that's what I think I'll hit first when we come back before
[28:01.600 --> 28:05.000]  I get into all the heart attacks and strokes that are happening, you hear about the blood
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.720]  clots, there's a lot more blood clots with Pfizer and with AstraZeneca and I keep forgetting
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.160]  about Bill Gates, Bill Gates is a vaccine company, he's kind of company too, he's invested
[28:18.160 --> 28:23.120]  the other two too but I keep having trouble remembering it, yeah your mic's overblown
[28:23.120 --> 28:34.000]  what was it, no it's not there, okay so we're going to come right back on the other side,
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.560]  there's a new article, Norwegian doctor claims to find link between AstraZeneca vaccine and
[28:38.560 --> 28:45.040]  wear blood clots, that was really months ago that came out, now it's all confirmed, they
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.920]  banned it in 21 countries in Europe and many other places but oh it's all safe and effective
[28:50.920 --> 28:53.680]  and you should all roll your sleeves up and take it right away, well they're right back
[28:53.680 --> 29:00.680]  to stay with us.
[29:00.680 --> 29:06.520]  I recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call in the background and I made the
[29:06.520 --> 29:11.160]  point that hey the cavalry is here but it's really true, listeners are incredible and
[29:11.160 --> 29:16.040]  we're able to keep these great products in stock, we were able to fund ourselves last
[29:16.040 --> 29:20.000]  year and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole that we've been in because I expanded
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.240]  so much for the 2020 election but thanks to you we're still on air but now because of
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.600]  the shutdown in production and because of the slowdowns with the whole COVID lockdowns
[29:29.600 --> 29:32.560]  and supply chain, a lot of our best selling products have not been available for months
[29:32.560 --> 29:36.200]  and months and months, some for six months, some have been discontinued but the cavalry
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.440]  is here now and our funding, because a lot of these products are finally coming back

[30:01.600 --> 30:06.840]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[30:06.840 --> 30:13.040]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with
[30:13.040 --> 30:19.360]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.560]  of the test subjects.
[30:21.560 --> 30:25.640]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[30:25.640 --> 30:29.600]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their plan
[30:29.600 --> 30:32.600]  for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[30:32.600 --> 30:36.400]  The film now is more important than ever when it is shot to number one on Amazon last year,
[30:36.400 --> 30:37.400]  they banned it.
[30:37.400 --> 30:42.280]  We have it back in print available now at InfoWareStore.com, selling them as low as $3.95

[31:05.680 --> 31:09.960]  the supply chain and it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric
[31:09.960 --> 31:10.960]  formula.
[31:10.960 --> 31:13.480]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[31:13.480 --> 31:14.480]  That's why this one's white.

[31:58.600 --> 32:25.000]  Here's why you're still here.
[32:25.000 --> 32:38.800]  I have the ideology because I believe that it is the best way of coming at the world
[32:38.800 --> 32:40.880]  and what type of policy.
[32:40.880 --> 32:46.240]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between the chairman
[32:46.240 --> 32:49.360]  of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[32:49.360 --> 32:55.160]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically
[32:55.160 --> 33:04.240]  that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[33:04.240 --> 33:33.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show is in place and again, it is Sunday, May 2,
[33:33.440 --> 33:34.440]  2021.
[33:34.440 --> 33:39.000]  I am your host Alex Jones and there are a lot of reasons this is happening.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.880]  A lot of reasons this is unfolding.
[33:41.880 --> 33:47.000]  The social engineers of the planet have come up with a plan to basically get rid of the
[33:47.000 --> 33:54.520]  general population who they see as ugly and stupid and lazy and hand the rest of the planet
[33:54.520 --> 33:56.360]  over to themselves.
[33:56.360 --> 33:59.560]  And that is the process that is now taking place.
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.280]  Of course, these globalists are the most ruthless out of control sinister people you can imagine
[34:05.280 --> 34:10.480]  and they sell us on hating ourselves and we're dirty and bad because we are, quote, hurting
[34:10.480 --> 34:18.720]  the earth and then make us have a guilt and a loathing of ourselves so that we will hate
[34:18.720 --> 34:26.680]  ourselves and roll over and let the globalists run the planet and we'll stand up for ourselves,
[34:26.680 --> 34:34.280]  we'll stand up for our own personal rights so that we can be completely run over.
[34:34.280 --> 34:39.680]  And that's really the easiest way to boil this down and I understand that the industrial
[34:39.680 --> 34:51.920]  modern world has made people very lazy, very soft, very stupid and that most people are
[34:51.920 --> 34:59.440]  just shuffling through life from one entertainment to the next but also know the modern world
[34:59.440 --> 35:06.720]  has been designed and set up to accentuate our weaknesses and make sure we never really
[35:06.720 --> 35:13.160]  ignite psychically, mentally, spiritually, physically, financially because that would
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.560]  get in the way of the globalists and their plants.
[35:18.560 --> 35:23.600]  And so the public doesn't deserve to be fried with all this GMO and these deadly vaccines,
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.720]  the public doesn't deserve it and it's not being done to save us or help us or make us
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.440]  live longer, it's being done because we're so passive and in such a trance and put up
[35:33.440 --> 35:42.920]  with so much corruption that they now see us as a bunch of people that are eating resources
[35:42.920 --> 35:49.440]  that are theirs because they have successfully stolen the planet, we have not stood up to
[35:49.440 --> 36:01.040]  them and they have no respect for us now because we don't respect ourselves and so the decision
[36:01.040 --> 36:13.120]  has been made too slowly but methodically dumb us down, sterilize us and then kill us
[36:13.120 --> 36:26.080]  and I know the folks listening to this show do not want to be poisoned and do not want
[36:26.080 --> 36:33.280]  to die and do not want to see your children only live to be 10, 15, 20 years old and you
[36:33.280 --> 36:38.520]  know that Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds don't
[36:38.520 --> 36:46.280]  have the right to do this to you even if they think they're God and so we've got to figure
[36:46.280 --> 36:54.880]  out a way to expose them and to stop them and to then bring them to justice and that's
[36:54.880 --> 37:01.160]  really what this broadcast is all about.
[37:01.160 --> 37:09.360]  They say only a dog goes back to its vomit and after I've read these news articles three
[37:09.360 --> 37:15.520]  or four times, scanned over the rest, there's always an excitement when I'm first reading
[37:15.520 --> 37:21.840]  them and then more excitement as I research and cross reference them but then once I'm
[37:21.840 --> 37:31.920]  about to get on air and cover these, it's like remembering a bullet wound in your compatriot
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.760]  or remembering a car wreck where somebody you know got their arm chopped off.
[37:36.760 --> 37:40.760]  It's reliving it because that's the thing.
[37:40.760 --> 37:42.840]  I know that's why people don't want to deal with this.
[37:42.840 --> 37:44.600]  It's pretty frightening.
[37:44.600 --> 37:52.240]  Boy do I wish it wasn't true.
[37:52.240 --> 37:54.600]  I just want to be away from these people.
[37:54.600 --> 38:04.840]  I just want to be far away from what they've done to society but also how weak people are,
[38:04.840 --> 38:10.120]  how dumb down they are and how much even when they're shown how they're being enslaved,
[38:10.120 --> 38:15.720]  they don't have an instinct to fight back against it because the system has built a
[38:15.720 --> 38:22.800]  very soft extermination grid that just sucks your soul out and poisons you and puts you
[38:22.800 --> 38:31.280]  into a trance before it finally sinks its big long spiritual spider things into your
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.760]  soul and sucks you dry.
[38:36.760 --> 38:43.400]  But the reason I fight it is because my soul is fulfilled by fighting but it is painful
[38:43.400 --> 38:52.920]  watching people being sucked dry all around me and then I think about the people that
[38:52.920 --> 39:00.280]  serve Satan who actually get off on all this and think that they're getting great power
[39:00.280 --> 39:08.880]  out of serving this system and they have no idea the majesty, the completion, the peace,
[39:08.880 --> 39:11.640]  the true power of the Creator.
[39:11.640 --> 39:22.960]  They have not even an idea, the fulfillment of being in the presence of God.
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.000]  They're caught off from God.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.120]  And I know how they were seduced.
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.600]  I understand.
[39:36.600 --> 39:43.280]  I have entered the orbit of the spirit that they follow but I never landed.
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.040]  I never sat down and been in need to it and I could just tell the Satanists, the Luciferians
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.960]  and the servants of the fallen one, you think you're on the winning team, you think you
[39:53.960 --> 39:59.720]  know what power is, you have no idea.
[39:59.720 --> 40:06.160]  And I guess that's okay because God gave us free will and that's what you resonate to
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.440]  and that's what you want to be part of and that's what you want to be with.
[40:10.440 --> 40:19.800]  But you just have no idea about the power that God is.
[40:19.800 --> 40:27.040]  All right, I'm going to try to cover all this.
[40:27.040 --> 40:28.040]  There's so much.
[40:28.040 --> 40:30.640]  It's all so important.
[40:30.640 --> 40:34.880]  I've got the TV ads, the different ads to ban the beef and ban the chicken and ban the
[40:34.880 --> 40:37.000]  fish and ban vegetables that you grow.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  Those are bad too.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  They want to cut trees down.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.640]  They say trees are bad now and bury them because they're carbon based.
[40:42.640 --> 40:43.880]  I told you that was coming.
[40:43.880 --> 40:46.600]  It doesn't make sense.
[40:46.600 --> 40:48.520]  Your submission is what makes sense to them.
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.760]  I mean, the whole Western world, I see full grown men in their cars in Texas still wearing
[40:53.760 --> 41:05.400]  masks as a virtue signal and then the vaccine is what kills you.
[41:05.400 --> 41:09.760]  The first horribly manes most people and will just debilitate you for the rest of your life
[41:09.760 --> 41:13.360]  and then they'll just suck everything out of you in the next 5, 10 years while you slowly
[41:13.360 --> 41:14.360]  die.
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.520]  I guess the lucky ones are the ones that just have a heart attack immediately.
[41:19.520 --> 41:24.360]  I mean, I've got like 20 articles a day of well-known people dying, children dying, women
[41:24.360 --> 41:25.360]  dying.
[41:25.360 --> 41:26.360]  You can't even keep track of it.
[41:26.360 --> 41:27.680]  It's in the hundreds of thousands.
[41:27.680 --> 41:33.000]  15-year-old boy dies of heart attack two days after taking Pfizer vaccine, had no history
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.600]  of allergic reactions, no heart problems.
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.040]  But you see, it causes an autoimmune response and has your body attack the cells in the
[41:42.040 --> 41:53.520]  heart and the arteries because the proteins are identical to what is in the vaccine, the
[41:53.520 --> 41:56.200]  so-called vaccine.
[41:56.200 --> 41:59.760]  And we even knew this was going to happen before they even rolled it out.
[41:59.760 --> 42:03.640]  We specifically showed you this paper, a red shot, please.
[42:03.640 --> 42:05.760]  You know, I spent about three days reading this whole thing.
[42:05.760 --> 42:10.880]  You're like, well, it took you three days to just read 40-something pages?
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.440]  Well, there's links to studies.
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.840]  And I read the studies and watched the videos and all of it took well-known science here,
[42:20.840 --> 42:21.840]  all these top scientists.
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.520]  And they said, it's going to maybe have heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, it's going
[42:26.520 --> 42:31.280]  to attack the uterus, the testicles, and the lymph nodes, and the brain.
[42:31.280 --> 42:32.280]  And of course, it's all happening now.
[42:32.280 --> 42:38.200]  I mean, as they said, I mean, the guy that wrote it's the former chief scientist, Pfizer,
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.280]  and he said, this is to kill people.
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.080]  And it's going to kill you with heart attacks, strokes, it's going to sterilize women.
[42:45.080 --> 42:46.080]  And it's all happening.
[42:46.080 --> 42:49.080]  I mean, that's just it.
[42:49.080 --> 42:50.080]  And everybody loves it.
[42:50.080 --> 42:51.080]  Everybody loves it.
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.440]  And they're going to come forcibly shoot you up next.
[42:53.440 --> 43:00.080]  Like, I got videos of that when we come back, they're announcing forced inoculations.
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.880]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[43:04.880 --> 43:07.600]  for beta testing to operational.
[43:07.600 --> 43:12.360]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[43:12.360 --> 43:13.360]  takeover.
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.480]  But the good news is, we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been
[43:16.480 --> 43:21.400]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[43:21.400 --> 43:22.520]  Humanity is strong.
[43:22.520 --> 43:23.520]  We're incredible.
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.040]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[43:27.040 --> 43:29.680]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[43:29.680 --> 43:33.920]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[43:33.920 --> 43:35.600]  others is absolutely essential.
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.120]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[43:40.120 --> 43:43.800]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[43:43.800 --> 43:45.800]  also funding our operation.
[43:45.800 --> 43:46.800]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:46.800 --> 43:47.800]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[43:47.800 --> 43:53.480]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are
[43:53.480 --> 43:55.960]  back in like bodies, vasobites, and others.
[43:55.960 --> 44:00.080]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the Resistance.
[44:00.080 --> 44:03.480]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person.
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.320]  But because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last twenty-seven
[44:07.320 --> 44:11.160]  years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their
[44:11.160 --> 44:13.280]  money because of God.
[44:13.280 --> 44:16.720]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[44:16.720 --> 44:17.720]  a break.
[44:17.720 --> 44:18.720]  The statinism's out in the open.
[44:18.720 --> 44:22.520]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil
[44:22.520 --> 44:23.520]  is so clear.
[44:23.520 --> 44:24.520]  And I get it.
[44:24.520 --> 44:27.240]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches, a lot of you have been turned off
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.080]  by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too.
[44:31.080 --> 44:36.800]  Believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe
[44:36.800 --> 44:42.400]  that God created that is so essential, and God created the universe for us to have communion
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.280]  with God through and to have life, and so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[44:46.280 --> 44:48.360]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[44:48.360 --> 44:51.600]  Thank you for spreading the word about InfoWars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.520]  on air by visiting InfoWarsStore.com, because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases,
[44:56.520 --> 44:57.520]  we'll be taking off the air.
[44:57.520 --> 45:02.520]  So thank you for the support, InfoWarsStore.com.
[45:02.520 --> 45:07.240]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.640]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[45:13.640 --> 45:16.440]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[45:16.440 --> 45:19.920]  But let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News today, and thanks for your support.
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.200]  We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video radio stations and TV stations across
[45:24.200 --> 45:25.200]  the country.
[45:25.200 --> 45:28.800]  We're now on a min-game, censored and taken offline by Amazon, when it hit number one
[45:28.800 --> 45:29.800]  a few years ago.
[45:29.800 --> 45:34.680]  It's now available again, we have reprinted it on high quality DVD, in HD, it has a zero
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.080]  country code, meaning anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it, and I'm
[45:38.080 --> 45:41.760]  asking you to get the original, make copies, give it to everyone you know, get it on local
[45:41.760 --> 45:46.040]  access TV, give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers,
[45:46.040 --> 45:47.360]  whatever you do, warn the world.
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.160]  This film uses their own documents and oath statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[45:52.160 --> 45:57.280]  It's more important than ever, available at InfoWars.com, that's InfoWars.com, in-game
[45:57.280 --> 45:59.160]  blueprint for global enslavement.
[45:59.160 --> 46:06.000]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day, when the first world collapses,
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.800]  the third world dies.
[46:07.800 --> 46:12.560]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts, that when you
[46:12.560 --> 46:17.720]  shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[46:17.720 --> 46:19.320]  and really hurt the first world.
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.600]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States, and that's because
[46:23.600 --> 46:27.960]  the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering
[46:27.960 --> 46:32.120]  gas have been shut down, plus the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down along with other
[46:32.120 --> 46:33.120]  pipelines.
[46:33.120 --> 46:36.520]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[46:36.520 --> 46:37.680]  We're being shut down.
[46:37.680 --> 46:39.880]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[46:39.880 --> 46:42.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[46:42.680 --> 46:45.120]  The third world is imploding as well, the borders have been removed.
[46:45.120 --> 46:49.480]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist sitcom takeover, Gregory said, you have no
[46:49.480 --> 46:50.480]  hope.
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.280]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer,
[46:55.280 --> 46:58.760]  so they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.800]  and your family.
[47:03.800 --> 47:33.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:33.600 --> 47:35.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[47:35.600 --> 47:48.560]  So it was eight months ago that we began to specifically get more documents that were
[47:48.560 --> 47:51.680]  leaked out of governments that are now confirmed about how they were never going to end the
[47:51.680 --> 47:57.720]  lockdown and how the lockdowns were designed to create permanent carbon taxes and to shut
[47:57.720 --> 48:01.560]  down small businesses and consolidate corporate power, but we didn't need those documents,
[48:01.560 --> 48:06.280]  I'll show you some of those next hour, I'm going to show you all of them.
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.880]  Because we had Klaus Schwab talking about the Great Reset three years ago, you'll own
[48:11.880 --> 48:16.440]  nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll love it, and then publishing a book one month into
[48:16.440 --> 48:21.160]  the quote pandemic that was already written saying this is all about world government,
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.280]  all about carbon taxes, all about getting humans to stop consuming so much.
[48:26.280 --> 48:32.720]  Then we have videos of him admitting that, and him saying you won't eat beef anymore,
[48:32.720 --> 48:37.720]  you'll drink sewage water, you'll eat weeds, I've got Bill Gates saying that too, and
[48:37.720 --> 48:42.800]  you're like why would they sell something so dystopic?
[48:42.800 --> 48:46.360]  Because they've learned if they hit you with something horrible, people will Stockholm
[48:46.360 --> 48:53.760]  syndrome and submit to it, if you tell somebody something good or happy, they don't believe
[48:53.760 --> 48:54.760]  it.
[48:54.760 --> 48:59.200]  Hey, I got you the winning lottery ticket, but if you tell them, you're a bad person,
[48:59.200 --> 49:01.760]  it's for the good of the earth, I'm going to take something away from you, you're a
[49:01.760 --> 49:12.280]  hero, the left especially has a sadomasochistic vein, but also they want to administer it
[49:12.280 --> 49:20.360]  over everybody, so they also know that they like to be masochistic to you.
[49:20.360 --> 49:31.080]  So let's do this, remember this from eight months ago, fact check, world leaders are
[49:31.080 --> 49:39.480]  not encouraging a second wave of a coronavirus to push a global vaccination strategy, nor
[49:39.480 --> 49:42.560]  is there an IMF-backed program to steal everything you own.
[49:42.560 --> 49:48.240]  Really, they're funding the build back better, get rid of the middle class, universal incomes,
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.240]  bankrupt everybody, make a spore, that's all officially there, I'm going to show you
[49:52.240 --> 49:54.160]  them saying that.
[49:54.160 --> 50:02.520]  But here's the actual email, when I saw this last October, the crew was saying is this
[50:02.520 --> 50:06.440]  real from a government official laying out how it's all a power grab, and I said of course
[50:06.440 --> 50:12.040]  it's real, this is all directly out of Klaus Schwab in the UN, he's the head of sustainability
[50:12.040 --> 50:16.360]  at the UN, he works for Henry Kissinger, but I said regardless, somebody either took all
[50:16.360 --> 50:19.920]  the real documents, put it together to get attention, or it's a real document, well
[50:19.920 --> 50:25.920]  later we saw a month later, Canadian government officials reading from this and announcing
[50:25.920 --> 50:31.240]  permanent lockdowns and COVID centers and mass arrests, you'll have to have COVID passport
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.960]  to have a job or get on a plane, so yes, we knew this was all coming, people were asking
[50:35.960 --> 50:40.240]  me is this real, Bill Gates was on TV saying you'll never go back to normal until you have
[50:40.240 --> 50:47.120]  a vaccine passport, take at least five shots a year.
[50:47.120 --> 50:58.280]  But now, eight months later, nine months later what's going on, well, let me just show you,
[50:58.280 --> 51:04.320]  four of these articles from the last two days, CNN analyst says White House should tell Americans
[51:04.320 --> 51:09.080]  the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated.
[51:09.080 --> 51:16.560]  It's time to start shunning the vaccine hesitant, they're blocking COVID herd immunity and
[51:16.560 --> 51:20.520]  they go on to say don't let them travel, don't let them do anything until they have it.
[51:20.520 --> 51:26.240]  Here's the latest one, infowars.com, CNN government business should leverage power to force Americans
[51:26.240 --> 51:34.520]  to take the COVID-19 shot, and it is a shot, it's not a vaccine, it's a mutinogenic system.
[51:34.520 --> 51:39.040]  People used to freak out about them changing the genes of a tomato we eat, this is changing
[51:39.040 --> 51:47.280]  our genes, this makes our body attack proteins in our own body, they're giving us a giant
[51:47.280 --> 51:55.080]  autoimmune disorders, this is the most uncool thing, evil thing ever, and they're all saying
[51:55.080 --> 51:58.800]  it lots of times, here's the New York Times, why you shouldn't skip your second COVID shot,
[51:58.800 --> 52:03.600]  it says public officials soon are going to make you have this for workplaces, college
[52:03.600 --> 52:13.280]  campuses, airlines, more patrol agents for proof of vaccination, it's everywhere, oh
[52:13.280 --> 52:16.440]  no one will ever make you have a passport, no one will ever make you take it, that's
[52:16.440 --> 52:21.240]  Alex Jones, don't listen to him, what did Dr. Carlson say last week, he said well it
[52:21.240 --> 52:29.880]  looks like Alex Jones is right, I told Tucker and I told Joe Rogan and I told them all in
[52:29.880 --> 52:35.360]  February and last year I said this will never end, they'll ratchet it up, dial it back,
[52:35.360 --> 52:44.040]  ratchet it tighter, always closing the noose, it's not about me being right, it's in the
[52:44.040 --> 52:52.000]  damn operation lockstep and crimson contagion and event 201, they don't even hide it, Bill
[52:52.000 --> 52:59.000]  Gates got up and laughed on CBS News and went, and on Colbert he said this is all just a
[52:59.000 --> 53:06.200]  drill, soon terrorist will be releasing something far worse, they're laughing, it was funny
[53:06.200 --> 53:11.400]  on both shows and see they call us the virus, remember the head of the UN goes we need to
[53:11.400 --> 53:16.080]  control the virus, that means us and when Gates says terrorist are going to release
[53:16.080 --> 53:21.720]  it, he means we're terrorist on the earth, his earth, he's a guardian of the earth, we're
[53:21.720 --> 53:26.440]  known as terrorist and virus is by them, that's what they call virus and terrorist, that's
[53:26.440 --> 53:31.960]  their names, so when he says terrorists are going to release the next bio weapon, that's
[53:31.960 --> 53:42.080]  because the COVID mutagenic system goes in and makes your body slough real deadly viruses,
[53:42.080 --> 53:45.920]  so you see now the new bio attack has started and people are getting more sun now, it's
[53:45.920 --> 53:50.520]  still bad, a lot of people are dying, getting ill, having heart attacks, drugs, blood clots,
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.280]  but when the next winter comes and you don't have vitamin D3 for the public doesn't know,
[53:54.280 --> 53:59.760]  it's going to be mass death and there'll be new viruses from the COVID-19, which even
[53:59.760 --> 54:05.240]  NPR and Wall Street Journal and Nature magazine admit it's causing the real viruses, like
[54:05.240 --> 54:12.200]  he said soon the terrorist will attack you with new viruses, you are the terrorist, attacking
[54:12.200 --> 54:18.920]  the other terrorist, see they make us the engine of our own destruction, very funny
[54:18.920 --> 54:25.520]  Bill, very funny, that's how they describe us, I'm described by CNN by three of their
[54:25.520 --> 54:29.920]  hosts as a virus and I've talked to folks that have been in Bilderberg, when they refer
[54:29.920 --> 54:35.680]  to depopulation, they talk in code, they go, we must get the regime in place to eradicate
[54:35.680 --> 54:40.560]  the virus and other scientists that are there that aren't in on it, they go eradicate, we
[54:40.560 --> 54:47.440]  can eradicate a virus, you just get immunity, they go, the virus is people dumbass, so remember
[54:47.440 --> 54:50.720]  oh, none of that was coming eight, nine months ago, that was all made up, it wasn't going
[54:50.720 --> 54:54.600]  to mean now we're in a lockdown three around the world, oh, none of that's going to happen,
[54:54.600 --> 55:03.320]  none of that's going to happen, don't worry, so here is Smirkanish yesterday talking about
[55:03.320 --> 55:07.440]  how everyone needs to pressure you, government, with corporations, that's called fascism,
[55:07.440 --> 55:14.240]  here it is, it's the unvaccinated to do their part is the best approach to show them those
[55:14.240 --> 55:20.160]  who have had their shots are still wearing masks or would displays of our foregone freedoms
[55:20.160 --> 55:26.480]  in a pre-COVID world be more effective messaging, that's the carrot, here's another, in Chicago
[55:26.480 --> 55:31.440]  the public health commissioner just introduced a vax pass which residents can use to gain
[55:31.440 --> 55:36.880]  access to summer concerts, according to ABC, Dr. Allison R. Waddy, Chicago's public health
[55:36.880 --> 55:42.160]  commissioner stressed that the forthcoming pass quote is not a vaccine passport nor
[55:42.160 --> 55:46.880]  is it an app that businesses check before patrons can enter, instead it will be more
[55:46.880 --> 55:52.040]  similar to city passes that give residents the discounts, free admission to museums
[55:52.040 --> 55:57.960]  or let them skip lines to city attractions, but if this sort of encouragement fails, there's
[55:57.960 --> 56:03.920]  also the stick which could be wielded by government and the private sector, businesses have particular
[56:03.920 --> 56:09.240]  leverage as they can require employees to get vaccinations and restrict public access
[56:09.240 --> 56:14.640]  to private spaces like airlines, mass transit, most sporting and cultural venues, restaurants
[56:14.640 --> 56:20.120]  and movie theaters, writing in USA Today, Michael Stern, a former federal prosecutor
[56:20.120 --> 56:26.800]  said this, businesses should make vaccination a requirement for employment, a COVID outbreak
[56:26.800 --> 56:32.880]  can shut down a business and be financially devastating, they hold you hostage, they tell
[56:32.880 --> 56:37.200]  you're not essential, they lock you down and now you're a prisoner, you'll be a trustee,
[56:37.200 --> 56:40.720]  the prosecutor tells you, if you do what he says, we'll let you out of the prison, that's
[56:40.720 --> 56:43.080]  how they hold you hostage.
[56:43.080 --> 56:47.960]  And so it's here, it's the global passport, it doesn't protect you, they still wear the
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.440]  mask, let an article on info wars where Democrats are still wearing it, saying it's their religion,
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.560]  it's their cult, they don't want to be associated with Trump, this is mass Stockholm syndrome
[56:56.560 --> 57:03.000]  as I say, here is one of the other CNN medical corresponded saying the same thing, here it
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  is.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.080]  It can reduce the level of infection in the community, increase vaccination rates, that's
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.120]  when at some point, hopefully soon, but at some point, we can relax the restrictions.
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.520]  I don't know if that works for many Americans, for many people it probably does work to say
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.560]  yes, we're in this together, it's patriotic, we're doing this together, but I think a lot
[57:20.560 --> 57:24.360]  of people are thinking kind of selfishly, thinking what's in it for me, and they're
[57:24.360 --> 57:29.120]  not willing to wait until this elusive herd immunity, if we can tell those individuals
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.880]  who otherwise would not get vaccinated, if we say to them the moment of freedom for
[57:33.880 --> 57:39.000]  you is when you get vaccinated, when you reach the two week mark, these are people who otherwise
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.560]  might not be vaccinated, so let's give them that incentive.
[57:42.560 --> 57:47.280]  Remember, remember they said that was false just eight months ago, now it's all indebted,
[57:47.280 --> 57:50.160]  they're following the plan exactly, stay with us.
[57:50.160 --> 57:53.360]  Gerald and South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[57:53.360 --> 57:54.360]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.640]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason, and amongst all
[57:58.640 --> 58:02.840]  this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year,
[58:02.840 --> 58:09.800]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.720]  Living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years, that almost
[58:14.720 --> 58:17.080]  killed me, living defense brought me back.
[58:17.080 --> 58:22.800]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now, this
[58:22.800 --> 58:29.560]  is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall
[58:29.560 --> 58:35.920]  kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be
[58:35.920 --> 58:39.800]  offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[58:39.800 --> 58:41.640]  That's right where we're at brother.
[58:41.640 --> 58:46.080]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[58:46.080 --> 58:51.000]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[58:51.000 --> 58:56.880]  I recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call in the background, and I made the
[58:56.880 --> 59:00.440]  point that hey, the cavalry is here, but it's really true.
[59:00.440 --> 59:04.040]  Listeners are incredible, and we're able to keep these great products in stock.
[59:04.040 --> 59:08.120]  We were able to fund ourselves last year, and actually dig ourselves somewhat out of
[59:08.120 --> 59:13.120]  a hole that we've been in, because I expanded so much for the 2020 election.
[59:13.120 --> 59:14.840]  But thanks to you, we're still on air.
[59:14.840 --> 59:19.360]  But now because of the shutdown in production, and because of slowdowns, with the whole COVID
[59:19.360 --> 59:22.880]  lockdowns and supply chain, a lot of our best-selling products have not been available for months
[59:22.880 --> 59:25.600]  and months and months, some for six months, some have been discontinued.
[59:25.600 --> 59:30.280]  But the cavalry is here now in our funding, because a lot of these products are finally
[59:30.280 --> 59:31.440]  coming back in.
[59:31.440 --> 59:36.120]  Trostegard, Vazobeats, Alpha Power, and of course, Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula are
[59:36.120 --> 59:38.120]  all in our top 10 best-sellers.
[59:38.120 --> 59:43.600]  Our second best-seller is Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, 95% of humanoid, it is back
[59:43.600 --> 59:46.840]  in stock right now, 50% off at m4store.com.
[59:46.840 --> 59:53.920]  So really, you are the cavalry when you order these products at m4store.com.
[59:53.920 --> 1:00:11.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:14.480]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:20.040]  The virus hysteria and the deadly vaccines, where the disease is a lot better than the
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:22.520]  cure, is just one prong of the attack.
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:26.600]  The other prong is giant third world enslaved populations, being brainwashed and weaponized
[1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:27.600]  against the West.
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:32.760]  Dan Lyman from EuropeWars.com joins us on the big reports of top French generals saying
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:36.040]  that civil war is imminent, that Islam is taking over.
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:39.520]  The government responded by saying, we are Islam, literally.
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:40.520]  So that's coming up.
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:45.680]  Then we're going to continue after he leaves us with the incredible news of the Great Reset
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.680]  and some huge, big developments at the bottom of the hour.
[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:52.320]  But first, I wanted to play a short clip with Becker Carlson talking about UFOs.
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:56.280]  The UFOs we're seeing are man-made and are owned by different governments.
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:01.360]  And I can guarantee you from what I've seen, this is US, Russian and Chinese based systems.
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:02.360]  Here's the report.
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:07.600]  On this story, we should have spent a lot more time because this could be the most consequential
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.960]  thing to happen to this country, to this world, maybe ever.
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:16.080]  In June, the United States government has set to release a public report on everything
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:18.160]  it knows about UFOs.
[1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:22.560]  Lou Elizondo was the former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:24.560]  He's been on the show a number of times.
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:29.400]  He just spoke to the New York Post about what that report will show.
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:36.920]  According to Elizondo, we will find an intelligence failure on the part of the US Intel community
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:38.400]  on the level of 9-11.
[1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:41.040]  Yeah, that's a problem.
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:44.320]  And too few have considered it from that perspective.
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:49.360]  Nick Pope is a former official from the UK and perfectly positioned to answer the obvious
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:51.440]  question, which is, why didn't we see this coming?
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:52.440]  He joins us now.
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:54.360]  Nick, thanks so much for coming on.
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:58.120]  I thought Lou made a very solid point, and I'm embarrassed I hadn't thought of it before,
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:03.560]  which is this is, among other things, whatever these objects are, a potentially very grave
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:05.680]  threat to nation states.
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:11.040]  So where was the intelligence community in warning about this and learning more about
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:15.640]  it, where were they?
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:17.640]  Well that has to be answered, absolutely.
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:20.040]  I mean, we are under siege.
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:23.600]  It's like there's a war of nerves going on.
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:31.040]  And if this was drones belonging to a foreign adversary, there would be an absolute outcray.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.080]  And yet, the situation we're in that we don't know what these things are, and they might
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:37.960]  even be extraterrestrial, that's worse.
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:40.320]  So I agree with Lou Elizondo on this.
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.560]  This is a potential catastrophic failure of intelligence.
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:50.400]  And if it happened because skeptical bureaucrats were just saying to themselves, it can't be
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:54.600]  therefore it isn't, then there must be a reckoning.
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:59.680]  So you say, and that is such a great point and nicely put, but you described it as a
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:00.680]  siege.
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:05.280]  Give our viewers who don't follow this topic closely a sense of the magnitude of data coming
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:10.640]  in about these encounters.
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:13.320]  Yeah, I mean, this is absolutely extraordinary.
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:18.240]  And every day it seems like new information drops, things that the public and the media
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:19.240]  weren't told.
[1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:24.240]  So, for example, former director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, just threw into
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.040]  the conversation the other day the fact that the satellite imagery of all this and some
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:35.480]  of the speeds being reported seem to blow the theory about foreign drones out of the
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:36.480]  water.
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:38.520]  We must be told what's going on here.
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:44.840]  And we should think of this upcoming report to Congress as an intelligence assessment
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:50.280]  of the phenomenon itself and one that's long overdue.
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:51.280]  There are a lot of these.
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:55.480]  This is not like, you know, some drunk guy in a rural road in northern New Hampshire
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:56.480]  saw something weird.
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:03.720]  I mean, is the U.S. military regularly, very often, recording these objects?
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:06.640]  Yes, absolutely.
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:13.720]  It's pilots, it's radar operators, it's satellite data, it's measurement and signature intelligence.
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:18.840]  There's such a lot of information now, so much that the U.S. Navy has instructions for
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:22.120]  its pilots on what to do if they encounter these things.
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:27.640]  Now, I think as we go into May, the run-up to this report going to Congress, there's
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:32.400]  going to be a lot of things going on behind the scenes, a lot of politicking, jockeying
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:37.440]  for position, factions trying to kind of have their say on this.
[1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:44.760]  I anticipate more leaks of information, photos, videos, documents, there's a lot more to
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:45.760]  tell.
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:46.760]  Absolutely.
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:48.680]  They are rolling it out everywhere that the aliens are getting ready to attack, they're
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:52.800]  definitely planning a fake-stage alien invasion, they've seen documents on that 20, 30 years
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:54.800]  ago and they're definitely building to record something big.
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:59.720]  The globalists have a lot of hooks to set.
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:04.680]  Last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission and he said to me, he said,
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:09.120]  Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:13.600]  dying from it and people getting sick, how do I reach out to my friends and family and
[1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:16.720]  explain to them and to warn them about the danger?
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:21.120]  And I said to him, something very profound because it's so true, trust your gut, trust
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:23.120]  your spirit with the Bible tells us.
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:28.760]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:29.760]  vaccine?
[1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.560]  And his answer was, no, they don't feel good about it, so go with your gut.
[1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:37.520]  Well, let me ask you again, how does your gut feel about getting a storeable food?
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:40.360]  How does your gut feel about getting out in the countryside?
[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:43.200]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.320]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.
[1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:48.360]  We have the best storeable food at the highest quality, at the lowest prices you're going
[1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:54.680]  to find, 10% off at infowarstore.com right now or for Paradox.com.
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:06:24.480]  So go with your gut and find the infowar, infowarstore.com.
[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:25.480]  All right.
[1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:31.960]  Dan Lyman is a great investigative journalist who lives in Europe, but he's an American
[1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:36.840]  and he ends up several big websites, but he's also the chief head and main reporter for
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:42.040]  EuropeWars.com and he writes amazing investigative reports every day.
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:46.520]  He routinely goes out in the field to no-go zones, anti-va zones, Islamic zones that are
[1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:51.200]  far worse than what you even see here in the United States, I'd say 50 times worse, just
[1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:53.000]  incredible scenes.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:58.920]  And so a whole list of top generals, a former and some current, came out about a week ago
[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:03.000]  and said, or a week and a half ago and said, we're on the verge of total civil war.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.760]  The Muslims are tagging over, they're attacking the police, they're burning hundreds of cars
[1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:11.000]  a week, burning buildings, raping people, and a lot of French leaders have declared,
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.240]  no, we are under Islam.
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:13.240]  They actually support it.
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:17.480]  It's part of the cucking under the great reset, replacement migration.
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:24.240]  And Macron has said they want 230 million North Africans and Middle Easterners to, quote,
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:30.080]  take over France alone, that they officially said that, that's probably what, 600 plus
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:33.600]  million people to come to the U.S. out of the U.N. replacement migration as well.
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:37.120]  And again, these are the third world populations that the globalists have helped implode, that
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:40.360]  they then load up and bring in for total destabilization.
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:46.920]  And so it's a big deal to have the French military come out and say this.
[1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:54.720]  Macron has promised to punish them, poll majority of French agree with military generals, that
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:56.800]  the country is heading towards civil war.
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:02.240]  And then the polls found the majority of French people support the sentiments expressed in
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:06.480]  a letter signed by active duty and retired members, the military that warned the country
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:11.280]  is heading towards civil war, caused by failed multiculturalism and attacks on French identity.
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:15.320]  1,000 service members, including former and current top generals, you name it.
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:20.160]  So I want to get Dan Lyman on about that because we don't just have the globalists devaluing
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:22.560]  our currencies, opening our borders.
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:26.880]  We don't just have them creating fear over these exaggerated viruses and giving us poisonous
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:32.320]  vaccines that wound the population and further bankrupt things.
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:34.880]  But they're also really trying to cause a civil war.
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:39.760]  And in Europe and now in the U.S., if you criticize it, even they were trying to put
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:47.400]  Le Pen, who's a very popular woman or father, one of the main leaders over in France, trying
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:52.120]  to put her in prison for even talking about this.
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:54.240]  The ADL has said, arrest me for talking about it.
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:57.800]  If you say replacement migration, they want you arrested in America.
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:58.800]  They've called for my arrest.
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:00.360]  So this is just next level.
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:03.680]  And so all of this is very, very serious.
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:08.240]  And then now they say, if you were against open borders and globalism, you're a white
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:14.640]  supremacist, and Biden said in his speech this last week, the joint address, not the
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:17.520]  State of the Union, everything's different now, you see?
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:21.240]  Can't say republic or he can't say union.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:25.240]  He said, if you oppose me, you're a white supremacist and we'll use the Pentagon on you.
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:27.880]  So this is reached purge level.
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:28.880]  It's not coming.
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:29.880]  We're already here.
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:33.520]  COVID is the martial law background, the excuse for being poor and not being able to leave
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:34.960]  your house.
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:40.760]  But now they're going to bring in the next phase of this.
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:43.920]  Dan Lyman joins us to talk about these incredible developments.
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:45.600]  Dan, thanks for joining us.
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:47.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:48.800]  This is an incredible situation.
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:53.040]  I think a lot of people have been wondering what would happen in France because they are
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:57.280]  kind of the furthest down the rabbit hole, so to speak, in terms of the amount of migrants
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:00.120]  that they brought in and the Islamization of the country.
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:04.680]  They have by far the largest Islamic population in all of Europe.
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:08.840]  So I think a lot of people have been looking to that country to see how that's going to
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:11.640]  play out and what will be done about that.
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:17.040]  And we eye France at Info Wars Europe every day because, to be honest, I could probably
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:23.480]  cover between three and seven shocking stories of mob attacks typically on police that take
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:27.920]  place on basically a daily basis in France around the cities.
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:32.600]  And in general, I mean, most of the attacks are shocking and they are executed by sometimes
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:35.200]  as many as a hundred people at a time.
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:39.640]  And so we are watching the de-evolution of society there.
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:41.960]  And all over the world, this is all Soros' run.
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:43.520]  He's on record running it.
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:46.360]  So the police are never back when they're attacked.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:48.520]  They're importing mobs that are protected.
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:52.680]  So the police are told, attack the yellow vests that are working class French.
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:53.760]  Attack any national groups.
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:58.080]  Same thing in the U.K., same thing in the U.S., but then these anti-fub Black Lives Matter
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:02.280]  and Islamic groups, they can literally burn, murder, do anything they want.
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:03.800]  Why is that?
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:06.160]  Absolutely, that's true.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:10.200]  We've covered yellow vests a few times on the ground when that was really raging a couple
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:11.200]  of years ago.
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:18.640]  And what I noticed was in general, yellow vests are all working class, middle class type folks
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:23.720]  who are there peacefully voicing their opposition to what's going on in their country.
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:28.960]  But it was almost always that the ne'er-do-wells who were using that as an opportunity to create
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:34.160]  chaos were either anti-fa or migrants, and I witnessed a lot of that firsthand, especially
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:35.440]  after dark.
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:41.360]  I came upon multiple scenes where people had thrown Molotov cocktails into hotels and
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.160]  restaurants, and if the police were on hand and they managed to catch anyone nine times
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:49.000]  out of ten, it was migrants or anti-fa-looking types.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:55.880]  So they are using both of these basically paramilitary forces on the ground in France
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:12:01.560]  to wreak havoc, as they did, of course, on Saturday, May Day, they do that every year.
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.600]  It's basically baked into the system at this point that France will burn on May Day, and
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:07.160]  we cover that basically every year.
[1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:11.720]  It's nothing new, but this has become basically a daily occurrence now, depending on where
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:14.560]  you are in France at any given time.
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:15.880]  And of course, it's a pincer attack.
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:19.160]  For those who don't know who the yellow vests are popping up three, four years ago, they're
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:23.920]  putting huge taxes on fuel, carbon taxes, huge taxes on fertilizer, carbon taxes, putting
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:28.920]  huge regulations on even organic farming to shut down production, the people are going
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:37.960]  bankrupt that have lived there since Cro-Magnon, I mean, literally, in those French areas,
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:40.040]  and they even have the cave people going bankrupt.
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:42.880]  They're not even allowed to cook food, people who don't know, people who have been living
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:46.120]  in caves for the 10,000 years, also in areas of France.
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:48.080]  They're being driven out by the Islamists.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:50.600]  And so where are Europeans supposed to go?
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:53.200]  Because we're being told that Europe's not even for Europeans anymore.
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:57.960]  Again, this is a globalist pincer attack, shutting off the food, shutting off the energy,
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:01.640]  then bringing in all these outside groups and playing us off against each other.
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:05.360]  What's the end game strategy of this pincer attack?
[1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:09.880]  Well, I think the end game ultimately has always been civil war.
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:14.600]  But if you say that or you hint at that or you say what the root causes might be, then
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:19.760]  of course, you get denounced as an extremist far right white supremacist Nazi, blah, blah,
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:20.760]  blah.
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:25.920]  And of course, I think what they really want is kind of a low energy civil war going on
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:30.800]  at all times in Europe to keep all the decent people, all the working class people, all
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:34.480]  the people who would really do care about their country, to keep them on their heels
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:38.760]  and afraid to say anything and also afraid to leave their homes in many cases.
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:43.880]  I'll say the first time that I was ever in Paris was in 2012, and I was a bit more naive
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:45.040]  at that time.
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:48.000]  And I found myself getting off the train into a no-go zone.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.760]  There was not a single French appearing person in sight.
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:53.760]  And I was shocked at what I encountered.
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:58.320]  And every time that I've been back to Paris since, reluctantly, of course, I have found
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:01.760]  that the city of light is degenerating at warp speed.
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.400]  It really is incredible.
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:07.320]  And everywhere you go in that city now is falling apart, of course.
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:11.160]  And the COVID situation and the lockdowns there have only made that worse.
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:13.040]  And this is done by design.
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:14.640]  The globalists control the printing presses.
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:15.880]  They control all the money.
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:16.880]  They want to depress things.
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:17.880]  This is a form of war.
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:21.600]  So no matter where you are in the world, we're leftists and globalists run things.
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:29.480]  Piles of feces, homeless, fentanyl, murder, rape, collapse, towards a larger total civilizational
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:34.000]  collapse where we then basically beg for total fascism and control.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:37.640]  They admit that that's really the model they're carrying out.
[1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:43.840]  So France, I've read, tourism's down before COVID, more than 60%, now down over 90%.
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:44.840]  People are all going bankrupt.
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:47.040]  Well, that's the plan.
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:48.040]  Oh, sure.
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:49.040]  Absolutely.
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:53.160]  Tourism has been bombing in France for years, especially with all of the protests that were
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:57.480]  going on during the Yellow Vest era, because things were so tenuous there.
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:01.960]  I would say downright dangerous, many of the times that I was there, had to go there in
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:04.040]  the helmets and goggles and the whole deal.
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:08.440]  And even kind of on the sidelines as a reporter, things were pretty dicey.
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:12.760]  But it's really sad to see what's become of France, because I know if you look back
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:15.400]  just a few decades ago, things were completely different.
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:20.800]  And that to this day is still the dream destination of the more naive types who think that France
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:23.160]  and Paris is what it was previously.
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:25.520]  But that is simply just not the case.
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.320]  Is it a filthy, decaying city?
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:32.560]  Listen, I've talked to contractors who've been in all the agencies, they've been all
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:33.560]  the world.
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:38.320]  They say France, especially Paris, is one of the worst places they've been in the world.
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:43.280]  I mean, they said it is literally an Islamic capital, and then you literally see the French
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:48.200]  women kidnapped being sold as sex slaves, just like the grooming in the UK, and the police
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:50.240]  are a bunch of cowards that go along with it.
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:51.240]  This is the leftist takeover.
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:16:13.200]  Stay there damn long, and we'll come back and ask you where all this is going.

[1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:58.360]  The cavalry is here.
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:03.120]  Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:04.920]  the third world dies.
[1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:09.680]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:14.840]  shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:16.280]  and really hurt the first world.
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:20.720]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States, and that's because
[1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:25.080]  the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:26.560]  gas have been shut down.
[1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:30.160]  Plus, the Keystone Pipelines have been shut down along with other pipelines.
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:33.600]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:34.800]  We're being shut down.
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:36.880]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:39.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:41.160]  The third world is imploding as well.
[1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:44.960]  The borders have been removed until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover.
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:47.360]  Gregory said, you have no hope.
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:52.360]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:55.800]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:59.600]  and your family.
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:09.120]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:16.880]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality, specifically
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:23.920]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:24.920]  in males.
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:30.960]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:36.000]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:43.120]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:48.280]  perfect, sacredicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:49.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.760]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:58.800]  Never been a better time than right now, Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:01.400]  CNN has almost no viewers.
[1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:06.480]  The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the world as a pack of anti-free
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:07.480]  speech liars.
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:10.920]  But that doesn't mean that they don't have power, just like the Southern Property Law
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:12.400]  Center, that's just as bad.
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:16.600]  They represent the globalist, the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:20.880]  backs communist China and its death camps, and they back bringing those similar systems
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:26.280]  here to America, and they've even officially called the ADL for my arrest for my speech
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:29.880]  and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested for free speech as well.
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:31.760]  These are very, very dangerous times.
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:33.280]  They don't want us to be on air.
[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:35.000]  You funding our operation is critical.

[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:20.440]  I've got a tiger by the tail explained to see, I won't be much when you get through
[1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:29.600]  with me, I'm losing weight and turning by the tail, and it looks like I've got a tiger
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:30.600]  by the tail.
[1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:37.120]  Be sure to check out EuropeWars.com, it's a totally different website, focused on the
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:41.000]  global state down in Europe and the UK, and how to fight back against it.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.080]  Dan Lyman's weather's for another segment, then I'm going to get back into the incredible,
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:53.480]  I mean, just over the top news of what scientists warned in Europe last year these vaccines
[1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:57.080]  would do, and that would be attack all the protein in your body and kill you, and now
[1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:58.080]  it's happening.
[1:20:58.080 --> 1:21:05.760]  A bunch of Churchill said there are times paraphrasing him when history runs over you,
[1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:08.960]  and most people get run over by a big event, they just kind of dust themselves off and
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:12.400]  forget it happened, but there are those that decide to actually be part of history and
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:17.560]  not just let it run them over, and we are in one of those periods of history right now.
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:21.600]  Every generation has wars, their own crises, but they say every two or three generations
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:26.440]  there's a really big event, and this is modern warfare, this is globalist economic takeover
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:30.760]  by the technocrats, by the big banks, using immigrant populations they've already exploited
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:36.080]  in the third world, using the COVID lockdown to vertically integrate wealth and power,
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:39.960]  and they're just getting started, they admit they're just getting started, and it's critical
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:46.240]  to expose the fact that it's officially the UN running the invasion of the Islamists
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:51.280]  and others, it's essential that we expose, it's essential to expose that the great reset
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:55.160]  and the COVID system is used for control, because the globalists are so arrogant, damn
[1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:59.800]  they brag about it, can you speak to why they're so arrogant and how we put pressure on them
[1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:04.000]  to stop, because they're just committing incredible crimes out in the open, I mean it is toward
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:10.520]  Soros and the UN running the open borders and doing this.
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:15.000]  We exposed a couple of years ago, you probably recall that many of the migrants that are
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.480]  entering into Europe, especially those that were coming up through the Balkans were doing
[1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:24.720]  so with prepaid debit cards that were loaded on with Mastercard logos, they had UN logos
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:30.240]  on them, UNHCR, and eventually because of that report, it would turn into a really big
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:34.760]  international story, and Hungary was able to pressure the EU into admitting that they
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:40.040]  were spending tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars in loading these cards
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:45.480]  to basically fund the trip for all these people coming in, and also we uncovered shortly
[1:22:45.480 --> 1:22:50.560]  before that, a year or two before Soros announced exactly this article on the screen here that
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:55.000]  Soros and Mastercard were partnering up to basically fund a migrant invasion, and of
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.440]  course we're seeing the same thing now coming up through the southern border of the United
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:01.800]  States, many of them are being found to either be carrying...
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:05.480]  It's the main guy that ran the Syrian invasion into the Balkans, you just mentioned, he's
[1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:11.040]  gotten billions, broken up at 530 million here, 200 million there, it's already a billion
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:15.840]  bucks and this one guy runs the whole thing, the same guy that ran the collapse of the
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:17.840]  European border.
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:21.280]  Not exactly, and of course Info Wars has been down at the southern border of the United
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:25.840]  States recently, Owen did all that great reporting there, you have migrants that are getting
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:30.720]  on planes with envelopes full of cash, and you have to ask yourself, where is that cash
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:35.400]  coming from, who is it being channeled through, and of course we could probably look to what
[1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:38.160]  has gone on in Europe to see a lot of the same players.
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:43.520]  Sure, Nigel Farage tries to oppose it, some of the Republicans oppose it, Trump did, but
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:49.960]  where are the conservatives in Europe and the US, this is all illegal, this is human
[1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:53.840]  smuggling, this is destroyed, why are they still backing it?
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:59.800]  No absolutely, and what we've seen though is that the EU and these dictators here in
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:06.040]  Europe are so powerful, you had Matteo Salvini by a miracle ended up at the very top of the
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:10.120]  Italian government and they managed to be rid of him quickly, they flushed him out,
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:15.760]  and you also had Shracha in Austria was doing a great job there, they flushed him out with
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:19.600]  a fake scandal, Le Pen probably should have won the last election,
[1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:23.880]  Stole the election from Trump, absolutely, only got hanging on to Bolsonaro.
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:29.920]  Yeah, incredibly, and of course they are out to get him 24-7, and you know even some of
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:34.160]  the heroes that we have had in Europe that have done a great job on the immigration situation,
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:40.360]  such as Viktor Orban in Hungary have proven to be totally bowing down to the globalist
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:43.800]  agenda when it comes to COVID, he's locked the whole country down and basically said
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:47.840]  we're not reopening until we hit so and so many vaccinations and everyone needs to be
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:51.880]  vaccinated, Poland has been disappointing and they're handling of COVID as well, locking
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:57.000]  down the whole country, so there are very few people that are standing up for Europeans,
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.580]  but I think that we're starting to see a shift, the unfortunate thing is that no matter how
[1:25:01.580 --> 1:25:07.160]  it plays out, it's probably going to be what these generals warned about because the globalists,
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:11.520]  not only are they not going to allow it to happen without a fight, but they also have
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:16.240]  their military wings on the ground already being incredibly violent and they will obviously
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:17.240]  ratchet that up.
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:21.040]  Well that was my question I should have asked up front, with generals finally bucking this
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:26.320]  and the French really pissed even liberal, you know, political pundits saying this is
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:33.800]  too much, life is unlivable, why won't the system back off?
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.760]  Your guess is as good as mine, but I feel like they're probably so deep in this now,
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:41.480]  especially with the progress that they've essentially made in the last year and a half,
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:46.080]  that they probably don't want to lose any ground, they did lose a little bit of ground
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.560]  of course just because of what Trump was able to accomplish in the US and Brexit and some
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:54.520]  of these populist nationalist victories in Europe, they did lose some ground and I think
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:59.720]  that they probably brought in the entire COVID situation earlier than planned in order to
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:04.200]  regain some of their lost footing and I don't think that they plan to give any of that up
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:05.200]  now.
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.320]  Well that's right, as messy as all this looks, this is war, so they think they can clean
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:12.040]  it up later after they've already conquered Europe because you conquer people as the UN
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:17.160]  says with migrant populations and with viruses, they got documents 12 years ago, 13 years
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:21.840]  ago, Blue Dobs did that actually stated all this, in closing Dan Lyman from EuropeWars.com,
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:26.760]  what an important site to visit daily, what an important site for everybody to share.
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:29.800]  Where do you see this going with the French and now with these generals going public?
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.600]  It took a lot of courage for them, I know McCross talking about punishing them.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:38.040]  He's talking about punishing the ones that he can punish technically, the active duty
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:40.160]  which there are only a few dozen of them.
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:45.600]  I have seen some reports that the thousand or so soldiers that signed on has bloomed
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:50.920]  to 7,000, I do need to verify that of course but I have seen that that number is growing
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:56.480]  and I would imagine the tide has to be turning in France because if the generals realize
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:59.520]  and the military realize their back is against the wall and they're willing to take this
[1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:03.760]  very dramatic step and put themselves out there and their necks on the line, then I
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:07.280]  would imagine the people are feeling the same as well and that's borne out in the polling
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:12.280]  of course and so the situation in France has become so untenable.
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:17.040]  The only problem is in what these generals said is correct, I do fear that whatever
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:20.920]  the solution is, if they do work to take their country back, if for any reason Le Pen is
[1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:25.960]  able to have some success in the coming election, I do feel that it will be a dangerous and
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:30.160]  volatile and potentially deadly situation in France in the coming months and years.
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:34.760]  I don't want to see another French Revolution but they're begging for another storming of
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:39.960]  the Bastille, I mean they're already letting a communist revolution happen and so I mean
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:43.960]  I'm telling you the establishment is really playing with fire over there.
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:48.240]  Absolutely, the coup has already happened, the globalists have affected that coup.
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:53.000]  Anything beyond this now in retaliation would be considered a counter coup in my opinion
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:59.160]  and if you do recall Macron had to be evacuated at least once from his residence during the
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:03.720]  Yellow Vest protests because they did come up to the gates and they did pose a genuine
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:05.560]  threat to the property there.
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:09.360]  All it's going to take is the police shooting people and a real revolution is going to start
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:13.560]  and so they're trying to claim the capitals on purpose or this or that, no, it's the
[1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:16.520]  system pushing conflict, they're the ones that already started it.
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:20.160]  I don't want this to explode but they're starting a fight.
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:24.200]  Yeah we don't want to see any violence at all, I mean that's just terrible but I think
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:28.360]  at this point the globalists have invited so much violence that is occurring on a daily
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:32.320]  basis in France now that the blood's on their hands.
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:35.320]  Absolutely and the more they squeeze, the more they put carbon taxes in starving people,
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:36.320]  what do they expect?
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:39.920]  It's what tyrants do over and over again, it's their psychotic nature.
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:45.120]  Europe Wars dot com, Europe Wars dot com, Dan Lyman, great job, we follow your reporting

[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:58.720]  Please take action today, protect your privacy and fund the info war.
[1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:04.600]  I recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call in the background and I made the
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:08.200]  point today the cavalry is here but it's really true.
[1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:11.880]  Listeners are incredible and when we're able to keep these great products in stock we were
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:16.720]  able to fund ourselves last year and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole that
[1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:21.480]  we've been in because I expanded so much for the 2020 election but thanks to you we're
[1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:22.600]  still on air.
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:27.120]  But now because of the shutdown in production and because of slowdowns with the whole COVID
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:30.400]  lockdowns and supply chain, a lot of our best selling products have not been available for
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:33.720]  months and months and months, some for six months, some have been discontinued but the
[1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:38.320]  cavalry is here now in our funding because a lot of these products are finally coming
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:39.320]  back in.
[1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:43.880]  Prosthegard, Vazzo Beats, Alpha Power and of course Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula are
[1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:45.840]  all in our top 10 best sellers.

[1:30:59.240 --> 1:31:05.680]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:10.120]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:16.320]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective is the world domination.
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:21.920]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:27.800]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:31.840]  The globalist feared this film made 14 years ago, it is the blueprint for their plan to
[1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:32.840]  figure the world.
[1:31:32.840 --> 1:31:36.440]  It is the blueprint for the great restat, it is in game, blueprint for global enslavement
[1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:40.720]  available right now at infowarstore dot com with a zero country code meaning you can make

[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:03.680]  It was our number two best selling product until the ongoing covid lockdowns destroyed
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.960]  the supply chain and it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:08.960]  formula.
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:12.120]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap, that's why this one's
[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:13.120]  white.

[1:33:01.560 --> 1:33:17.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:24.920]  You're tuned in to the program that tyrants, pedophiles, globalists, communists, dual overtypes
[1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:31.080]  absolutely hate because we do our research and we draw millions and millions of people
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:36.320]  who have a race, color and creed that want freedom and want to be aware of what's really
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:41.520]  going on and we document what we say here.
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:45.640]  And we've proven track record of being accurate and they know we have that credibility.
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:52.800]  And so we wear it like a badge of honor that we are so lied about and vilified by enemies
[1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:55.040]  of free humanity.
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:59.240]  You know, a lot of these stacks I've got here, I'm going to start getting to right now.
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:01.320]  I think some of this is so much research here.
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:05.320]  I'll continue on tomorrow, but I'm going to do my best to run at this now and then cover
[1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:10.680]  some more of it next hour with Tom Pappert joining me and then he will segue off and
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:12.680]  host the rest of the transmission.
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:18.440]  Oh, and Troyer normally hosts Sunday Live 6 to 8 PM right after my 4 to 6 PM transmission
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:24.240]  is taking a few days of rest well-deserved off and Tom Pappert will be hosting the war
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:29.440]  tomorrow at 3 PM central as well, don't forget Harrison Smith doing a splendid job with a
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:33.880]  morning's 8 AM with American Journal.
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:38.240]  Final videos, all the live feeds and the rest of it at band.video.info, wars.com, sports
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:39.240]  last show.
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:45.480]  Okay, so let me redirect you back to where we were at the start of the show.
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:55.480]  And this is so upsetting to me, all of this is so upsetting that it's not like I want
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:01.960]  to give up, it's the opposite of that feeling, it's like I want to go for like a month to
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:08.400]  the mountains by myself and decide what I'm going to do because I'm not threatening violence,
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:10.760]  I'm not even applying that.
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:17.840]  I'm just saying we're being assaulted, we're under military attack and we have to decide
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:23.000]  what are we going to do about this legally, lawfully and everybody listening, here's
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.280]  the deal.
[1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:31.400]  They did two rounds of anthrax experimental shots during the first Gulf War and then
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:40.600]  again in 2001 and even mainline news and then Congress estimates 34,000 servicemen and
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:45.880]  women die in an experimental vaccine that the Pentagon just decided to give people.
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:52.960]  Now, I'm not a biologist but I am quite a voracious reader of biology.
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:58.280]  I always knew that scientists believe anthrax may be the oldest life form on earth, I always
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:03.000]  knew they thought if there is life on Mars that could live there still, it'd be anthrax.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:07.280]  They've dug up 10,000 year old anthrax that's still alive.
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:14.400]  You can't kill anthrax, you can't radiate it, you can't cut it up with a micro knife.
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:21.360]  All you can do is burn it at about 1,000 degrees and if you totally desiccate it, then it's
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:22.360]  dead.
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:29.840]  Now, I was on air when the second round of shots came around and I had medical doctors
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:36.520]  and scientists on and whistleblowers at congressional hearings and I watched Marine Corps captains
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:44.400]  and army privates and corporals and the, you name it, die after they have the shots.
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:49.080]  The French, none of them got sick because they didn't take the anthrax shot because they'd
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:55.240]  done anthrax shots in Indochina and back in the 50s and had a big problem with them because
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:37:01.960]  you can't attenuate, you can't radiate anthrax and then have a dead anthrax spore, it's like
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:07.440]  a plant and then have your body not still get sick from it.
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:12.720]  They were getting anthrax, they get rotholes in their lungs and rotholes in their body,
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:17.400]  some of the troops actually got anthrax, you know, bloody spots all over their bodies and
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:27.240]  the anthrax is tough, close to a zombie as you're going to get and so that was a beta
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:37.760]  test to kill 34,000 U.S. troops, Marines and sailors and they did it and it came out they
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:47.360]  did it and yeah, there's the Senate, the Department of Veterans Affairs on it and they had findings
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.120]  that they shouldn't have given an experimental vaccine and that they wouldn't do it again
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.360]  and that's why now they go, oh, we can force the military to take approved vaccines because
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:00.680]  you have a lot of your rights outside of the military but you can't make them take an experimental
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:09.120]  vaccine, even Senator Jay Rockefeller's committee found that in hearings of all people.
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:15.400]  So here we are in 2021 and they've got way more experimental, mRNA, you've got all these
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:18.840]  top scientists, things that cause problems, you've got these vaccines banned all over
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:22.840]  the world because they're killing so many people but none of them are banned here baby,
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:29.440]  no, they've got more coming down, Gates has just got approved, a really sneaky mRNA and
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:33.520]  they won't even tell you fully what's in them, they just tell you, oh, this will attack
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:38.200]  the spike protein of the virus and then people go, the spike protein of the virus is one
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:44.120]  of the most common proteins in the body, riddle me this Batman, you do that, it's going to
[1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:47.320]  cause the body to attack itself, we're going to have a lot of heart attacks and a lot of
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:56.200]  fast strokes and that's right away, then we're going to have cancer, see this, 40 something
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:03.640]  pages long, it's out over 50 exhibits in it, top scientists from Pfizer and the EU went
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:08.000]  public in December and said it's going to cause heart attack strokes and women are going
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.520]  to have all sorts of problems with their uteruses because it turns out the uterus lining proteins
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:20.880]  exactly the same as the virus, just a fast growing protein, Dr. McCam shot please, petition
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:28.400]  for administrative regulatory action regarding a confirmation of epilepsy and points and
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:35.040]  use of data in connection with the following clinical trials and then it goes into the
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:46.680]  Pfizer vaccine and now what's happening, here is salk.edu, the salk research lab is the
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:53.400]  most respected vaccine development lab in the world named after salk who created the
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:40:00.000]  polio vaccine and gave people cancer viruses on purpose and it says the novel coronavirus
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.040]  spike protein plays additional key role in illness, there's all these articles already
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:10.440]  out going gee, they're now admitting that it's the protein of the virus that's actually
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:15.640]  hurting people and then when your body has an autoimmune response to that protein, it's
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:26.280]  going to attack the heart, the brain, the cardiovascular system, the uterus, the testicles
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:37.080]  and it's a very dry article, it just says that the protein is already associated with
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:42.920]  that, well your body then learns to attack that protein attack itself, that's just one
[1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:47.920]  facet I'm told of a whole bunch of serious problems, but see they're not problems, like
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:51.640]  you start a chainsaw up and you cut a tree down, it's like man that chainsaw has got
[1:40:51.640 --> 1:40:56.640]  a problem, no it's designed to do that, or I walk up and shoot you in the face with a
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:01.000]  12 gauge shotgun and blow your head off, my shotgun doesn't have a problem, it's working
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:07.320]  quite well.
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:12.720]  So let me come back and hit all the stuff I haven't gotten to yet, but let me show TV
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:18.520]  viewers and radio listeners something right now, we had Dr. Francis Boyle who is an international
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:24.160]  war crimes lawyer and expert on all this and wrote the U.S. biological weapons law who's
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:27.920]  been totally vindicated 14 months later with all his predictions, he was on yesterday and
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.520]  we reposted it in a live show feed of the show, we put the live show feed up please with
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:36.960]  the headline, Sunday emergency broadcast scientists across the world confirm COVID vaccines are
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:42.480]  deadly bio weapons, let's scroll down, keep scrolling please, and right under the live
[1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:48.600]  show feed, we have his notice to doctors and others about them trying to force the vaccine
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:53.280]  on you, which are now announcing, the notice by authority the Nuremberg code on medical
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:58.920]  experimentation I do hereby exercise my right to refuse to submit or to administer the use
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:03.920]  of COVID-19 vaccine, the United States government has prosecuted convicted and executed medical
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:08.000]  doctors who have violated the Nuremberg code on medical experimentation, aiders and abetters
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.760]  of Nuremberg crimes are equally guilty and have also been prosecuted convicted and executed.
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:18.600]  Now by the way, he used to be the former U.N. head prosecutor of war crimes, he tried
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:24.720]  slow them a lot, he's not a lightweight trainer Henry Kissinger, that's what he says, we
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.320]  also posted the entire Nuremberg code 1947 before you underneath that, that's what you
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:34.200]  get, that's what you share, that's what this is, but I think you're so stupid, you hear
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.560]  Bill Gates said there's too many people all day, he's creating all these GMO mosquitoes
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:44.200]  you name it, this is their attack folks, we already let them kill 34,000 U.S. troops and
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.280]  got away with it, then they got to main millions of millions of kids with autism for the shots
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:52.720]  and you didn't do anything, so they go okay, those beta tests work, kill hundreds of millions,
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:58.280]  they'll kill billions, the attack is now live, stay with us.
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:04.360]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:09.160]  for beta testing to operational, the globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:13.440]  takeover, their robot takeover, but the good news is we've been working and you've been
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:17.760]  working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:22.480]  to be able to find it off, humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:26.720]  attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it, if we ask God for guidance,
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:31.080]  he will defeat it, so prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is
[1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:35.840]  essential and warning others is absolutely essential and at the same time supporting
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:40.000]  InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:46.200]  great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation, InfoWarsStore.com,
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.400]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold out because
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:54.440]  the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, Mazzo beats and others, so get them
[1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:58.480]  today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:03.840]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something,
[1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:08.200]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:12.480]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:16.560]  you, the listeners of this show, I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you,
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:20.080]  whether you are old, whether you are spanned in quite black, it doesn't matter, you got
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:24.920]  red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:30.160]  are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:34.800]  with you over the years and as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:38.360]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:43.480]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us,
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:45.760]  but again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:49.360]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:54.880]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:57.280]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse.
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:44:58.280]  God bless.
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:04.680]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British Royal Family Finance Scientist had developed
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:08.280]  a plan for scientific dictatorship rewind.
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:12.000]  That grew into the Robber Barons and then into the Eugenics Movement, Hitler and of
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:13.360]  course, the Restless History.
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:17.840]  Our film, In-Game, Blueprint for Global Enslagement, has been censored on Amazon and many other
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:22.480]  big platforms, sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts.

[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:14.400]  system.

[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:19.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:30.480]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:35.480]  I want to be clear, and I keep harping on this, we've had the former head of Rockefeller
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:39.520]  Hospital go public a year ago and lay all this out before it even happened, and the
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:45.200]  author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law and great contributor to the UN World Law on
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:51.280]  saying all this 14 months ago, and again yesterday with me, we've had Yedon, the former head
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:54.800]  scientist at Pfizer just retired a few years ago, go public and say this is mass murder,
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:59.840]  this is pure evil, it's going to attack the protein in your body, this is madness.
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:05.800]  And all these other medical doctors and scientists coming out saying this, and I couldn't believe
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:10.840]  it was even that bad, I thought they were being a little bit alarmist.
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:14.360]  But it's all really happening, and now the mounting death and the heart attacks and the
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:19.800]  strokes and the blood clots, and the way they do it is they'll go, oh, there were six women
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:24.240]  got sick nationwide with blood clots from a vaccine, and they go, oh, actually we had
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:29.920]  to shut down a Houston area, Dick's Sporting Goods, because we vaccinated a couple hundred
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:34.880]  people, and 30 of them went to the hospital, actually one lady died, and actually down
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:41.120]  the street another person died, and if you actually go to the adverse reactions page,
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.040]  almost 4,000 Americans have died from the vaccine, the CDC admits, and remember, between
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:51.120]  one in 10 and one in 100, they're not sure, end up getting reported, because if you're
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:56.160]  Hank Aaron, or you're marvelous Marvin Hagler, or you're the rapper that took the shot and
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:01.000]  died a day later of a heart attack, they just go, well, we don't know the vaccine, did it?
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:07.280]  They might be hit by a bus, and they say, well, we don't know if that's what did it.
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:13.040]  But the first two months of this year, it fares, that's the adverse reaction site, they
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:16.840]  reported more than the whole past year of death.
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:23.920]  Oh, and remember, roughly the same number of people died in 2020 has died in 2019, and
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:27.800]  remember, no flu cases, so it was all a fraud, it was all a PCR test, but now you're going
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:35.040]  to see big death, and that's the big news that broke on Friday, mainstream news reporting,
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:42.480]  60% of the people now in the hospitals with COVID, those are the bad cases, were vaccinated
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:46.080]  in the last month, they're not there from COVID, they're there from the vaccine, but
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:52.560]  they're testing positive, oh, you've got COVID, oh, it wasn't the shot, no, no, no, the vaccine
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:59.760]  doesn't work, so it either doesn't work, or the vaccine caused it, but of course the
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:02.280]  vaccine caused it.
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:07.800]  But now, what they're doing is when you've had the vaccine is, they are turning the PCR
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:13.160]  test down even lower, than they normally would, they normally did it at 40 cycles or higher
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:18.000]  to get false positives, now they're going below 29 to get negatives, it's all a computer
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:27.280]  scam, think Theranos, not Thanos from Marvel Comics, think Theranos, Theranos, Bill Gates'
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:31.480]  front lady, billions of dollars, they got a little scanner, a PCR test tells you if
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:36.480]  you have cancer, tells you if you've got all these things, it's a fraud, they got billions
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.040]  and billions before doctors went, this isn't real, of people going in and having surgeries
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:44.360]  according to what this said, see, they do whatever they want, now they tell you, oh,
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:48.520]  your uterus has got a bunch of tumors, after the shot, you're bleeding, you're 80 years
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:53.360]  old, don't worry, you don't have cancer, because we're not calling what COVID grows
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:51:01.960]  in your ovaries, or your uterus cancer, it's all sick, PR agency's in big tech now, your
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:08.560]  doctors, Bill Gates is your doctor, Sleepy Joe's your doctor, and they're going to put
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:11.560]  in you whatever they want, and then people say, well, what's in it? And they go, oh,
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:19.400]  sorry for progery, it's secret, but just what they admit these vaccines do, teaches your
[1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:27.320]  body to attack a protein, not a virus, not a bacteria, a protein that's in your body,
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:30.640]  and one of the top scientists say, they said, it will attack your whole body, we're going
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:34.560]  to see heart attacks, everything, because what happens when you have an autoimmune response,
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:41.560]  an allergic response, a bee stings you, your throat swells up, what happens when it's designed
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:47.760]  to attack your heart, your heart swells up, the arteries close, it's called a heart attack,
[1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:54.320]  it's called a heart attack, and I've got stacks of articles here of old people, young people,
[1:51:54.320 --> 1:52:00.760]  women, children having heart attacks, and dying, here's one, 15 year old boy dies of
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:05.600]  heart attack, two days after taking Pfizer vaccine, had no history of allergic reactions,
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:10.320]  and his parents put it in the VAR's report, most people don't even know to go to the adverse
[1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:22.400]  event reporting system. But remember what the law says, trying to make someone take an
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:33.440]  experimental treatment violates the Nuremberg code, since when did we allow this, we have
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:39.920]  been totally and completely stampeded, and it gets worse, look at this, report, nation's
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:44.600]  second largest teachers union influence CDC on school reopening guidelines delayed return
[1:52:44.600 --> 1:52:48.720]  to classes, but it's more than that, they were political, they don't want things ever
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:59.680]  opening again, these are monsters. Pentagon's canceled rolling thunder says the 30 plus year
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:04.240]  veterans pro military group not welcome in the Biden administration, they're domestic
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:12.560]  terrorists, you better learn what the great reset is, I'll cover it, next hour, I'm going
[1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:17.280]  to get into the economics of it, what do all the charts show, I'm going to show you, food
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:22.320]  prices are going to go up 76% in the next six months, how do I know, that's the Bloomberg
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:28.600]  global agri index is dead on around the world on food prices at where they're being grown
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:34.760]  and delivery prices are already set at 76% higher on average globally, that is going
[1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:40.600]  to cause massive world civil unrest, and the UN is going to be the direct those third world
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:45.760]  populations at our borders, it's going to be spectacular, and they're breaking the European
[1:53:45.760 --> 1:53:52.560]  and US borders now. Also, we have cyber polygon, the economic plan to implode things, also
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.000]  about John Hopkins, it's all coming together, and then we've got another big index over
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:07.080]  here called the cobra index, or the cobra effect, and again, once you get super inflation
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.320]  coming, and they don't control it, it looks like a cobra head when it pops up, and it's
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:17.080]  the same thing with food prices or cobra heading, same thing with overall indexes on inflation,
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:22.160]  the same cobra head, and it's a huge king cobra, biggest they've ever seen, it's just
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:29.400]  now surging into the cobra head. And so, Katie bar the door on that one, now, that's why
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:33.760]  they want another reset, another lockdown, because if they're going to inflate and give
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:39.040]  themselves trillions, they get it, they get yachts, they get gold toilets, they get giant
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:42.960]  inflation mansions, well, you go bankrupt, then that will keep inflation from happening
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:47.680]  if you don't get any of the money. So, look for them to stall the economy again to try
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:51.320]  to stop that hyperinflation getting to the general public, but it's already happening,
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:57.360]  big articles are here about Costco, bigarticleinfowords.com has shrumped the amount of food and other
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:03.120]  materials and all their packages, and they just give you more air. So, that old fashioned
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:08.880]  scam is not just happening at Costco, there's a big article about it at Costco, but Costco's
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:13.160]  owned by a big liberal globalist, so, of course, it's one of the worst. Remember, when the
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:17.600]  more loving they are, the more savage they are, the more anti-racism they are, the more
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:23.640]  pro-racism they are, everything they say, it's inverse, it's always the opposite. We're
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:29.000]  going to go to Bright, come back, also Mitt Romney got beautifully booed, we've got nullification,
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.800]  taking our cities and counties back is the way, the left takes over cities and ignores
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:36.960]  constitutional law, we take the cities over and ignore their garbage, and if they've already
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:41.360]  got the big cities, we move to small towns, and we basically maintain control, because
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.680]  this is going to be a long, hard fight.
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:47.960]  All right, Sunday Live is usually on show, Tom Papert's hosting, I'm going to co-host
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:52.400]  with him, that is coming up, a lot of stations carry it, some stations don't, just go to

[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:02.040]  which is supposed to be on all the network streams, so that's coming up with the great
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:08.600]  Tom Papert, and I'll get into the economy, and so much more of all of this for you. They're
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:14.400]  also trying to pass a law in Canada to ban free speech, put the government over, everybody's
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:17.640]  post, it's very, very serious.
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:23.960]  Separately, talk about immune system, talk about the good for your joints and good for
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:29.280]  detoxifying yourself, turmeric is amazing. We have the ultimate turmeric formula, 95%
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:32.800]  of your cuminoid, been sold out for almost six months, because of the supply chain right
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:37.800]  now, we've got a very limited shipment, I still did 50% off, that's just how I do it,
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:40.680]  but I'm going to go back to regular price starting Tuesday, because it'll be months
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:45.520]  and months until we get more of body's ultimate turmeric formula back in. If you want it,
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.720]  I'll get that order in now. Also, our great super powerful sleep aids, five milligrams
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:55.560]  of melatonin, so much more, down and out, and of course, rocket rest is a powdered form,
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:59.000]  they're both extremely strong, too strong for some of you, we got knockout, it's still
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.520]  a great formula as well, but they're all 40% off, but are selling out, I'm going to keep
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:07.040]  them at that till they sell out, because I want their new products, I want people to
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:10.240]  experience how amazing they are, even though it's going to be a long time before we get
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:15.680]  more of that in months and months, go infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three,

[1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:54.480]  I recently ran an ad where we played a Cavalry Bugle call in the background and I made the
[1:58:54.480 --> 1:58:58.960]  point that, hey, the Cavalry is here, but it's really true. Listeners are incredible
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:04.000]  and we're able to keep these great products in stock. We were able to fund ourselves last
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.960]  year and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole that we'd been in because I expanded
[1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:13.040]  so much for the 2020 election. But thanks to you, we're still on air. But now because
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:17.560]  of the shutdown in production and because of slowdowns with the whole COVID lockdowns
[1:59:17.560 --> 1:59:20.520]  and supply chain, a lot of our best-selling products have not been available for months
[1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:24.160]  and months and months. Some for six months, some have been discontinued. But the Cavalry
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:29.160]  is here now in our funding because a lot of these products are finally coming back in.
[1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:33.640]  Cross-to-Guard, Vazzo Beats, Alpha Power and of course, Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula
[1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:39.160]  are all in our top 10 best-sellers. Our second best-seller is Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula,
[1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:44.920]  95% of our humanoid. It is back in stock right now, 50% off at InfoWorstware.com. So really,
[1:59:44.920 --> 2:00:04.680]  you are the Cavalry when you order these products at InfoWorstware.com.
