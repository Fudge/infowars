[00:00.000 --> 00:18.540]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
[00:18.540 --> 00:39.360]  I can report to you with certain confidence that the mainstream media as we know it is completely
[00:39.360 --> 00:49.160]  discredited defunct and hated by 90% of the public core scientific polls already show this but
[00:49.160 --> 00:58.280]  to see the manifestation and to see even Democrats and liberals admitting that CNN and MSNBC are
[00:58.280 --> 01:09.800]  the gold standards of corporate vomit and fake liberal neoliberal garbage unbelievable don't
[01:09.800 --> 01:16.080]  you love Trump's tweets last night where he talked about Mica and Scarborough begging to
[01:16.080 --> 01:21.480]  meet him at Marlago and then his secret service detail said you know she's out here she's had
[01:21.480 --> 01:28.000]  plastic surgeries he's got blood dripping out of her you know hair obviously psycho Joe as he's
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.920]  known was pretty revved up who knows what they were out doing or it is they like to party pretty
[01:32.920 --> 01:41.240]  hard and Trump you notice said that she's low IQ and he's a psycho wonder why the president called
[01:41.240 --> 01:49.280]  old Joe Scarborough a psycho you ever investigated Joe Scarborough folks but a few minutes looking
[01:49.280 --> 01:57.440]  into his past why he left Congress why he's the perfect shield they went to Marlago three nights
[01:57.440 --> 02:04.600]  in a row on New Year's Eve and insisted on joining me she was bleeding badly from a facelift I said
[02:04.600 --> 02:19.160]  no and she doesn't even know about the tunnel I'm not gonna tease them I'm gonna stop right there
[02:19.160 --> 02:28.840]  but celebrating the fall of these arrogant dirt bags off of their vulture perches as they try
[02:28.840 --> 02:34.120]  to destroy this country in this world as they try to consolidate total control is a real
[02:34.120 --> 02:49.560]  pleasure it's a luxury I relish it with great satisfaction and savor now they use the whole
[02:49.560 --> 02:53.840]  pizza gate thing that mainstream media created by pointing at the pizza place instead of the
[02:53.840 --> 03:01.720]  pedophile code words that were in the emails and the weiner procurement operations that we first
[03:01.720 --> 03:08.480]  reported that have been confirmed they decoyed us and like a bird dog we took the bird in our
[03:08.480 --> 03:14.120]  mouth about five seconds to taste it bad threw it out and went after the real birds but they've
[03:14.120 --> 03:21.480]  tried to use pizza gate as a facelift for the pedophile empire Paul Watson has an excellent
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.040]  report pedophiles rule the world well actually the globalists that rule the world use pedophilia
[03:27.040 --> 03:33.400]  and satanism and other things as the control arm and they want pedophiles as their renfields as
[03:33.400 --> 03:43.640]  their servants as their minion class the real controllers torture children to death they
[03:43.640 --> 03:52.480]  don't have sex with them renfield just wants to play with another slave because he was abused
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.480]  himself doesn't mean the abuse isn't horrible and the Catholic church was infiltrated and taken
[03:58.480 --> 04:06.000]  over by a pedophile network rat singer was removed and sent to Gandalf Castle being blackmailed
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.880]  that a lot of his top people reportedly were involved in trafficking of children he was sent
[04:13.880 --> 04:18.000]  to Gandalf Castle I'm not talking about Lord of the Rings it really is where he's basically on
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.800]  house arrest at Gandalf Castle and then the liberal savior Pope came in who reportedly from our
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.880]  sources had been running the whole up well just as we're striking back against the pedophile
[04:30.880 --> 04:39.240]  networks here in the United States they're striking back in Australia Australian Cardinal best friend
[04:39.240 --> 04:45.440]  and top aid to the Pope is charged with sexual assault of scores of children and the Pope's
[04:45.440 --> 04:52.680]  backing him to the hill that's right we're gonna go inside the rabbit hole of the renfields and
[04:52.680 --> 05:01.280]  the Dracula's on the other side where it is Pope Francis is a Dracula the tide is turning in the
[05:01.280 --> 05:06.240]  witch hunt aimed at President Donald Trump after being right about rigged elections fake news and
[05:06.240 --> 05:11.080]  the travel ban the unrelenting persecution of our president is actually starting to yield some fruit
[05:11.080 --> 05:15.840]  for the drain the swamp movement after Trump trolled James Comey into admitting he leaked and
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.160]  Loretta Lynch intervened in the Clinton email probe the investigations are now aimed at the
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.960]  Democrats John Podessa had a secret hearing on Tuesday Loretta Lynch will soon be called to a
[05:24.960 --> 05:29.160]  hearing Susan Rice will have to answer for unmasking and Bernie Sanders and his wife are
[05:29.160 --> 05:34.240]  being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud and now Republican senators want answers on the FBI
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.040]  Russia probe in regards to surveillance senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham are leading the
[05:39.040 --> 05:44.440]  way in searching for answers on the procedures taken and by whom to issue surveillance requests
[05:44.440 --> 05:48.880]  because of the Russian probe what could this possibly turn up as the world awaits answers from
[05:48.880 --> 05:54.320]  Barack Obama as to why it was he that interfered with the Russian investigation not President

[08:10.200 --> 08:16.520]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[08:16.520 --> 08:34.200]  we are accelerating towards the global quickening a cascade of singularity moments
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.440]  leading our species toward our ultimate destiny the doorway to the future the doorway to things
[08:42.440 --> 08:49.800]  the eye has not seen the ear is not heard the mind is not dreamed is before us we are entering
[08:49.800 --> 08:58.200]  the threshold but guarding it guarding it is the fallen one now whether you believe in christian
[08:58.200 --> 09:06.280]  cosmology and the final equation doesn't matter because the devil believes in you and the archetype
[09:06.280 --> 09:16.680]  is certainly real ladies and gentlemen hiding in plain view the Vatican has been completely
[09:16.680 --> 09:26.680]  taken over by multinational intelligence agencies using the honeypot of pedophilia and once they
[09:26.680 --> 09:32.280]  get people in positions of power they recruit more in and then fill all the spaces with more
[09:32.280 --> 09:40.520]  pedophiles it's all over the italian press it's all over the roman newspapers it's it's
[09:40.520 --> 09:45.400]  it's well documented i traveled there last year we have had experts on we should get leo
[09:45.400 --> 09:54.600]  zygami back on documenting the fact that they used child rape and child murder there's been a lot
[09:54.600 --> 10:01.720]  of children found dead at the Vatican strangled to death and they used that information to control
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.600]  the world's second largest religion because you can say catholicism is its own brand of
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.680]  christianity and there's a billion catholics and there's like a billion protestants and there's a
[10:12.680 --> 10:20.760]  1.4 billion muslims but i traveled there i investigated it they're watching on television at
[10:20.760 --> 10:27.720]  the time lapse i shot off my hotel balcony right over the Vatican and it's 100 and 200 foot walls
[10:31.240 --> 10:38.040]  and now the Vatican's top cardinal the vice president basically of the Vatican the best
[10:38.040 --> 10:44.920]  friend of the pope his confidant charged with sexual assault in a string of young children
[10:44.920 --> 10:50.520]  the rape of children the rape of little boys
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.000]  and you notice that it's over 10 000 pedophiles arrested since trump got in
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.320]  and the police will bust hundreds and hundreds and hundreds in some cases with houses full of
[11:05.320 --> 11:11.000]  cages with little children sometimes dead children and it'll be in the newspaper one time
[11:11.000 --> 11:18.280]  that tells you ladies and gentlemen that there's a major network here and we already know that
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.320]  i'm personally i'm in financing private investigators and others that are interfacing
[11:27.320 --> 11:32.840]  with law enforcement on the trail of this right now and that's why the enemy's hitting us so hard
[11:32.840 --> 11:38.200]  because they know behind the scenes i'm not buying a private jet i'm trying to finance going after
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.680]  these people and giving law enforcement the final piece they haven't had media that's willing to report
[11:44.680 --> 11:51.320]  it just like in viva vendetta and the inspector says why didn't you do this earlier he said i
[11:51.320 --> 11:54.680]  was waiting for you inspector well now it's the other way around the police have been waiting for
[11:54.680 --> 12:02.840]  us and now trump has signaled the attack uk intelligence has been rounding up the pedophiles
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.800]  they've been saying that it literally runs the government that's mainstream on telegraph headlines
[12:10.040 --> 12:15.080]  it's it again it's a system of evil and let me explain something in the netherlands and in
[12:15.080 --> 12:24.280]  germany and in spain and in france particularly and in northern european countries as well they
[12:24.280 --> 12:31.640]  will bust houses in some cases with 20 30 40 kids in it starving to death and many little skeletons
[12:31.640 --> 12:37.080]  buried and it just gets taken off the news and what they do is they torture them for months
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.040]  they believe they're sucking the energy out of them a psychopaths call it using them up
[12:42.040 --> 12:47.000]  to understand the rim fields generally were tortured as children themselves and then want to
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.800]  go out and associate sexual love with children because they were raped as children and i'm not
[12:51.800 --> 12:57.640]  condoning what they've done they're horrible horrible creatures but they are products of the
[12:57.640 --> 13:05.960]  true vampires not metaphysical vampires not legendary vampires not true immortals but the
[13:05.960 --> 13:14.920]  spirits the the possession that overtakes these people as they in their off time are in dungeons
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.320]  with little children begging for mommy and that's what they do and that's who they are and they hate
[13:19.320 --> 13:24.280]  me and they hate you and they hate america and they hate jesus christ and they hate women and
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.880]  they hate children they want to murder you and your family they want to fund radical islam
[13:29.880 --> 13:34.600]  bringing in because it is based on pedophilia and oppression of women and children as well
[13:36.920 --> 13:43.480]  and in breeding what england's two percent pakistani and 30 some percent of the deformities
[13:43.480 --> 13:47.800]  are pakistani i'm not bashing pakistani folks they're great smart people but the islamic in
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.760]  breeding of marrying your sister marrying your cousin is causing this and it shows another curse
[13:52.760 --> 14:00.040]  of the mental illness the side of cane whatever you want to call it but the same mental illness of
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.840]  the royal elites in in breeding together is the same mental illness of the same sickness that we
[14:04.840 --> 14:13.640]  see in islamic cultures and you see this evil alliance with the globalists in islam so here
[14:13.640 --> 14:22.120]  it is australian cardinal and aid to pope is charged with sexual assault that's the new york times
[14:22.120 --> 14:29.000]  you got to read deep to find out it was little kids pope backs australian cardinal in fight against
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  sex abuse charges and again pope frances even the one in guardian admits use the sex candles as a
[14:35.000 --> 14:48.360]  jesuit coup d'etat inside of the vatican and it's so sick and it's so evil these creepy creepy creepy
[14:48.360 --> 14:55.800]  creepy old men and just imagine ladies and gentlemen that's only the gateway drug is raping the little
[14:55.800 --> 15:04.280]  boys it's always little boys because they want to stunt the manhood and create a slave create a
[15:04.280 --> 15:11.960]  servant of dracula again everything is archetype in the literature folks every culture said you
[15:11.960 --> 15:17.720]  don't get near the castle at night they'll kill you that's because the inbred elites are always the
[15:17.720 --> 15:23.080]  same you want to grab you you want to take you and they want to suck the life out of you they
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.800]  would spiritually want to hear those babies beg for their mommas and be in that horror and they
[15:27.800 --> 15:32.600]  want to scare the hell out of those children and do horrible satanic rituals where they put on demon
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.280]  mask and just terrorize the hell out of them until they give up and are zombies and are gone and
[15:38.280 --> 15:44.600]  they celebrate the destruction of the innocence and the torture of the soul that is the heart of god's
[15:44.600 --> 15:53.560]  creation they blaspheme and defile children and hollywood sexualizes the children and they have
[15:53.560 --> 16:03.080]  the ads sexualizing children it's all their religion abortion they like that's why they've
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.320]  caught them at abortuaries all over the country doing rituals it doesn't mean if you were part
[16:07.320 --> 16:10.920]  of an abortion that you knew that or that you're even bad as long as you're aware of the overall
[16:10.920 --> 16:16.120]  program that you were deceived but they get you involved in the evil and then you commit to the
[16:16.120 --> 16:22.440]  evil believing that oh no it might it can't be evil i've got a heart in my heart but no that's
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.480]  what it's about but even better is getting a three or four year old and torturing them for as long
[16:27.480 --> 16:33.960]  as possible until the light goes out of their eyes and these demon possessed psychopaths i've
[16:33.960 --> 16:38.840]  talked to top psychiatrists you're on the show who are the famous lady that you know goes and talks
[16:38.840 --> 16:42.200]  all the serial killers and she said yeah that's not really in the mainline literature because
[16:42.200 --> 16:46.040]  they don't want to be there but they're all devil worshipers and they all basically have
[16:46.040 --> 16:51.400]  no consciousness until they're killing somebody or hurting an innocent person or torturing a woman
[16:51.400 --> 16:56.920]  and then there's like white light and they're alive when they're not doing it they're having
[16:56.920 --> 17:02.680]  nightmares the demons are attacking them it's a hellish depressed existence until they go out
[17:02.680 --> 17:09.720]  and grab your child and torture them and then then there's ecstasy the satanic pleasure
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.720]  this is the great secrets of the enemy now let's go ahead and read and break this down
[17:18.840 --> 17:23.800]  vatican's third most powerful figure he's really number two cardinal pell charged with multiple
[17:23.800 --> 17:31.080]  sex assaults the extent of the charges the senior vatican cardinal's facing has not been revealed
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.960]  by police however according to patent there are multiple complaints related to those charges
[17:36.920 --> 17:41.880]  adding that they were miners at the time of the alleged assaults and are now aged from their 20s
[17:41.880 --> 17:47.640]  to their 50s the allegations are believed to stretch from the time that pell was a priest in the australian
[17:48.360 --> 17:54.520]  town of ballerat to when he was archbishop of melbourne it is alleged that the cardinal groom
[17:54.520 --> 18:01.240]  boys had a swimming pool at ballerat in the 1970s and committed the assault at st patrick's cathedral
[18:01.240 --> 18:09.240]  in melbourne according to the australian and that they they commit the rapes in the sanctuary
[18:10.280 --> 18:18.120]  that's why sandusky was at noon on a saturday at the fieldhouse at penn state raping little kids
[18:18.120 --> 18:24.360]  in front of everybody because that's how you do it you do it out in the open you sell a
[18:24.360 --> 18:33.480]  braiding the vatican's third most powerful figure cardinal pell charged with sex assaults
[18:33.480 --> 18:39.800]  on miners papal resignation linked to inquiry into vatican gay officials says the paper

[18:56.760 --> 19:04.280]  we're up against they can be easily defeated but you've got to admit they exist oh but the news
[19:05.080 --> 19:10.760]  that focused cnn new york times washington post on a pizza place instead of the pizza code words
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.320]  and the vedesta emails they got people to distract off into that that's the facelift now pedophilia

[19:24.840 --> 19:31.880]  it scares them to death because they know their system is being exposed and they are hungry for
[19:31.880 --> 19:37.960]  more children to torture and murder and rip their teeth out and flay their skin and do brain

[25:36.840 --> 25:43.960]  control of this nation and we're selling it out piece by piece they are so freaked out it's like
[25:43.960 --> 25:50.040]  coming home when you've been gone for a week on vacation and your college son or daughter we've
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.760]  all heard these stories is there with a bunch of their friends having a party and you walk in

[25:57.720 --> 26:03.720]  their feet kicked up just saying i'm gonna leave in a minute or i'm not gonna leave at all this is

[26:34.520 --> 26:42.600]  through each and every one of us that's not new age that's the bible christ the pure manifestation
[26:42.600 --> 26:49.960]  of that we're made the image of the creator little g and look what we can envision look what we can
[26:49.960 --> 26:58.520]  build and god is all-knowing omnipresent created the entire universe and everything in it and gives
[26:58.520 --> 27:09.080]  us free will all at the very same time guiding those that are drawn towards interfacing with god
[27:09.080 --> 27:20.680]  is powerful but there are those that interface with the twisted evil the darkness and i know
[27:20.680 --> 27:27.800]  that to those that are pure the darkness has a certain beauty to it but once you're enveloped
[27:27.800 --> 27:34.920]  by the darkness you find out all it is is sorrow and pain betrayal and failure the opposite of god

[36:10.200 --> 36:16.120]  speak out when when the news is calling for trump's death and his family's death that while the
[36:16.120 --> 36:21.160]  press secretary might actually say you're fake news you've been reporting fake news when they have
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.880]  like a costa in there every day being caught putting out fake news and they still go to acosta
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.120]  then he sits there and makes up more garbage i was watching the scene in this morning and they

[37:01.160 --> 37:08.680]  track of what the enemy's doing occasionally but but they're universally reviled i love the new york
[37:08.680 --> 37:13.960]  times kept saying we're doing great we're expanding we're booming and i'd go actually read the share
[37:13.960 --> 37:19.320]  holder news on it they're losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year they're propped up by a
[37:19.320 --> 37:25.480]  mexican kingpin the richest guy in the world reported leakers that's not true but the richest

[37:46.040 --> 37:52.520]  few months we're on the march the empire is on the run now let's go to komo again lecturing
[37:52.520 --> 37:58.200]  everybody that this whole fake news thing needs to end and it needs to end right now but you started
[37:58.200 --> 38:05.000]  it brother you got a lot of wavos to get up there and say now you're not allowed to read wiki leaks
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.560]  only we are in the media will tell you what they say and then of course you don't also famously
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.320]  said a few months ago you know if your young daughter doesn't like seeing a full grown man in
[38:13.320 --> 38:17.560]  the showers at their school and doesn't like seeing their genitals they're hateful and you
[38:17.560 --> 38:25.240]  taught them to be hateful so see now basically pedophilia is a persuasion and you're hateful as
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.840]  long as you call it transgender and say a transgendered man a 300 pound man wants to go in a shower
[38:30.840 --> 38:37.560]  with your 10 year old daughter and she gets freaked out seeing a naked man and is and is johnson

[38:44.360 --> 38:49.000]  like we've lost all credibility they hate us they see through us we've got to say such outlandish stuff
[38:49.000 --> 38:55.320]  that somehow it shocks them back into submission it's not working scum it's not working filth we
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.840]  know you hate us we know you hate our children we know you're the enemy and i pray for you to be

[40:23.240 --> 40:28.600]  wars dot com and by the way you can do it on abc you can do it on cbs you can do it on c span any
[40:28.600 --> 40:33.400]  live event two thousand five hundred dollars just to make it fun there's a big banner on the front
[40:33.400 --> 40:37.320]  of info wars dot com now we've got a lot of these videos we've been playing we're going to play some
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.720]  more we've got it we have a limited staff we're going to get the prizes out to folks but it's just
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.480]  starting to you know take hold but this is the time to do it the cnn is fake news contest big
[40:47.480 --> 40:54.040]  banner on info wars dot com it's a very very exciting time to be alive and to really have
[40:54.040 --> 41:00.280]  these rats cornered by the light of truth now let's go to coma get rid of all the market reforms
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.480]  give americans the freedom and insurance companies to design products that people can afford to suit
[41:05.480 --> 41:10.840]  their needs and we won't be spending so much money on subsidies and people will have in terms of net
[41:10.840 --> 41:15.320]  effect in terms of premiums they won't be harmed but two things on that we need information and the
[41:15.320 --> 41:20.360]  debate on this thing has been completely distorted using incorrect information well two things about
[41:20.360 --> 41:25.080]  that uh well first of all one thing i know you're not suggesting that i'm using misleading
[41:25.080 --> 41:30.360]  information right you know you let me know what i'm saying that's inaccurate because this whole
[41:30.360 --> 41:34.360]  phase needs to end and it needs to end right now just tell me what i'm getting wrong or we'll deal
[41:34.360 --> 41:39.080]  with the numbers i'm not i'm not i'm not accusing you i'm talking about the fact people don't
[41:39.080 --> 41:44.360]  understand the 22 million and there was a wrong baseline and then the way the premiums are reported
[41:44.360 --> 41:48.360]  you have to really understand the way economists take a look at this and what's really happening
[41:48.360 --> 41:55.160]  no i you look at these con men and now he tries to put this straight face on when we have the
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.600]  internal emails from wiki leaks we have their own producers on video saying we lie we deceive it's
[42:00.600 --> 42:08.440]  what we do we're trying to start a war with russia we know trump sentison and you look at these people
[42:08.440 --> 42:14.520]  trying to double down with their feeble audience it's a joke and to watch the rest of the media
[42:14.520 --> 42:21.160]  trying to prop them up and run in uh and you know try to uh keep keep their whole facade going
[42:21.160 --> 42:25.640]  it really is like watching a bunch of rats run around on the deck of a sinking ship trying to
[42:25.640 --> 42:30.840]  find somewhere to jump off or leap off to the public left off a long time ago so enjoy enjoy
[42:30.840 --> 42:40.600]  your watery grave and by that i mean historically i wish no harm or violence against cnn or any
[42:40.600 --> 42:46.040]  other msm and of course we've always said that but they keep saying trump and myself and others
[42:46.040 --> 42:51.800]  speaking out against them they're saying it's our fault the public doesn't trust them and it's our
[42:51.800 --> 42:58.200]  fault the people hates them no people hate you because they know you're elitist want to be scum
[42:58.200 --> 43:04.840]  they can't stand you they know you're a pack of liars that's your fault look in the mirror it's
[43:04.840 --> 43:09.560]  your fault you wanted to have a war with america you wanted to try to bully people you wanted to
[43:09.560 --> 43:13.560]  call the public racist because they wanted lower taxes or they didn't want obama care you want to
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.120]  sit there try to bully people all day then you're gonna have folks stand back up against you and
[43:18.120 --> 43:25.720]  your whole bully boy facade is going down scumbags i don't have fake confidence like you do with your
[43:25.720 --> 43:32.280]  big money and your globalist backing i come from the streets i come from access television they always
[43:32.280 --> 43:35.800]  use that like it's some negative thing that i come from the grassroots and i have the pedigree to
[43:35.800 --> 43:40.840]  show it i'm proud of the fact i never got government money or big corporate money i'm proud of the
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.840]  house all my friends this morning i'm ashamed that i'm in hollywood movies i mean i like rick
[43:46.840 --> 43:51.640]  link later he invited me to be in scanner darkly and uh waking life and i've been invited to be a
[43:51.640 --> 43:58.200]  lot of other movies and i've said no now and and and literally i would not be in starring roles in
[43:58.200 --> 44:03.240]  in hollywood you could not pay me to be in l.a you could not pay me to be part of that it is
[44:03.240 --> 44:10.120]  a total joke and i was never into it but now i realize it's beyond not being into it i hate it
[44:10.680 --> 44:19.640]  i cannot stand it it is absolutely toxic and evil and just a total joke and it's so liberating
[44:19.640 --> 44:23.000]  to be completely above the hype and just to absolutely be
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.800]  disconnected from the globalist paradigm i'm aware of what they do i'm aware of what they spew
[44:29.800 --> 44:35.800]  but i don't care what they say what they what they push their lies about me it means nothing
[44:37.480 --> 44:44.040]  because they're run by a bunch of pedophiles and devil worshipers and greedy hateful slobs whose
[44:44.040 --> 44:53.000]  time is coming to an end and thank god thank jesus christ our lord and savior that we're not with
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.240]  these people and these big mega churches that are all want to be hollywood little deals where
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.680]  you know the preacher's the star and there's all this other crud and everybody plays it safe it's
[45:02.680 --> 45:09.400]  sick it's sick see in an anchor trump putting journalists in danger declaration of war on

[45:30.840 --> 45:36.360]  and so you keep saying we're pushing violence as you hope somebody shoot somebody from cnn
[45:36.360 --> 45:41.320]  nobody should hurt cnn nobody's here at abc you should tell their sponsors you don't like them
[45:41.320 --> 45:47.080]  you should not watch it you should expose them we've got t-shirts that say fake news with cnn's
[45:47.080 --> 45:55.160]  logo info wars.com wear those out this is about celebrating the truth by exposing the lies but

[57:03.640 --> 57:07.800]  it i said this looks like a false flag the way it's produced i said that guy that police captain
[57:08.600 --> 57:13.720]  looks like a guy i saw in the narcos series as an actor turns out the guy is an actor
[57:13.720 --> 57:18.920]  and the helicopter is attacking the supreme court for two hours it's fake and no one's
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.720]  believing it but yesterday media called it a conspiracy theory to question that it was a
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.920]  real attack on the communist government and now today the media says no one buys it see
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.800]  they just don't want you thinking on your own they want to tell you how everything works
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.000]  but there's some mars junk probably from one of our landers it looks human
[57:39.000 --> 57:45.400]  and a photo out the day i'll get you later that a probe videoed took photos of
[57:46.120 --> 57:51.880]  and the conspiracy theorists think it might be man-made or alien well obviously it's man-made
[57:51.880 --> 57:58.680]  or alien but the point is it's probably space junk but a whole bunch of 50 something probes we
[57:58.680 --> 58:08.040]  know of on mars so okay looks like human space junk looks like our designs but they just say
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.600]  conspiracy theorists think it might be space junk see because only the news can tell you what it is
[58:12.600 --> 58:16.200]  because they have to wait and run back and get told that's why for a day when the whole project
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.280]  veritas thing broke the whole msm wouldn't cover it because they had to decide how they would spend
[58:20.280 --> 58:27.640]  it first there it is conspiracy theorists think it's alien spacecraft think this mars chirasi
[58:27.640 --> 58:32.760]  rover pictures proves aliens exist see no no it's called people are speculating but see having
[58:32.760 --> 58:38.200]  your own thoughts is now a conspiracy theory hour number two straight ahead spread the link info
[58:38.200 --> 58:43.640]  wars dot com they hate it we're in a humet war info wars dot com spread that link
[58:44.600 --> 58:45.640]  stay with us today

[58:54.600 --> 58:59.720]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify
[58:59.720 --> 59:05.320]  the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's
[59:05.320 --> 59:11.000]  made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[59:11.000 --> 59:16.920]  detoxifying the body and it supports the info war it is a classical 360 win this is the formula that
[59:16.920 --> 59:22.280]  i personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[59:22.280 --> 59:27.160]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to yourself you want to your family
[59:27.160 --> 59:32.760]  and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean

[1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:27.320]  show all right we have a very informed yes joining us robert david steele start of the next segment
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:32.760]  as i've been saying over the weekend clearly the neocons the democratic party won't start a war in
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:42.360]  syria they want to cause a crisis before trump set to meet briefly on the sidelines the g20 next
[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.800]  week and that's their admitted plan in fact we pulled the clip of the british ambassador to syria
[1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:52.760]  former ambassador pointing out that trump's attack on that base a few months ago green lighted
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:59.240]  the rebels who've been caught false flagging chemical attacks sarin nerve gas attacks
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:04.200]  it green lights them to launch more if they can make the president do what they want by staging
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:07.640]  and and i get it trump did it for optics they'd already agreed to get the chemicals they hadn't
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:12.760]  given them all up they restored at the base there's photos of that i get that it was for optics
[1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:20.680]  and trump has said no no boots in the ground to remove a side but clearly the deep state is
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:25.160]  shooting down syrian aircraft that are taking on ices blowing up armored columns doing this
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:27.800]  and the russians have now said if you come in we're going to shoot you down
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:33.320]  that is massive brinksmanship and we're all just kind of calmly here going oh it doesn't really
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:38.280]  matter you know i wonder what the latest trump tweet is so there's that backdrop going on we're
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:45.560]  going to be talking about that but i want to play this short clip because a few days ago
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:49.960]  cnn teamed up with elmo and sesame street
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:58.360]  to say oh we're being mean to the refugees and make the kids feel guilty and bad that you know
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:03.800]  trump's hurting the little baby muppets and things so a listener took paul watson's words i love it
[1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:08.200]  when folks do this when you take our material our info and edit it and change it whatever i even like
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:14.040]  the stuff that makes fun of us just please more of it i just love it uh but pjw uh hijack's elmo
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:22.760]  character so i love how the humet of the internet is responding back here it is an extremely exciting
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:28.440]  facebook live here for you now we're talking about an amazing project that is bringing the
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:34.680]  wonders of sesame street to refugees in different war torn places across the world and we have some
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:40.040]  really exciting guests with us facebook users you will want to be asking questions start putting
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:45.400]  them in the comments section um let me introduce our guest we have david milliband who is of course
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.240]  the ceo of the irc the international rescue committee who have teamed up with sesame street
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:56.840]  in this venture we have sherry weston who is the head of global impact for the sesame workshop
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:02.200]  and last but not least i have to say this is a real treat like a lot lots of exciting people but
[1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:08.920]  elmo welcome thank you for being with us this is a complete scandal and a huge security threat
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:14.680]  elmo can i just start by asking you because i know you went to visit a refugee camp in jordan
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:21.880]  right yeah february yeah what was it like they're not refugees half of them disappear on arrival
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:28.680]  we did many of them support isis and it's partly your fault and did you find that the syrian
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:33.880]  little girls and little boys were a lot like your friends here in america it's not refugees fleeing
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:40.120]  war-torn countries it's fundamentally dishonest to call it a refugee crisis when it's not and they
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:45.320]  loved elmo they loved meeting elmo and it's being catastrophic well you're pretty lovable elmo so
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:49.880]  we're getting a lot of questions coming in unsurprisingly because we do have a pretty stellar
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:55.560]  cast here but keep sending them in facebook users as you think of questions you'd like answered just
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:59.720]  place them in the comment section and we will try to get to as many of them as we can i've got a
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:05.960]  question coming in now for elmo wait what surprise surprise elmo let me ask you was it
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:11.960]  sad for you to meet little boys and girls who had lost their homes george soros open society
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:17.960]  backed foundations like avaz.org medicine sand frontiers and move on dot org are also allegedly
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:27.000]  involved soros invested 500 million dollars to quote help refugees i'm sure what why do you
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.400]  think elmo that it's important to help other children if you think they'll come a point where
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:36.920]  the number of migrants pouring into europe slows to a trickle then think again if we continue these
[1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:45.000]  disastrous policies it's only going to get worse right amen to that and of course cnn the globalists
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.400]  eight years ago seven years ago openly started the air of spring to put radical jahodist in
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:55.880]  oba thruse five or six countries get all this but now they're going to send elmo for the kids that
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:05:02.120]  are being mass martyred and slaughtered i mean they're just sick russian senator alexia pushkoff
[1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:09.800]  warns that the us is preparing a false flag provocation as a pretext to launch a military
[1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:18.440]  assault on syria responding to a cnn report that the us has ships and aircraft in place to strike
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:25.240]  syria pushkoff cautioned that this could be the precursor to a staged incident meanwhile the
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:31.800]  us ambassador to the un nikki haley posted on twitter the other day any further attacks done to the
[1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:38.760]  people of syria will be blamed on Assad the ambassador right there referring to the mass
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:45.880]  murder of civilians including children during the april 2017 chemical weapons attack an incident
[1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:52.840]  that most experts and investigators outside the mainstream believe was a false flag terror attack

[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:31.320]  all right for the hour robert david steel is our guest at the bottom of the hour i intend
[1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:34.920]  to open the phones up on any subject you'd like to discuss he wasn't just an analyst
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:38.520]  in the cia he was actually on the ground in operations in the middle east and many other
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:42.600]  countries in real operations you know more james bondy type stuff and he's a great guy i would
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:47.160]  call him liberal or conservative uh but you know just overall really strategic thinker about where
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:52.200]  the world is right now and i wanted to get him on about how does he think they're gonna try to
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:58.440]  derail trump and russia making a deal getting in getting russia's resources working with russia
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:03.320]  uh i mean the imparts will strike back the neocons the republican establishment the democrats
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:09.240]  they want a false flag and they've green lighted that with nikki haley saying one more attack of
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:14.200]  any type we're blaming you i mean that is telling russia we want confrontation they've shot down
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:19.800]  multiple aircraft they bombed armored columns battling ices and al-qaeda grips al-nazra
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:26.360]  i mean they are this is the only area that i think trump is really dropping the ball i mean he's
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:32.600]  been he's been smart and they said we don't want a bunch of boots to the ground we won't take out a
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:37.640]  sod but mic master and others have put in the marines heavy artillery i mean this is this is
[1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:42.440]  serious and they're starting to mop up al-qaeda and ices right now so this is the time that you
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:46.840]  would see that happen he set to meet briefly with putin next week on the sidelines of the g20
[1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:51.000]  we'll talk about that but robert davis still also because of the timeliness of it he's actually
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  involved promoting and helping publish a book on the pulpedophile empire that's right below the
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.640]  surface and that ties into the number three in the vatican really number two he's the top advisor of
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:09.240]  the pope uh the cardinal of australia cut being being indicted for just massive child rape uh so
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:14.040]  this is a sickening cult uh and the old days that get you for having you know cheating on your wife
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:18.440]  well that doesn't get it anymore so it's got to be pedophilia uh so we'll talk about it with robert
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.840]  david steel uh who's a researcher and a lot more in a few minutes robert david still dot com

[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:43.000]  is robert david steel if you just joined us i was asking the question they're trying to launch a
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.520]  false flag clearly here i see that as the big threat uh what is your expert uh take on that robert
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:52.680]  david steel obviously you're not just a former analyst with the cia but you were in the field
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:57.320]  you know running a lot of operations and things well alex first off i was never an analyst at the
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:01.240]  cia was a clandestine case that's what i was saying you were never an analyst you were actually in
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:07.160]  the field i was a clandestine operations case officer one of the first assigned to chase terrorists
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:14.280]  in the 1980s and i had five times the regional average in recruitments and in production now
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:19.720]  i have never been more aligned with you alex in the years that we've known each other than right
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:28.760]  now you and i are on the same page i am disgusted with herbert mcmaster who was a trader we have
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:34.280]  a source in the white house that has told us that mcmaster co-conspired with john brennan
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:40.840]  brennan who is still running the dark side of the cia just like alan dullis ran the dark side
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:46.360]  of the cia after john f kennedy fired him brennan is leading up to the assassination of president
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:51.960]  donald trump he is following the playbook that is at david talbot's uh the devil's chessboard
[1:15:53.160 --> 1:16:00.840]  brennan john mccain who i think is going senile uh and herbert mcmaster co-conspired with both
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:08.360]  saudi arabian israel to pay 300 to 400 000 to the white helmets who did the false flag operation
[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:15.240]  the first one an mit professor has very clearly established that this was a ground improvised
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:23.720]  explosive and there was no sarin gas donald trump is being chumped and we out here the alt right
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:30.120]  are very very concerned that he is breaking every campaign promise he made about no more regime
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:36.440]  change no more elective wars from where i sit i'm still holding out hope that trump will come back
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:43.160]  to reality but right now it looks like he is an employee of dick cheney wow that is powerful
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:47.880]  info and hearing you speak we can pull up mainstream news cy harsh on every front backing up what you're
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:52.840]  saying we have our sources the the rebels have been caught three or four times staging chemical
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:58.280]  attacks even the un has had to confirm that they videotape it themselves trump wants to look strong
[1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:02.680]  he gets roped into the first you know strike a few months ago the problem is like the british
[1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:07.560]  ambassador said to syria once you do that you embolden the rebels to launch chemical attacks
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:12.840]  to draw the us in and hayley is saying the us ambassador for for the un for folks that
[1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:17.800]  just joined us she said to tweet what monday if there's anything that happens again in syria
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:23.000]  we're pinning it on russia so she told the rebels stage the false flag was that not the green light
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:32.040]  nicky hayley is our first indian american bimbo in the united nations um i'm sorry but i cannot
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:38.680]  take her seriously she is simply not being intelligent and she's demonstrating a grotesque
[1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:44.920]  lack of integrity unfortunately she's taking her lead from the trump white house which is controlled
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:51.320]  by mike pence and rents previous not by donald trump i am seriously concerned that our president
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:57.320]  is an enemy hands it is absolutely essential that donald trump stopped playing the deep state game
[1:17:57.320 --> 1:18:04.520]  by deep state rules on the deep state court in washington dc he needs to lead hashtag on rig
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:10.120]  he needs to get out of washington and reconnect not only with 26 percent of us that voted for him
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:15.000]  but the 73 percent that i agree he's got to do fireside chats he's got to get back on the road
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:21.080]  he's got to notice they're trying to sequester him like a chinese emperor or a punzel up in a tower
[1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:24.680]  where he you're trying to get him to not interface with the public but let's go back to what you
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:29.080]  just said because it's so bombshell let's walk through that uh brennan the wahhabist in you
[1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:33.240]  know uh still running deep state arrogantly telling the president you better watch your mouth
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:37.480]  deep state working against the president uh and clearly they're trying to sell the idea and get
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:43.080]  people ready for the assassination of trump let's let's let's walk through that well let's start with
[1:18:43.080 --> 1:18:49.800]  john brennan as a saudi whore and an american trader john brennan personally signed the visa
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:55.960]  applications for every single patsy for 9 11 that was carrying a saudi passport they were not all
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:19:02.760]  saudies they were simply given saudi passports as a logistics convenience dick chaney ran 9 11
[1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:09.160]  dick chaney murdered 3000 people on 9 11 to get his excuse to go to war on iraq and afghanistan
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:15.640]  and now dick chaney owns the golon heights which has all of the oil that rightfully belongs to syria
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:23.480]  this syrian thing was started by hillary clinton she sold syria to saudi arabia for tens of millions
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:29.720]  of dollars of donations to the clinton foundation which is the single greatest criminal charity on
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:37.160]  the planet after the united nations um i really am i'm deeply concerned about donald trump i wrote
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:42.760]  the trump revolution series at amazon most of those titles are free online donald trump is our
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:49.720]  legitimately elected president he can still be the greatest president ever but he has to understand
[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:55.800]  that he is being lied to by mike penson rents brevis and herbert McMaster to his credit mike
[1:19:55.800 --> 1:20:03.000]  pompale the director of the cia a a um the top graduate at west point which means he's a genius
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:09.160]  it is not easy to do mike pompale has told the president the truth about syria about syrian
[1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:15.800]  false flag operations and donald trump is being chumped by everybody else his white house comment
[1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:23.160]  line the white house petition line even twitter donald trump's twitter feed is being manipulated
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:30.360]  by eric schmidt and the twitter people and the whole everything donald trump reads is now controlled
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:43.080]  he doesn't get that he is being fed a pile of crap keep going ha ha ha alex come on this is where
[1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:48.200]  you guide me i mean i really want to play tennis with you here let me just say that you and i are
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:54.040]  on the same page we are patriots we want americans to come out let me just give you this alex i want
[1:20:54.040 --> 1:21:00.680]  to send you one by fedex along with your first unrig t-shirt hashtag on rig this is the international
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:09.240]  symbol of distress and what i really want to see happen here is every american this fourth of july
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:15.080]  needs to understand that their government is in enemy hands and they can take this 50 cent flag
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:20.600]  and they can turn it upside down and they can put hashtag on rig if they want to it i don't care
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:27.240]  bottom line here is every member of congress is coming home in august that's the opportunity for
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:32.200]  every american patriot to confront every member of congress just like we did five years ago and we
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.080]  got ron paul and ran paul and others have come out to say we're not al-qaeda's air force so they
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:42.680]  changed the name to isis to confuse us we've got a force in the not-take-control of the trump
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:47.640]  administration by staging this because clearly he comes out and countermans mac master and others
[1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:52.280]  that says no we're not removing Assad but then they've got deep state shooting down aircraft
[1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:57.000]  doing this now the russians have said you you come into airspace again we're going to shoot you down
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:03.160]  incredible brinksmanship i expect them to try to pull something by next week when trump is going
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:08.360]  to be meeting with putin we we have you know what trump and i want trump and putin to earn the
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:13.880]  nobel peace prize and i was nominated for the nobel peace prize but i've said publicly i don't
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:19.960]  deserve it it's trump and putin and ji and modi and india that can earn the nobel peace prize and
[1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:26.200]  they should putin has showed enormous restraint what our american patriots don't understand
[1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:33.560]  is that under george bush with buzzy krongaard sitting next to george tenet the united states
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:43.240]  of america has been waging a gold war against russia since 1998 9 11 was in part about covering
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:50.360]  up the 250 billion dollars in illicit profits that dick cheney earned from the gold war against
[1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:58.200]  russia we destroyed the russian economy as an act of war and putin has been enormously
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:02.760]  restrained about all of this if i had been putin i would have had buzzy krongaard and
[1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:08.440]  george tenet assassinated on the streets of america this is absolutely and dick cheney
[1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:18.280]  this is absolutely an outrageous decade-long war against russia the neil cons are out of control
[1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:23.880]  and isn't that because the trotskyites got kicked out of russia so they've always had a hard on
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:27.960]  because their daddies and granddaddies got kicked out by stalin and that's why they're such roosa
[1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:32.360]  fobs alex that's certainly a very intelligent observation but i think this is about filthy
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:38.600]  lucrative this is about money and power wanting money and this is about it's about getting a
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:44.760]  continent i mean russia eurasia all that has more assets and more raw minerals than africa
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:49.880]  yes but we're not going to do that i mean what's happening by the way russia will invite us in
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:55.880]  free market to exploit those resources that for everybody's game and and rex tolerson knows that
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:00.840]  right now rex tolerson is caught between a rock and a hard place he wants to serve the president
[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:07.080]  he wants to make peace and and do commerce as ron paul says we need a foreign policy of peace
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:11.560]  commerce and friendship i love ron paul he's one of the greatest americans we've got he'll create
[1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:18.040]  the greatest renaissance ever but he has been pushed out ron paul denis casinic patrick bucanon
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:24.200]  jesse ventura they've all been marginalized we synthia mckinney and i are inviting ron paul and
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:29.400]  denis casinic and jesse ventura and ralph nadir and i love patrick bucanon particularly we're
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:35.560]  inviting them to join hashtag on rig and lead at the second american revolution this summer
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:42.120]  and alex you could be the single most important kingmaker we would love to be exclusive to you
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:47.560]  as a channel for leading the second american revolution hashtag on rig well sure i mean i mean
[1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:51.400]  get in the audience behind something like that's a great idea will it defeat the globalist maybe
[1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:58.600]  maybe not the point is the action together will do it and expose this whole situation but undoubtedly
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:05.640]  soros is trying to get a bunch of civil unrest going what other threats are on your radar
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:09.960]  going into this summer i mean such critical changes unfolding that's a wonderful wonderful
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:14.760]  question the biggest threat alex is that there is an economic collapse coming in september
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:20.200]  martin armstrong has never been wrong i'd love to see him interviewed on your show he's the
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:27.720]  same greatest gone i was telling the girl let's get him on yes martin armstrong is easily accessible
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:34.360]  he is a genius you absolutely should have him on he spent seven years in jail because he refused
[1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:38.600]  to give his economic model to the central intelligence and he's been on before just
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:45.000]  which is too stupid to create its own okay cia is a bunch of drone dwellers i mean i was happy
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.640]  to be one of the thousand four hundred or so people that are actually in the field everybody
[1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:54.600]  else at cia lives in a cubicle and has no idea what's going on with the real power trip because
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:26:01.320]  i've got a cia id yes they're good people trapped in a bad system and one of the things that william
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:05.960]  benny and i and i hope you have been on again soon he sees absolutely wonderful we've agreed
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:10.680]  that 70 percent of the secret intelligence community should be shut down it's worthless it
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:17.080]  is wasteful the other big thing alex that i have realized since leaving the cia is that the greatest
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:24.200]  threat to our integrity is the fbi cia and nsa spying on our members of congress and then black
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:28.360]  mailing sure that's how they're controlling them let's come out real Saudi Arabia it's our own
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:34.200]  intelligence community spying on and blackmailing the members of congress i want to with the
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:40.040]  election reform act of 2017 i want to free the members of congress and i have told donald
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:45.080]  trump and he's read the memo he needs to offer a presidential pardon to every single member of
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:51.080]  congress who's being blackmailed for pedophilia tapes with jeffrey eppstein and others provided
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:56.760]  they reveal who they're blackmailers and that's the next big issue they tried to use pizza gate
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:00.600]  as a way to say pedophilia doesn't exist even though it's exploding everywhere now the
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:05.240]  number three guy number two guy depending on your look at it best friends with the pope
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:10.680]  we know use blackmail to get under controlled and they get rapsing around this is a huge move
[1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:19.080]  by the australians what is your intel on that my intel on that is that pedophilia is how the
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:25.880]  deep state holds everything together the free masons i'm told actually use sodomy at the higher
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:34.280]  levels that's the third eye um pedophilia is being normalized by the united nations by walt
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:42.840]  disney which is selling uh penis like toys um there is just so much evil going on our culture
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:48.760]  is being destroyed and it is being destroyed because the deep state wants us to give up all
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:55.640]  of our christian values give up all of our ethical lanes in the road and they are literally
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:02.600]  kidnapping between 800 000 and a million kids every year in the united states of america
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:09.720]  and these kids are not just being sonomized they're being killed in and tortured their blood is being
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:15.080]  adrenalineized and you know how the chinese boil dogs the chinese boil dogs in order to
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:20.440]  generalize the blood it changes the flavor of the meat that's the fastest way i found to explain
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:26.760]  to americans that children are being tortured peter feal in silicon valley has admitted publicly
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:36.440]  that he gets child blood transfusions he is one step away from paying top dollar for blood
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:41.880]  transfusions from children who have been tortured to death so that the blood is but let's be clear
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:45.480]  on the peter tilt thing i see him funding a lot of libertarian stuff and other issues i think he's
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:50.120]  being public about you know getting blood transfusions i think from like teenagers younger people
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.200]  and that whole science we know the role family's been using it that's through consent that's one
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:59.080]  issue but i think he's talking about publicly doing something above board through a company
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:04.760]  legally and lawfully and and and taking the black market and ending it what what what feal
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:09.960]  what feal has done is rendered a public service and i absolutely like the way you've moved this
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:17.160]  conversation because what feal has done is shown that young people's blood and i would add to that
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:25.400]  is the commodity and and bone marrow has been shown to be a very effective anti-aging technique
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:32.760]  this should open the public's eyes to the fact that for the last 50 years the elite has been

[1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:48.520]  A gas mask is the couture in the summer of rain The building masquerades within the
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:56.280]  sense You and I are vaccinated We're preparing us for an all-out police
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:33:57.280]  mistake
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:07.160]  That's Whelan Jennings' son, Shooter Jennings, a very accomplished artist in self.
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:12.360]  Actually, M4 is inspired, that song, Summer of Range, that's about five years old now,
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:13.360]  How Time Flies.
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:18.440]  That's the thing where they call yourself liberal or conservative, Stephen King also
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:20.120]  voiced the album.
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:25.340]  We all understand there's this hidden darkness of predators who have a religion of being
[1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:27.720]  psychopaths and not caring about the public.
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:32.000]  They've got their Wrenfields, their little servants or procurers that are a lot of times
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  abused children that have grown up.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:37.680]  So they're creating armies basically of trauma-based mind control.
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:43.160]  That's what Dr. Ewing Cameron of the CIA got caught doing in Canada and the US.
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:51.120]  Over 10,000 young children grabbed up, given LSD, PCP, cocktails for years, brainwashed,
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:56.720]  electroshock, giving them commands until you create true Manchurian candidates.
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:02.040]  It can really only be done at least with that old technology with girls, with higher levels
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:03.040]  of success.
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.520]  The boys would end up just being complete mental patients, but girls could compartmentalize
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:08.520]  it.
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.720]  They're way beyond all that, and again, they've used secrecy in the national security state
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:15.760]  to have criminal elements hide out in these agencies.
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:19.600]  I'm not defending the agencies, I'm not attacking them because they're just like Petri dishes
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:20.920]  growing this.
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:25.360]  They could also be used against the global, like we saw Patriots in US intelligence with
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:27.360]  the WikiLeaks, not the Russians.
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:31.760]  And most people, most of the police are awake, most of the militaries are awake, a lot of
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:35.480]  the intelligence agencies people are awake because they know M4 Wars isn't making this
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:36.480]  stuff up.
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:41.600]  What we are is a catalyst and a focal point to validate and let people know in government
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:43.960]  and outside that you're not alone.
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:49.600]  Robert David Steele, of course, was CIA operations in the field, and again, that's rare because
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:57.480]  most of it is analysts, and he's a longtime counterterrorism expert, RobertDavidSteal.com.
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:06.400]  This is website, pi-beta-iota.net also, Unrig.net, we'll talk about what he means by Unrig.
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:11.560]  But give us, and then I'm going to give the number out, it's 800-25-99231, you got a question
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:15.560]  for Robert David Steele or for myself, I want to make a statement, you disagree, agree.
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:18.480]  We don't screen your calls, just you have a good phone and tell us where you're calling
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:28.520]  from, 800-25-99231, 800-25-9923, 800-25-99231.
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:38.880]  Now, the 35,000-foot view, I see nationalism exploding, awakening new elites, disinformation
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:43.400]  being exposed, more information coming out, the fact that globalists are using orthodox
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:48.440]  radical Islam, radicalized, wound up by big foundations as a weapon to then bring in a
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:53.280]  police state here, we've seen May doing that, so we see the Spencer attack, but they are
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:57.600]  having major failures, they are panicked, even though Trump's only operating on half
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:04.040]  of his cylinders, devastating CNN, devastating the globalist, kind of again a catalyst to
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:08.480]  make people legitimize that the feelings they already have, I mean, I see big changes,
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:13.720]  but I see the Empire striking back, so what is your prognosis on the state of the world
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:15.000]  right now?
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.720]  Because I see us winning big, even though Trump surrounded, the problem is, as you said,
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:25.000]  they're clearly signaling, anything happens in Syria, we're blaming Assad, we're going
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.880]  to war with you, and trying to start a war with Russia, which any military analyst will
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:32.760]  tell you, in 25 minutes you can go to thermal nuclear war, so maybe we should walk through
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:34.080]  that before we take calls.
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:40.720]  Well, let me say that I think that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have a Reykjavik moment
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:43.560]  coming up here in Hamburg, and-
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:49.480]  And of course, that's just like Reagan meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland with Gorbachev.
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:54.720]  Yes, yes, yes, look, one of the things that John F. Kennedy discovered when he was talking
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:59.240]  to Nikita Khrushchev is the only people our presidents can trust are each other.
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:00.240]  Exactly.
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.520]  Khrushchev and Kennedy actually said they're generals where they're worst enemies.
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:08.960]  The American generals wanted to nuke Russia, and the Russian generals wanted to nuke the
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:10.280]  United States.
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:15.280]  Donald Trump needs to rise above all of these traders and miscreants that he's got surrounding
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:18.000]  him, many of them of his own choosing.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.120]  He is being lied to.
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:21.120]  And he-
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:22.120]  By the way, I have to interrupt.
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  You asked me to interrupt earlier, and I wouldn't, because you're so on target.
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.080]  I didn't get to this point.
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:30.080]  Search engine, you had it, I think, from Associated Press, like 10 minutes ago, crew.
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:32.320]  Trump's pushing to meet with Putin.
[1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:36.040]  He's already met with all these other leaders, the Indian prime minister, the Chinese president.
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:37.040]  Should have met with him.
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:39.200]  Should have met with Russia, probably second or third.
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:41.320]  But they said don't meet because of the optics.
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:42.640]  He should double down.
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:43.640]  They should hug.
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:44.800]  They should have an open debate.
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:49.480]  I mean, that shows how they're trying to literally, you know, enslave him and capture
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:55.800]  him, that he's having to push, that was the headline, Trump pushing to meet with Putin
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:58.800]  when Putin's been begging to meet with him day one.
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:01.920]  Because they escalated this crisis, made it a campaign issue.
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:04.520]  The Democrats have been caught doing what they said he did.
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:09.360]  He should have already met with Putin by January 30th.
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:12.400]  Trump is being chumped.
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:13.760]  I can't say it often enough.
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.240]  I also say God bless Donald Trump because he opened everyone's eyes to the lies of the
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:23.680]  secret intelligence world, to the fake news, the crap news network and all of that.
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:30.040]  What Trump has failed to do is change the rules of the game and get out of Washington,
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:31.040]  D.C.
[1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:36.640]  Donald Trump can be the greatest president ever if he leads hashtag on rig.
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:40.720]  I mean, I'm looking at videos from people all over the country saying, Mr. President,
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:42.240]  you said we have a rig system.
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:44.720]  Why are you not leading hashtag on rig?
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:45.720]  Okay.
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:48.000]  We have a seven minute video that's going viral.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.900]  It may make the front page of Reddit because of you, Alex, and God bless you.
[1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:57.320]  Our seven minute video has Cynthia McKinney up front, me in support, and then it has
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:03.480]  this wonderful young person saying, Mr. President, you said we have a rig system.
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:05.200]  Why aren't you leading hashtag on rig?
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:07.200]  Mr. President, I have the same question.
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:08.200]  Exactly.
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:09.200]  So let's expand on that.
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:13.320]  Even though he's surrounded by hyenas and everything else, he's fundamentally bringing
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:16.720]  power back to the presidency, back to Congress, doing some good things in the economy.
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:19.120]  And I'm not trying to cheerlead, but it's true.
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:23.160]  His big weakness is he loves the military so much he doesn't get it's infiltrated like
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:27.680]  anything else and that McMaster and them were arrogantly two months ago saying, yes, we're
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:30.840]  going to take out a side on Fox till Trump.
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:34.080]  And by the way, I talked to folks that talked to Trump or I could just say I talked to Trump,
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:35.080]  but I'm going to leave it at that.
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:37.200]  You said, no, we're not boots on the ground.
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:38.480]  We're not removing a side.
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:39.480]  That's all bull.
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:42.280]  And then three days later, after I said that Trump had said that, it was in the news that
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:45.040]  he said we're not doing this, but they don't care.
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:50.320]  Yeah, again, Mad Dog, Mattis, all of them are moving towards a major ground force.
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:52.520]  They're building up right now.
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:57.200]  And David Petraeus who works for a firm in New York City that is not Donald Trump's friend
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:00.160]  is also part of this problem.
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:07.560]  The military takes up 60% of our budget is 50% waste and cannot win a war against Russia
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:08.640]  or China.
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:10.880]  It couldn't even win a war in Iraq.
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:11.880]  Okay.
[1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:13.720]  Now I really am very concerned.
[1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:18.560]  I like James Madison, of course, I'm a former Marine, but the fact of the matter is James
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:22.000]  Madison, Donald Trump had a shit staff.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.920]  They're simply not up to world-class strategy.
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:29.920]  McMaster is a seriously overrated person who was about to be fired by the U.S. Army Chief
[1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:30.920]  of Staff.
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:35.000]  He should be sent back to the Army for court martial or early retirement because he is
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.200]  done.
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:38.720]  McMaster is part of Trump's problem.
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:45.800]  Trump needs a national strategy advisor, lower case, a clerk rather than a czar.
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:47.520]  Tillerson can still be saved.
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:51.720]  Mattis can still be saved, but Trump has to provide some leadership in a global strategic
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:52.720]  context.
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:53.720]  He's not doing that.
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:54.720]  None of these people.
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:59.720]  Well, I mean, as you know, though, for two months they've got an unnamed number of the
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:03.840]  word is it's a lot of Marines and heavy artillery and weapons and it's all being prepared and
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:04.840]  aimed right at Damascus.
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:07.200]  And I've talked to a lot of smart folks.
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:12.560]  They say that Syria will make Iraq more a cakewalk.
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:13.560]  Yes.
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:17.440]  And we're building up troops in both Egypt and Romania.
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:18.440]  Okay.
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:24.320]  Basically, Donald Trump is being lied to every single day by Pence, Priebus, McMaster, and
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:28.440]  he's being pressured by potential pedophiles.
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:33.920]  There's certainly being blackmailed by CIA over many issues, including sexual and financial
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:35.800]  improprieties in their past.
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:40.480]  John McCain and Lindsey Graham are being blackmailed by CIA.
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:42.520]  These are not people we should have in Congress.
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:43.520]  He was compromised.
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:45.480]  I've talked to folks on air.
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:46.480]  They're dead now.
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:49.520]  I also interviewed Admiral Moore, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:50.520]  They died naturally.
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:51.520]  I'm sorry.
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:52.520]  What?
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:53.520]  Were they murdered?
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:55.680]  I have had a lot of guests that have been murdered.
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:01.400]  I mean, it's kind of sad, but he was old.
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:07.960]  He died, but he was a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs staff, and they were just getting
[1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:13.720]  into, I mean, I forgot the point I was going to make, but I mean, it's just totally and
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:17.080]  completely insane, the point this country got into.
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:22.880]  And yet it's easily fixable, and this is why I was so excited to be invited back to Info
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:23.880]  Wars.
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:27.040]  And by the way, Cynthia McKinney is available on the 3rd of July.
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:31.120]  She and I are in St. Louis together, and she's open in the afternoon if you want her on this
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:33.280]  really wonderful webcam of mine.
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:38.320]  It's the Logitech Z393, I love it, 175 bucks at Best Buy.
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:41.600]  I was about to say, I know you do consumer reviews as well, I was going to say what camera
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:42.600]  is that?
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  It looks like HD.
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:49.640]  It's some of the best stuff there is in Logitech Z393 for 175 bucks.
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:52.240]  I recommend it to all of your guests.
[1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:53.240]  It will significantly...
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:54.240]  It looks 3D.
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:57.160]  I mean, it looks like what a $10,000 camera does.
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:00.400]  Yes, it is, and it only costs 175 bucks.
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:04.840]  Alex, I would actually recommend you buy a hundred of them and ship them to your favorite
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:05.840]  guests.
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:06.840]  I agree.
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:09.960]  In fact, that's my next plan, because I want to have folks that are hosting, like you coming
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:12.840]  in every week or couple of times a week in roundtable discussions.
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:15.880]  That's the type of broadcast I'm about to launch very, very soon.
[1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:18.560]  I think you're on the verge of a major breakout.
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:21.040]  You've already accomplished a great deal.
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:26.840]  But hashtag unrigged needs a national channel, and we're offering to be exclusive to you.
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:32.120]  Well, that's great, let me explain to people what this unrigged initiative is.
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:37.000]  It is nothing more or less than having all of our citizens understand that there are
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:42.200]  12 specific things that need to be changed in order to restore integrity to our government.
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:45.400]  This is the Election Reform Act of 2017.
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:51.400]  It is the, and I apologize if I haven't given you the graphic, but if your staff looks
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:55.440]  up Election Reform Act 2017, they'll get right to it.
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:59.440]  But here's the deal, Alex, Dr. McKinney and I are educators.
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:02.040]  We are getting a bus, an RV.
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:04.000]  We are going to drive all over the country.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:09.080]  We've already got a meetup, meetuppro.com forward slash unrigged.
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:10.560]  We've got a national meetup.
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:14.960]  We're setting up 435 chapters, one for every congressional meeting.
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:18.240]  Well, I would love to have you reporting with us each week as you go across the country.
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:19.720]  That's a fabulous idea.
[1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:23.000]  It would be a blessing from God to have that opportunity.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  There's no way.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.600]  I want to go to some calls while we have time here.
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:29.360]  Robert David Steele formally with the CIA actually in the field.
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  Yes, that's it.
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:31.360]  Absolutely.
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:32.360]  There it is, unrigged.
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:33.360]  Summer to peace.
[1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:37.280]  But we need to have a coalition that brings in liberals that are real liberals like Cynthia
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:42.800]  McKinney and others so that we can stop Soros trying to create all this violence and division.
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:44.800]  But that's my next question.
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:46.600]  Clearly they're trying to cause civil unrest.
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:48.720]  Clearly they're launching all of this.
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:52.640]  And I'm really concerned about this summer.
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:54.160]  What are your concerns?
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:57.280]  I'm very concerned because Berkeley was a dry run.
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:02.520]  I mean, one of the things Trump is not properly appreciating is that the establishment includes
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:06.320]  all the mayors, all the governors, and all the university presidents.
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:09.160]  Berkeley was allowed to be violent.
[1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:12.520]  The law enforcement people were told to stand down.
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.240]  George Soros is planning a violent summer revolution.
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:19.200]  Hashtag resist is the summer of violence.
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:21.600]  Hashtag unrigged is the summer of peace.
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:26.480]  And I credit Dr. Randy Short, a brilliant Harvard historian, a man of color who I had
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:29.200]  the privilege of meeting in Washington, D.C.
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:34.120]  So there is an opportunity here for the alt-right and the alt-left to come together and say
[1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.040]  the hashtag resist.
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:37.560]  We love you, man.
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:40.080]  But join us in the second American Revolution.
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:41.080]  Let me expand on that.
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:47.320]  Isn't it interesting that the Assange's and the Snowden's and a lot of other people, a
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:52.480]  lot of other people, I would call the real left, the intercept, all of them, have to
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:54.600]  admit Trump's really for real.
[1:46:54.600 --> 1:46:56.000]  And a lot of other liberals are saying that.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:01.240]  I mean, when it just comes to returning the republic, jobs, all of it, clearly the elite
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:03.160]  hate Trump for a good reason.
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:05.600]  He is trying to take power back from them.
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:08.440]  Alex, I would take a bullet for Donald Trump.
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:11.320]  I mean, the man is a blessing.
[1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:12.840]  God bless Donald Trump.
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:16.360]  And I've been saying that since July of 2015.
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:17.360]  I've been beating my head.
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:18.360]  Well, he's really smart.
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:19.960]  Why do you think he's got McMaster in there?
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:22.520]  Because I know everybody else said they wouldn't take the job.
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:27.640]  I have to say very candidly, I think Donald Trump is very impetuous.
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:29.920]  He makes decisions without proper betting.
[1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:34.640]  For example, he did not know, when he hired Mike Pence, he did not know that Mike Pence
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:38.680]  was an enabler and cover-up for pedophilia in his state, okay?
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:43.520]  And Flynn got fired in part because Mike Pence's best friend was on the pedophilia
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:45.480]  list out of Amsterdam, okay?
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.720]  I think Trump should offer Pence a pardon and Pence should resign.
[1:47:49.720 --> 1:47:51.240]  We can't fire him.
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:53.840]  Pence should resign and Cynthia McKinney should be the vice president.
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:58.760]  Now listen, expanding on that, I know there's a lot of stuff going on, but I mean, where's
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:02.680]  the news article or the proof about, I mean, the Vatican's covering a pedophilia.
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:04.600]  Where is it that Pence is involved?
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:13.160]  Well, first off, a guy named Troy Smith went on video and documented all of these allegations
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:14.480]  against Pence.
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:16.680]  It's not enough to indict Pence.
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:18.680]  It's not enough to convict Pence.
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:19.680]  It is true.
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:25.160]  Just to be clear, like with the Vatican and Penn State and Sandusky, we have all the proof.
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:28.240]  But then, I mean, people say stuff about that about me.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:30.160]  That's all I'm saying is, how do we know?
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:31.640]  I think you're clean, Alex.
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:33.240]  No, no, I know I am.
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:37.120]  The point is, I mean, maybe I drink too much sometimes and I drive my car too fast, but
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  I mean.
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:39.200]  Forget about pedophilia.
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:43.080]  The big problem with Pence is he works for Dick Cheney, George Bush, and John McCain.
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:44.240]  He doesn't work for Donald Trump.
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:48.680]  Well, clearly, I was told early on that even though he was popular with the base, look
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:51.440]  out, they were going to start trying to promote him to replace Trump.
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:54.360]  Now, MSM is promoting Pence to replace Trump.
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:55.880]  Well, it's worse than that.
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:00.480]  Mike Pence has created a political action committee.
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:07.240]  He has been caught calling major supporters of Donald Trump and trying to recruit them
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:08.640]  against Donald Trump.
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:13.720]  And, of course, the loyalists call Trump and say, hey, are you aware that Pence is stabbing
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:14.720]  you in the back?
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:15.720]  All right.
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:19.480]  Bottom line here is, Cynthia McKinney is not a threat to Donald Trump and she brings the
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:20.480]  alt-right.
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:27.440]  Cynthia McKinney has told me that no less than one-third and as many as half of the blacks
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:30.360]  are ready to leave the Democratic Party.
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:34.320]  But she is saying, and you can ask her yourself on the 3rd of July if you want her on the
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:38.640]  show, she's saying that Donald Trump has to reach out to the blacks.
[1:49:38.640 --> 1:49:44.760]  McKinney has to offer tangible policy solutions for the black people.
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:49.080]  They are being killed by the deep state.
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:54.120]  So bottom line here is, Cynthia McKinney and I are asking Donald Trump to stop playing
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:58.160]  the deep state game by deep state rules on the deep state court and come out here and
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:49:59.660]  play with America.
[1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:00.660]  Donald Trump.
[1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:01.660]  Well, I agree.
[1:50:01.660 --> 1:50:02.660]  That's what he did in the campaign.
[1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:03.660]  If he does that again, it's going to be amazing.
[1:50:03.660 --> 1:50:07.720]  We're going to come back and go to Doug, Stephen, Frank, Jason, and Justin in the next few
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:08.720]  segments.
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:14.960]  Then we have another guest joining us coming up, and I have open phones throughout the entire
[1:50:14.960 --> 1:50:15.960]  third hour.
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:20.500]  Then John Rappaport has put out a new article today in infowars.com detailing our MSM lies.
[1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:22.900]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:24.500]  That's always extremely informative.
[1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:25.500]  So much more coming up.
[1:50:25.500 --> 1:50:28.640]  Please don't forget, you built InfoWars.
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:30.500]  You spread the word.
[1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:32.460]  And when you buy the products, that's what funds us.
[1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:33.460]  They hate it.
[1:50:33.460 --> 1:50:34.460]  They want to shut us down.
[1:50:34.460 --> 1:50:36.700]  But because of you supporting us, that hasn't happened yet.
[1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:37.900]  So, again, thank you.
[1:50:37.900 --> 1:50:42.300]  Free shipping running through the 4th of July, Myco ZX, it's the latest probiotic that takes
[1:50:42.300 --> 1:50:46.220]  out the fungus and the yeast, not just the good bacteria.
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:51.460]  And Biome Defense is teamed up with it, our amazing probiotic, the highest quality foods.
[1:50:51.460 --> 1:50:52.460]  You can't beat it.
[1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:55.100]  I mean, there's stuff they sell from top labs that you can cost three times this that isn't
[1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:56.100]  even as good.
[1:50:56.100 --> 1:51:00.100]  4.9 stars out of hundreds of reviews.
[1:51:00.100 --> 1:51:05.100]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels
[1:51:05.100 --> 1:51:08.780]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:51:08.780 --> 1:51:13.700]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:17.100]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:51:17.100 --> 1:51:21.820]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:51:21.820 --> 1:51:22.820]  across America.
[1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:26.820]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:26.820 --> 1:51:30.420]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:51:30.420 --> 1:51:31.420]  healthier I feel.
[1:51:31.420 --> 1:51:34.060]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:39.340]  Over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to
[1:51:39.340 --> 1:51:41.700]  keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:03.540]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[1:52:03.540 --> 1:52:07.940]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:11.740]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[1:52:11.740 --> 1:52:14.740]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[1:52:14.740 --> 1:52:18.580]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[1:52:18.580 --> 1:52:21.420]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:25.540]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[1:52:25.540 --> 1:52:29.740]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[1:52:29.740 --> 1:52:34.980]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:39.500]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting
[1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:44.160]  food on hand, so no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:45.860]  We love our freeze dryer.
[1:52:45.860 --> 1:52:58.460]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-923-9591, that's HarvestRight.com or 800-923-9591.
[1:52:58.460 --> 1:53:00.220]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[1:53:00.220 --> 1:53:05.020]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:06.020]  I buy some.
[1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:07.020]  I use some.
[1:53:07.020 --> 1:53:08.020]  I store some.
[1:53:08.020 --> 1:53:09.020]  Awesome.
[1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:13.260]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life, NASA Pack technology.
[1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:14.260]  Bacon.
[1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:19.700]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon or warm and served.
[1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:21.700]  Life saving, ready to eat bacon.
[1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:23.460]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[1:53:23.460 --> 1:53:28.340]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com, FullyCookedBacon.com.
[1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:29.340]  It's a no-brainer.
[1:53:29.340 --> 1:53:31.580]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:36.060]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine
[1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:39.660]  disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[1:53:39.660 --> 1:53:41.580]  And does it all at only 2 cents per gallon.
[1:53:41.580 --> 1:53:45.220]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[1:53:45.220 --> 1:53:49.940]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:58.700]  Call or click 1-877-99-Berkey or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com, that's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[1:53:58.700 --> 1:54:15.660]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:54:15.660 --> 1:54:17.700]  Robert Davis-Shills will be with us a little bit in the next hour because I want to get
[1:54:17.700 --> 1:54:19.700]  back into this Vatican thing.
[1:54:19.700 --> 1:54:23.500]  The best friend of Pope Francis, who's a double dealer.
[1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:28.540]  He was a communist and a socialist, but then helped with the right-wing regime, round up
[1:54:28.540 --> 1:54:32.780]  all the socialists and communists and kill them in South America.
[1:54:32.780 --> 1:54:35.420]  So in Argentina, I mean, there's no end to these people.
[1:54:35.420 --> 1:54:40.340]  Robert David-Shills is our guest formerly in the field with the CIA.
[1:54:40.340 --> 1:54:42.820]  Just briefly, again, we have the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:48.780]  They have news articles out of the nation this week saying, he sells fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:53.580]  No, really, seriously, he's a swindler.
[1:54:53.580 --> 1:54:57.940]  I mean, it's the same people make toms of Maine that's sold in every store in the country.
[1:54:57.940 --> 1:55:02.900]  People know the fluoride they put in toothpaste is a Grignard reagent, heavy metal additive.
[1:55:02.900 --> 1:55:06.060]  I mean, my dad is a dentist.
[1:55:06.060 --> 1:55:07.580]  It's not calcium fluoride.
[1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:08.660]  You have to have a little bit of it.
[1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:09.660]  You die.
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:12.020]  It's hydrofluorosalic acid.
[1:55:12.020 --> 1:55:13.460]  My dad's an oral surgeon.
[1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:20.180]  I mean, they're making jokes about fluoride-free toothpaste, folks, with iodonic little silver.
[1:55:20.180 --> 1:55:21.180]  It's ridiculous.
[1:55:21.180 --> 1:55:27.260]  So, again, that's back in stock in FullWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[1:55:27.260 --> 1:55:29.860]  They are so mad that we're self-funding ourselves.
[1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:33.100]  They're even coming out and attacking that I sell toiletries now.
[1:55:33.100 --> 1:55:37.020]  Again, Bezos can own Whole Foods and sell this stuff and sell all the fluoride-free
[1:55:37.020 --> 1:55:38.780]  toothpaste they want, but I can't.
[1:55:38.780 --> 1:55:41.460]  That's why it's so important now more than ever to keep supporting the broadcast.
[1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:42.460]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:55:42.460 --> 1:55:45.860]  Let's go to phone calls here with Robert David Steele, who's been holding the longest.
[1:55:45.860 --> 1:55:51.420]  We've got Justin wants to talk about China, Jason wants to talk about Luciferians, Frank
[1:55:51.420 --> 1:55:56.020]  wants to talk about fact and fiction, Stephen wants to talk about Pito Rings, who's been
[1:55:56.020 --> 1:55:57.860]  holding the longest here.
[1:55:57.860 --> 1:56:03.740]  Let's go to Doug in California on the media, listening on KFCO, 1080 AM.
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:04.740]  You're on the air.
[1:56:04.740 --> 1:56:05.740]  Go ahead.
[1:56:05.740 --> 1:56:08.260]  Great to talk to you again, Alex.
[1:56:08.260 --> 1:56:10.860]  I've called you before years ago as comedic genius.
[1:56:10.860 --> 1:56:16.900]  I just want to congratulate the work that you've done.
[1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:21.020]  The only person who's put more, is more of Superman than you, of course, is President
[1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:22.020]  Trump.
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:23.500]  Please, I don't want to be the big kahuna.
[1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:24.900]  I want more people taking action.
[1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:27.740]  It shows how weak the globalist are that we've been so successful.
[1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:28.740]  But thank you.
[1:56:28.740 --> 1:56:29.740]  I remember you.
[1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:31.780]  You go and knock on doors and stuff, don't you?
[1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:38.460]  No, I'm the biggest loser here and I do politics, but also I have a water policy think tank.
[1:56:38.460 --> 1:56:43.380]  I right now advocate really looking in closely into damning the Golden Gate because of sea
[1:56:43.380 --> 1:56:44.380]  level rise.
[1:56:44.380 --> 1:56:49.700]  Anyway, what I'm calling it so much urgency is, you know, this new immigration law that
[1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:53.180]  they're considering, that Kate Steinle and then there's another one.
[1:56:53.180 --> 1:56:59.100]  Now, I'm here in the belly of the beast in phantakarism and they're cutting funding and
[1:56:59.100 --> 1:57:01.260]  they're doing a number of different things with us.
[1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:06.740]  What really has to be done to make this law effective is the sworn public servants and
[1:57:06.740 --> 1:57:10.940]  elected to have sworn to us to follow the Constitution and laws.
[1:57:10.940 --> 1:57:16.340]  But they have to be their non-compliance with federal ice holes.
[1:57:16.340 --> 1:57:17.340]  They actually have to be criminal.
[1:57:17.340 --> 1:57:18.340]  Sure.
[1:57:18.340 --> 1:57:19.340]  Let's expand on that.
[1:57:19.340 --> 1:57:20.340]  And here's the deal.
[1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:21.340]  Nobody wants to persecute migrants.
[1:57:21.340 --> 1:57:22.340]  Immigrants were brought here.
[1:57:22.340 --> 1:57:25.980]  But they're being brought in by the Soros groups, weaponized politically and turned to an arm
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:26.980]  of disintegration.
[1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:30.860]  That's why we have to say you have to come here legally and deport people that commit
[1:57:30.860 --> 1:57:32.300]  felonies and crimes.
[1:57:32.300 --> 1:57:35.780]  And you've seen the courts and rebellion against Trump, even banning people from failed
[1:57:35.780 --> 1:57:37.260]  Islamic states.
[1:57:37.260 --> 1:57:38.940]  Now the Supreme Court ruled properly.
[1:57:38.940 --> 1:57:40.540]  The president does have that power.
[1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:44.940]  Let's get Robert David Steele's take on that.
[1:57:44.940 --> 1:57:50.140]  I first off, I want to say that I really support you on your fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:57:50.140 --> 1:57:54.980]  I am just appalled at the number of people that are so ignorant they don't understand
[1:57:54.980 --> 1:57:57.780]  that you're actually rendering a service here.
[1:57:57.780 --> 1:58:05.660]  And I also have been a victim of basically a mental defective who is live streaming slander
[1:58:05.660 --> 1:58:08.420]  and trying to incite people to write letters.
[1:58:08.420 --> 1:58:11.140]  And I've got a restraining order and progress against them.
[1:58:11.140 --> 1:58:16.220]  And Google has just forced him to remove a number of videos that were slanders, including
[1:58:16.220 --> 1:58:20.300]  one playing a phone call with me that he tapes her obitiously.
[1:58:20.300 --> 1:58:24.580]  So Alex, I totally, totally support you on everything you're doing.
[1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:29.700]  And I really believe that it comes with the, your elevated status in America.
[1:58:29.700 --> 1:58:30.980]  That's when you start attracting.
[1:58:30.980 --> 1:58:34.940]  Yeah, let me ask you that question, is you're a smart guy, smarter than I am a lot of ways.
[1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:36.460]  What do you think I should do at this point?
[1:58:36.460 --> 1:58:38.060]  Because they're definitely coming after me.
[1:58:38.060 --> 1:58:42.140]  We'll be back in 70 seconds, Robert David Steele, more calls, thanks Doug, Stephen,
[1:58:42.140 --> 1:58:44.620]  Frank, Jason, Justin, we're going to all of you.
[1:58:44.620 --> 1:58:45.940]  Stay with us, infowars.com.
[1:58:45.940 --> 1:58:51.540]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:52.980]  It took you over a year to do it.
[1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:54.700]  Why is this so good?
[1:58:54.700 --> 1:58:59.260]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:58:59.260 --> 1:59:04.020]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:59:04.020 --> 1:59:05.020]  my system.
[1:59:05.020 --> 1:59:10.300]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[1:59:10.300 --> 1:59:15.580]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[1:59:15.580 --> 1:59:16.820]  disease around.
[1:59:16.820 --> 1:59:19.460]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:59:19.460 --> 1:59:20.460]  These are all parasites.
[1:59:20.460 --> 1:59:23.180]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:59:23.180 --> 1:59:24.420]  You have the neem in there.
[1:59:24.420 --> 1:59:27.500]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:30.860]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:31.860]  All right.
[1:59:31.860 --> 1:59:33.980]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:59:33.980 --> 1:59:36.980]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:36.980 --> 1:59:37.980]  And folks, you can't lose.
[1:59:37.980 --> 1:59:40.780]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:59:40.780 --> 1:59:44.060]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:44.060 --> 1:59:46.300]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:59:46.300 --> 1:59:51.860]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:59:51.860 --> 2:00:08.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:08.340 --> 2:00:14.660]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance from the front lines of
[2:00:14.660 --> 2:00:16.900]  the information war.
[2:00:16.900 --> 2:00:19.060]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:19.060 --> 2:00:23.380]  Unelected global corporate government that has a eugenics-based anti-human operating
[2:00:23.380 --> 2:00:27.460]  system is not going to be popular if we're challenging it and speaking out against it.
[2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:28.460]  They tried to stonewall.
[2:00:28.460 --> 2:00:29.940]  That hasn't worked.
[2:00:29.940 --> 2:00:31.380]  Now they're trying to destabilization.
[2:00:31.380 --> 2:00:33.340]  That hasn't worked.
[2:00:33.340 --> 2:00:38.020]  Mainstream media, corporations, institutions are being totally discredited.
[2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:39.220]  But how are they going to strike back?
[2:00:39.220 --> 2:00:41.700]  Well, that's Robert David Steele to start the next segment to get into that.
[2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:45.300]  I'm going to your calls obviously right now, and I want to get back into the Vatican.
[2:00:45.300 --> 2:00:46.300]  How big is this?
[2:00:46.300 --> 2:00:53.260]  The main confidant, the aid to camp, the head Catholic of Australia arrested for reportedly
[2:00:53.260 --> 2:00:58.300]  a whole string of pedo ring garbage.
[2:00:58.300 --> 2:01:02.500]  It was this pope came to power using pedo blackmail that was even in the Guardian.
[2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:04.260]  So now what's happening?
[2:01:04.260 --> 2:01:08.100]  The word I get is that Trump has green-lighted going after the pedophiles.
[2:01:08.100 --> 2:01:11.060]  Obviously they've got their operators in law enforcement as well, so there's a civil war
[2:01:11.060 --> 2:01:12.060]  over this.
[2:01:12.060 --> 2:01:14.500]  That's one reason the deep states fighting so hard.
[2:01:14.500 --> 2:01:17.220]  Robert David Steele is going to talk about that more right now with Robert David Steele.
[2:01:17.220 --> 2:01:18.220]  We're taking phone calls.
[2:01:18.220 --> 2:01:21.540]  Stephen in Florida on the pedo gate situation.
[2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:22.540]  Go ahead.
[2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:23.540]  Yeah.
[2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:24.540]  Good afternoon.
[2:01:24.540 --> 2:01:29.340]  First of all, I want to say Romans 12 says give honor to whom honors do.
[2:01:29.340 --> 2:01:32.580]  So I know you guys are patriots, Mr. Steele and Alex.
[2:01:32.580 --> 2:01:37.140]  I won't say thank you, but I do say I respect you and I'm glad you're doing what you're
[2:01:37.140 --> 2:01:38.140]  doing.
[2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:43.220]  And this, this issue about this pedophile ring and these provert criminals, it infuriates
[2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:44.220]  me.
[2:01:44.220 --> 2:01:45.220]  It's a lot of button issues.
[2:01:45.220 --> 2:01:49.660]  Oh, it's the only time I think about violence because I don't like being violent, but I
[2:01:49.660 --> 2:01:53.980]  mean, I fantasize about like jabbing daggers in their eyes, stuff like that.
[2:01:53.980 --> 2:01:54.980]  I mean, I'm being honest.
[2:01:54.980 --> 2:01:55.980]  I can't help it.
[2:01:55.980 --> 2:02:00.700]  I, when I think about pedophiles torturing kids, I want to kill.
[2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:01.700]  Go ahead.
[2:02:01.700 --> 2:02:02.700]  Sorry.
[2:02:02.700 --> 2:02:03.700]  Same way.
[2:02:03.700 --> 2:02:08.060]  And I just wanted to say real quick before I get to that, Johnny Depp, look into his
[2:02:08.060 --> 2:02:14.780]  eyes for Hunter Thompson, the Satanist that groomed him in Hollywood when he says he wants
[2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:15.780]  to kill Trump.
[2:02:15.780 --> 2:02:17.300]  I don't think he's blown smoke.
[2:02:17.300 --> 2:02:21.820]  I take that real serious to look into that, but you know, one of Hunter's Thompson's best
[2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:22.820]  friends.
[2:02:22.820 --> 2:02:23.820]  He's the famous artist.
[2:02:23.820 --> 2:02:24.820]  I interviewed him.
[2:02:24.820 --> 2:02:29.220]  He said Hunter's Thompson was about to expose pedophile rings and things and then it was
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:32.820]  disinfo against him by the pedophile rings because he was writing about it.
[2:02:32.820 --> 2:02:34.740]  Let me see what Robert David Steele has to say.
[2:02:34.740 --> 2:02:35.740]  Go ahead.
[2:02:35.740 --> 2:02:40.060]  I agree with that and let me just point out, let me just point out that pedophilia does
[2:02:40.060 --> 2:02:42.580]  not stop with sodomizing children.
[2:02:42.580 --> 2:02:47.940]  It goes straight into terrorizing them to adrenalize their blood and then murdering
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:48.940]  them.
[2:02:48.940 --> 2:02:54.620]  It also includes murdering them so that they can have their bone marrow harvested as well
[2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:56.660]  as body parts.
[2:02:56.660 --> 2:02:57.660]  Pedophilia is much bigger.
[2:02:57.660 --> 2:03:00.420]  This is the original growth hormone.
[2:03:00.420 --> 2:03:01.420]  Yes.
[2:03:01.420 --> 2:03:02.420]  Yes.
[2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:08.220]  It's an anti-aging thing and this may strike your listeners as way out, but we actually
[2:03:08.220 --> 2:03:14.820]  believe that there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children who were kidnapped
[2:03:14.820 --> 2:03:18.260]  and sent into space on a 20-year ride.
[2:03:18.260 --> 2:03:23.460]  So that once they get to Mars, they have no alternative but to be slaves on the Mars colony.
[2:03:23.460 --> 2:03:25.260]  There's all kinds of...
[2:03:25.260 --> 2:03:30.020]  Look, I know 90% of the NASA missions are secret and I've been told by high-level NASA
[2:03:30.020 --> 2:03:32.060]  engineers that you have no idea.
[2:03:32.060 --> 2:03:34.380]  There's so much stuff going on, but then it goes off into all that.
[2:03:34.380 --> 2:03:37.380]  I mean, that's the kind of thing the media jumps on, but I know this.
[2:03:37.380 --> 2:03:42.900]  We see a bunch of a mechanical wreckage on Mars and people say, oh, look, it looks like
[2:03:42.900 --> 2:03:43.900]  a mechanic.
[2:03:43.900 --> 2:03:45.380]  They go, oh, you're conspiracy theorist.
[2:03:45.380 --> 2:03:47.540]  Clearly, they don't want us looking into what's happening.
[2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:49.620]  Every time probes go over, they turn them off.
[2:03:49.620 --> 2:03:54.620]  Alex, you're one of the most original guys on the air and you asked what should you do.
[2:03:54.620 --> 2:03:59.540]  I think you should be the truth channel in America and I think you should really try
[2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:04.700]  to systematically put guests on that Donald Trump is not listening to because they're
[2:04:04.700 --> 2:04:06.780]  being blocked from him.
[2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:11.420]  For example, Carl Denninger, co-founder of the Tea Party, he should be a guest on your
[2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:16.100]  show talking about how the Trump health plan, the Ryan health plan is completely dishonest
[2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:20.180]  because it doesn't have a price list and it doesn't allow the government to negotiate with
[2:04:20.180 --> 2:04:21.660]  the companies.
[2:04:21.660 --> 2:04:26.820]  You should have Edgar Fage, the inventor of the automated payment transaction tax that
[2:04:26.820 --> 2:04:31.900]  would eliminate all taxes, including income taxes on people like you and me, and it would
[2:04:31.900 --> 2:04:32.900]  tax currency and stocks.
[2:04:32.900 --> 2:04:35.900]  Is that the Tobin tax?
[2:04:35.900 --> 2:04:39.220]  Is that the Tobin tax?
[2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:40.620]  I don't think so.
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:41.620]  It's similar.
[2:04:41.620 --> 2:04:47.340]  It's a tiny fractional tax on every transaction, including internal corporate transactions
[2:04:47.340 --> 2:04:49.100]  where a lot of money laundering goes on.
[2:04:49.100 --> 2:04:54.300]  Well, I don't know about Mars bases, but I know they've created massive thousands of
[2:04:54.300 --> 2:04:59.740]  different types of chimeras that are alien life forms on this earth now.
[2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:07.140]  Russian Senator Alexei Pushkov warns that the U.S. is preparing a false flag provocation
[2:05:07.140 --> 2:05:14.420]  as a pretext to launch a military assault on Syria, responding to a CNN report that
[2:05:14.420 --> 2:05:19.180]  the U.S. has ships and aircraft in place to strike Syria.
[2:05:19.180 --> 2:05:24.540]  Pushkov cautioned that this could be the precursor to a staged incident.
[2:05:24.540 --> 2:05:30.060]  Meanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, posted on Twitter the other day,
[2:05:30.060 --> 2:05:36.020]  any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad.
[2:05:36.020 --> 2:05:41.420]  The ambassador right there referring to the mass murder of civilians, including children,
[2:05:41.420 --> 2:05:48.340]  during the April 2017 chemical weapons attack, an incident that most experts and investigators
[2:05:48.340 --> 2:05:54.580]  outside the mainstream believe was a false flag terror attack carried out by Western
[2:05:54.580 --> 2:05:55.580]  powers.
[2:05:55.580 --> 2:05:59.220]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[2:05:59.220 --> 2:06:04.460]  The reason Infowars Life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want

[2:06:05.900 --> 2:06:06.900]  I take this.
[2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:07.900]  My family takes this.
[2:06:07.900 --> 2:06:11.580]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going
[2:06:11.580 --> 2:06:12.580]  to find anywhere.

[2:06:16.900 --> 2:06:21.460]  If I ever forget to take them, like I'll I have a noticeable difference.
[2:06:21.460 --> 2:06:22.700]  I don't feel good.
[2:06:22.700 --> 2:06:26.300]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:29.060]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[2:06:29.060 --> 2:06:35.140]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[2:06:35.140 --> 2:06:37.300]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[2:06:37.300 --> 2:06:41.460]  So and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:43.580]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[2:06:43.580 --> 2:06:44.580]  I love it.
[2:06:44.580 --> 2:06:47.300]  The nascent iodine is essential.
[2:06:47.300 --> 2:06:48.300]  Survival Shield X2.
[2:06:48.300 --> 2:06:51.700]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing, that I would suggest it's nascent
[2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:55.900]  iodine Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating.
[2:06:55.900 --> 2:07:00.100]  It's a win-win InfowarsLife.com.
[2:07:00.100 --> 2:07:04.060]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[2:07:04.060 --> 2:07:09.420]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[2:07:09.420 --> 2:07:14.380]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:15.980]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:07:15.980 --> 2:07:19.820]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[2:07:19.820 --> 2:07:23.900]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[2:07:23.900 --> 2:07:29.140]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[2:07:29.140 --> 2:07:33.220]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[2:07:33.220 --> 2:07:35.020]  the products that you need each month.
[2:07:35.020 --> 2:07:38.660]  Just go to InfowarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products.

[2:07:48.060 --> 2:07:49.420]  this is a sure win.
[2:07:49.420 --> 2:07:51.020]  10% off on auto ship.
[2:07:51.020 --> 2:07:53.420]  Win, win, win at InfowarsLife.com.
[2:07:53.420 --> 2:07:55.420]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[2:07:55.420 --> 2:08:10.540]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[2:08:10.540 --> 2:08:17.260]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:18.260]  the Infowar.
[2:08:18.260 --> 2:08:34.620]  So, they want to say that basically, pedophilia doesn't even exist anymore, even though rampantly
[2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:39.660]  they're being indicted, the heads of Penn State, the Sandusky Son, the Catholic Church.
[2:08:39.660 --> 2:08:44.300]  Number three in the Catholic Church, number two to the Pope, I mean, his main aid to
[2:08:44.300 --> 2:08:51.420]  camp, indicted for running mass child rape operations reportedly.
[2:08:51.420 --> 2:08:53.180]  Truth is strange with the fiction.
[2:08:53.180 --> 2:08:58.620]  I mean, Prince Charles' main bloodline is of Lydde and Paylor, who is the archetype
[2:08:58.620 --> 2:09:01.980]  of Count Dracula, whose family crest was the dragon.
[2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:08.340]  And then his offspring would bathe in blood and drink blood and boil children's bones
[2:09:08.340 --> 2:09:09.860]  and they believed it made them live longer.
[2:09:09.860 --> 2:09:13.060]  That's in mainline history books.
[2:09:13.060 --> 2:09:18.220]  And I'll have national media go, Jones is crazy and claims that Prince Charles is related
[2:09:18.220 --> 2:09:19.220]  to Dracula.
[2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:24.100]  He lives there half the year now and is in all these weird videos and stuff on TV at
[2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:27.540]  orphanages hugging and kissing on kids on television.
[2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:32.700]  I mean, I don't even want to, if you think I'm joking around, just type in Prince Charles
[2:09:32.700 --> 2:09:37.020]  visits orphanage in Transylvania and then like kids run up and kiss him and he goes,
[2:09:37.020 --> 2:09:39.180]  so I've been friends with this little boy for five years.
[2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:40.180]  I love him.
[2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:44.500]  And it's just like, you're just like, oh my God, this can't be real.
[2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:48.020]  But this is how they throw it in your face.
[2:09:48.020 --> 2:09:53.140]  And then Robert David Steele, big career at the CIA ran, you know, big operations in
[2:09:53.140 --> 2:09:57.740]  the field, respected John, he goes, yeah, and the word is they've got some breakaway
[2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:01.300]  civilization, you know, colony missions they launched.
[2:10:01.300 --> 2:10:05.340]  And you hear that, but then I knew a guy, still know a guy who's actually a big Hollywood
[2:10:05.340 --> 2:10:10.020]  producer, who was top of his class and when he was a kid was in one of these programs
[2:10:10.020 --> 2:10:15.220]  down in Houston, getting these kids ready for simulated missions to Mars.
[2:10:15.220 --> 2:10:18.740]  And they were talking about cinema like 10 was in the test.
[2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:23.460]  And then I remember Buzz Aldrin, not Buzz Lightyear, the real Buzz Aldrin was on my
[2:10:23.460 --> 2:10:25.820]  broadcast about nine years ago.
[2:10:25.820 --> 2:10:29.700]  And he told no one else this but me, later he got asked about it and said some of it
[2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:31.200]  on C-SPAN.
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:32.200]  This really happened.
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:38.540]  I thought it wasn't the real Buzz Aldrin, because I don't get into the UFOs.
[2:10:38.540 --> 2:10:44.020]  They say, John says there's no space missions and John says lizards run everything and John
[2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:45.340]  says the earth is flat.
[2:10:45.340 --> 2:10:47.100]  I don't say any of that.
[2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:49.620]  I say there's more space missions than they're telling you.
[2:10:49.620 --> 2:10:50.620]  That's admitted.
[2:10:50.620 --> 2:10:57.300]  So we're going to go back to our guests, your calls for a moment, but you can Google, Buzz
[2:10:57.300 --> 2:11:05.500]  Aldrin says look at the moon of Mars and says they're obelisk on Mars and that's on my show.
[2:11:05.500 --> 2:11:10.660]  So about six months before India crashed that probe in to see if there's water, well they
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:14.060]  already knew there's water all under the surface of the moon.
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:19.060]  Before they did that, when I was talking to Buzz Aldrin out in LA, it was off record
[2:11:19.060 --> 2:11:23.940]  conversation, most of it, but I mean I just can't hold back at a certain point.
[2:11:23.940 --> 2:11:28.820]  I mean he said some of this on air and it was just wild and he wasn't kidding around
[2:11:28.820 --> 2:11:29.820]  either.
[2:11:29.820 --> 2:11:36.500]  I mean, you know, moon bases, missions that have already been to Mars, he said, and watch,
[2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:39.180]  if you don't believe me, they're going to announce water on Mars.
[2:11:39.180 --> 2:11:42.780]  The probe will find water, he's really laughing, and he goes, we know, because this is the
[2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:45.260]  way we're announcing it through them.
[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:50.980]  I mean it's just so weird, the secret societies and NASA and all the occult stuff, Robert
[2:11:50.980 --> 2:11:53.140]  David Steele, that's a whole other can of worms.
[2:11:53.140 --> 2:11:57.340]  I don't even cover that, but it's something they don't want anybody to touch.
[2:11:57.340 --> 2:11:58.340]  Go ahead.
[2:11:58.340 --> 2:12:02.140]  Let me just say, Alex, you haven't said anything about the book that I'm co-sponsoring on
[2:12:02.140 --> 2:12:03.140]  pedophilia.
[2:12:03.140 --> 2:12:06.500]  Well, I mentioned it when you first came on, let's talk about that in the Vatican and
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:07.500]  then go to Coles.
[2:12:07.500 --> 2:12:10.980]  Okay, this is going to be a blockbuster.
[2:12:10.980 --> 2:12:16.180]  Hakeem Hagelpan is a West Point graduate, one of the best investigative journalists
[2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:21.780]  we have today, and we're publishing every chapter free online, and of course we'd be
[2:12:21.780 --> 2:12:23.540]  honored if you wanted to publish them.
[2:12:23.540 --> 2:12:31.580]  This is going to be the definitive book on pedophilia in this generation.
[2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:38.460]  The occult, what you call Satanism is always the same archetype as associated with this.
[2:12:38.460 --> 2:12:41.460]  Whether it's some genetic manifestation of the brain, or whether it's interdimensional,
[2:12:41.460 --> 2:12:45.180]  whatever it is, it's real, it's manifesting, from your deep research of this, when did
[2:12:45.180 --> 2:12:48.300]  you discover it's like a pedophile network ruling the planet?
[2:12:48.300 --> 2:12:53.820]  That's the consensus now, even in mainline literature and research, this is an empire
[2:12:53.820 --> 2:12:56.300]  of people that feed on children.
[2:12:56.300 --> 2:13:03.180]  I have to say, Alex, I was late to really understand all of this, and I'm 64, 65 years
[2:13:03.180 --> 2:13:09.500]  old, and what I'm finding is that it's not until people get to be about 50 to 60 that
[2:13:09.500 --> 2:13:12.900]  their minds starting to open to possibilities.
[2:13:12.900 --> 2:13:16.580]  Everybody else is happy in the little lane in the road that the government gives them,
[2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:18.620]  that the fake news media gives them.
[2:13:18.620 --> 2:13:27.420]  But PizzaGate, for me, was a major event because a Romanian taxi driver, not Russian intelligence,
[2:13:27.420 --> 2:13:32.180]  got John Podesta to do something really stupid, respond to a phishing attack, and it broke
[2:13:32.180 --> 2:13:33.300]  it all open.
[2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:38.620]  The code words, the small children by name, invited to the swimming pool party with John
[2:13:38.620 --> 2:13:45.100]  Podesta, all of this is sick, sick, sick, and it's all documented, documented, documented.
[2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:51.020]  What we're not at yet is people realizing that it includes satanic rituals, the murder
[2:13:51.020 --> 2:13:53.460]  of children, the drinking of blood.
[2:13:53.460 --> 2:13:54.460]  That's the final veil.
[2:13:54.460 --> 2:14:00.260]  I'm a commissioner on the International Tribunal of Natural Justice with Sasha Stone, and the
[2:14:00.260 --> 2:14:05.140]  Chief Justice and many others, in fact, Cynthia McKinney, I think, will also be a commissioner.
[2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:10.220]  We have a year-long project on pedophilia that is going to blow the top off this thing,
[2:14:10.220 --> 2:14:15.900]  and the book is a first step toward helping the public understand that the deep state
[2:14:15.900 --> 2:14:18.380]  is glued together by pedophilia.
[2:14:18.380 --> 2:14:19.380]  That's how they control.
[2:14:19.380 --> 2:14:20.380]  Sure.
[2:14:20.380 --> 2:14:21.380]  Let's expand on that, though.
[2:14:21.380 --> 2:14:22.940]  Let's expand on that.
[2:14:22.940 --> 2:14:27.260]  You go back to every ancient society that got more complex, they would always get more
[2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:31.740]  corrupt, whether it was in Western Europe, or whether it was in Asia, or whether it was
[2:14:31.740 --> 2:14:35.620]  in Mesoamerica, you always end up building pyramids, it always ends up with throwing
[2:14:35.620 --> 2:14:39.940]  virgins into fire, that means young girls, young boys.
[2:14:39.940 --> 2:14:46.420]  There is some weird anomaly that keeps manifesting itself, and it's happening in modern time
[2:14:46.420 --> 2:14:48.540]  in association with people in power.
[2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:54.260]  Is it just some sacrament to prove that you will hurt the young and that you're a psychopath?
[2:14:54.260 --> 2:14:57.020]  Is it like a gang initiation, or why does it keep manifesting?
[2:14:57.020 --> 2:15:01.620]  Alex, you're one of the foremost commentators on mind control, and I would tell people that
[2:15:01.620 --> 2:15:08.180]  not only does David Talbot do an excellent job in the devil's chess board, documented
[2:15:08.180 --> 2:15:13.140]  how CIA, with Nazi scientists help, got a really good, and Yale University help, got
[2:15:13.140 --> 2:15:17.140]  a really good job, really good grip on mind control.
[2:15:17.140 --> 2:15:19.980]  That's what they brought in, the angel of death to help.
[2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:26.460]  Now it's far advanced, so what we have here is pedophilia and mind control and blackmail
[2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:31.420]  and bribery are all part of how the deep state, which begins with the Rothschilds and the
[2:15:31.420 --> 2:15:36.500]  Black Pope, the Jesuit Black Pope, then the City of London, the Bank, Wall Street, they
[2:15:36.500 --> 2:15:43.780]  use mind control and pedophilia and blackmail and bribery to basically manage the Freemasons,
[2:15:43.780 --> 2:15:49.940]  the Knights of Malta, and other secret societies that are willing to betray every national,
[2:15:49.940 --> 2:15:53.580]  corporate, and cultural loyalty.
[2:15:53.580 --> 2:16:01.700]  So it's part of the hidden control of our economy, our society, our government.
[2:16:01.700 --> 2:16:03.980]  And that's what hashtag on rig is all about.
[2:16:03.980 --> 2:16:04.980]  Exactly.
[2:16:04.980 --> 2:16:08.140]  So what would you call this, this big awakening that's coming?
[2:16:08.140 --> 2:16:11.300]  And then what are the anomalies, what are the counter strikes that we're going to see
[2:16:11.300 --> 2:16:13.140]  by the forces of the vampires?
[2:16:13.140 --> 2:16:15.700]  Well, I'm worried about a pandemic, Alex.
[2:16:15.700 --> 2:16:19.180]  I really think that the empire is planning a pandemic.
[2:16:19.180 --> 2:16:24.820]  I think that they are going to unleash a virulent airborne...
[2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:26.260]  And Chelsea's new book said that.
[2:16:26.260 --> 2:16:30.780]  We need global government to respond to the global pandemic that's coming.
[2:16:30.780 --> 2:16:32.100]  That's absolutely false.
[2:16:32.100 --> 2:16:34.660]  Global government is the worst possible solution.
[2:16:34.660 --> 2:16:41.340]  One of the things that a Nobel Prize was given to Eleanor Ostrom for governing the comments.
[2:16:41.340 --> 2:16:46.060]  And what she demonstrated is that the only kind of governance that works is self-governance
[2:16:46.060 --> 2:16:47.460]  at the local level.
[2:16:47.460 --> 2:16:49.580]  The higher you move, authorities...
[2:16:49.580 --> 2:16:50.580]  Everybody knows that.
[2:16:50.580 --> 2:16:52.980]  The more you're not in touch with what's happening, the more authoritarian.
[2:16:52.980 --> 2:16:53.980]  Exactly.
[2:16:53.980 --> 2:16:54.980]  Yeah.
[2:16:54.980 --> 2:16:56.780]  I mean, a socialist wrote the book, Small is Beautiful.
[2:16:56.780 --> 2:16:57.820]  They were right about that.
[2:16:57.820 --> 2:16:59.900]  So why don't they see that socialism doesn't work?
[2:16:59.900 --> 2:17:01.980]  You need absolute individualism.
[2:17:01.980 --> 2:17:06.500]  Then through free market, it creates the ultimate collectivism of individual free will.
[2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:12.900]  Alex, I would like you to be the voice for hashtag on rig, okay?
[2:17:12.900 --> 2:17:14.660]  This is respecting the flag.
[2:17:14.660 --> 2:17:17.540]  This is the international distress symbol.
[2:17:17.540 --> 2:17:18.540]  No, I agree.
[2:17:18.540 --> 2:17:19.540]  You're on July 3rd.
[2:17:19.540 --> 2:17:20.540]  We'll talk about Cynthia.
[2:17:20.540 --> 2:17:21.860]  I admire her exposing the pedophile rings.
[2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:25.740]  And remember, in Congress, she exposes it and the Secretary of Defense didn't even deny
[2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:26.740]  it.
[2:17:26.740 --> 2:17:28.340]  He admitted it was going on.
[2:17:28.340 --> 2:17:33.460]  We not only have the military participating in pedophilia and military transports bringing
[2:17:33.460 --> 2:17:39.020]  in kids that have been kidnapped or purchased in Thailand and elsewhere.
[2:17:39.020 --> 2:17:42.780]  We also have a lot of male rape in the military.
[2:17:42.780 --> 2:17:46.340]  We have Kate Griggs, whom you'll remember, Colonel Griggs's wife in the Marine Corps
[2:17:46.340 --> 2:17:51.580]  talking about the sadomasochistic Nazi disease that is prevalent among our senior officers
[2:17:51.580 --> 2:17:53.020]  in the military.
[2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:56.300]  Did you ever run into any of that when you were an officer in the Marines?
[2:17:56.300 --> 2:17:58.860]  The short answer is no.
[2:17:58.860 --> 2:18:00.340]  And I feel blessed by that.
[2:18:00.340 --> 2:18:03.940]  I was asked to join the Masons when I was in the CIA.
[2:18:03.940 --> 2:18:08.700]  And I'm glad that I didn't because it turns out most Masons are good people trapped in
[2:18:08.700 --> 2:18:09.700]  a bad system.
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:14.140]  Well, it's just like any secret organization, other cults use it to recruit.
[2:18:14.140 --> 2:18:15.140]  Yes.
[2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:16.140]  Yes.
[2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:17.140]  We're going to...
[2:18:17.140 --> 2:18:19.140]  I got to keep it even longer because I promise we're going to calls.
[2:18:19.140 --> 2:18:21.260]  I don't want to cut these callers off, but let's get started here.
[2:18:21.260 --> 2:18:24.860]  We've got Frank, Jason, Justin, Travis, Dean, we're going to everybody.
[2:18:24.860 --> 2:18:25.860]  Let's go ahead.
[2:18:25.860 --> 2:18:26.860]  Who's been home the longest here?
[2:18:26.860 --> 2:18:27.860]  Justin and Alabama.
[2:18:27.860 --> 2:18:29.060]  Let's shift gears into China.
[2:18:29.060 --> 2:18:30.060]  Go ahead.
[2:18:30.060 --> 2:18:31.060]  Hey, Alex.
[2:18:31.060 --> 2:18:35.740]  Man, awesome to talk to you and Mr. Steele.
[2:18:35.740 --> 2:18:38.820]  Well, I have you here, man.
[2:18:38.820 --> 2:18:45.820]  I was just thinking with the Russia narrative dead, would it be a great idea to go on offense
[2:18:45.820 --> 2:18:50.020]  and talk about China's involvement in our election?
[2:18:50.020 --> 2:18:52.980]  It's connected to so many things.
[2:18:52.980 --> 2:18:53.980]  That's a great point.
[2:18:53.980 --> 2:18:54.980]  Well, let me ask Steele this.
[2:18:54.980 --> 2:18:55.980]  I mean, I think we've turned the corner.
[2:18:55.980 --> 2:18:58.020]  I think the Russia thing is starting to die.
[2:18:58.020 --> 2:18:59.020]  Do you agree with that?
[2:18:59.020 --> 2:19:00.020]  Yes.
[2:19:00.020 --> 2:19:01.020]  I agree with that.
[2:19:01.020 --> 2:19:02.420]  And let me respectfully point out to your guests.
[2:19:02.420 --> 2:19:05.940]  The only person that hacked the US election was Hillary Clinton.
[2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:09.340]  She stole 13 state primaries from Bernie Sanders.
[2:19:09.340 --> 2:19:10.340]  Exactly.
[2:19:10.340 --> 2:19:12.220]  And only Trump's talking about it.
[2:19:12.220 --> 2:19:13.220]  Sanders won't even do it.
[2:19:13.220 --> 2:19:15.020]  Oh, Sanders is a sheepdog.
[2:19:15.020 --> 2:19:17.500]  I mean, the People's Party is sheepdog 2.0.
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:22.300]  And one of the reasons why I feel so blessed to have Cynthia McKinney as my partner and
[2:19:22.300 --> 2:19:26.220]  co-founder of hashtag on rig is she is everything I'm not.
[2:19:26.220 --> 2:19:28.420]  I'm an alt-right white male.
[2:19:28.420 --> 2:19:31.220]  She is an alt-left black female.
[2:19:31.220 --> 2:19:35.820]  And what we're trying to do is reach out to the Sandronistas and reach out to the Trump
[2:19:35.820 --> 2:19:40.260]  pieces and bring them together and say, let's move beyond Trump and Sanders.
[2:19:40.260 --> 2:19:41.260]  Let's restore it.
[2:19:41.260 --> 2:19:42.260]  Well, you know why McKinney's good.
[2:19:42.260 --> 2:19:46.020]  The way they destroyed her, they lied about her because they're scared of her because
[2:19:46.020 --> 2:19:47.020]  she has so much courage.
[2:19:47.020 --> 2:19:49.380]  She'll be on next July 3rd if you can give me.
[2:19:49.380 --> 2:19:52.860]  She's one of the most talented people I know, Alex, and I know she would be honored to be
[2:19:52.860 --> 2:19:53.860]  on next July 3rd.
[2:19:53.860 --> 2:19:54.860]  No, I know.
[2:19:54.860 --> 2:19:55.860]  You're on.
[2:19:55.860 --> 2:19:56.860]  You're on.
[2:19:56.860 --> 2:19:57.860]  You're on July 3rd.
[2:19:57.860 --> 2:19:58.860]  Justin, we're coming right back to you.
[2:19:58.860 --> 2:19:59.860]  She's going to come back.
[2:19:59.860 --> 2:20:01.140]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[2:20:01.140 --> 2:20:05.980]  I'm talking thick meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[2:20:05.980 --> 2:20:06.980]  I buy some.
[2:20:06.980 --> 2:20:07.980]  I use some.
[2:20:07.980 --> 2:20:08.980]  I store some.

[2:24:15.780 --> 2:24:19.660]  At least another 10-15 minutes take your phone calls and I've got a Paul Watson report I've
[2:24:19.660 --> 2:24:20.660]  got to get to.
[2:24:20.660 --> 2:24:24.780]  I don't have any tombstone for the undead creature known as CNN.
[2:24:24.780 --> 2:24:26.740]  This report we're going to air is it.
[2:24:26.740 --> 2:24:30.700]  So the video of CNN doesn't want you to see with Paul Watson coming up.
[2:24:30.700 --> 2:24:35.700]  And I've always known if we just promote liberty, promote open free societies, promote Americana,
[2:24:35.700 --> 2:24:40.100]  they're going to be strong men and women, they're going to wake up and take action politically
[2:24:40.100 --> 2:24:42.740]  and culturally they'll be way more articulate than I am.
[2:24:42.740 --> 2:24:43.740]  Or anybody else.
[2:24:43.740 --> 2:24:45.020]  Paul Watson's one of them.
[2:24:45.020 --> 2:24:48.860]  Donald Trump who I've ever thought, I've looked at his past now, he was fighting after
[2:24:48.860 --> 2:24:53.540]  CNN 30 years ago, he was against the globalist so he knew about the stuff where I was born.
[2:24:53.540 --> 2:24:59.220]  Dr. Corsi knew him 45 years ago when I was even born, I'm 43, look like I'm 50.
[2:24:59.220 --> 2:25:02.060]  And Trump was awake back then, he's just been playing possum.
[2:25:02.060 --> 2:25:05.900]  How many other Patriot sleeper cells are there?
[2:25:05.900 --> 2:25:11.620]  It's an amazing time to be alive ladies and gentlemen.
[2:25:11.620 --> 2:25:14.540]  And I guess I told Steele earlier that he was going to leave at 20 after but he had
[2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:17.540]  said he could stay on longer so I guess we didn't relay that message, let's try to get
[2:25:17.540 --> 2:25:19.100]  him back on, if not it's fine.
[2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:22.700]  They always great having him on though, because I was relaying we're going to hold him longer
[2:25:22.700 --> 2:25:23.700]  and he said he could.
[2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:26.140]  Justin in Alabama, you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:25:26.140 --> 2:25:27.140]  Yes sir.
[2:25:27.140 --> 2:25:30.980]  You're making the point about China, go ahead.
[2:25:30.980 --> 2:25:36.260]  Yeah, I was just mentioning about China, it's connected to Hillary Clinton and based off
[2:25:36.260 --> 2:25:42.060]  of what Hagman was reporting that the indictments are going to be following fast, would that
[2:25:42.060 --> 2:25:45.500]  not connect her and help him out in that regard?
[2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:50.260]  And also with North Korea, it seems like that's what everybody wants to talk about and those
[2:25:50.260 --> 2:25:51.260]  two seem to be.
[2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:54.660]  No, no I agree, we should change the subject of Russia on to China and again I don't want
[2:25:54.660 --> 2:25:58.700]  to sit here and bash China and the Chinese people, they're great people, they have a
[2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:04.180]  horrible regime and a bunch of corrupt generals, total crony capitalism living off of them
[2:26:04.180 --> 2:26:08.420]  and I'd love to see China reformed, I'd love to work with China but right now they're very
[2:26:08.420 --> 2:26:14.300]  aggressive, they're penetrating everything, I mean it's just incredible, Robert David
[2:26:14.300 --> 2:26:18.340]  Steele, what do you think about China and its influence?
[2:26:18.340 --> 2:26:24.060]  The bottom line is the American era is over and the Chinese era has begun and people need
[2:26:24.060 --> 2:26:26.060]  to get a grip on that.
[2:26:26.060 --> 2:26:33.140]  The problem is that the Americans represent the worst form of predatory capitalism, unilateral
[2:26:33.140 --> 2:26:39.740]  militarism and virtual colonialism, I mean I stand with Martin Luther King who was assassinated
[2:26:39.740 --> 2:26:44.660]  because he said the United States was the worst purveyor of violence on the planet.
[2:26:44.660 --> 2:26:49.220]  China is beating the United States, I recommend to all of your listeners a book by my friend
[2:26:49.220 --> 2:26:53.140]  De Parag Khanna called Connectography.
[2:26:53.140 --> 2:26:59.500]  Instead of spending on its military, China is building roads and ports and basically
[2:26:59.500 --> 2:27:01.820]  bribing a lot of foreign officials.
[2:27:01.820 --> 2:27:07.780]  Sure so they've done the soft power takeover, 98% of Earth minerals, how in the world could
[2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:13.100]  the United States go in the last 30 years from controlling Earth minerals to giving
[2:27:13.100 --> 2:27:15.900]  that strategic system to them.
[2:27:15.900 --> 2:27:21.100]  A lack of integrity in our government, I am a professional intelligence officer, I want
[2:27:21.100 --> 2:27:27.060]  Donald Trump to have a grand strategy that understands the 10 high level threats to humanity,
[2:27:27.060 --> 2:27:32.100]  the first three are poverty, infections, disease and environmental degradation and I want him
[2:27:32.100 --> 2:27:36.180]  to be able to manage all policies and true cost economics.
[2:27:36.180 --> 2:27:41.340]  We need a balanced budget, we need to actually focus on the prosperity of the individual
[2:27:41.340 --> 2:27:42.340]  average of marriage.
[2:27:42.340 --> 2:27:45.340]  Absolutely, turning loose the power of the people, he says he's doing it, he's made
[2:27:45.340 --> 2:27:48.900]  the first steps, the elites are already so upset, how far will they let him go, we'll
[2:27:48.900 --> 2:27:53.420]  talk about it coming up, Frank, Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air with Robert David
[2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:54.420]  Steele.
[2:27:54.420 --> 2:28:01.580]  Yeah Alex, I respect you for taking my call, I consider myself to be an amateur intelligence
[2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:06.780]  officer, I'm a former O311 team leader, 9-11 truth or truth seeker, truth teller, the
[2:28:06.780 --> 2:28:13.340]  best I know how and I am an admirer of Cynthia McKinney and I recently heard Dr. Steve Pshenick
[2:28:13.340 --> 2:28:18.020]  state something on your show that you are a master of mixing back with fiction and also
[2:28:18.020 --> 2:28:23.580]  of the PsiOp and I just wanted to say that I really agree with that with his characterization
[2:28:23.580 --> 2:28:29.380]  and you expend a lot of time and energy deflecting attention away from ground zero of the New
[2:28:29.380 --> 2:28:31.740]  World Order which is organized jury.
[2:28:31.740 --> 2:28:38.540]  Well sir, you know, one big part of that is I'm constantly being accused of getting my
[2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:43.100]  orders from Israel, okay, and that if somebody falls on a banana peel, Jews did it.
[2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:47.380]  Do I like some of the things some of the interests in Israel have done, I mean there's a bunch
[2:28:47.380 --> 2:28:51.540]  of different camps in Israel, they're constantly trying to overthrow each other, just like
[2:28:51.540 --> 2:28:55.940]  I criticize Communist China but I said I'm not against the Chinese people, it's not
[2:28:55.940 --> 2:29:03.900]  out of some control, I haven't had Jews involved in anything I've done, I've had liberal
[2:29:03.900 --> 2:29:09.060]  Jews call me anti-Semitic and make up crap and I've not sunk to their race-baiting level
[2:29:09.060 --> 2:29:13.060]  because I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm not against Arabs, I'm not against Jews, I'm not against
[2:29:13.060 --> 2:29:16.580]  anybody but I'm going to go to break, I'm going to let you come back, Robert I know
[2:29:16.580 --> 2:29:21.220]  this is a short segment but I'll keep you the end, sorry Robert, 20 seconds I'm going
[2:29:21.220 --> 2:29:22.780]  to come back to the caller after that, go ahead.
[2:29:22.780 --> 2:29:29.140]  Okay, there are four levels of Zionists and most Jews are not the problem, it's the Rothschilds
[2:29:29.140 --> 2:29:33.460]  and the Zionists at the top of Israel, it's not Israel and it's not Jews that are the
[2:29:33.460 --> 2:29:34.460]  problem.
[2:29:34.460 --> 2:29:36.340]  Sure, I'm going to come back to Frank, don't give him a couple of minutes on this because
[2:29:36.340 --> 2:29:42.740]  it just gives me a headache, I mean it really does, I mean I work for the Vatican, I work
[2:29:42.740 --> 2:29:47.140]  for the CIA, I work for the Jews, you know how about I did some things myself in my life,
[2:29:47.140 --> 2:29:48.820]  you know?
[2:29:48.820 --> 2:30:00.100]  Here on the March, The Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.100 --> 2:30:03.860]  The tide is turning and the witch hunt aimed at President Donald Trump.
[2:30:03.860 --> 2:30:07.860]  After being right about rigged elections, fake news and the travel ban, the unrelenting
[2:30:07.860 --> 2:30:12.340]  persecution of our president is actually starting to yield some fruit for the drain the swamp
[2:30:12.340 --> 2:30:13.340]  movement.
[2:30:13.340 --> 2:30:17.020]  After Trump trolled James Comey into admitting he leaked and Loretta Lynch intervened in
[2:30:17.020 --> 2:30:20.980]  the Clinton email probe, the investigations are now aimed at the Democrats.
[2:30:20.980 --> 2:30:25.540]  John Podesta had a secret hearing on Tuesday, Loretta Lynch will soon be called to a hearing,
[2:30:25.540 --> 2:30:29.260]  Susan Rice will have to answer for unmasking and Bernie Sanders and his wife are being
[2:30:29.260 --> 2:30:31.380]  investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[2:30:31.380 --> 2:30:37.020]  And now Republican senators want answers on the FBI Russia probe in regards to surveillance.
[2:30:37.020 --> 2:30:40.740]  Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham are leading the way in searching for answers
[2:30:40.740 --> 2:30:45.620]  on the procedures taken and by whom to issue surveillance requests because of the Russian
[2:30:45.620 --> 2:30:46.620]  probe.
[2:30:46.620 --> 2:31:03.740]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[2:31:03.740 --> 2:31:06.620]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[2:31:06.620 --> 2:31:12.660]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[2:31:12.660 --> 2:31:17.620]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[2:31:17.620 --> 2:31:22.540]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[2:31:22.540 --> 2:31:27.700]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[2:31:27.700 --> 2:31:29.420]  you can to purify your air.
[2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:34.420]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[2:31:34.420 --> 2:31:39.620]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[2:31:39.620 --> 2:31:43.580]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:31:43.580 --> 2:31:47.180]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:31:47.180 --> 2:31:50.740]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[2:31:50.740 --> 2:31:53.940]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:53.940 --> 2:32:00.060]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[2:32:00.060 --> 2:32:04.460]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:32:04.460 --> 2:32:09.180]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:32:09.180 --> 2:32:10.700]  to detoxify the body.
[2:32:10.700 --> 2:32:15.580]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:32:15.580 --> 2:32:17.100]  It's made in the USA.
[2:32:17.100 --> 2:32:22.020]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[2:32:22.020 --> 2:32:23.860]  the body and it supports the infomer.
[2:32:23.860 --> 2:32:26.100]  It is a classical 360 win.
[2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:30.580]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[2:32:30.580 --> 2:32:35.260]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[2:32:35.260 --> 2:32:36.260]  get.
[2:32:36.260 --> 2:32:39.500]  You owe it to your health, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[2:32:39.500 --> 2:32:44.540]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[2:32:44.540 --> 2:32:49.780]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[2:32:49.780 --> 2:32:52.420]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:32:52.420 --> 2:32:55.780]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:32:55.780 --> 2:33:22.180]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfowarsLive.com.
[2:33:22.180 --> 2:33:27.420]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:27.420 --> 2:33:34.740]  You know what I found is there's an infighting bug where you're a liberal, conservative,
[2:33:34.740 --> 2:33:40.500]  Christian, Jewish, agnostic, libertarian where everybody wants to be this purist that then
[2:33:40.500 --> 2:33:45.140]  grades and reviews everybody else.
[2:33:45.140 --> 2:33:48.540]  And it's one of the favorite tactics and I don't screen your calls, I mean I'm happy
[2:33:48.540 --> 2:33:56.500]  to take this call where people call in and they say you're covering up for the Jews and
[2:33:56.500 --> 2:33:57.500]  all this stuff.
[2:33:57.500 --> 2:34:03.300]  Meanwhile, I have the left calling me deeply racist, unalloyed racist, Tom Bro call you
[2:34:03.300 --> 2:34:06.060]  name it, taken out of the crypt to come out and say it.
[2:34:06.060 --> 2:34:11.660]  And I've got the forward and the Jerusalem post saying Alex Jones thinks Jews are evil
[2:34:11.660 --> 2:34:16.100]  you know and Alex Jones thinks blah, blah, blah, you know all this horrible.
[2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:21.380]  So it's just crazy the paradigm where I have like almost, I'm not saying you're this Frank,
[2:34:21.380 --> 2:34:27.500]  but the Nazi groups, the KKK, I mean they hate me more than BB, not Nyahu.
[2:34:27.500 --> 2:34:34.420]  And it's because most of the Nazi movements and things have been run by the FBI and by
[2:34:34.420 --> 2:34:35.420]  big foundations.
[2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:36.780]  They've been caught over and over again.
[2:34:36.780 --> 2:34:40.900]  And so they want to create an internal fight in a nationalist movement to a brand the
[2:34:40.900 --> 2:34:45.640]  nationalist movement as a race based system and then anyone that tries to bring everybody
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:50.140]  in under free market open systems is then branded as a race trader.
[2:34:50.140 --> 2:34:53.260]  So it's attacked from without and within.
[2:34:53.260 --> 2:35:00.940]  And then people want to feel good like they can call in and they can say to the Alex Jones,
[2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:02.340]  you're not pure, you're a fake.
[2:35:02.340 --> 2:35:06.900]  I agree with Steve Pacenek and he says, who says you mix truth with fiction.
[2:35:06.900 --> 2:35:08.300]  That's not what Pacenek said.
[2:35:08.300 --> 2:35:13.300]  He said I can come in with narrative and archetype and things and story tell and then bring in
[2:35:13.300 --> 2:35:19.260]  the news, parables, examples, parallels.
[2:35:19.260 --> 2:35:22.020]  All I've got is my integrity.
[2:35:22.020 --> 2:35:27.940]  And I had the most open show of different diverse ideas and I'm not here even defending
[2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:28.940]  myself.
[2:35:28.940 --> 2:35:29.940]  I care about Frank.
[2:35:29.940 --> 2:35:33.180]  Frank's been calling in, you know, off and on for like 10 years.
[2:35:33.180 --> 2:35:36.580]  If I remember his voice right, I have a good memory and it's basically always the same
[2:35:36.580 --> 2:35:37.580]  deal.
[2:35:37.580 --> 2:35:40.740]  Dude, all you got to do is you want to get on the air and say stuff about Israel or whatever
[2:35:40.740 --> 2:35:41.740]  it is.
[2:35:41.740 --> 2:35:42.740]  You're going to be able to say it.
[2:35:42.740 --> 2:35:47.980]  You're going to be able to change your call and just say that it's like, it has to be
[2:35:47.980 --> 2:35:52.020]  like, but oh, let's add Alex Jones in because he's covering it up.
[2:35:52.020 --> 2:35:53.660]  I was covering it up, bro.
[2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:57.700]  I snap my fingers and have him sit there and interrogate people and hang up on folks and
[2:35:57.700 --> 2:35:58.700]  or it could plug in.
[2:35:58.700 --> 2:36:02.860]  We got digital phone systems, caller ID, we don't even do that and I can have your numbers
[2:36:02.860 --> 2:36:04.700]  in there and no, that's what other talk radio does.
[2:36:04.700 --> 2:36:07.100]  That's why they talk to you three, four minutes for you to get on air.
[2:36:07.100 --> 2:36:08.860]  We're not screening your calls.
[2:36:08.860 --> 2:36:10.980]  What is it about that integrity?
[2:36:10.980 --> 2:36:12.980]  You don't understand.
[2:36:12.980 --> 2:36:13.980]  Okay.
[2:36:13.980 --> 2:36:16.820]  See, if you want to say something in Israeli, that's, I mean, I think I even heard you when
[2:36:16.820 --> 2:36:21.940]  I was off last week calling and or somebody sounded like you and like, Jones didn't cover
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:22.940]  the USS Liberty.
[2:36:22.940 --> 2:36:24.660]  I made a film about it.
[2:36:24.660 --> 2:36:27.100]  I had the captain on before he died.
[2:36:27.100 --> 2:36:29.140]  I had the chairman of the joint chiefs on.
[2:36:29.140 --> 2:36:31.940]  I had the head of the judge advocate general on.
[2:36:31.940 --> 2:36:34.460]  I've done probably a hundred shows on it.
[2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:36.780]  I'm dealing with World War three with the Russians right now.
[2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:39.780]  But again, it's just this little power trip and it's not that you hurt me.
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:46.940]  You hurt yourself as a man to try to count coup on somebody and to say things about somebody
[2:36:46.940 --> 2:36:47.940]  that didn't do it.
[2:36:47.940 --> 2:36:50.980]  In fact, it got the white supremacists and people.
[2:36:50.980 --> 2:36:56.660]  I mean, we're talking about panties in a log when I made fabled enemies showing how Israel,
[2:36:56.660 --> 2:36:59.700]  the US and other governments were actually funding radical Islam and staging terror
[2:36:59.700 --> 2:37:00.980]  attacks from the documents.
[2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:04.980]  I mean, they thought, they thought it was the end of the world and that's because the
[2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:11.020]  ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center handlers, like we know, ran Elohim City, are pissed.
[2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:14.420]  So the real intelligence operatives, like, like, like people go, oh, Alex was working
[2:37:14.420 --> 2:37:15.420]  with the CIA.
[2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:16.420]  I am so proud.
[2:37:16.420 --> 2:37:19.180]  I did this myself and with my listeners who get the credit.
[2:37:19.180 --> 2:37:21.460]  I am so proud that I'm organic.
[2:37:21.460 --> 2:37:24.460]  I am so proud that I'm not associated with any of this.
[2:37:24.460 --> 2:37:26.340]  Can I pick the phone up and call current former CIA?
[2:37:26.340 --> 2:37:27.980]  Can I pick the phone up and call senators?
[2:37:27.980 --> 2:37:28.980]  Can I pick the phone up?
[2:37:28.980 --> 2:37:31.580]  I will need to get a call the president.
[2:37:31.580 --> 2:37:33.260]  You bet I can.
[2:37:33.260 --> 2:37:35.980]  But the point is, is that I'm who I am, Frank.
[2:37:35.980 --> 2:37:40.700]  Now, I don't want to piss on our other callers and not get to our guests who's holding Robert
[2:37:40.700 --> 2:37:43.660]  David Steele here, who will have his own comment on this in a moment.
[2:37:43.660 --> 2:37:46.380]  But again, we're not like mainstream media where something happens.
[2:37:46.380 --> 2:37:48.540]  We got away today to see what the corporate line is.
[2:37:48.540 --> 2:37:49.620]  It's instant.
[2:37:49.620 --> 2:37:50.620]  It's instant here.
[2:37:50.620 --> 2:37:52.420]  So you're really talking to me, Frank.
[2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:53.420]  I'm real.
[2:37:53.420 --> 2:37:55.140]  I believe what I say.
[2:37:55.140 --> 2:37:56.860]  I don't work for the Jews.
[2:37:56.860 --> 2:37:58.260]  Okay, go ahead.
[2:37:58.260 --> 2:38:04.380]  So, Alex, I'm very sympathetic because you've been prominent for much longer than I have.
[2:38:04.380 --> 2:38:09.620]  And it's only now that I'm starting to get my stalkers and people who misunderstand me
[2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:11.780]  and attack me and so forth.
[2:38:11.780 --> 2:38:14.780]  So what you're paying for is the price of fame.
[2:38:14.780 --> 2:38:18.340]  I'm going to give you the floor on this subject, and you talk about different types of Zionism
[2:38:18.340 --> 2:38:19.340]  in a minute.
[2:38:19.340 --> 2:38:23.540]  There's Christian Zionism, Social Zionism, Communist Zionism, Political Zionism, Metaphizism.
[2:38:23.540 --> 2:38:27.140]  We'll talk about it briefly, but I want to give Frank a minute, because I've got to
[2:38:27.140 --> 2:38:28.620]  run at him for five minutes.
[2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:29.620]  Go ahead, Frank.
[2:38:29.620 --> 2:38:31.900]  Let me have it.
[2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:33.220]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:36.060]  And like you always say, justice be done, let the heavens fall.
[2:38:36.060 --> 2:38:37.060]  I agree.
[2:38:37.060 --> 2:38:39.060]  There is a hierarchy.
[2:38:39.060 --> 2:38:45.820]  From my investigation, from my heart, it all seems to be subservient to organized Jewry.
[2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:49.180]  You look, I mean, the Jewish people are the most organized people in the world.
[2:38:49.180 --> 2:38:51.380]  You look, I mean, I'm not even talking about Israel.
[2:38:51.380 --> 2:38:57.020]  Just look at the organizations of Israel and the money they're able to raise here in America.
[2:38:57.020 --> 2:39:00.300]  I mean, and their control that they exercise over the media.
[2:39:00.300 --> 2:39:03.380]  I mean, I used to fight these guys that you call Nazis.
[2:39:03.380 --> 2:39:04.780]  I used to defend you.
[2:39:04.780 --> 2:39:10.420]  I used to write like five page long blogs defending you on social media 10, 11 years
[2:39:10.420 --> 2:39:11.420]  ago.
[2:39:11.420 --> 2:39:15.180]  Sir, I don't think you need to defend straw men that they've created.
[2:39:15.180 --> 2:39:17.380]  You don't need to do that.
[2:39:17.380 --> 2:39:21.940]  And what I'm telling you is they also give mythical powers to Jews and then say everyone's
[2:39:21.940 --> 2:39:24.900]  really Jewish who isn't or Jews funded this, Jews funded that.
[2:39:24.900 --> 2:39:26.500]  Do you understand that?
[2:39:26.500 --> 2:39:31.620]  It's fundamentally insulting to think that info wars was secretly financed by Jews.
[2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:33.060]  Okay, I'm sick of it.
[2:39:33.060 --> 2:39:36.420]  I want to promote ideology of freedom, not infighting.
[2:39:36.420 --> 2:39:38.980]  And then we're going to get Jews, everybody else to join it.
[2:39:38.980 --> 2:39:39.980]  I believe in that.
[2:39:39.980 --> 2:39:46.060]  I believe my ideas, your ideas, good ideas are going to trump whatever mafia crap there
[2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:47.060]  is.
[2:39:47.060 --> 2:39:48.060]  Is there a Jewish mafia?
[2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:49.060]  Absolutely.
[2:39:49.060 --> 2:39:50.060]  Do they demonize me for exposing it?
[2:39:50.060 --> 2:39:51.060]  Absolutely.
[2:39:51.060 --> 2:39:52.740]  When you expose Jewish mafia, do they call you anti-Semitic?
[2:39:52.740 --> 2:39:53.740]  Absolutely.
[2:39:53.740 --> 2:39:55.180]  No, there's, there's mafias in every group.
[2:39:55.180 --> 2:39:59.260]  The Russian mob's big, the Jew mob's big, the Italian mob's big.
[2:39:59.260 --> 2:40:01.860]  The Wasp mob is so big, they don't even call it a mob.
[2:40:01.860 --> 2:40:04.340]  The point is, and then they misrepresent what I say.
[2:40:04.340 --> 2:40:10.900]  How do you square the leftist press and the forward and all the rest of it saying I'm
[2:40:10.900 --> 2:40:14.260]  basically Adolf Hitler and then all the Nazis hate me more than anybody?
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:15.740]  How do you square that up?
[2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:21.900]  Well, I checked the names of all the people that you talked about for the past 11 years
[2:40:21.900 --> 2:40:26.740]  that are agents of the New World Order, whatever you want to call it, the elites of globalist.
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:29.140]  Almost all of them are Jewish, so that begs the question.
[2:40:29.140 --> 2:40:32.300]  You know, I didn't know anything about Jewish power.
[2:40:32.300 --> 2:40:33.580]  I looked it up on the internet.
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:37.180]  I said, well, what percentage of the population did Jews make up when I found out that they'd
[2:40:37.180 --> 2:40:41.300]  never made up more than one or two percent of the population of the United States?
[2:40:41.300 --> 2:40:42.820]  But I checked the bios.
[2:40:42.820 --> 2:40:45.500]  I ended up calling it a bio check.
[2:40:45.500 --> 2:40:46.860]  They're almost all Jews.
[2:40:46.860 --> 2:40:51.020]  Everybody you talk about on your show for the past 11 years, almost all of them are
[2:40:51.020 --> 2:40:52.020]  Jewish.
[2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:53.020]  How is that irrelevant?
[2:40:53.020 --> 2:40:57.780]  But see, nobody then goes, oh, look at Matt Dredge fighting the globalist.
[2:40:57.780 --> 2:41:01.460]  He's Jewish or, you know, look at people in Trump's family that are involved supporting
[2:41:01.460 --> 2:41:02.660]  fighting the globalist.
[2:41:02.660 --> 2:41:04.220]  It's way more complex than that.
[2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:05.220]  But listen, you've had your time.
[2:41:05.220 --> 2:41:09.220]  I can get to other callers and then I'll get callers saying the Vatican runs it all.
[2:41:09.220 --> 2:41:13.820]  Or they'll say I'm anti-Catholic because I'm exposing pedophile rings that took it over.
[2:41:13.820 --> 2:41:16.980]  I'm not anti-Catholic either.
[2:41:16.980 --> 2:41:17.980]  Just like masons.
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:18.980]  I'm not anti-Mason.
[2:41:18.980 --> 2:41:22.860]  They can use any big organization or group for power groups to form in.
[2:41:22.860 --> 2:41:25.660]  Robert David Steele, I mean, what is your view on this?
[2:41:25.660 --> 2:41:26.660]  Unfiltered.
[2:41:26.660 --> 2:41:28.500]  We don't pre-interview you like everybody else tries to do.
[2:41:28.500 --> 2:41:32.300]  I mean, we don't sense, if I ever told you what to talk about or what to do, I know you've
[2:41:32.300 --> 2:41:34.980]  been critical of Israel.
[2:41:34.980 --> 2:41:40.500]  My bottom line is if you're being attacked, you're being effective, period.
[2:41:40.500 --> 2:41:45.820]  But how do you square the paradox of I'm like number one enemy of the Nazis and white supremacists?
[2:41:45.820 --> 2:41:50.620]  It's literally, and then the liberal Jewish groups say I'm this Nazi.
[2:41:50.620 --> 2:41:53.100]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:41:53.100 --> 2:41:57.100]  The reason Cynthia McKinney and I joined together is because I'm all to right and she's all
[2:41:57.100 --> 2:41:58.100]  left.
[2:41:58.100 --> 2:42:02.580]  We're actually trying to talk to the bikers about having a biker escort for our...
[2:42:02.580 --> 2:42:06.820]  No, no, you're all about solutions, but how do you square up what I'm talking about?
[2:42:06.820 --> 2:42:09.660]  You have to be true to yourself and keep doing it, period.
[2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:13.940]  You cannot let all these nitpickers get you off course.
[2:42:13.940 --> 2:42:18.420]  And one of the things that I'm finding is right now, I'm under a massive slanderous attack
[2:42:18.420 --> 2:42:21.140]  from a guy with zero integrity.
[2:42:21.140 --> 2:42:25.020]  No, I agree, but you just got to move forward and ignore it all because that's what these
[2:42:25.020 --> 2:42:26.020]  psychic vampire...
[2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:28.540]  I'm not saying the last guy was a psychic vampire, but some of these people, that's
[2:42:28.540 --> 2:42:29.540]  what they do.
[2:42:29.540 --> 2:42:32.580]  And it's important we talk about this in fighting because people, my crew comes to me and says,
[2:42:32.580 --> 2:42:33.580]  hey, these people are fighting each other.
[2:42:33.580 --> 2:42:35.340]  I think it helps to acknowledge the attack.
[2:42:35.340 --> 2:42:40.100]  I think it helps to acknowledge the attack and to do one gracious response.
[2:42:40.100 --> 2:42:44.500]  And in the event the attack is violating the law, as this guy is with me, and I got to give
[2:42:44.500 --> 2:42:49.260]  Google high marks, they forced him to take down videos in which he was slandering me.
[2:42:49.260 --> 2:42:55.820]  So as much as I don't like the way Google has attacked you, and I hope that's all settled,
[2:42:55.820 --> 2:42:56.820]  as much as...
[2:42:56.820 --> 2:43:01.460]  Well, it wasn't even Google we've now learned, it was a contractor company that actually hooked
[2:43:01.460 --> 2:43:02.460]  him with Facebook.
[2:43:02.460 --> 2:43:06.820]  Well, I'm glad to hear that because I think Google has a lot of power to do good, but
[2:43:06.820 --> 2:43:10.580]  I don't like the way they've manipulated searches in favor of Hillary Clinton against
[2:43:10.580 --> 2:43:11.580]  Donald Trump.
[2:43:11.580 --> 2:43:17.180]  But having said that, Google, I will say now publicly, Google did well by me in the last
[2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:23.940]  48 hours in ensuring that videos that slandered me that were illegal and obviously legally
[2:43:23.940 --> 2:43:25.660]  actionable were taken down.
[2:43:25.660 --> 2:43:29.380]  So God bless Google, God bless Donald Trump, God bless Alex Jones.
[2:43:29.380 --> 2:43:33.700]  Alex, this next 90 days could be the second American Revolution and you could be one of
[2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:34.700]  the leaders.
[2:43:34.700 --> 2:43:36.900]  I'm going to have you back, I know you're all hyped up about this and it's great, you
[2:43:36.900 --> 2:43:39.580]  know, your old hashtag deal, then that's wonderful, but the one I'm getting back to
[2:43:39.580 --> 2:43:40.580]  is...
[2:43:40.580 --> 2:43:41.580]  Or it could be World War III.
[2:43:41.580 --> 2:43:42.580]  What are you making?
[2:43:42.580 --> 2:43:47.140]  We're going to call of the brinksmanship of our ambassador to the UN signaling, any other
[2:43:47.140 --> 2:43:51.580]  problems in Syria, we're going to blame Russia and attack your forces, and Russia says,
[2:43:51.580 --> 2:43:52.940]  okay, we're ready to go to war.
[2:43:52.940 --> 2:43:55.060]  That is bad.
[2:43:55.060 --> 2:43:57.780]  Nikki Haley is a bimbo.
[2:43:57.780 --> 2:43:59.900]  She is being badly briefed.
[2:43:59.900 --> 2:44:03.860]  I mean, she's a nice lady, I'd love to have her have a decent intelligence briefing, but
[2:44:03.860 --> 2:44:05.460]  she's clearly not getting it.
[2:44:05.460 --> 2:44:08.780]  Well, let's briefly talk about how this, because you're an expert in the Middle East, you started
[2:44:08.780 --> 2:44:09.780]  for many years.
[2:44:09.780 --> 2:44:13.340]  I mean, clearly, you blow up some more Russian aircraft, they go ahead and shoot down your
[2:44:13.340 --> 2:44:18.460]  aircraft, then heavier weapons get used, then boom, a tactical nuke gets used, and then
[2:44:18.460 --> 2:44:21.500]  the ICBMs get launched, the subs launch, and we're all dead.
[2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:27.580]  There is no congressional authorization for war with Russia, nor will there ever be.
[2:44:27.580 --> 2:44:31.500]  We have 11 presidential wars now, most of them started under Obama.
[2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:35.820]  Donald Trump should be closing all of our military bases overseas, and bringing our
[2:44:35.820 --> 2:44:37.580]  military home.
[2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:43.340]  Problem that Donald Trump has is he doesn't have the political base to show a pair of
[2:44:43.340 --> 2:44:46.180]  balls in dealing with the deep state.
[2:44:46.180 --> 2:44:51.660]  So I want Donald Trump to leave Washington and grow a pair of balls that is backed up
[2:44:51.660 --> 2:44:53.660]  by 60 to 70 percent.
[2:44:53.660 --> 2:44:57.940]  Wait a minute, I think he's probably grown King Kong size, but I mean, I get what you're
[2:44:57.940 --> 2:44:58.940]  saying.
[2:44:58.940 --> 2:44:59.940]  Talbe, do you know this personally?
[2:44:59.940 --> 2:45:03.180]  No, I mean, his action is what I'm saying.
[2:45:03.180 --> 2:45:04.180]  Hey, hey.
[2:45:04.180 --> 2:45:07.220]  Donald Trump is not standing up to the deep state.
[2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:08.500]  He is being chomped.
[2:45:08.500 --> 2:45:11.140]  I want him to stand up to the deep state.
[2:45:11.140 --> 2:45:12.140]  I want Donald Trump.
[2:45:12.140 --> 2:45:15.740]  Why do you think the Democrats are suddenly running scared on their Russia fable?
[2:45:15.740 --> 2:45:17.620]  Well, so are the Republicans.
[2:45:17.620 --> 2:45:21.700]  The Republicans want a war with Russia just as much as the Democrats do.
[2:45:21.700 --> 2:45:25.980]  No, no, I know that, but I mean, clearly, Trump is winning more and more of his agenda
[2:45:25.980 --> 2:45:26.980]  points.
[2:45:26.980 --> 2:45:27.980]  Let's go to another phone call.
[2:45:27.980 --> 2:45:28.980]  Everybody's been holding patiently.
[2:45:28.980 --> 2:45:34.140]  This guy's going off down the route of the stupid Israel stuff all day.
[2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:36.340]  Gosh, I'm so sick of it.
[2:45:36.340 --> 2:45:37.340]  Let's go ahead and go.
[2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:38.340]  I just want everybody to be free.
[2:45:38.340 --> 2:45:41.900]  Everybody to have a great future, free market, advanced technologies.
[2:45:41.900 --> 2:45:45.820]  I just want to be all about ideas, not what religion or what color you are.
[2:45:45.820 --> 2:45:49.180]  The reason I'm so anti-Islam is it's been totally radicalized.
[2:45:49.180 --> 2:45:51.700]  It's been green lighted by the left and it's not tolerant.
[2:45:51.700 --> 2:45:54.420]  Can I say something real quick?
[2:45:54.420 --> 2:45:55.420]  Yeah.
[2:45:55.420 --> 2:45:56.420]  World War Three.
[2:45:56.420 --> 2:45:58.460]  It's one of my Trump Revolution series.
[2:45:58.460 --> 2:46:00.620]  World War Three has started.
[2:46:00.620 --> 2:46:04.980]  It is between the 1% and the 99%.
[2:46:04.980 --> 2:46:07.140]  Everything else is disinformation.
[2:46:07.140 --> 2:46:08.140]  I agree.
[2:46:08.140 --> 2:46:09.140]  Except I've done the math.
[2:46:09.140 --> 2:46:14.420]  If you look at how less than one-tenth of 1% has half the wealth of the 1% has like 75-80%.
[2:46:14.420 --> 2:46:15.420]  We did the math before.
[2:46:15.420 --> 2:46:19.860]  It was like.0000040042 or something.
[2:46:19.860 --> 2:46:24.620]  I mean, you're in the 1% if you're making $300,000 a year.
[2:46:24.620 --> 2:46:28.420]  That's a good middle-class person with jobs and getting their nails done and buying cars.
[2:46:28.420 --> 2:46:29.420]  That's not the ultra-rich.
[2:46:29.420 --> 2:46:33.700]  I mean, it needs to be like the one-tenth of one-millionth or whatever it is.
[2:46:33.700 --> 2:46:38.860]  Look, what we have going for us, Alex, is that the only thing that can overcome organized
[2:46:38.860 --> 2:46:42.060]  money is organized people on the street.
[2:46:42.060 --> 2:46:46.820]  Not only can the public take back the power in August by basically confronting every member
[2:46:46.820 --> 2:46:49.820]  of Congress, all 535 of them.
[2:46:49.820 --> 2:46:51.780]  We can take back the power.
[2:46:51.780 --> 2:46:53.380]  We can restore state rights.
[2:46:53.380 --> 2:46:55.620]  We can end federal ownership of most land.
[2:46:55.620 --> 2:47:00.580]  No, I agree, and Trump should get behind that, and I agree with Robert David Steele that
[2:47:00.580 --> 2:47:04.140]  the Soros is funding folks to go harass members of Congress when they're back in their districts.
[2:47:04.140 --> 2:47:08.020]  We need to be at all those events and city councils and using every bully pulpit to promote
[2:47:08.020 --> 2:47:09.020]  Americana.
[2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:10.020]  God bless you.
[2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:12.740]  Okay, so let's go to Jason in Connecticut holding like a real trooper.
[2:47:12.740 --> 2:47:14.740]  Jason, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:17.580]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[2:47:17.580 --> 2:47:20.660]  So I probably don't have much time for me to get right into this.
[2:47:20.660 --> 2:47:24.220]  I think to win the war, we must kill their God.
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:30.780]  And to answer your question on why and where all this pedophilia, all this stuff is coming
[2:47:30.780 --> 2:47:36.140]  from, we know that their God now is Baphomet, 100 percent, you know, goes back to the Knights
[2:47:36.140 --> 2:47:37.140]  Templar.
[2:47:37.140 --> 2:47:43.860]  It goes even connects to Islam because Muhammad is another word for Baphomet, and I believe
[2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:46.540]  you should really have Tracy Twyman on.
[2:47:46.540 --> 2:47:47.540]  She wrote a book.
[2:47:47.540 --> 2:47:52.660]  It came out late last year called Baphomet, The Temple Mystery Unveiled, and she just
[2:47:52.660 --> 2:47:56.540]  came out with another novel that reads like a Dan Brown novel.
[2:47:56.540 --> 2:47:59.500]  It gives the reader an insight into the God's origins.
[2:47:59.500 --> 2:48:04.100]  You know, Prince Charles is a character, Prince Philip is a character.
[2:48:04.100 --> 2:48:07.500]  It shows how these rituals are done historically based on archeological...
[2:48:07.500 --> 2:48:08.500]  Well, that's right.
[2:48:08.500 --> 2:48:09.980]  I mean, there's archeological.
[2:48:09.980 --> 2:48:11.400]  It's at the Smithsonian.
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:15.940]  We got into the big archives, the Getty Archives a few months ago in Los Angeles.
[2:48:15.940 --> 2:48:20.220]  And we talked about torturing the kids to then get adrenaline in their blood, then drinking
[2:48:20.220 --> 2:48:21.460]  it fresh.
[2:48:21.460 --> 2:48:24.500]  It's all in mainline museums.
[2:48:24.500 --> 2:48:26.180]  They just don't show the public.
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:29.140]  So Millie Weaver and Gavin got that info.
[2:48:29.140 --> 2:48:30.140]  Thank you, Jason.
[2:48:30.140 --> 2:48:31.140]  Yeah.
[2:48:31.140 --> 2:48:34.100]  What about Satanism or Luciferianism as an operating system?
[2:48:34.100 --> 2:48:40.380]  Well, if you're asking me, I think it's part of the glue that keeps the state together.
[2:48:40.380 --> 2:48:46.740]  I mean, one of the things people don't realize is that the Catholic church is actually a controlled
[2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:48.300]  religion.
[2:48:48.300 --> 2:48:51.540]  It's a religion that's intended to take control away from the states.
[2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:56.060]  I don't believe that the Pope and the Vatican should have diplomatic recognition.
[2:48:56.060 --> 2:48:58.060]  I agree, but let's expand on that.
[2:48:58.060 --> 2:49:02.380]  This Pope has finally gotten Catholics to wake up where they're promoting open borders,
[2:49:02.380 --> 2:49:06.380]  global government, the end of families saying, get rid of the Europe's Christian roots.
[2:49:06.380 --> 2:49:07.380]  These are quotes.
[2:49:07.380 --> 2:49:09.300]  I mean, this Pope is outrageous.
[2:49:09.300 --> 2:49:12.380]  It's like the Cardinals elected Anton Leves.
[2:49:12.380 --> 2:49:19.100]  Well, you know, the United Nations and the Catholic Church are essentially globalist tools.
[2:49:19.100 --> 2:49:24.780]  And I'm publishing a new paper in the Trump Revolution series on taking down the deep
[2:49:24.780 --> 2:49:25.780]  state.
[2:49:25.780 --> 2:49:30.620]  And I discussed the United Nations, the Catholic Church, particularly the Jesuits, who violate
[2:49:30.620 --> 2:49:31.620]  the confessional.
[2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:33.620]  They're using the confessional as an example.
[2:49:33.620 --> 2:49:34.620]  Well, sure.
[2:49:34.620 --> 2:49:37.980]  I mean, the Jesuits aren't supposed to even be involved as Cardinals, much less a Pope.
[2:49:37.980 --> 2:49:42.740]  It was a separate army, as you know, created by loyal, and it's completely out of control.
[2:49:42.740 --> 2:49:47.820]  Well, the Jesuits also have 200 years worth of managing the Vatican's finances.
[2:49:47.820 --> 2:49:50.380]  They control the gold and the land.
[2:49:50.380 --> 2:49:54.460]  And I don't have any direct knowledge, but I'm reading voraciously.
[2:49:54.460 --> 2:50:00.700]  And my bottom line is we, the people, need to end the power of all foreign agents over
[2:50:00.700 --> 2:50:01.700]  our government.
[2:50:01.700 --> 2:50:02.700]  And I agree.
[2:50:02.700 --> 2:50:04.140]  We hear about Russia involved.
[2:50:04.140 --> 2:50:06.820]  What about having the Vatican involved in our election?
[2:50:06.820 --> 2:50:08.500]  The Pope against our president.
[2:50:08.500 --> 2:50:09.500]  That is foreign meddling.
[2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:10.500]  That's right.
[2:50:10.500 --> 2:50:11.500]  Exactly right.
[2:50:11.500 --> 2:50:12.500]  I totally agree.
[2:50:12.500 --> 2:50:13.580]  Talk about separation in church and state.
[2:50:13.580 --> 2:50:17.540]  What about a foreign power, a foreign religious power coming in?
[2:50:17.540 --> 2:50:19.380]  I agree we should have separation in church and state.
[2:50:19.380 --> 2:50:21.760]  We shouldn't have a government-certified religion.
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:22.760]  We have freedom of religion.
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:23.760]  So what is the Vatican doing?
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:28.460]  Let me also tell you that I believe that any congressman that signs the APAC pledge should
[2:50:28.460 --> 2:50:29.460]  be fired.
[2:50:29.460 --> 2:50:32.020]  Well, I know this, again, exactly.
[2:50:32.020 --> 2:50:33.580]  I'm not against Israel itself.
[2:50:33.580 --> 2:50:39.060]  Absolutely, why does Israel get to be involved in our internal affairs when other governments
[2:50:39.060 --> 2:50:40.060]  aren't supposed to be?
[2:50:40.060 --> 2:50:41.940]  I don't care who it is.
[2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:46.820]  Kennedy was assassinated in part because he was about to force the issue of every Jewish
[2:50:46.820 --> 2:50:52.740]  organization receiving funding or direction from Israel being required to register itself
[2:50:52.740 --> 2:50:54.740]  as an agent of a foreign power.
[2:50:54.740 --> 2:50:57.140]  We're going to go to break right there.
[2:50:57.140 --> 2:50:58.140]  We're going to go to break right there.
[2:50:58.140 --> 2:50:59.140]  We're going to come back.
[2:50:59.140 --> 2:51:00.140]  Hi.
[2:51:00.140 --> 2:51:04.060]  This is Ron Paul, former congressman in Republican presidential candidate.
[2:51:04.060 --> 2:51:08.420]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[2:51:08.420 --> 2:51:12.220]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:15.260]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:51:15.260 --> 2:51:19.060]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[2:51:19.060 --> 2:51:21.900]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:26.060]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[2:51:26.060 --> 2:51:30.260]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[2:51:30.260 --> 2:51:35.500]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:51:35.500 --> 2:51:39.980]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting
[2:51:39.980 --> 2:51:41.300]  food on hand.
[2:51:41.300 --> 2:51:44.660]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[2:51:44.660 --> 2:51:46.340]  We love our freeze dryer.

[2:54:14.100 --> 2:54:15.100]  John Hubport is coming up.
[2:54:15.100 --> 2:54:19.500]  He wrote a powerful article for Infowars.com today looking at the 10 ways mainstream media
[2:54:19.500 --> 2:54:20.500]  lies.
[2:54:20.500 --> 2:54:23.860]  I meant to read it today, go over it, but I did and I'm sure he'll be covering that.
[2:54:23.860 --> 2:54:27.340]  There's a Paul Watson piece at Troy's singing and I haven't aired yet and premiered.
[2:54:27.340 --> 2:54:31.020]  We'll do that at about six or seven after next hour and then Rob Porol will come out
[2:54:31.020 --> 2:54:32.020]  about 15 after.
[2:54:32.020 --> 2:54:33.340]  So that's coming up.
[2:54:33.340 --> 2:54:37.500]  We're going to go to Caller that Disagrees on Trump's priorities and then Dean Travis
[2:54:37.500 --> 2:54:39.980]  Chris and a few others.
[2:54:39.980 --> 2:54:45.060]  Before I do that, we have fluoride-free high-quality toothpaste made by the biggest organic manufacturer
[2:54:45.060 --> 2:54:46.060]  in the country.
[2:54:46.060 --> 2:54:48.820]  They're the folks that supply toms of Maine.
[2:54:48.820 --> 2:54:54.140]  So it's that high-quality toothpaste, but it has iodine, the clean pure iodine added,
[2:54:54.140 --> 2:54:56.500]  and the nano silver.
[2:54:56.500 --> 2:54:58.020]  Super blue is back in stock.
[2:54:58.020 --> 2:55:01.980]  The bubblegum flavor that doesn't have the tea tree and stuff that tastes too strong
[2:55:01.980 --> 2:55:02.980]  for the kids.
[2:55:02.980 --> 2:55:03.980]  That's not back in.
[2:55:03.980 --> 2:55:04.980]  That's been sold out.
[2:55:04.980 --> 2:55:06.820]  So again, that's got 4.8 stars.
[2:55:06.820 --> 2:55:07.820]  Thousands of reviews.
[2:55:07.820 --> 2:55:13.140]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three,
[2:55:13.140 --> 2:55:14.140]  nine.
[2:55:14.140 --> 2:55:15.140]  They're free shipping throughout the store.
[2:55:15.140 --> 2:55:18.980]  They're handed it into July 4th, and we also have a lot of other big specials in the July
[2:55:18.980 --> 2:55:25.020]  4th, mega special deals that are going, and we have the micro ZX, micro ZX, that is the
[2:55:25.020 --> 2:55:26.020]  Beyond probiotic.
[2:55:26.020 --> 2:55:29.340]  It goes great with our bottom defense, best probiotic out there from our research.
[2:55:29.340 --> 2:55:33.140]  This knocks out the yeast in Candida and the fungus and all the garbage.
[2:55:33.140 --> 2:55:34.660]  This is a big deal.
[2:55:34.660 --> 2:55:35.900]  Bottom line is supporting the broadcast.
[2:55:35.900 --> 2:55:36.900]  You cannot lose.
[2:55:36.900 --> 2:55:40.380]  But most folks, I've talked to have incredible results.
[2:55:40.380 --> 2:55:44.780]  This is game-changing research, the yeast and the mold and what's happening in the gut.
[2:55:44.780 --> 2:55:45.780]  This is so important.
[2:55:45.780 --> 2:55:47.780]  So, micro ZX, back in at infowarslife.com.
[2:55:47.780 --> 2:55:48.780]  Okay.
[2:55:48.780 --> 2:55:54.300]  We've got Robert David Steeleman riding a shotgun with us, formerly with a CIA out on the front
[2:55:54.300 --> 2:55:55.300]  lines there.
[2:55:55.300 --> 2:55:58.020]  Let's go to, who's been holding the longest here?
[2:55:58.020 --> 2:56:00.780]  Disagreeing is Jeremy in California.
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:01.780]  You're on the year.
[2:56:01.780 --> 2:56:02.780]  Go ahead.
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:03.780]  Hey, thank you.
[2:56:03.780 --> 2:56:04.780]  Yeah.
[2:56:04.780 --> 2:56:10.340]  I just wanted to call because I'm looking at both the articles, by the way, a quick
[2:56:10.340 --> 2:56:15.740]  question that I'd like to ask your guest that he could answer after I make my statement
[2:56:15.740 --> 2:56:20.500]  is who nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize if he could provide proof or documents regarding
[2:56:20.500 --> 2:56:21.500]  that.
[2:56:21.500 --> 2:56:26.580]  The other thing I wanted to point out was that with regard to Trump tweeting out about
[2:56:26.580 --> 2:56:31.060]  Mika Brzezinski, my question for you is where do you draw the line?
[2:56:31.060 --> 2:56:32.860]  I mean, why is that cool?
[2:56:32.860 --> 2:56:33.860]  Why is that fighting?
[2:56:33.860 --> 2:56:34.860]  Oh, this is a seminar call.
[2:56:34.860 --> 2:56:39.140]  Let me answer your stupid question, okay?
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:42.660]  Trump, they're saying get rid of his Twitter because they hate him having indirect communication.
[2:56:42.660 --> 2:56:43.660]  It's a joke.
[2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:46.060]  They do manage it, only feed spam at the top of it.
[2:56:46.060 --> 2:56:47.860]  They showed up begging to meet with him.
[2:56:47.860 --> 2:56:50.500]  Reportedly, she was bleeding and had her head tied up.
[2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:52.620]  It just shows what a narcissist she is.
[2:56:52.620 --> 2:56:56.340]  And Trump made a joke about it because they demonize him and attack him and she said he's
[2:56:56.340 --> 2:57:02.060]  trying to be a dictator last week when they're the ones promoting war in the streets.
[2:57:02.060 --> 2:57:04.460]  So she's saying he's a dictator overthrowing.
[2:57:04.460 --> 2:57:07.420]  He makes a joke and you say, where do you draw the line?
[2:57:07.420 --> 2:57:09.540]  Do you have no decency, sir?
[2:57:09.540 --> 2:57:11.780]  Do you have no decency, Jeremy?
[2:57:11.780 --> 2:57:14.500]  Like you're calling in talking to somebody with a 70 IQ, bro.
[2:57:14.500 --> 2:57:16.820]  So I mean, what are you saying?
[2:57:16.820 --> 2:57:20.540]  Is there no decency in you, Jeremy?
[2:57:20.540 --> 2:57:23.660]  What I'm saying is this, is that it is important that the guy-
[2:57:23.660 --> 2:57:27.860]  What I'm saying is he needs to take his gloves off and get down here with the people even
[2:57:27.860 --> 2:57:31.140]  more and keep calling them traitors and outside powers.
[2:57:31.140 --> 2:57:34.380]  It's killing them and we're killing them with the information war.
[2:57:34.380 --> 2:57:35.380]  They want to make it violent.
[2:57:35.380 --> 2:57:39.700]  They're a pack of lion's scum and it's not that Trump's even perfect, but I love his
[2:57:39.700 --> 2:57:41.820]  bare knuckles boxing.
[2:57:41.820 --> 2:57:44.380]  Anything else, Jeremy?
[2:57:44.380 --> 2:57:51.660]  Yeah, I think that he needs to stop trolling down social media.
[2:57:51.660 --> 2:57:53.780]  Oh yeah, because it's so effective.
[2:57:53.780 --> 2:57:55.660]  I know he probably needs to quit breathing too.
[2:57:55.660 --> 2:57:56.740]  I appreciate your call.
[2:57:56.740 --> 2:58:00.820]  By the way, you're an accomplished author, researcher, great guy.
[2:58:00.820 --> 2:58:03.860]  I mean, you get into people being, I don't think you want to be nominated for a Nobel
[2:58:03.860 --> 2:58:06.980]  Peace Prize now, they're kind of a joke, but since you asked that question, go ahead.
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:07.980]  Yeah, sure.
[2:58:07.980 --> 2:58:10.980]  All of the information is at RobertDavidSteel.com.
[2:58:10.980 --> 2:58:12.700]  But it doesn't even matter.
[2:58:12.700 --> 2:58:16.140]  I'm not saying you're not a prominent guy and you have been promoting peace.
[2:58:16.140 --> 2:58:20.140]  The point is Obama was given one of these things, so I don't think you want one.
[2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:26.460]  Well, actually, I want to help Trump, Putin, Xi and Modi earn the Nobel Peace Prize.
[2:58:26.460 --> 2:58:30.300]  Even though the Nobel Peace Prize has been to me, I mean, any prize given to Henry Kissinger
[2:58:30.300 --> 2:58:31.300]  and Barack Obama.
[2:58:31.300 --> 2:58:32.300]  That's right.
[2:58:32.300 --> 2:58:33.580]  And stay there five more minutes.
[2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:37.660]  What about the alliance with, since you mentioned the Prime Minister of India with Trump?
[2:58:37.660 --> 2:58:41.220]  Let's talk about that back in 70 Seconds, hour number four.
[2:58:41.220 --> 2:58:42.220]  Spread the word, infowars.com.
[2:58:42.220 --> 2:58:44.900]  It is an act of resistance.

[2:59:46.540 --> 3:00:09.460]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:09.460 --> 3:00:22.980]  Look if the people just start putting out content, analyzing news, playing clips, giving
[3:00:22.980 --> 3:00:27.980]  common sense views of it, outside of talking points, but what actually arrives on our own
[3:00:27.980 --> 3:00:30.460]  research, it's over for the globalist.
[3:00:30.460 --> 3:00:32.460]  Okay, that's the big secret here.
[3:00:32.460 --> 3:00:36.660]  So I nominate Robert David Steele for a Human Liberty Award.
[3:00:36.660 --> 3:00:41.020]  The first we're giving out 10,000 times better than the Nobel Prize says that seminar caller
[3:00:41.020 --> 3:00:42.020]  called in.
[3:00:42.020 --> 3:00:45.340]  Let's do two more calls here, and we've got Paul Watson coming up with an exclusive info,
[3:00:45.340 --> 3:00:49.220]  and then John Rappaport, Dean in Wisconsin, and then Travis.
[3:00:49.220 --> 3:00:50.220]  Go ahead, Dean.
[3:00:50.220 --> 3:00:51.220]  Hey, Alex.
[3:00:51.220 --> 3:00:52.220]  Yeah.
[3:00:52.220 --> 3:00:53.220]  I just wanted to call.
[3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:54.220]  No, thanks.
[3:00:54.220 --> 3:01:02.380]  That was a good rebuttal to that Jeremy, because, you know, I just want to say about the climate
[3:01:02.380 --> 3:01:06.700]  accord, that was a perfect dry run, I'm going to keep on saying this when I call in if I
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:08.700]  ever get in.
[3:01:08.700 --> 3:01:12.380]  You just said it just right before.
[3:01:12.380 --> 3:01:17.380]  Compare globalism with tyranny to our sovereignty.
[3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:18.380]  It's over with.
[3:01:18.380 --> 3:01:21.940]  No one's going to be down for that.
[3:01:21.940 --> 3:01:28.060]  I mean, you did it, I think, on the show after Trump's speech, it was a perfect dry run explaining
[3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:32.580]  how that Paris Accord was a total extortion deal.
[3:01:32.580 --> 3:01:33.580]  Exactly.
[3:01:33.580 --> 3:01:34.580]  Let me, Dean.
[3:01:34.580 --> 3:01:35.580]  Sure.
[3:01:35.580 --> 3:01:36.580]  Go ahead.
[3:01:36.580 --> 3:01:41.980]  No, and then you said the same thing on, you said it concisely, or you just said it
[3:01:41.980 --> 3:01:44.660]  perfectly too on the show the next day, I think I saw.
[3:01:44.660 --> 3:01:45.660]  Well, thank you for that.
[3:01:45.660 --> 3:01:47.100]  Let me get to Steele's take on that.
[3:01:47.100 --> 3:01:48.100]  Thank you, Dean.
[3:01:48.100 --> 3:01:49.100]  I'm going to get Travis in here.
[3:01:49.100 --> 3:01:52.260]  Yeah, you're going to have a corporate global government that tries to make the general
[3:01:52.260 --> 3:01:55.820]  public poor, and you think the public's so done you're going to keep it secret.
[3:01:55.820 --> 3:02:00.100]  Now that the facade has fallen, Robert David Steele, how do they ever set up this global
[3:02:00.100 --> 3:02:02.300]  corporate tyranny again?
[3:02:02.300 --> 3:02:03.860]  I don't think you're going to be able to.
[3:02:03.860 --> 3:02:09.740]  I mean, I'm worried about the pandemic, because if they do a pandemic, that definitely creates
[3:02:09.740 --> 3:02:10.740]  some issues.
[3:02:10.740 --> 3:02:12.700]  That's their moon raker scenario to depopulate.
[3:02:12.700 --> 3:02:17.220]  Yes, but I supported the president on getting out of the climate change treaty, and what
[3:02:17.220 --> 3:02:22.660]  most citizens need to understand is that like the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership that
[3:02:22.660 --> 3:02:28.660]  the president very like, those are all about reducing sovereignty.
[3:02:28.660 --> 3:02:33.460]  Those are all about giving the city of London and Wall Street and the Rothschilds and the
[3:02:33.460 --> 3:02:35.780]  Black Pope more power.
[3:02:35.780 --> 3:02:41.300]  Those are all about screwing the average American for the benefit of the 1% of 1%.
[3:02:41.300 --> 3:02:42.300]  That's right.
[3:02:42.300 --> 3:02:46.300]  So is this a good sign that the Black Pope's aid to camp has been indicted for child rape?
[3:02:46.300 --> 3:02:49.580]  Yes, but they're only throwing one guy under the bus.
[3:02:49.580 --> 3:02:53.780]  The fact is 50% of the Catholic leadership should probably be indicted.
[3:02:53.780 --> 3:02:56.260]  Look, this is the sign of distress, okay?
[3:02:56.260 --> 3:03:00.660]  This is what every American should be putting on their law on this 4th of July.
[3:03:00.660 --> 3:03:01.660]  I agree with you.
[3:03:01.660 --> 3:03:02.660]  It's a sign of respect.
[3:03:02.660 --> 3:03:03.660]  You are under enemy control.
[3:03:03.660 --> 3:03:07.020]  Travis in Kansas, last caller before John Rebeport takes over.
[3:03:07.020 --> 3:03:08.020]  Go ahead.
[3:03:08.020 --> 3:03:09.020]  Hello?
[3:03:09.020 --> 3:03:10.020]  Yes, sir.
[3:03:10.020 --> 3:03:14.020]  Hey, how's it going, Alec?
[3:03:14.020 --> 3:03:15.020]  Good.
[3:03:15.020 --> 3:03:19.540]  Yeah, I just wanted to mention, you know, everything that you've been saying is, is
[3:03:19.540 --> 3:03:21.500]  true and everything.
[3:03:21.500 --> 3:03:27.060]  And you know, people need to realize that the true battle is good versus evil.
[3:03:27.060 --> 3:03:32.820]  It's not Democrats versus Republicans or left versus right, you know, and they're trying
[3:03:32.820 --> 3:03:36.220]  to divide people on as many fronts as possible to divide.
[3:03:36.220 --> 3:03:37.220]  That's right.
[3:03:37.220 --> 3:03:38.220]  Evil's got players everywhere.
[3:03:38.220 --> 3:03:40.540]  Good's got players everywhere.
[3:03:40.540 --> 3:03:43.300]  Well, I agree with that.
[3:03:43.300 --> 3:03:44.300]  And that's the heart.
[3:03:44.300 --> 3:03:45.940]  And let me end on this.
[3:03:45.940 --> 3:03:50.820]  That's the heart of why Dr. Cynthia McKinney and I have come together to create hashtag
[3:03:50.820 --> 3:03:51.820]  on rig.
[3:03:51.820 --> 3:03:54.260]  And we will not talk to any politicians.
[3:03:54.260 --> 3:03:59.620]  All we're doing is educating constituents, one congressional district at a time on how
[3:03:59.620 --> 3:04:00.620]  they can take back the power.
[3:04:00.620 --> 3:04:01.620]  Sure.
[3:04:01.620 --> 3:04:02.620]  How much power they have.
[3:04:02.620 --> 3:04:03.620]  We're going to have you back up July 3rd.
[3:04:03.620 --> 3:04:04.620]  Let's let Travis finish.
[3:04:04.620 --> 3:04:07.380]  Go ahead, Travis.
[3:04:07.380 --> 3:04:14.260]  Your biggest sleeper cell that you got in the American community is the Democrats, right?
[3:04:14.260 --> 3:04:18.140]  And they know that there's something else out there, that there's more to it.
[3:04:18.140 --> 3:04:19.140]  Well, I think...
[3:04:19.140 --> 3:04:20.140]  Yeah.
[3:04:20.140 --> 3:04:21.140]  They know Seth Rich got killed.
[3:04:21.140 --> 3:04:22.140]  They know Sanders got robbed.
[3:04:22.140 --> 3:04:27.060]  Well, I think the biggest awakening is just doing full disclosure.
[3:04:27.060 --> 3:04:28.060]  They need to...
[3:04:28.060 --> 3:04:29.060]  They...
[3:04:29.060 --> 3:04:30.060]  You know, it's...
[3:04:30.060 --> 3:04:31.060]  No, I agree.
[3:04:31.060 --> 3:04:32.060]  Don't get in the infighting.
[3:04:32.060 --> 3:04:33.060]  Keep hammering the issues.
[3:04:33.060 --> 3:04:34.060]  Thank you.
[3:04:34.060 --> 3:04:35.060]  Real fast for steel.
[3:04:35.060 --> 3:04:37.860]  Why do you think they're having an FBI and Diamond prepared on Sanders to keep him in
[3:04:37.860 --> 3:04:38.860]  line?
[3:04:38.860 --> 3:04:39.860]  Or why is that happening?
[3:04:39.860 --> 3:04:40.860]  Because he played ball.
[3:04:40.860 --> 3:04:41.860]  That's a really good question.
[3:04:41.860 --> 3:04:47.100]  And I think Sanders has deministered bleep and bribed by the Democratic Party.
[3:04:47.100 --> 3:04:52.140]  And I would reach out to the members of the People's Party, which is a Sanders sheepdog
[3:04:52.140 --> 3:04:53.140]  movement.
[3:04:53.140 --> 3:04:56.020]  And I would say to them, free yourself from the Democrats.
[3:04:56.020 --> 3:04:57.020]  Exactly.
[3:04:57.020 --> 3:04:58.020]  Thank you so much.
[3:04:58.020 --> 3:04:59.020]  Paul Watson coming up in John Rappaport.
[3:04:59.020 --> 3:05:00.020]  Thank you, Robert.
[3:05:00.020 --> 3:05:03.860]  Inforced is proud to announce the CNN is fake news contest, an expansion of the already
[3:05:03.860 --> 3:05:05.940]  successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[3:05:05.940 --> 3:05:06.940]  The contest is simple.
[3:05:06.940 --> 3:05:10.980]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is fake news sign or legible
[3:05:10.980 --> 3:05:15.260]  self-made t-shirt, $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is fake news
[3:05:15.260 --> 3:05:16.260]  sign or t-shirt.
[3:05:16.260 --> 3:05:20.260]  And it's also heard to say CNN is fake news info wars.com is real.
[3:05:20.260 --> 3:05:24.740]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available
[3:05:24.740 --> 3:05:26.940]  now at info wars store.com.
[3:05:26.940 --> 3:05:31.300]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener to realize that you have the
[3:05:31.300 --> 3:05:35.180]  power to save civilization from the criminal cabal control and humanity in his fake news
[3:05:35.180 --> 3:05:36.980]  propaganda machine called CNN.
[3:05:36.980 --> 3:05:40.860]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which
[3:05:40.860 --> 3:05:44.740]  a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[3:05:44.740 --> 3:05:48.900]  We need to come together to remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda
[3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:52.860]  thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual
[3:05:52.860 --> 3:05:54.620]  thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[3:05:58.340 --> 3:06:00.740]  This is Kit Daniels.
[3:06:00.740 --> 3:06:04.580]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[3:06:04.580 --> 3:06:09.460]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[3:06:09.460 --> 3:06:12.220]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:06:12.220 --> 3:06:18.500]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[3:06:18.500 --> 3:06:21.020]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[3:06:21.020 --> 3:06:25.340]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:06:25.340 --> 3:06:29.980]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[3:06:29.980 --> 3:06:35.020]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:06:35.020 --> 3:06:39.620]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.

[3:08:23.100 --> 3:08:30.100]  All right, John Rappaport soon will be, we're going to launch this soon, I just had a lot
[3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:34.460]  of fish in the fryer, he hosting part of his own show whenever he wants to, whether it's
[3:08:34.460 --> 3:08:35.460]  every day or every week.
[3:08:35.460 --> 3:08:38.380]  We're going to wind up, he's about to take over in about seven minutes, but I got behind.
[3:08:38.380 --> 3:08:42.740]  Here's Paul Watson's report, the truth about CNN that they do not want you to see.
[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:49.740]  We were at such an epic moment where the entire facade of fake news that John Rappaport's been
[3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:52.580]  exposing for decades, he coined the term, I think fake news first.
[3:08:52.580 --> 3:08:59.100]  He's had his website for 15 years, nomorefakenews.com, it's now happening.
[3:08:59.100 --> 3:09:01.580]  The question is, I don't want to be overconfident.
[3:09:01.580 --> 3:09:02.580]  What's the byproduct?
[3:09:02.580 --> 3:09:03.980]  What do we have to look out for?
[3:09:03.980 --> 3:09:07.500]  My gut tells me though, and intellectually as well, devastating victory.
[3:09:07.500 --> 3:09:08.860]  This is an incredible time.
[3:09:08.860 --> 3:09:14.380]  The Catholic Church is a giant satanic pedophile ring at the top coming out, it's all happening.
[3:09:14.380 --> 3:09:16.620]  This is just crazy.
[3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:20.580]  So here is a CNN and then John Rappaport will be joining you.
[3:09:20.580 --> 3:09:25.900]  Brian Stelter is butthurt that people are being mean to CNN, boo-hoo.
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:30.700]  He's whining about info wars promoting hate and resentment towards CNN.
[3:09:30.700 --> 3:09:33.780]  Millions of people are exposed to extreme anti-journalism views daily.
[3:09:33.780 --> 3:09:38.140]  Example, memes equating journalists to terrorists, this is harmful.
[3:09:38.140 --> 3:09:41.580]  You want to talk about harmful, and all you've got is memes.
[3:09:41.580 --> 3:09:46.540]  I'll tell you what's harmful, your network pushed a fake news narrative, Trump-Russia
[3:09:46.540 --> 3:09:50.740]  collusion, that your own producer admits was made up for ratings.
[3:09:50.740 --> 3:09:51.980]  Areas are incredible right now.
[3:09:51.980 --> 3:09:54.700]  You think the whole Russia **** is just like ****?
[3:09:54.700 --> 3:09:56.700]  I mean, it's mostly **** right now.
[3:09:56.700 --> 3:10:00.780]  That your own top contributor admits is a big nothing burger.
[3:10:00.780 --> 3:10:03.100]  The Russian thing is a big nothing burger.
[3:10:03.100 --> 3:10:07.620]  A narrative that pushed two superpowers closer to World War III.
[3:10:07.620 --> 3:10:08.980]  That's harmful.
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:11.580]  Your network pushed a fake news narrative.
[3:10:11.580 --> 3:10:13.140]  Hands up, don't you?
[3:10:13.140 --> 3:10:16.740]  We want you to know that our hearts are out there marching with them.
[3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:21.820]  That led to two mass shootings, riots, and a nationwide hate movement.
[3:10:21.820 --> 3:10:22.820]  That's harmful.
[3:10:22.820 --> 3:10:25.260]  Your network pushed a fake news narrative.
[3:10:25.260 --> 3:10:30.860]  Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, that led to one million dead Iraqis and thousands
[3:10:30.860 --> 3:10:34.180]  of dead and maimed US troops.
[3:10:34.180 --> 3:10:35.180]  That's harmful.
[3:10:35.180 --> 3:10:39.940]  Your network pushed a fake news narrative about Syrian rebels being moderate.
[3:10:39.940 --> 3:10:45.020]  Show the US I think that there is a significant amount of moderate rebels ready to take to
[3:10:45.020 --> 3:10:46.180]  the ground in Syria.
[3:10:46.180 --> 3:10:50.740]  That led to the rise of ISIS and an international migrant crisis.
[3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:51.740]  That's harmful.
[3:10:51.740 --> 3:10:56.460]  Your network pushed a fake news narrative about the Aleppo boy being a victim of Assad
[3:10:56.460 --> 3:10:59.180]  to propagandize for the invasion of Syria.
[3:10:59.180 --> 3:11:01.820]  We shed tears, but there are no tears here.
[3:11:01.820 --> 3:11:05.020]  He didn't cry once, that little boy is in total shock.
[3:11:05.020 --> 3:11:09.780]  When his whole family was supporters of Assad and said their son was used as a propaganda
[3:11:09.780 --> 3:11:30.860]  tool by the Jihadist rebels and by extension CNN.
[3:11:30.860 --> 3:11:31.860]  That's harmful.
[3:11:31.860 --> 3:11:35.740]  Some of this anti-journalism, it's insidious.
[3:11:35.740 --> 3:11:37.660]  I'll tell you what's insidious.
[3:11:37.660 --> 3:11:43.300]  Your network staged managing a protest to manipulate public opinion right after a terrorist
[3:11:43.300 --> 3:11:44.300]  attack.
[3:11:44.300 --> 3:11:45.740]  That's insidious.
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:50.140]  Your network burying the truth by reporting the Michigan airport terrorist said something
[3:11:50.140 --> 3:11:55.740]  in Arabic when it had been widely reported for hours before that he had shouted al-Araq
[3:11:55.740 --> 3:11:56.740]  bar.
[3:11:56.740 --> 3:11:57.900]  That's insidious.
[3:11:57.900 --> 3:12:02.060]  Your network telling Americans it was illegal to read WikiLeaks.
[3:12:02.060 --> 3:12:03.060]  That's insidious.
[3:12:03.060 --> 3:12:08.180]  It's illegal to possess these stolen documents, it's different for the media, so everything
[3:12:08.180 --> 3:12:10.940]  you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[3:12:10.940 --> 3:12:15.220]  Your network cutting off guests who even mentioned WikiLeaks.
[3:12:15.220 --> 3:12:16.220]  That's insidious.
[3:12:16.220 --> 3:12:20.900]  Hillary Clinton's a liar, she can't be trusted and now the two faces of Hillary Clinton are
[3:12:20.900 --> 3:12:26.780]  coming out, the fact through WikiLeaks that she says one thing and f***ing f***ing f***ing
[3:12:26.780 --> 3:12:27.780]  f***ing.
[3:12:27.780 --> 3:12:28.780]  Oh no.
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:32.780]  Your network cutting off guests who mention a link between refugees and terrorism.
[3:12:32.780 --> 3:12:33.780]  That's insidious.
[3:12:33.780 --> 3:12:34.780]  30%.
[3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:39.800]  30% of their domestic terrorism cases that they're investigating are from folks who are
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:40.800]  refugees.
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:45.160]  It's important not to label all refugees bad people, that's not why I'm here, but you
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:47.460]  f***ing f***ing.
[3:12:47.460 --> 3:12:52.900]  Your network pretending its own camera man is a random man on the street anti-Trump
[3:12:52.900 --> 3:12:54.060]  protester.
[3:12:54.060 --> 3:12:55.060]  That's insidious.
[3:12:55.060 --> 3:12:57.180]  One vote equals one vote.
[3:12:57.180 --> 3:12:58.500]  What's wrong with that?
[3:12:58.500 --> 3:12:59.500]  What's the debate?
[3:12:59.500 --> 3:13:01.940]  You can definitely feel his passion, there's other people out here who feel the same way,
[3:13:01.940 --> 3:13:05.220]  Like, you heard this man very passionate about the idea he doesn't want Hillary to stop.
[3:13:05.220 --> 3:13:08.340]  Yeah, Brian, you know I used to live there and I know that guy, that's John Gerkevic.
[3:13:08.340 --> 3:13:10.900]  He actually went to Africa with me as a cameraman.
[3:13:10.900 --> 3:13:16.900]  Your network's commentator giving debate questions to Hillary Clinton in advance.
[3:13:16.900 --> 3:13:18.900]  That's insidious.
[3:13:18.900 --> 3:13:24.260]  Your network telling debate focus groups what to say to make Hillary look good.
[3:13:24.260 --> 3:13:25.540]  That's insidious.
[3:13:25.540 --> 3:13:29.220]  That America already is great, but we are great because we are good.
[3:13:29.220 --> 3:13:32.100]  America is great.
[3:13:32.100 --> 3:13:37.380]  All right, so I want to ask you, what was it about Hillary Clinton's argument that resonated
[3:13:37.380 --> 3:13:39.780]  with you following Donald Trump's defense of the video?
[3:13:41.060 --> 3:13:44.900]  She stated that America is already great and I tend to agree with that.
[3:13:44.900 --> 3:13:49.140]  Your network running cover for Black Lives Matter by editing statements to turn them
[3:13:49.140 --> 3:13:53.700]  into the complete opposite of what was actually said. That's insidious.
[3:13:53.700 --> 3:14:00.420]  You're burning down **** we need in our community. Take that **** to the suckers. Burn that **** down.
[3:14:00.420 --> 3:14:02.340]  With his sister calling for peace.
[3:14:02.340 --> 3:14:05.220]  Don't bring the violence here and the ignorant here.
[3:14:06.260 --> 3:14:07.060]  Milwaukee police.
[3:14:07.060 --> 3:14:12.820]  Your network calling Milo Yiannopoulos an extremist. That's insidious.
[3:14:12.820 --> 3:14:17.620]  Most journalists try to be fair and right. When screw-ups happen, corrections are made.
[3:14:17.620 --> 3:14:20.740]  Screw-ups. Really? Screw-ups.
[3:14:20.740 --> 3:14:26.420]  A Harvard study found that CNN's coverage of Trump was 93% negative.
[3:14:26.420 --> 3:14:31.300]  93%. 13 to 1 negative to positive stories.
[3:14:31.300 --> 3:14:33.380]  Is that just a screw-up too?
[3:14:33.380 --> 3:14:37.060]  Whoops, we just did 13 negative stories on Trump again.
[3:14:37.060 --> 3:14:39.780]  What a coincidence. Oh well, just a screw-up.
[3:14:39.780 --> 3:14:42.500]  That's not a screw-up. That's bias.
[3:14:42.500 --> 3:14:46.020]  That's not fair and right. That's having an agenda.
[3:14:46.020 --> 3:14:49.460]  Look, I'm biased, but I don't claim to be neutral.
[3:14:49.460 --> 3:14:52.100]  I don't claim to be an impartial journalist.
[3:14:52.100 --> 3:14:57.620]  The fact that you and everyone else at CNN is still claiming to be impartial
[3:14:57.620 --> 3:15:00.020]  is an insult to our intelligence.
[3:15:00.020 --> 3:15:04.340]  Your boy Jim Acosta winds every week about how Trump and the White House
[3:15:04.340 --> 3:15:06.980]  take questions from conservative media.
[3:15:06.980 --> 3:15:10.660]  Like, how dare they allow anyone to break CNN's monopoly?
[3:15:10.660 --> 3:15:16.020]  Here's a guy who got caught tweeting fake news about Trump not visiting Scalise in hospital.
[3:15:16.020 --> 3:15:20.260]  Every chance he gets, he's bitching about Trump. He's not fair.
[3:15:20.260 --> 3:15:23.300]  He's not impartial. He's not a journalist.
[3:15:23.300 --> 3:15:27.460]  He's an activist. Just be frigging honest about it.
[3:15:27.460 --> 3:15:31.140]  You wonder why there's all this hate and resentment towards you.
[3:15:31.140 --> 3:15:33.860]  It's not because people hate all journalists.
[3:15:33.860 --> 3:15:39.780]  It's because you lie all the time, you push an agenda, and you get caught.
[3:15:39.780 --> 3:15:43.460]  But then you have the arrogance to still claim that you're impartial.
[3:15:43.460 --> 3:15:48.500]  You have the arrogance to point the finger at us as the reason for you being reviled.
[3:15:48.500 --> 3:15:53.860]  You have the arrogance, after all this, to still claim you have the moral high ground.
[3:15:53.860 --> 3:15:56.100]  You don't have the moral high ground.
[3:15:56.100 --> 3:16:00.100]  People hate you because you lie about huge things.
[3:16:00.100 --> 3:16:04.340]  You lie about things that cause wars and violence on the streets.
[3:16:04.340 --> 3:16:06.260]  That's why people hate you.
[3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:10.580]  They're not anti-journalism. They're anti-fake news.
[3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:14.980]  They're anti-CNN. And you earned that hate because...
[3:16:14.980 --> 3:16:16.980]  Oh, no.
[3:16:20.740 --> 3:16:22.660]  And now, John Rappaport reporting.
[3:16:28.180 --> 3:16:34.180]  John Rappaport here for Info Wars, sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour.
[3:16:34.180 --> 3:16:41.140]  Yes, Paul Watson. That's really something.
[3:16:42.900 --> 3:16:45.540]  I've been around for a long time doing news.
[3:16:47.300 --> 3:16:49.380]  There's nobody like Watson.
[3:16:50.900 --> 3:16:57.780]  He's taken that type of presentation to a new height.
[3:16:59.220 --> 3:17:00.500]  Look at all of his work.
[3:17:00.500 --> 3:17:05.780]  CNN, fakery on parade.
[3:17:07.060 --> 3:17:16.420]  There's a story running right now on Breitbart saying that, according to Twitter audit report,
[3:17:17.540 --> 3:17:24.340]  17 million or 50% of all CNN Twitter followers are fake.
[3:17:24.340 --> 3:17:32.340]  17 million fake Twitter followers?
[3:17:34.180 --> 3:17:37.300]  That's the result of the Twitter audit report.
[3:17:38.420 --> 3:17:40.100]  So ask yourself, how does that happen?
[3:17:41.140 --> 3:17:46.820]  I mean, if you wanted to get 17 million fake Twitter followers for yourself,
[3:17:47.460 --> 3:17:48.980]  how would you do it? What would you do?
[3:17:49.700 --> 3:17:50.820]  How would you work that out?
[3:17:50.820 --> 3:17:54.420]  I don't know, but you'd have to have some help, don't you think?
[3:17:55.060 --> 3:17:59.460]  I don't think you can just press a button in your house.
[3:17:59.460 --> 3:18:01.140]  No, you're right. Twitter has to be involved.
[3:18:02.260 --> 3:18:04.820]  I mean, yeah. How else can you do that?
[3:18:05.380 --> 3:18:11.300]  So obviously, CNN has some kind of a deal going right in order for them to be able to do this
[3:18:12.100 --> 3:18:15.860]  to amass 17 million fake Twitter followers.
[3:18:15.860 --> 3:18:20.180]  I don't think it's just, hey, we're CNN and guess what happened last night?
[3:18:20.180 --> 3:18:23.940]  We don't know how. We just got 17 million new Twitter followers.
[3:18:23.940 --> 3:18:26.900]  I don't think that's the way it works. I don't think so.
[3:18:27.940 --> 3:18:32.340]  So the fakery doesn't quit on every single possible front.
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:39.460]  And one of the things that Watson was saying there on his fantastic video,
[3:18:40.020 --> 3:18:45.460]  the Chris Cuomo dunce report on CNN.
[3:18:45.460 --> 3:18:48.580]  Remember that moment when he said, well, it's illegal.
[3:18:48.580 --> 3:18:51.380]  Well, this was during the presidential campaign.
[3:18:51.380 --> 3:18:57.460]  It's illegal for you or me or anybody in the public to possess.
[3:18:57.460 --> 3:18:59.860]  I think he said possess, right?
[3:19:00.900 --> 3:19:07.620]  The John Podesta emails that WikiLeaks released, you see, illegal.
[3:19:08.900 --> 3:19:12.900]  But we, the media, he said, we can do that. That's okay.
[3:19:13.780 --> 3:19:16.580]  And then we give you the information.
[3:19:16.580 --> 3:19:21.940]  It's filtered through us at CNN. And then you know it's okay.
[3:19:23.380 --> 3:19:29.060]  So what he's actually saying is we'll tell you what's good for you
[3:19:30.900 --> 3:19:33.700]  because we know what's good for you and we know what you should know.
[3:19:33.700 --> 3:19:37.300]  We know what you shouldn't know because we're CNN.
[3:19:37.300 --> 3:19:40.580]  I mean, these people think that way all the time.
[3:19:41.700 --> 3:19:44.900]  Talk to many, many mainstream reporters over the years.
[3:19:44.900 --> 3:19:47.460]  This is their arrogance. This is their entitlement.
[3:19:47.460 --> 3:19:50.260]  This is their attitude. This is why they think all the time.
[3:19:50.260 --> 3:19:57.460]  But they don't say it. You see, CNN is a bunch of kids, amateurs,
[3:19:57.460 --> 3:20:02.020]  fakers dressing up like adults and pretending to be journalists.
[3:20:02.020 --> 3:20:05.380]  That's really who they are. That's who they are.
[3:20:05.380 --> 3:20:08.580]  And they don't know how to do it. They can't get it right.
[3:20:08.580 --> 3:20:15.220]  So they'll have Chris Cuomo, you know, a dunce basically,
[3:20:15.220 --> 3:20:18.100]  coming on the air and just telling the people,
[3:20:18.980 --> 3:20:22.820]  you can't have that. You shouldn't go. Don't go to WikiLeaks.
[3:20:23.460 --> 3:20:26.180]  Don't look at those emails that are now posted there.
[3:20:26.740 --> 3:20:29.300]  You're not allowed to. It's not okay.
[3:20:30.580 --> 3:20:36.020]  But we can do that. We at CNN, we can go there and we can do that.
[3:20:36.020 --> 3:20:39.460]  We can do that. And then we can interpret, you see, and digest
[3:20:39.460 --> 3:20:44.100]  because we understand what's important and what isn't important
[3:20:44.100 --> 3:20:50.020]  and how you might be deluded by all of this stuff.
[3:20:50.020 --> 3:20:52.660]  We can tell the fake from the real. You trust us.
[3:20:52.660 --> 3:20:55.860]  We'll do that job for us, you see. It's different.
[3:20:55.860 --> 3:20:58.340]  You let us look outside of the outside world.
[3:20:58.340 --> 3:21:02.340]  You stay in the box. We're going to tell you your eyes are our eyes.
[3:21:02.340 --> 3:21:03.700]  You have to go through our filter.
[3:21:03.700 --> 3:21:06.900]  We are the controllers of your reality. We are your gods.
[3:21:06.900 --> 3:21:08.260]  This is the ultimate cult.
[3:21:08.260 --> 3:21:10.580]  And now, John, we see their cult falling.
[3:21:10.580 --> 3:21:12.020]  What do you expect to happen next?
[3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:14.020]  I'm sorry to be jumping in. I'm just watching and listening.
[3:21:14.020 --> 3:21:15.460]  That's okay. I'm glad you are, Alex.
[3:21:15.460 --> 3:21:16.740]  No, no, we skipped the breaks. We have more time.
[3:21:16.740 --> 3:21:18.260]  I apologize for coming in. Go ahead.
[3:21:19.140 --> 3:21:25.140]  You know, they've imploded so many times that where are they going to go next?
[3:21:25.140 --> 3:21:30.180]  I mean, either they stop talking about the whole Russia-Trump narrative
[3:21:30.180 --> 3:21:35.460]  that they've run 5,000 stories on because they had to retract the article.
[3:21:35.460 --> 3:21:39.540]  They fired three reporters, including a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[3:21:39.540 --> 3:21:41.540]  They're being sued for $100 million.
[3:21:41.540 --> 3:21:45.780]  Sued. So either they dropped that story, in which case, what do they have? Nothing.
[3:21:46.420 --> 3:21:50.900]  Or they just continued a pound on it. I wrote a piece today.
[3:21:50.900 --> 3:21:55.780]  Their ratings are crashing. They're now third behind MSNBC.
[3:21:55.780 --> 3:21:57.300]  He wrote a piece. I hope you'll get it later on.
[3:21:57.300 --> 3:21:58.580]  The 10 ways they lie, too.
[3:21:58.580 --> 3:22:05.700]  Yeah, the 10 ways that they lie. But this latest one, you know, they're the lowest of the cable
[3:22:05.700 --> 3:22:10.500]  ratings right now as of last Tuesday, running behind MSNBC and Fox.
[3:22:11.220 --> 3:22:13.060]  So they're just going to continue to crash.
[3:22:13.860 --> 3:22:19.780]  And the truth tellers are going to hold them up against the wall like never before.
[3:22:19.780 --> 3:22:23.860]  I mean, we've already been doing it to a tremendous extent.
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:26.260]  No, but I agree. They're beyond wounded. They're like undead.
[3:22:26.260 --> 3:22:28.740]  They've been dead since the Piers Morgan days, but they won't.
[3:22:28.740 --> 3:22:32.180]  They don't know when to quit, which is going to make their destruction even more spectacular.
[3:22:32.740 --> 3:22:38.100]  I think so. I think so because they're going to be thinking, you know, we have to do something
[3:22:38.100 --> 3:22:42.020]  completely outrageous in order to get our audience back. What is it going to be?
[3:22:43.060 --> 3:22:47.940]  And they're going to cook up some ridiculous scenario or event.
[3:22:47.940 --> 3:22:50.820]  I agree. They're already foreshadowing violence against them.
[3:22:50.820 --> 3:22:54.820]  They might run a false flag and hire some mercenaries to come in there. I'm serious.
[3:22:54.820 --> 3:22:58.660]  That's right. Because what did they recently say in the latest fake story?
[3:22:59.540 --> 3:23:06.340]  Trump hears a story from CNN because Trump is attacking us by calling us fake.
[3:23:07.540 --> 3:23:13.060]  Now the lives of journalists all over the world are in physical danger.
[3:23:13.060 --> 3:23:16.180]  Try to follow that line. So now when anybody gets hurt in a war zone,
[3:23:16.180 --> 3:23:18.980]  a war CNN helped start, it's Trump's fault.
[3:23:18.980 --> 3:23:24.020]  There you go. Exactly. It's Trump's fault. He did it because he criticized us.
[3:23:24.020 --> 3:23:28.180]  So what's the takeaway from that? Don't criticize the media.
[3:23:28.180 --> 3:23:32.420]  And they really think that's going to fly. I mean, that's going absolutely nowhere.
[3:23:32.420 --> 3:23:34.900]  It's just going to redouble people's attacks on them.
[3:23:34.900 --> 3:23:38.900]  I was about to say, don't they get their feeding the trolls times a trillion?
[3:23:38.900 --> 3:23:40.660]  I mean, this is, this is spectacular.
[3:23:41.380 --> 3:23:44.980]  Yeah. They don't, they don't seem to get it at all. Right.
[3:23:44.980 --> 3:23:49.140]  Yeah. There's Wolf Blister potentially very dangerous for Trump to call the media an enemy
[3:23:49.140 --> 3:23:54.660]  of the people. Okay. This guy is the weakest anchor on television in the history of television news.
[3:23:55.220 --> 3:24:01.220]  He can't even say that he's doing the news. He has to call the news the situation room.
[3:24:02.340 --> 3:24:07.300]  Who dreamed up that idea? What's the, what's the room? It's a television studio.
[3:24:07.300 --> 3:24:10.580]  What's the situation? The situation is, here's the news.
[3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:15.700]  So they have to dress this guy up because he doesn't have any firepower.
[3:24:15.700 --> 3:24:21.940]  He has no energy of his own. He's just sinking into, you know, the swamp.
[3:24:21.940 --> 3:24:24.740]  Why do you think though, because they could hire some powerful looking,
[3:24:24.740 --> 3:24:31.060]  smart sounding people to read teleprompters. It seems like CNN and MSNBC purposely get like
[3:24:31.060 --> 3:24:38.500]  these rat like people, even the female anchors. I'm like, this is like so transparently not real,
[3:24:38.500 --> 3:24:43.460]  not bonafide, not substantial. It just reeks of failure.
[3:24:43.460 --> 3:24:48.980]  Yeah. It's like they designed themselves to fail. This is what we're going to do.
[3:24:49.860 --> 3:24:55.940]  You know, because here's a 24 hour a day, seven day a week news channel, CNN.
[3:24:57.060 --> 3:25:01.140]  Where's their news? You know, they just have one kind of vague,
[3:25:01.140 --> 3:25:06.740]  drifting idiots delight show after another. And then, okay, it's time for the news.
[3:25:06.740 --> 3:25:12.260]  Okay. Give a few minutes to that back to another panel of 15 people sitting around,
[3:25:12.260 --> 3:25:17.620]  you know, talking over each other. I mean, you would think, like you said, Alex, they would have,
[3:25:17.620 --> 3:25:23.860]  here's our newscast and this is our guy or our woman or whoever, and they're substantial,
[3:25:23.860 --> 3:25:28.900]  but they don't, they don't have that. They're designing themselves. They've always designed
[3:25:28.900 --> 3:25:33.380]  themselves as far as I can see to fail completely. Just like, I'll tell you why they got sick of Dan
[3:25:33.380 --> 3:25:37.220]  rather and Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings, even though they were controlled. They didn't like the
[3:25:37.220 --> 3:25:42.580]  celebrity of the news man or woman. So right off 9-11, they went to these panels and people
[3:25:42.580 --> 3:25:47.140]  because the corporate guys want total control. They're so narcissistic and competitive.
[3:25:47.140 --> 3:25:51.460]  They don't want to start a deal with. They just want empty suits to read off a machine.
[3:25:52.180 --> 3:25:58.980]  Exactly. And the other trend I would say is we're going to be, our network is going to be more
[3:25:58.980 --> 3:26:05.300]  democratic. We're going to give more airtime to different people. We don't want to have the one
[3:26:05.300 --> 3:26:12.660]  voice, the one face of the network. We want to, you know, spread it out and give everybody a chance
[3:26:12.660 --> 3:26:20.580]  and so forth. And so, you know, they die. That's the way you die if you're that kind of an operation.
[3:26:20.580 --> 3:26:25.940]  That's right. There's no identity because the globalists, they don't want us to have it. They want
[3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:30.740]  an empty culture. They want to kill original journalism so that, because it threatens them
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:36.420]  by putting out false journalism, but instead all they killed was their own system. Yeah,
[3:26:36.420 --> 3:26:40.980]  that's exactly right. They thought they were killing us. They are really committing suicide.
[3:26:41.860 --> 3:26:47.460]  That's the way it always works. You know, if you're going to have an independent media,
[3:26:47.460 --> 3:26:54.900]  you're going to have many independent individuals presenting the news and the news behind them.
[3:26:54.900 --> 3:26:58.500]  And if you're going to have powerful personalities, and I don't mean by their physical looks,
[3:26:58.500 --> 3:27:02.260]  but by their spiritual looks, they're going to occasionally, even if they're your own ideologue,
[3:27:02.260 --> 3:27:06.980]  disagree with you. Execs don't want that. They want these empty nobody's. Yeah,
[3:27:06.980 --> 3:27:12.820]  that's the way it's turning out to be. Okay, we don't like this guy because he's too, you know,
[3:27:12.820 --> 3:27:18.500]  I don't know what authoritative we don't like. He seems too real. So let's get him out of there.
[3:27:18.500 --> 3:27:24.740]  Let's have 10 fake people instead talking over each other. I mean, this is just the way these
[3:27:24.740 --> 3:27:31.380]  people think. They can't help themselves because their failures. I mean, look at Jeff Zucker.
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:39.060]  In his, he was the CEO and president of NBCUniversal. That's right. During the period of time,
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:44.820]  when he basically destroyed NBC, I mean, they went from the number one network down to the
[3:27:44.820 --> 3:27:49.460]  bottom of the toilet behind everybody else. And everybody in the business knew about it.
[3:27:49.460 --> 3:27:54.740]  And they said, how can this guy still get good jobs? I mean, he just destroyed NBC completely
[3:27:54.740 --> 3:28:01.380]  from number one to the bottom, but he gets the head of CNN. So how is that guy going to think?
[3:28:01.380 --> 3:28:05.460]  Is he going to want to find a really strong personality that's suddenly going to
[3:28:06.020 --> 3:28:08.500]  No, that's globalism. Everybody under you week. So
[3:28:09.380 --> 3:28:13.780]  existentially then, what do you expect next? I mean, they edited me. It was horrible, whatever.
[3:28:13.780 --> 3:28:18.260]  Megan Kelly totally blow up in their face. She's gone from 7 million viewers five weeks ago
[3:28:18.260 --> 3:28:24.100]  to less than 3 million. She's done. I mean, it's like, it's like the kiss of death. These people
[3:28:24.100 --> 3:28:30.660]  are a joke. I love it. She's going to go to MSNBC. They're going to dump her in the graveyard over
[3:28:30.660 --> 3:28:35.140]  there with Brian Williams. And they're going to have a little Tay-Tay show between them.
[3:28:35.140 --> 3:28:39.460]  And it's going to be. That's right. They never admit they fail. They always have like a magazine
[3:28:39.460 --> 3:28:45.220]  show once a month for Pierce Morgan too. Right. Yeah. Nobody really ever dies. They just keep
[3:28:45.220 --> 3:28:49.780]  bringing it back. That's what's going to happen to her. And I think that it's quite possible
[3:28:50.580 --> 3:28:56.100]  that NBC just took her away from Fox with what sounded like a great deal because,
[3:28:56.980 --> 3:29:00.500]  you know, the idea was to destroy Fox. That's right. That was all part of that.
[3:29:00.500 --> 3:29:04.340]  NBC knew that they couldn't really use her. Their audience doesn't.
[3:29:04.340 --> 3:29:08.260]  She doesn't get she was being used, comma, causing Trump. I told that person,
[3:29:08.260 --> 3:29:12.420]  you still don't get you've been used sweetheart. You're so used to using everybody else. You're
[3:29:12.420 --> 3:29:17.860]  being used up. She's climbing the ladder and climbing ladder at Fox since, you know, stepping
[3:29:17.860 --> 3:29:22.820]  over whatever she has to step over to get to the top. And then she doesn't realize you're not at
[3:29:22.820 --> 3:29:28.020]  the top. They're going to just use you and throw you away. And that's what's happening. All right,
[3:29:28.020 --> 3:29:31.860]  John Rappaport on fire as usual. No more fake news.com. I'm going to unplug her. I'll keep
[3:29:31.860 --> 3:29:35.460]  interrupting. He's coming up straight ahead. The nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central.
[3:29:35.460 --> 3:29:39.540]  We appreciate all you spread the word about info wars.com. The globals are trying to censor it.
[3:29:39.540 --> 3:29:42.740]  They're trying to block up the articles, the videos, all of the live feeds.

[3:30:12.900 --> 3:30:17.060]  After Trump trolled James Comey into admitting he leaked and Loretta Lynch intervened in the
[3:30:17.060 --> 3:30:22.260]  Clinton email probe, the investigations are now aimed at the Democrats. John Podessa had a secret
[3:30:22.260 --> 3:30:26.660]  hearing on Tuesday. Loretta Lynch will soon be called to a hearing. Susan Rice will have to answer
[3:30:26.660 --> 3:30:31.140]  for unmasking and Bernie Sanders and his wife are being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[3:30:31.140 --> 3:30:36.580]  And now Republican senators want answers on the FBI Russia probe in regards to surveillance.
[3:30:36.580 --> 3:30:40.820]  Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham are leading the way in searching for answers on
[3:30:40.820 --> 3:30:45.380]  the procedures taken and by whom to issue surveillance requests because of the Russian
[3:30:45.380 --> 3:30:50.420]  probe. What could this possibly turn up as the world awaits answers from Barack Obama as to why
[3:30:50.420 --> 3:30:55.220]  it was he that interfered with the Russian investigation, not President Trump. Stay tuned

[3:32:03.460 --> 3:32:08.180]  stock at info wars store.com. The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week. I thought it
[3:32:08.180 --> 3:32:12.420]  would be a six month supply for listeners and since then people are beating down our doors
[3:32:12.420 --> 3:32:17.700]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue research across the board is clear. In fact it's
[3:32:17.700 --> 3:32:22.340]  certified when bacteria infect your gums it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[3:32:22.340 --> 3:32:26.900]  clots and heart attacks. That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns
[3:32:26.900 --> 3:32:31.460]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body. Super blue fluoride free

[3:35:03.780 --> 3:35:12.100]  stories media reports that keep on talking about mental illness in young people kids children
[3:35:13.140 --> 3:35:21.780]  new discovery breakthrough study indicates that more children than we thought have a mental
[3:35:21.780 --> 3:35:28.100]  disorder as if this is some scientific discovery it's a total hoax i could tell you
[3:35:28.100 --> 3:35:35.540]  you can check it out you can really check it out it's a total hoax i've been investigating
[3:35:35.540 --> 3:35:43.460]  psychiatry in the medical cartel for 35 years now as a reporter listen to these stats okay
[3:35:44.260 --> 3:35:50.500]  want to make sure i get these straight 25 percent of college students
[3:35:50.500 --> 3:36:00.340]  in the previous year have been diagnosed or treated for a mental disorder 25 percent
[3:36:02.020 --> 3:36:09.220]  according to you know the powers that be in the so-called mental health community
[3:36:09.220 --> 3:36:21.460]  a quarter of all americans 18 to 24 years old have a mental illness 25 percent that's a total hoax
[3:36:22.580 --> 3:36:34.020]  and you have 6.4 million children in america between the ages of four and four and 17 diagnosed
[3:36:34.020 --> 3:36:42.340]  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd that's destruction
[3:36:45.060 --> 3:36:52.820]  the diagnosis is fake because there is no science you can look it up in the diagnostic
[3:36:52.820 --> 3:36:58.420]  and statistical manual of mental disorders which is the official publication of the american
[3:36:58.420 --> 3:37:06.180]  psychiatric association fifth edition and you can read through that giant tome that lists roughly
[3:37:06.180 --> 3:37:13.460]  300 separate and officially certified so-called mental disorders different distinct have names
[3:37:13.460 --> 3:37:20.820]  labels and look for a blood test look for a hair test look for a urine test look for a
[3:37:20.820 --> 3:37:29.780]  brain scan look for a genetic assay as a defining way to diagnose any any folks
[3:37:30.420 --> 3:37:36.420]  of the so-called mental disorders and you won't be able to find it's not there not for any of
[3:37:36.420 --> 3:37:42.660]  the so-called mental disorder yes kids have problems adults have problems all kinds of
[3:37:42.660 --> 3:37:54.100]  things happen but the grid that's laid over this by the psychiatric fraudsters is a fraud
[3:37:54.100 --> 3:38:00.100]  a complete fraud and of course the treatments as i detail in the article that was just put up
[3:38:01.220 --> 3:38:04.900]  headline psychiatric destruction of creative children
[3:38:07.300 --> 3:38:12.100]  you can see that the drugs are incredibly toxic and they're being given to younger and
[3:38:12.100 --> 3:38:19.220]  younger children such as for example ssri antidepressants like prozac paxil zoloft given to
[3:38:19.220 --> 3:38:24.820]  younger and younger children who are being diagnosed with clinical depression now i don't
[3:38:24.820 --> 3:38:30.820]  know how you diagnose a four-year-old with clinical depression unless you're a sadist okay
[3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:39.300]  i have no idea how you would do that unless you were a sadistic md psychiatrists then
[3:38:39.300 --> 3:38:43.860]  i could see how you could do that how you could sit there and look at a four-year-old child and say
[3:38:44.980 --> 3:38:51.620]  this child has clinical depression and i'm going to prescribe a toxic drug called zoloft
[3:38:51.620 --> 3:39:01.700]  to treat that developing brain in that child and of course these antidepressants have been linked to
[3:39:01.700 --> 3:39:13.620]  so-called suicidal ideation suicide violence and homicide that's great huh what kind of a person
[3:39:13.620 --> 3:39:20.980]  does it take what kind of a monster basically does it take to start prescribing these drugs to
[3:39:20.980 --> 3:39:26.180]  four-year-old six-year-olds eight-year-olds and making this kind of diagnosis
[3:39:26.180 --> 3:39:34.900]  another very popular one of course is now the trend which has been exposed by the way
[3:39:35.620 --> 3:39:43.940]  as total fraud total sadistic fraud diagnosing younger and younger children with bipolar
[3:39:43.940 --> 3:39:52.100]  disorder used to be called manic depression and the drugs for that are just brain hammers
[3:39:52.100 --> 3:39:59.860]  valpruate lithium look up the adverse effects look up the adverse effects of those drugs
[3:39:59.860 --> 3:40:05.700]  for yourself just check it out it's all there in the literature and then just imagine a kid
[3:40:05.700 --> 3:40:12.820]  six years old being diagnosed with manic depression bipolar disorder by a supposed
[3:40:13.460 --> 3:40:21.460]  mental health professional without any test whatsoever no physical test no blood test no
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:31.140]  urine test no genetic assay no brain scan no anything this would be like you okay imagine
[3:40:31.140 --> 3:40:35.780]  this come on get with it you're going into a doctor's office and he says so what are you
[3:40:35.780 --> 3:40:40.580]  feeling how do you feel what do you think blah blah blah back and forth and after five minutes he
[3:40:40.580 --> 3:40:48.580]  says you've got cancer you say why yeah you've got cancer it's obvious what do you mean you're
[3:40:48.580 --> 3:40:52.820]  going to run a test on me you've got a blood test something you're going to do x-rays you're
[3:40:52.820 --> 3:40:57.780]  going to know we don't need to run a test i can tell from you know in fact just hold on a minute
[3:40:57.780 --> 3:41:03.780]  and then he opens the door and a few other doctors come in now they're a committee and he shows in
[3:41:03.780 --> 3:41:08.020]  their notes on the conversation just to have with you and you say what do you think guys and there's
[3:41:08.020 --> 3:41:13.460]  like four guys there and three of them say well this patient obviously has cancer that's you
[3:41:13.460 --> 3:41:18.100]  and the fourth one says i'm not sure well three out of four is pretty good so we say you've got
[3:41:18.100 --> 3:41:24.260]  cancer and now we're going to give a chemotherapy most toxic drugs ever invented chemical warfare
[3:41:24.260 --> 3:41:33.140]  basically it's kind of a you know a toss up whether the chemo will kill the tumors before
[3:41:33.140 --> 3:41:40.900]  the chemo kills you we'll see okay you've got cancer how would you react to that say well that
[3:41:40.900 --> 3:41:48.980]  is the setting in a psychiatrist's office no tests just a diagnosis of a child saying to the parent
[3:41:48.980 --> 3:41:57.220]  okay this is what we've got here this is what we've got your child has bipolar i'm going to prescribe
[3:41:57.220 --> 3:42:05.300]  these brain hammer drugs to a young child with a developing brain that's torture that's chemical
[3:42:05.300 --> 3:42:11.380]  warfare that's what it is now this is part and parcel of a much larger structure that includes
[3:42:11.380 --> 3:42:19.540]  of course major media who support this uniformly they're on board they're partners in this operation
[3:42:20.660 --> 3:42:25.540]  then you have the rest of the medical cartel the medical schools the psychiatric training
[3:42:25.540 --> 3:42:31.220]  the monopoly virtual monopoly given on mental health to the psychiatric profession by the
[3:42:31.220 --> 3:42:37.700]  government you've got that and then to go bigger you've got globalism and you've got the
[3:42:39.620 --> 3:42:49.700]  push to level out the capacity of human beings at the lowest common denominator because what do
[3:42:49.700 --> 3:42:54.580]  you think is going to happen and what is happening and what has been happening in schools where you've
[3:42:54.580 --> 3:42:58.740]  got kids who are sitting there twiddling their thumbs and bored and looking out the window
[3:42:58.740 --> 3:43:04.100]  and fidgeting because they're way ahead of everybody else in the class and they're dreaming
[3:43:04.100 --> 3:43:09.700]  up projects that what they want to do because they're extremely smart and ingenious and most of all
[3:43:09.700 --> 3:43:17.220]  they're creative so they don't fit in they're going to get diagnosed with ADHD that's what's
[3:43:17.220 --> 3:43:22.180]  going to happen if they keep that up and the teacher notices it well you've got to see the
[3:43:22.180 --> 3:43:27.460]  counselor now and the counselor says yes it looks like ADHD and let's get a confirming diagnosis
[3:43:27.460 --> 3:43:32.820]  from a psychiatrist and now we're going to put you on one of these drugs called Ritalin or Adderall
[3:43:32.820 --> 3:43:39.380]  one of these that are actually amphetamine type drugs that are going to cause you initial clarity
[3:43:39.380 --> 3:43:46.340]  and then a speed crash because that's what happens when you do speed you crash and for those of you
[3:43:46.340 --> 3:43:53.780]  that are watching the boys are putting up Richard Scarnotti an outline of hazardous side effects of
[3:43:53.780 --> 3:43:59.620]  Ritalin which is a study that was published some years ago in 1986 and you see all the adverse
[3:43:59.620 --> 3:44:06.020]  effects of a speed type drug paranoid delusions paranoid psychosis toxic psychosis visual
[3:44:06.020 --> 3:44:11.860]  hallucinations yeah you didn't hear about this right extreme withdrawal terrified affect screening
[3:44:11.860 --> 3:44:18.740]  aggressiveness insomnia psychic dependence decreased REM sleep convulsions brain damage
[3:44:18.740 --> 3:44:26.020]  possibility yeah yeah with ADHD drugs yeah that's right that's right
[3:44:28.420 --> 3:44:36.660]  we're going to destroy the creative child before he can do what he came here to do
[3:44:37.300 --> 3:44:46.420]  which is to create wonderful new things and if you do that and that certainly is the global
[3:44:46.420 --> 3:44:53.220]  medical psychiatric agenda which they will never admit but that's the way it's working out you're
[3:44:53.220 --> 3:44:59.620]  going to destroy the lives the brains the initiative the determination the free will
[3:45:00.580 --> 3:45:07.620]  and most of all the creativity and imagination of a child a creative child who would otherwise
[3:45:07.620 --> 3:45:14.900]  go on to live a spectacular spectacular life that's what you would do that's what's happening
[3:45:14.900 --> 3:45:17.300]  that is what's happening
[3:45:22.660 --> 3:45:31.060]  my blood boils when I get onto the subject really boils why aren't these people put in prison
[3:45:32.580 --> 3:45:38.020]  why aren't they carted away and prosecuted by the department of justice that's what the
[3:45:38.020 --> 3:45:43.620]  department is there for right that's what this is supposed to be all about delivering justice
[3:45:43.620 --> 3:45:49.780]  you're torturing a child we're not going to let you do that we don't care what you call yourself
[3:45:49.780 --> 3:45:55.220]  we don't care if you're an MD or psychiatrist or whatever you're torturing a young child you're
[3:45:55.220 --> 3:46:00.820]  destroying their brain and their creativity so for the rest of your life you're going to be in
[3:46:00.820 --> 3:46:08.980]  prison seems only fair at minimum that would be justice oh well we never thought we were doing
[3:46:08.980 --> 3:46:16.660]  that and it never occurred to us and the studies and the yeah well we've exposed all of that
[3:46:17.620 --> 3:46:24.820]  so it's too late for you now but possibly you can while away your years in a lock up
[3:46:27.060 --> 3:46:32.420]  thinking and understanding that you may set an example for the professionals that come behind
[3:46:32.420 --> 3:46:39.700]  you so that they won't do what you did to destroy lives all on the basis of transforming global
[3:46:39.700 --> 3:46:50.740]  society into the lowest common denominator of slug slug with these drugs that's the chemical
[3:46:50.740 --> 3:46:58.900]  warfare that never ended and unless we put a stop to it or the very least have choice to get out of it
[3:46:58.900 --> 3:47:07.140]  it's going to go on the pace that's what's going to happen that's where this whole thing is going
[3:47:10.500 --> 3:47:18.820]  and cnn and fox and mbc and abc and cbs and whoever else you want to throw into the mix
[3:47:18.820 --> 3:47:24.580]  they all support this is science they all get behind it they all say well this is the professional
[3:47:24.580 --> 3:47:30.740]  community here of of scientists and we can't really investigate them or call them out or
[3:47:30.740 --> 3:47:38.180]  expose them because what do we know this is the attitude of helpless disgusting victims
[3:47:39.780 --> 3:47:44.900]  in the press those who are the victims but then there are other people in the press who know
[3:47:44.900 --> 3:47:52.020]  exactly what's happening they're the shills they're the assets they're the agents who have been
[3:47:52.020 --> 3:48:00.820]  invaded in order to support this global psychiatric agenda a word to the wise

[3:54:30.260 --> 3:54:37.940]  we say i wrote a piece uh over at no more fake news this week about how all the elite media anchors
[3:54:37.940 --> 3:54:47.300]  are gone and when i say that i mean you know the voices of authority that used to completely
[3:54:47.300 --> 3:54:53.140]  hypnotize the public going back to the early days of television don't know how many of you remember
[3:54:53.140 --> 3:55:02.260]  that john daily and we had edward r murrow and we had chet huntley and david brinkley and we finally
[3:55:02.260 --> 3:55:09.620]  you know had walter cronkite this is walter cronkite presenting the news you've got nothing like that
[3:55:09.620 --> 3:55:17.540]  anymore all of that is gone and so the hypnotic effect has crumbled and continues to crumble
[3:55:17.540 --> 3:55:24.740]  because you've got bench warmers and second stringers and amateurs being used as the main news
[3:55:24.740 --> 3:55:33.300]  national news and global news anchor of these uh giant networks cbs just got rid of scott pelley who
[3:55:33.300 --> 3:55:40.660]  was like some sort of a uh i don't know i i always thought of him as a surgeon who did operations
[3:55:40.660 --> 3:55:47.780]  without anesthetic he kind of looked i don't know not good he's gone they don't have a permanent
[3:55:47.780 --> 3:55:55.060]  replacement over at nbc you've got lester holt he's their main guy he is just you know

[3:56:06.100 --> 3:56:10.740]  interrupted donald trump 41 times during a presidential debate when he was a moderator
[3:56:10.740 --> 3:56:17.460]  great and then we have david murr he's kind of the young guy you know the metro guy over at
[3:56:17.460 --> 3:56:24.820]  abc he's now their national anchor he's got the gravitas of a sears underwear model that's about it
[3:56:25.620 --> 3:56:33.700]  these are you know like people from the junior varsity that are now up there trying to exercise
[3:56:33.700 --> 3:56:39.940]  massive hypnotic mind control over the american people and the global audience with their national
[3:56:39.940 --> 3:56:46.180]  news broadcasts it ain't going to work folks it's not going to work and it's not working
[3:56:46.180 --> 3:56:54.100]  it's not working that whole mind control effect of the authoritative this is walter kronkine
[3:56:54.100 --> 3:57:02.980]  that's gone it's over it's finished it's finished and this is a great thing a good thing a cause
[3:57:02.980 --> 3:57:11.780]  for celebration indeed he do as the rise of independent media accelerates so does the decline
[3:57:11.780 --> 3:57:20.180]  in the ability to hypnotize the public of major media they're they're they're losing it they've
[3:57:20.180 --> 3:57:30.340]  lost it as alex and i were discussing at the top here their losers appointing other losers to carry
[3:57:30.340 --> 3:57:38.980]  the ball they're democratizing and heavy quotes the news broadcast to include more reporters more
[3:57:38.980 --> 3:57:44.500]  people who are rank amateurs they sit them in panels and they blab across from each other
[3:57:45.140 --> 3:57:51.620]  and occasionally have you know big time arguments about nothing that's where it's all devolving
[3:57:51.620 --> 3:57:59.860]  into because the people that run these news networks they don't have it anymore they're of
[3:57:59.860 --> 3:58:07.540]  another generation they think that if they give more minutes to more so-called field reporters
[3:58:07.540 --> 3:58:14.980]  and less to the anchor that it's going to be more inclusive and they must be inclusive
[3:58:14.980 --> 3:58:22.900]  to be politically correct you see their own idiotic mindset is contributing to their own
[3:58:22.900 --> 3:58:28.340]  destruction that's what's happening and that's a very good thing that's a terrific thing so as
[3:58:28.340 --> 3:58:34.980]  much as they whine they scream and they moan and they accuse and they tell us that independent media
[3:58:34.980 --> 3:58:40.180]  are destroying the public mind no no no what's really happening is they used to destroy the
[3:58:40.180 --> 3:59:06.100]  public mind and now they've lost the neck of how to do that
