[00:00.000 --> 00:21.240]  these
[00:21.240 --> 00:32.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:32.480 --> 00:34.200]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:34.200 --> 00:40.480]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we have some incredibly important information to cover
[00:40.480 --> 00:42.200]  here today.
[00:42.200 --> 00:50.280]  We are in a climate where we are openly hearing that there's going to be a civil war, that
[00:50.280 --> 00:56.280]  the president's a traitor, that he's got to be removed, the president is calling all
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.840]  of this a attempted coup.
[01:01.840 --> 01:04.840]  So that is the climate we're in.
[01:04.840 --> 01:13.160]  And there is a deep state that is attempting to take our president down, that is trying,
[01:13.160 --> 01:16.000]  you know, really as hard as they can.
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.120]  And so the headlines are up on infowars.com and newswars.com right now.
[01:24.120 --> 01:32.240]  Trump activates U.S. marine reserves for emergency within the United States to stop illegal
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.240]  coup.
[01:34.240 --> 01:41.880]  Now we have the Marine Corps ordered as well that we're going to be going over after we
[01:41.880 --> 01:45.840]  come back from break here.
[01:45.840 --> 01:50.840]  I don't want to play a compilation of the last few weeks and going back the last few
[01:50.840 --> 01:55.120]  years, Democrats saying impeach, imprison and then kill the president.
[01:55.120 --> 02:02.040]  Now Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA, a protege of Comey and of Mueller is saying
[02:02.040 --> 02:03.520]  they're going to shank the president.
[02:03.520 --> 02:06.600]  They said they're going to kill him previously, Mudd said that, but now they're going to shank
[02:06.600 --> 02:08.320]  him.
[02:08.320 --> 02:10.600]  So that's all coming up.
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.920]  Obviously this is the climate we're in, we're taking this very, very serious.
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.560]  This shows how far we've gone and they may just move with an illegal coup, not even the
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.240]  impeachment because Trump in two weeks has the IG report coming out on the FISA warrants
[02:23.240 --> 02:24.880]  and the illegal spy on the president.
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.320]  Here's that report.
[02:29.320 --> 02:33.320]  If he takes the risk of going to trial and he's convicted, that could be seen as an impeachable
[02:33.320 --> 02:34.320]  offense.
[02:34.320 --> 02:37.200]  I don't see how that wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
[02:37.200 --> 02:41.160]  That tweet fits the Republican definition of an impeachable offense.
[02:41.160 --> 02:43.160]  Where do you see an impeachable offense?
[02:43.160 --> 02:44.680]  It is grounds for impeachment.
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.120]  Potentially criminal or even impeachable grounds for impeachment.
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.600]  You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America.
[02:52.600 --> 02:54.400]  America will triumph over you.
[02:54.400 --> 02:57.320]  That apparently directed for the president of the United States.
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.320]  Is it impeachable?
[02:58.320 --> 03:01.000]  100% is impeachable.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.040]  Very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanor.
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.160]  To take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back
[03:09.160 --> 03:10.160]  at you.
[03:10.160 --> 03:12.640]  As former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[03:12.640 --> 03:15.120]  There is enough here for articles of impeachment.
[03:15.120 --> 03:16.120]  Absolutely.
[03:16.120 --> 03:17.120]  Already.
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.960]  The president himself admitted that he had a telephone conversation with the president
[03:21.960 --> 03:23.120]  of Ukraine.
[03:23.120 --> 03:25.840]  He also said he did talk to him about Biden.
[03:25.840 --> 03:28.960]  He is with so many people knowing about this.
[03:28.960 --> 03:31.640]  It's interesting and I'm kind of proud to say this.
[03:31.640 --> 03:36.440]  He took a member of the intelligence community to step up and bring it forward.
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.840]  It's hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the founders more
[03:41.840 --> 03:44.080]  than what's on that call.
[03:44.080 --> 03:51.720]  Where you have a president using the full power of his office to try to effectively coerce
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.000]  a foreign leader that is completely dependent on our country for military, economic, diplomatic
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.280]  and other support.
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.240]  To intervene in our election to help his campaign.
[04:03.240 --> 04:09.320]  Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election.
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.320]  It couldn't be clearer.
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.240]  And that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[04:14.240 --> 04:15.440]  That is treason.
[04:15.440 --> 04:17.160]  It's treason, pure and simple.
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.160]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death.
[04:21.160 --> 04:22.160]  That's the only penalty.
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.000]  I mean, president is only a four-year job, but it feels like it's taken him five years
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.520]  to just fire his ass.
[04:28.520 --> 04:29.520]  It's frustrating.
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.880]  You know, I bet somebody explained how long impeachment takes to John Wilkes Booth, and
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.520]  he was like, okay, well, where's he at right now?
[04:36.520 --> 04:44.960]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.880]  The call is the call, but there's nothing here that rises to the level of high crimes
[04:49.880 --> 04:50.880]  and misdemeanors.
[04:50.880 --> 04:59.120]  I don't know where they're from.
[04:59.120 --> 05:03.720]  Well, the president came out this last Wednesday and said, there is an ongoing coup against
[05:03.720 --> 05:13.920]  me by the people to understand what's happening and to spread the word and to call Congress
[05:13.920 --> 05:16.240]  and to financially support me into this election.
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.320]  That's all totally true.
[05:17.320 --> 05:18.320]  Please do it.
[05:18.320 --> 05:19.720]  Also in full force, easier support.
[05:19.720 --> 05:20.720]  I make it easy.
[05:20.720 --> 05:23.440]  It's one of the very best supplements that make your life so much better than made mine
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.440]  amazing.

[05:33.680 --> 05:36.200]  And right now, the sales got to end the next few days.

[05:39.800 --> 05:42.120]  quality supplements and so much more.

[05:48.840 --> 05:49.840]  you do.
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.600]  That's all for now because history is taking place.
[05:52.600 --> 06:11.760]  Black Friday comes two months early, mega sale is about to end.
[06:11.760 --> 06:18.240]  Look at what happened in Tiananmen Square back in 1989, thousands were shot dead and
[06:18.240 --> 06:23.800]  run over by army tanks there in the college area when they simply came out and said, we
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.760]  want to be able to vote.
[06:25.760 --> 06:28.760]  We want to be able to have representative government.
[06:28.760 --> 06:37.960]  In 1986, the chairman of the Communist Party by the name of Hu Yaobang, who was a sympathetic
[06:37.960 --> 06:46.600]  to the student's debate and democracy movement at that level, was stripped of his position
[06:46.600 --> 06:50.400]  and put him under house arrest.
[06:50.400 --> 06:57.360]  When that happened, China came into a relatively repressive period when all the debate had
[06:57.360 --> 07:07.000]  to go underground, which caused a lot of tension and that built up till the spring of 1989 when
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.240]  Hu Yaobang unexpectedly died of a heart attack.
[07:11.240 --> 07:17.520]  And that, as you all remember, was the event that triggered Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
[07:17.520 --> 07:23.440]  Those days, as a 21-year-old student leader marching on the streets of Beijing and occupying
[07:23.440 --> 07:28.640]  Tiananmen Square, we not only had the support of the Chinese people, we had the support
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.240]  from all over the world, particularly in the democratic countries.
[07:33.240 --> 07:39.440]  Clearly, you felt we were fighting for the same as you had fought for and lived by.
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.280]  It felt like history was on our side and victory would be ours soon.
[07:45.280 --> 07:53.000]  On June 4, 1989, the Chinese Communist Party sent troops to massacre the people it claimed
[07:53.000 --> 07:54.520]  to represent.
[07:54.520 --> 08:00.480]  In order to save its own skin, the Communist Party brutally suppressed freedom of expression
[08:00.480 --> 08:02.640]  and crushed all dissents.
[08:02.640 --> 08:10.600]  It has continued to rule since then at the barrel of guns using fear and lies.
[08:10.600 --> 08:16.000]  The People's Republic of China is not a republic, neither is North Korea.
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.960]  It is a Politburo, Central Committee, dictatorship of the grandchildren and the children of the
[08:23.960 --> 08:29.400]  people who overthrew and took over China in its weakened position from the Japanese at
[08:29.400 --> 08:36.280]  the end of World War II and leftist in America and major foundations, backed that so the
[08:36.280 --> 08:41.880]  robber barons would have a country with hundreds of millions of slaves to be able to leverage
[08:41.880 --> 08:43.920]  out the rest of the world economy.
[08:43.920 --> 08:48.760]  And now it is the China Century, according to the anti-American globalist at the Council
[08:48.760 --> 08:49.760]  on Foreign Relations.
[08:49.760 --> 08:55.400]  Will the 21st century be the American Century or will it be the Chinese Century?
[08:55.400 --> 08:57.080]  The Chinese are moving up fast.
[08:57.080 --> 08:58.400]  There's no doubt about that.
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.600]  When I was there just about a month ago and the change in 25 years because it was 25 years
[09:04.600 --> 09:07.880]  ago that I was first there, it is extraordinary.
[09:07.880 --> 09:13.080]  What would be the consequence, in your opinion, if Trump were to confront China on trade?
[09:13.080 --> 09:24.960]  One can expect that people like myself and those leading Americans who for eight administrations
[09:24.960 --> 09:32.600]  have pursued a common policy will continue to believe in those principles and will continue
[09:32.600 --> 09:34.120]  to advocate them.
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.360]  But we're beginning to see signs that the fabric of how we finessed it is beginning
[09:39.360 --> 09:40.360]  to fray.
[09:40.360 --> 09:44.560]  So I actually think it's possible not just an economic confrontation with China but also
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.520]  a political and strategic confrontation in ways that if you had had me on the show one
[09:49.520 --> 09:51.640]  or two years ago I would not have predicted.
[09:51.640 --> 09:55.360]  This relationship is deteriorated significantly in a short amount of time.
[09:55.360 --> 09:58.560]  The folks in Hong Kong said when they build this bridge that took five years, the biggest
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.720]  bridge in the world, from the mainland here, it will be used to bring in tanks and troops.
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.240]  The bridge hadn't even been completed two months when tanks and armored vehicles and
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.640]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of troops per week began pouring in a few months ago.
[10:15.640 --> 10:18.240]  Again, it got completed what six months ago.
[10:18.240 --> 10:21.600]  They began pouring in right after that and they've been pouring in hundreds of thousands
[10:21.600 --> 10:23.880]  every week since then.
[10:23.880 --> 10:30.640]  No one knows the full number but it's reportedly over a million because very few leave back
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.680]  to the mainland they've been massing troops there.
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.320]  Look around us.
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.440]  The societies that have made the most spectacular progress in the shortest period of time are
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.880]  not the most rigidly organized nor even the richest in natural resources.
[10:46.880 --> 10:53.240]  No, it's where people have been allowed to create, compete, and build.
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.680]  Where they've been permitted to think for themselves, make economic decisions, and benefit
[10:57.680 --> 11:04.360]  from their own risks, that societies have become the most prosperous, progressive, dynamic,
[11:04.360 --> 11:05.360]  and free.
[11:05.360 --> 11:13.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[11:13.880 --> 11:23.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday, October 6, 2019,
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.200]  and I'm going to cover the news we're going to hit on the other side of this break.
[11:29.200 --> 11:36.640]  I just want to say that the news we're going to be covering here tonight is about as concerning
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.680]  and serious as it can get and I don't know what's going to happen to this country in
[11:41.680 --> 11:49.880]  the future because we are a very domesticated, very soft, entertained to death delusional
[11:49.880 --> 11:57.920]  nation now that is extremely disconnected from the land and disconnected from history
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.720]  and disconnected from our families and disconnected from ourselves.
[12:02.720 --> 12:10.920]  Now I say all of that not to be mean and not to be on some proverbial high horse like I'm
[12:10.920 --> 12:12.200]  perfect myself.
[12:12.200 --> 12:21.960]  I say that because knowing the problems that we have as a civilization and as a society
[12:21.960 --> 12:29.080]  are what are going to let us know how to fix these problems.
[12:29.080 --> 12:34.200]  Now we have a lot of big news, obviously, to cover here today.
[12:34.200 --> 12:40.000]  In fact, so much big news that I went to rebroadcast for the first seven, eight minutes of the
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.880]  show so that I could work on what I'm about to break down here on air.
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.360]  And so, again, when we come back from break, I'm going to reset as best I can.
[12:52.360 --> 13:02.240]  I'm going to restart the show and I'm going to really try to lay out exactly what's unfolding.
[13:02.240 --> 13:09.960]  But there is no doubt that there is an attempted coup taking place not just against the president
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.280]  but against this country's very existence.
[13:14.280 --> 13:20.440]  No one can deny that we've become a very corrupt nation, a very drugged up nation, a very ignorant
[13:20.440 --> 13:23.800]  nation, a very unhealthy nation on average.
[13:23.800 --> 13:30.520]  But still we have a lot of attributes that powerful countries and corporate systems want
[13:30.520 --> 13:40.400]  to take control of.
[13:40.400 --> 13:41.960]  And that is what's going on.
[13:41.960 --> 13:49.880]  We are in the middle of a coup against this country.
[13:49.880 --> 13:57.840]  And we see all the trappings, the censorship, the social unrest, the collapsing borders,
[13:57.840 --> 14:08.120]  the economic warfare, the physical warfare, the crises happening all around the planet.
[14:08.120 --> 14:15.000]  And the Democrats bought and paid for by multinational interest are openly for the team that wants
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.320]  to bring this country down.
[14:17.320 --> 14:25.480]  That's really what it comes down to.
[14:25.480 --> 14:36.400]  And so we need to look at what that coup comprises itself of and the information that a lot of
[14:36.400 --> 14:46.240]  organizations and groups are pushing for a classical physical coup.
[14:46.240 --> 14:54.280]  And they're trying to hype the intelligence agencies that are a bunch of spoiled, rotten
[14:54.280 --> 15:06.640]  Ivy League snot noses at the top into making a move on the president outside of Congress.
[15:06.640 --> 15:20.160]  Now if you remember, back in 2017, six months into the year at the Aspen Institute being
[15:20.160 --> 15:33.920]  hosted by Wolf Blitzer of CNN, several of Obama's former operatives, Peyton, Brennan,
[15:33.920 --> 15:39.960]  all of them got up on the stage and said, the president will be gone by December.
[15:39.960 --> 15:41.720]  And Blitzer said, you mean impeachment?
[15:41.720 --> 15:44.480]  They said, no, we mean another way.
[15:44.480 --> 15:47.320]  Well, they're now making that move right now.
[15:47.320 --> 15:52.640]  And Trump has called the Marine Corps reserves up to deal with the breakdown of civilization
[15:52.640 --> 15:54.360]  and to aid civil authorities.
[15:54.360 --> 15:55.360]  Break it down.
[15:55.360 --> 15:57.120]  We come back.
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.960]  I'm up here with the crew, just late at night, but I can't leave the office because history
[16:02.960 --> 16:04.640]  is happening right now.
[16:04.640 --> 16:09.760]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny,
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.760]  those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[16:13.760 --> 16:15.440]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners.
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.160]  You are the salt of the earth, you're the people that understand what's happening and
[16:19.160 --> 16:22.360]  who have helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny.
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.640]  So I thank you again, but please understand how important you are and understand that
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.920]  your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support is absolutely more critical
[16:29.920 --> 16:30.920]  than ever.
[16:30.920 --> 16:34.800]  Not just for President Trump, but for M. Full Wars, who is President Trump's bullhorn
[16:34.800 --> 16:36.520]  of nationalism and patriotism.
[16:36.520 --> 16:40.920]  Please spread the word about M.FullWars.com, port slash show, band dot video and all the
[16:40.920 --> 16:46.000]  powerful transmissions and reports, support yourselves with great products at M.FullWars.com.

[16:54.360 --> 16:57.800]  goods at M.FullWars.com.
[16:57.800 --> 17:02.560]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.000]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.520]  corporate rule government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity,
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.120]  that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the people, but then meanwhile
[17:16.120 --> 17:17.680]  is tax exempt again offshore.
[17:17.680 --> 17:21.280]  Well, Trump got that and all these other populace get it.
[17:21.280 --> 17:25.520]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say
[17:25.520 --> 17:30.400]  the communist Chinese, the David Rockefeller, Putin power are better than everybody?
[17:30.400 --> 17:36.240]  That is a sick, freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch humanity turned over to
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.440]  these people and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help
[17:41.440 --> 17:47.120]  me part of their defeat and I've been saying that prayer for 20-plus years and God is delivering
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.960]  because God is great, thank God for his son Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.960]  the NW.
[17:57.960 --> 18:02.000]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you the
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.320]  products at M.FullWars.com are.
[18:05.320 --> 18:12.880]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[18:12.880 --> 18:17.640]  that God gave us through Mother Nature and then we make it even stronger, even better
[18:17.640 --> 18:19.120]  and lower the price.
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.480]  Now turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[18:23.480 --> 18:29.240]  it's good for the immune system, so many things, it sells itself, but normal turmeric
[18:29.240 --> 18:37.040]  only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant, originally obviously
[18:37.040 --> 18:38.040]  from India.
[18:38.040 --> 18:44.600]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other
[18:44.600 --> 18:49.240]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it and that's why people absolutely
[18:49.240 --> 18:50.240]  love it.
[18:50.240 --> 18:56.640]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at M.FullWars.com.
[18:56.640 --> 19:03.000]  The globalist and their democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  hot.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.240]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship
[19:09.240 --> 19:14.840]  and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.840]  of war.
[19:15.840 --> 19:20.720]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, ally with the chai comms and
[19:20.720 --> 19:26.000]  others with the Hollywood, America hating, God hating filth to try to capture the United
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  States.
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.240]  This is 21st century war and wars need money to be prosecuted and we're actually winning
[19:33.240 --> 19:36.000]  the war, but the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.720]  That's why we need financial support, it's a total 360 win, double patriot points, 50%
[19:40.720 --> 19:43.840]  off, store-wide free shipping, it's about to end with a running out of a lot of these
[19:43.840 --> 19:48.640]  products at M.FullWars.com, but I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high
[19:48.640 --> 19:53.120]  quality products you already need and fund the information war at M.FullWars.com.
[19:53.120 --> 20:03.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:41.120 --> 20:47.280]  stories are up on M.FullWars.com, NewsWars.com and the main article originates
[20:47.280 --> 20:54.120]  from NaturalNews.com, I've been talking to Mike Adams today, he's gonna be with us tomorrow
[20:54.120 --> 20:59.120]  in studio hopefully if not Skype and he's been talking to his sources, I've been talking
[20:59.120 --> 21:09.640]  to my sources and this is a public document from October 3rd, ladies and gentlemen, 2019
[21:09.640 --> 21:16.760]  memorandum 55019, already the left is trying to spin this to a previous order from years
[21:16.760 --> 21:21.840]  ago, planning this order is not accurate, that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen,
[21:21.840 --> 21:27.760]  U.S. Marine Reserves units activated for an emergency within the United States, which
[21:27.760 --> 21:33.560]  will come with little warning sites threats to the homeland.
[21:33.560 --> 21:37.920]  Now we have the Democrats running around saying they want the 25th Amendment, they want Trump
[21:37.920 --> 21:43.360]  removed out of office, 22nd Amendment saying that they want to say that he's basically
[21:43.360 --> 21:49.680]  mentally ill, you also have them classically running around on CNN saying it's time to
[21:49.680 --> 21:54.280]  kill him, it's time to remove him, you've got Maxine Waters saying that impeachment
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.520]  is too good for him, he needs to be in prison in solitary confinement, you've got Phil Mudd
[21:58.520 --> 22:03.360]  of the CIA who famously said the intelligence agencies are gonna kill this guy, he now said
[22:03.360 --> 22:09.640]  last Friday that someone's gonna stab him in the back with a shank, we have Trump saying
[22:09.640 --> 22:15.920]  this is a coup to remove an elected president, so these are epic unprecedented times, and
[22:15.920 --> 22:27.160]  you've got the Attorney General lined up and getting ready and reportedly about to release
[22:27.160 --> 22:40.400]  these men in the Associated Press, the AG report dealing with all of the illegal spying on the Trump campaign
[22:40.400 --> 22:46.520]  by the Obamas and the Clintons, and the reported indictment of Andy McCabe, who will be the
[22:46.520 --> 22:51.480]  first FBI Director in history to be indicted, of course it came out three weeks ago that
[22:51.480 --> 22:55.400]  he's been indicted, but that they brought it up to the Deputy Director of the Justice
[22:55.400 --> 22:59.880]  Department that's over those things to hopefully have it quashed or squashed and that did not
[22:59.880 --> 23:06.600]  happen, so the deep state is scared and they've launched this new Russia hoax 2.0, the Ukraine
[23:06.600 --> 23:12.640]  hoax, and the first quote whistleblower was third hand, probably just shift making it
[23:12.640 --> 23:18.840]  up, we know he reads fake transcripts from the House Intelligence Committee Chairman's
[23:18.840 --> 23:26.800]  Dias, so now someone who had second hand knowledge reportedly is filing, and so that's all this
[23:26.800 --> 23:31.680]  is, it's just like Velazie Ford and all these other fake women coming out with fake stories,
[23:31.680 --> 23:37.520]  they just want to have this drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, where this all builds up, that
[23:37.520 --> 23:41.320]  oh we've got him talking to foreign leaders, he's a traitor again, just like he's getting
[23:41.320 --> 23:46.000]  peed on by Russian hookers, none of it's true, he releases the real transcript, not there,
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.160]  but then Trump goes of course, I'm bringing up all the corrupt deals, the Obamas and the
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.720]  Clinton signed with China and everybody else, we're ending those deals where they would
[23:55.720 --> 23:59.480]  get pay, they would get money, they would get on the board of directors of these different
[23:59.480 --> 24:05.360]  companies and then they would sell out US interest, of course I'm stopping all that, that's my
[24:05.360 --> 24:11.920]  job is to go through all these deals and make better deals, I'm doing it to stop corruption,
[24:11.920 --> 24:16.520]  so they're trying to turn this around and say oh no, that's corruption to try to stop
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.840]  the ongoing deals with all these companies that Republican and Democrats, but mainly
[24:21.840 --> 24:28.160]  Democrats, but some Republicans are involved, the neocons, in setting up, Ukraine has been
[24:28.160 --> 24:32.760]  a giant cash machine, it's been a civil war for a long time and the West has been funding
[24:32.760 --> 24:37.120]  up to $5 billion a year into it trying to kick Russian interest out before the civil
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.520]  war started five years ago.
[24:42.520 --> 24:50.040]  So we're on the precipice here of a real coup, a hot coup against the president and the take-away
[24:50.040 --> 24:55.880]  is the fact that he's called up Marines, that you don't call up for hurricanes or tornadoes
[24:55.880 --> 25:01.320]  or earthquakes, call up the Marines for an emergency within the United States which will
[25:01.320 --> 25:09.800]  come with little warning, cites threats in the homeland.
[25:09.800 --> 25:14.560]  Incredible article at naturalnews.com, we have the article mirrored at infowars.com with
[25:14.560 --> 25:20.880]  our live feed so we can show you more and so you can share that link.
[25:20.880 --> 25:26.560]  Trump activates US Marines reserves for quote, emergency within the United States to stop
[25:26.560 --> 25:32.360]  illegal coup, order says emergency will come with little warning, cites threats within
[25:32.360 --> 25:37.480]  the homeland, click below for live coverage, I suggest you share that.
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.440]  Now the reason I added the part about clearly this is for a coup is that's what our sources
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.160]  are saying, the president says there's an ongoing coup and President Trump has told
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.520]  confidants in the past that if they ever try any legal coup on him outside of Congress,
[25:52.520 --> 26:00.280]  outside of law, which they're now saying they'll do, that he will use the Marines to encircle
[26:00.280 --> 26:06.960]  the White House and then send the Army and Marines in to round up the coup plotters.
[26:06.960 --> 26:12.240]  So this is what you see in Turkey, it's what you see in Guatemala, it's what you see in
[26:12.240 --> 26:17.640]  Venezuela, it's the type of crap you see in countries whose intelligence services battle
[26:17.640 --> 26:20.240]  over who controls the nation, not the voters.
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.800]  I've said it, Tucker Carlson said it, President Trump has said it, this is about intelligence
[26:25.800 --> 26:31.880]  agencies wanting to take over the government fully and wanting to nullify an election.
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.060]  And so they say we're in a civil war, they say they're going to remove the president,
[26:36.060 --> 26:40.480]  they say they're going to trigger riots, Trump goes that's wrong, you're putting us into
[26:40.480 --> 26:45.200]  a civil war, they go oh my God, you want a civil war, that's impeachable.
[26:45.200 --> 26:49.920]  So we see them agitating, we see them pushing, we see them preparing, we see them getting
[26:49.920 --> 26:59.840]  everybody upset.
[26:59.840 --> 27:03.840]  And then sitting back when they create the crisis and Pelosi goes I'm so sad, we're
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.280]  going to have to have an impeachment, oh it's going to tear our country apart, can't believe
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.120]  Trump's brought us to this place, it's so horrible when they've been trying to impeach
[27:12.120 --> 27:15.560]  him before he ever got in office.
[27:15.560 --> 27:16.560]  That's right.
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.120]  Oh, he's criminal, the Russians stole it, so don't seat the delegates, he'll be gone
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.240]  before January 20th, 2017, then once he got in, remember all the reports we filed, all
[27:27.240 --> 27:33.120]  the shows we covered, where they had the Aspen Institute on CNN with both Blitzer, and he
[27:33.120 --> 27:47.320]  had Brennan, and he had Clapper on the stage, and they said oh, he'll be gone by December,
[27:47.320 --> 27:50.200]  by the fiscal year, that's when they want to get him done by so they can get a hold of
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.040]  the budget again and give themselves all that money again, the Swiss bank accounts aren't
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.480]  big enough, remember that, got to play that clip again, where they said he'll be gone by
[28:00.480 --> 28:09.240]  December, okay, well that was two years ago now, and then oh, it's the 22nd amendment,
[28:09.240 --> 28:13.400]  he's mentally ill, we've got to get rid of him, we've got to get members of his cabinet
[28:13.400 --> 28:16.720]  to do it, so they're threatening members of his cabinet, and so they came up with a plan
[28:16.720 --> 28:22.480]  since Russiagate had zero truth in it, well at least if we have him on real phone calls
[28:22.480 --> 28:27.640]  with world leaders, we'll claim those are inappropriate, and claim that there's quid
[28:27.640 --> 28:32.720]  pro quo going on, and we'll have enough people just say it, at least the phone calls are
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.200]  real even though the contents aren't real, maybe that'll work, and we'll have enough
[28:36.200 --> 28:39.840]  of a smoke screen there to scare enough people and claim they're going to jail that they'll
[28:39.840 --> 28:45.240]  agree to a 22nd amendment, but Trump won't go quietly, so they'll have to incapacitate
[28:45.240 --> 28:49.200]  him or kill him, and they shot Ronald Reagan one year into office, Trump's way overdue
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.720]  for it folks, this nation is in total crisis right now, there is a coup going into hot
[28:53.720 --> 29:03.080]  food right now, the gauntlet has been thrown down, every major democrat candidate has come
[29:03.080 --> 29:08.680]  out and said they want to confiscate all semi auto firearms, and now buddha judge has come
[29:08.680 --> 29:14.480]  out and said that it's about political power, that's why they want the guns, well finally
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.480]  they're being honest, because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want, so
[29:19.480 --> 29:24.080]  now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny, it shows what incredible followers
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.440]  these people are, the globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war,
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.680]  and they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position
[29:32.680 --> 29:37.560]  in that civil war, but it's up to us to understand the big picture, to carry the fight to the
[29:37.560 --> 29:42.760]  enemy in the information war, before they can kick off a hot civil war, that's our mission,

[33:25.480 --> 33:34.720]  You know, I think the best thing I can do tonight is just read this article from naturalnews.com,
[33:34.720 --> 33:45.640]  it's also posted at infowars.com and then read through the actual command document
[33:45.640 --> 33:50.640]  from the Marine Corps General in charge that Trump put in just a few months ago.
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.480]  I think that's really the most important thing to do and then understand that there
[33:55.480 --> 34:01.520]  is a war on reality by the Democrats and the neocons that have presided over the sell out
[34:01.520 --> 34:04.080]  of this nation to foreign interest.
[34:04.080 --> 34:12.880]  But if you just tuned in, we're gonna be covering this throughout the rest of the show tonight.
[34:12.880 --> 34:21.280]  Trump has activated Marines for a domestic operation to assist civil authorities for
[34:21.280 --> 34:29.360]  a disaster that will come with little warning, cites threats in the homeland.
[34:29.360 --> 34:34.160]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the President has already said there is an ongoing coup and
[34:34.160 --> 34:36.480]  attempted coup against him.
[34:36.480 --> 34:40.120]  He said that about ten times I know of the last week.
[34:40.120 --> 34:47.280]  He said it on video, in national addresses, to the cameras.
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.520]  The Democrats are talking about what prisons they want to put everybody in.
[34:51.520 --> 34:53.240]  They're talking about how they want to kill the President.
[34:53.240 --> 34:56.800]  If you just joined us, I heard video at the start of the show of prominent Democrats saying
[34:56.800 --> 35:00.120]  let's stab him, let's kill him, let's put him in solitary confinement.
[35:00.120 --> 35:11.880]  These are former heads of counterterrorism at the CIA, like Phil Mudd, Maxine Waters,
[35:11.880 --> 35:13.880]  and they have been foaming at the mouth for impeachment.
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.600]  And so this fake whistleblower comes forward and then that gives him a platform to have
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.000]  Brennan and other coup architects, former head of the CIA, known serial liar.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.680]  He's mentally lied to Congress many times to say, all whistleblowers activate and report
[35:28.680 --> 35:30.440]  the crimes you know of.
[35:30.440 --> 35:35.680]  And that means, like Balazi, Ford, and others, make up lies like they did with Kavanaugh.
[35:35.680 --> 35:39.160]  It's a repeat of that.
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.600]  You know, Saturday Night Live, three times I watched it, read fake transcripts of the
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.920]  President saying he was guilty quid pro quo with Ukraine.
[35:48.920 --> 35:52.080]  That Saturday Night Live, people knew it was a joke.
[35:52.080 --> 35:55.560]  And Adam Schiff did it as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.560]  It was criminal.
[35:56.560 --> 35:59.960]  It didn't tell people till later it was fake.
[35:59.960 --> 36:07.320]  MSNBC put out fake dossiers and fake transcripts as well.
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.400]  And they're still saying that's not a full transcript when it is a full transcript.
[36:11.400 --> 36:14.920]  This is how they take over and change the subject from their corruption because their
[36:14.920 --> 36:21.440]  backs against the wall and Trump is draining the swamp and Trump's going to win re-election.
[36:21.440 --> 36:27.120]  In their fake poll show, he's above where Obama was three years into his presidency,
[36:27.120 --> 36:29.200]  his first term.
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.760]  So they're moving with a real coup, but they can't get one.
[36:32.760 --> 36:34.720]  They don't have the votes of the Senate yet.
[36:34.720 --> 36:39.360]  So they need to drum up some other reason to get the intelligence agencies to move against
[36:39.360 --> 36:45.920]  Trump by saying he's a foreign asset, he won't.
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.000]  He removed by the election or by Congress, so we've got to act.
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.240]  That's what they've been saying on television.
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.360]  Somebody's going to kill him, somebody's going to stab him.
[36:57.360 --> 37:04.600]  And these are people like Phil Mudd, who was over counterterrorism, that means hit teams
[37:04.600 --> 37:05.600]  at the CIA.
[37:05.600 --> 37:11.440]  That's the deep state saying, kill the president, kill the president, kill the president.
[37:11.440 --> 37:15.760]  And so you bet he's mobilized the Marines.
[37:15.760 --> 37:20.120]  You see, I've talked to multiple people very close to the president.
[37:20.120 --> 37:22.960]  And the president knew that when he tried to drain the swamp and restore the republic,
[37:22.960 --> 37:24.680]  it was a good chance this would happen.
[37:24.680 --> 37:29.360]  And he's always had a plan that if someone tries to remove him, not through Congress,
[37:29.360 --> 37:37.280]  not through lawful impeachment, but through some type of paramilitary coup with a group
[37:37.280 --> 37:43.640]  of leftists, say out of the FBI or some other agency, that are going to try to grab the
[37:43.640 --> 37:48.440]  president, say we're in command, and hope the coup works, that the Marines are going
[37:48.440 --> 37:54.760]  to remove them.
[37:54.760 --> 37:59.280]  So this happens in countries all the time, just happened in Turkey last year.
[37:59.280 --> 38:00.560]  And we've become a third world country.
[38:00.560 --> 38:02.640]  We act like a third world country now.
[38:02.640 --> 38:04.840]  And so this isn't going to happen.
[38:04.840 --> 38:05.840]  It's happening.
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.760]  The question is, how bad will the coup attempt get?
[38:09.760 --> 38:11.680]  So let's read over it all right now.
[38:11.680 --> 38:12.680]  U.S.
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.720]  Marines reserve units activate for emergency within the United States, which will come
[38:17.720 --> 38:20.440]  with little warning sites threats in the homeland.
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.440]  Those are quotes.
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.640]  Breaking update concerning the directive involving the United States Marine Corps reserve units
[38:27.640 --> 38:36.080]  via Marine admins number 550-19, signed October 3rd, 2019, authorized by Brigadier General
[38:36.080 --> 38:40.080]  Daniel L. Shipley, Director of Manpower Plans and Policy.
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.960]  Notably, Brigadier General Daniel L. Shipley was nominated by President Trump for the
[38:44.960 --> 38:50.120]  rank of Major General, courted to a January 16, 2019, defense.gov, press announcement
[38:50.120 --> 38:51.120]  before serving.
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.720]  His current role, Shipley, served as the Deputy Director of Program Analysis, the Evaluation
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.720]  Department of Programs and Resources for United States Marines.
[38:59.720 --> 39:06.320]  The new order summarizes Marines ordered to active duty ISO defense support of civilian
[39:06.320 --> 39:09.680]  authorities, means in support of.
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.760]  Many observers are concerned that the Democrats, like Representative Tlaib, openly talking about
[39:14.760 --> 39:19.440]  which prisons to use for imprisoning Trump and his cabinet, and with Hillary Clinton
[39:19.440 --> 39:24.720]  positioning herself to run for president, and with the IG and FISA abuse report set
[39:24.720 --> 39:28.920]  to drop in a few weeks, the deep state Democrats have reached a point of desperation where
[39:28.920 --> 39:35.400]  they may attempt to initiate a hot coup, kinetic engagement, arrest or execution of the president
[39:35.400 --> 39:38.680]  and his cabinet to avoid going to prison themselves.
[39:38.680 --> 39:45.200]  The entire CIA-run deep state media, i.e. Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, etc., are all in
[39:45.200 --> 39:50.720]  on the effort and are now gaslighting the entire nation with gender whistleblower schemes
[39:50.720 --> 39:53.640]  that are wholesale fabrications.
[39:53.640 --> 39:58.520]  Alex Jones reminds us, and I've told this story before, Trump has long planned to activate
[39:58.520 --> 40:01.920]  the U.S. Marines to stop an illegal coup.
[40:01.920 --> 40:03.720]  It goes on.
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.840]  I spoke with Jones on the phone today about this breaking news, and he told me, I've talked
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.400]  to high-level Trump confidant just recently concerning what Trump would do if the deep
[40:12.400 --> 40:14.560]  state attempted an illegal coup.
[40:14.560 --> 40:17.880]  Trump said that they would call out the Marines and surround the White House to illegally
[40:17.880 --> 40:25.320]  and lawfully pursue the organizers and the originators of the criminal coup.
[40:25.320 --> 40:29.240]  This high-level confidant is someone who is very close to the president and who is familiar
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.600]  with the president's plans for how to deal with any attempt by the deep state to carry
[40:34.600 --> 40:40.160]  out an illegal coup attempt, again, this high-level confidant is someone who is very close to the
[40:40.160 --> 40:45.640]  president and who is familiar with the president's plans on how to deal with any attempt by the
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.160]  deep state to carry out an illegal coup attempt.
[40:49.160 --> 40:53.440]  We urge all lawful pro-American-organized individuals prepared to defend your president
[40:53.440 --> 40:56.520]  against an illegal coup attempt in the coming weeks and months.
[40:56.520 --> 41:01.640]  Details the military order to U.S. Marines, threats in the homeland will come with little
[41:01.640 --> 41:02.640]  or no warning.
[41:02.640 --> 41:07.440]  He notes, as the following order described, an activation of U.S. Marines' reserve units
[41:07.440 --> 41:12.040]  to prepare for an anticipated hot coup against the president, while some might downplay
[41:12.040 --> 41:17.600]  the order as a routine personnel organization directive, you can read the highlights here
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.840]  and decide for yourself that these are unprecedented with the president's standards and attempted
[41:21.840 --> 41:23.720]  coup against him, and there is.
[41:23.720 --> 41:25.880]  I mean, this is the climate.
[41:25.880 --> 41:26.880]  This is going on.
[41:26.880 --> 41:31.000]  It's like the Weather Report says, look out for tornadoes and you walk outside the skies
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  green.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.400]  You'll see a tornado a mile away.
[41:33.400 --> 41:36.880]  I mean, we're already in this is what I'm saying.
[41:36.880 --> 41:38.880]  The question is, how bad is it going to get?
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.440]  Let me go to the actual order here for you.
[41:42.440 --> 41:44.560]  Okay, this is really important.
[41:44.560 --> 41:52.120]  Manpower guidance for activation and the activation of reserve component Marines ordered to active
[41:52.120 --> 41:57.240]  duty ISO defense support of civil authorities.
[41:57.240 --> 42:01.960]  So they're calling up the Marine Corps reserves and when we come back, we're going to get
[42:01.960 --> 42:02.960]  to go over all this.
[42:02.960 --> 42:10.400]  And folks, if you're a TV viewer, you can see we're at marines.gov or dot mill yourself.
[42:10.400 --> 42:16.680]  Manpower guidance for activation and deactivation of reserve component Marines ordered to active
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.720]  duty ISO defense support of civilian authorities.
[42:20.720 --> 42:25.520]  Now three days ago, and we've been making phone calls to Marines normally, they'd be
[42:25.520 --> 42:26.520]  told what it was for.
[42:26.520 --> 42:28.200]  They'd be told where they were going.
[42:28.200 --> 42:29.960]  That's not the case.
[42:29.960 --> 42:30.960]  So this is a big deal.
[42:30.960 --> 42:38.040]  Folks, we're already in a battle, a civil war, a cold civil war for control of the republic.
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.960]  Democrats and neocons are on the side of the globalist chikoms and they're openly trying
[42:41.960 --> 42:45.480]  to collapse our borders and cause a race war and the federal reserves and trying to kill
[42:45.480 --> 42:46.480]  the economy.
[42:46.480 --> 42:49.920]  America is under attack and our presidents under attack and independent free media is
[42:49.920 --> 42:51.120]  under attack.
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.240]  All the center ships in place when they make their big move, get ready, stay with us.
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.960]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[42:59.960 --> 43:01.920]  They think the West is dead.
[43:01.920 --> 43:04.880]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots off internet, you'll just forget
[43:04.880 --> 43:05.880]  about us.
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.160]  And then they'll be the only information out there well so far that's not been working
[43:09.160 --> 43:10.160]  too well for them.
[43:10.160 --> 43:14.680]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive
[43:14.680 --> 43:19.840]  and well at band.video and now we've added a lot of new functions and a lot of new hosts

[43:33.440 --> 43:38.080]  it's apple or droid you simply click the share button on your phone and then add to
[43:38.080 --> 43:41.160]  home screen and then there's nothing the scumbags can do.
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.320]  The power of America, the power of freedom, the power to build a better world and stand
[43:46.320 --> 43:52.280]  in the face of the censors of the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at band.video
[43:52.280 --> 43:57.400]  but it's up to you to unleash its full potential band.video.
[43:57.400 --> 44:01.920]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[44:01.920 --> 44:05.880]  He is working for American interest steadfastly.
[44:05.880 --> 44:10.840]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders bankrupt
[44:10.840 --> 44:16.080]  and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood
[44:16.080 --> 44:17.760]  and the majority of our debt.
[44:17.760 --> 44:23.400]  We have been maneuvered towards a collapse in bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute
[44:23.400 --> 44:28.160]  the American people put a populist in power and it's happening all over the world so
[44:28.160 --> 44:31.720]  great things are happening but the enemy is striking back.
[44:31.720 --> 44:34.720]  You're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.080]  It has bipartisan support and I'm telling you President Trump needs our prayers and
[44:39.080 --> 44:42.240]  info wars needs your prayers and support.
[44:42.240 --> 44:45.720]  Ladies and gentlemen the globalists are trying to shut us down but right now it's easier
[44:45.720 --> 44:49.160]  than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time with
[44:49.160 --> 44:54.920]  Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping, double patriot points and ladies
[44:54.920 --> 44:57.240]  and gentlemen 50% off.
[44:57.240 --> 44:59.360]  Josh in Washington you're on the air go ahead.
[44:59.360 --> 45:04.240]  Alex God bless you I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of this is your
[45:04.240 --> 45:09.160]  brain this is your brain on drugs this is your brain this is your brain on 5G.
[45:09.160 --> 45:10.160]  Oh yeah.
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.160]  Showing your brain getting fried then I have some comments on your supplements man pull
[45:13.160 --> 45:18.600]  it change my life I use turbo force bodies album power brain force fish oil ultra twelve
[45:18.600 --> 45:24.800]  daily X2 every several days now what I found is is really combining them is so it's synergistic
[45:24.800 --> 45:29.320]  and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products and I just want to urge
[45:29.320 --> 45:31.920]  all your listeners who haven't tried them I just want to say why not.
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.880]  Well you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible whether it's turmeric
[45:35.880 --> 45:39.440]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the
[45:39.440 --> 45:43.440]  CoQ-10 and bio PQQ and all the rest of it all of these are things that are like rocket
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.880]  fuel on the body you take these bases together then you have your foundation now you can
[45:47.880 --> 45:51.920]  build the big strong temple with these products I take my religiously remember to take them
[45:51.920 --> 45:55.880]  it makes my life so much better and then it funds the information war which is so critical
[45:55.880 --> 45:58.480]  thank you so much God bless you.
[45:58.480 --> 46:04.880]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it didn't I say a thousand
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.680]  times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate rule government
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.960]  above the law but doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying
[46:12.960 --> 46:18.240]  it's communist and socialist power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.880]  well Trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful
[46:23.880 --> 46:28.520]  countries and cultures just so you could say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller
[46:28.520 --> 46:35.000]  put in power are better than everybody that is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.600]  by and watch humanity turn over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the will
[46:40.600 --> 46:45.160]  to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat and I've been saying that prayer
[46:45.160 --> 46:51.560]  for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great thank God for his son Jesus Christ
[46:51.560 --> 47:00.160]  and now let's move forward against the NW.
[47:00.160 --> 47:14.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.120 --> 47:18.080]  Let me tell you one really fascinating piece here Chris that nobody's talking about Rudy
[47:18.080 --> 47:23.320]  Giuliani and the comment you just made that Mike Pompeo when he got the stuff from Giuliani
[47:23.320 --> 47:27.480]  referred to it for investigation I spent a lot of time in government there are State
[47:27.480 --> 47:32.560]  Department officials who will testify Intel guys DOD Department of Defense people all
[47:32.560 --> 47:38.800]  of us are sort of a brotherhood and sisterhood Rudy Giuliani parachutes in from Mars the people
[47:38.800 --> 47:43.120]  who will testify are going to look at him including State Department officials and say
[47:43.120 --> 47:47.960]  I don't have to protect that guy he didn't operate by the rules he didn't do what you're
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.040]  supposed to do in government I suspect he's worried about what the Congress will do if
[47:53.040 --> 48:01.160]  I were him I'd be worried about whether people in government stick a shiv in his back he's
[48:01.160 --> 48:02.160]  in trouble.
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.120]  There you go it was Phil Mide two years ago that said government's going to kill the
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.880]  president by those clips that start the broadcast president says there's an attempt to coup on
[48:11.880 --> 48:18.440]  him you have five senators in the last three years that have openly called up Ukraine and
[48:18.440 --> 48:25.800]  threatened to withhold money if they didn't do politically what they wanted and they've
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.440]  openly tried to get dirt on Trump from Ukraine which didn't exist but those are people that
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.560]  are under the US control so they'll do what they're told but still they couldn't dig
[48:34.560 --> 48:43.000]  any dirt up on Trump now they accuse Trump of what they themselves have done and say
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.160]  oh this whistleblower is coming forward but then it turns out that the whistleblower never
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.240]  heard this information and then it's not true so now they've moved on to a whole bunch of
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.520]  other whistleblowers not just about this phone call but phone calls to the Germans and phone
[48:57.520 --> 49:02.280]  calls to the Spanish and phone calls to the Russians and phone calls to the Swiss and
[49:02.280 --> 49:09.320]  phone calls to the Australians and phone calls to the Mexicans and phone calls to the Brazilians
[49:09.320 --> 49:14.600]  hoping if they get all the president's phone calls they can find something where Phil
[49:14.600 --> 49:19.920]  Mudd's phone calls where Nancy Pelosi's phone calls where Robert Mueller's phone calls where
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.600]  Hillary Clinton's phone calls where their emails oh they're all shredded or they're
[49:23.600 --> 49:31.600]  all bleached bit what I'm going to do is next hour I'm going to relaunch all this and I'm
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.840]  going to read the Marine Corps order on air and I'm going to go over it all and I I do
[49:35.840 --> 49:44.800]  want to specifically open the phones up for citizens veterans first-time callers specifically
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.800]  of what you think about this civil war we're in that we see in government with the global
[49:49.800 --> 49:52.960]  of centers trying to force out the nationalist interests that are trying to drain the swamp
[49:52.960 --> 49:59.200]  and we think about the president saying there's an active coup against him and that they're
[49:59.200 --> 50:06.400]  causing a civil war when they're using wars like they're using words like civil war and
[50:06.400 --> 50:11.720]  then they say oh that's the reason to remove him because he's saying there's a civil war
[50:11.720 --> 50:21.640]  these people have wound themselves up into a crazy position they've gone nuts and they're
[50:21.640 --> 50:27.160]  not going to stop pushing and that's why I told listeners in the last few weeks that
[50:27.160 --> 50:31.840]  I know their behavior and I've watched them closely and they intend to try to remove the
[50:31.840 --> 50:37.640]  president one way or another now by the end of the year because their corrupt networks
[50:37.640 --> 50:41.920]  are being smashed they're being dug out of their bureaucratic holes the president is
[50:41.920 --> 50:47.640]  now getting real reform in and is exposing their crimes and the big inspector general
[50:47.640 --> 50:54.320]  reports coming out within two weeks the indictment of McCabe is there so I cannot stress to everyone
[50:54.320 --> 51:00.200]  what a dangerous time not just for America but for the world this is that this is not
[51:00.200 --> 51:05.600]  just business as usual I have a few other clips I want to play just to set the table
[51:05.600 --> 51:12.440]  here for how crazy they are Joy Reed panel explains how Dems can make Pelosi president
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.520]  than Mad Maxine's has spineless Trump supporter GOP senators willing to harm the country this
[51:18.520 --> 51:29.680]  was all Friday days before that mad Maxine said that quote we played the clip prison
[51:29.680 --> 51:35.680]  is too good for him impeachment is too good for him he needs solitary confinement I mean
[51:35.680 --> 51:41.280]  you just heard Phil mud of the CIA say the president better be worried somebody's gonna
[51:41.280 --> 51:47.040]  stick a shiv oh we're so scared you use the prison term you know Phil mud never did the
[51:47.040 --> 51:51.560]  killing he just sent other you know people to kill folks for him and then after you go
[51:51.560 --> 52:00.360]  kill people for Phil mud you get set up put in prison I mean it's Obama that hung everybody
[52:00.360 --> 52:04.960]  out to dry it's Hillary that hangs everybody out to dry it's it's Obama targeted record
[52:04.960 --> 52:11.680]  numbers of whistleblowers and media and persecuted all these people Trump has done none of that
[52:11.680 --> 52:19.680]  but oh he's at war with the press well yeah he doesn't roll over to them this is a very
[52:19.680 --> 52:24.920]  very dangerous time and you see massive censorship intensifying now they're censoring Joe Rogan's
[52:24.920 --> 52:29.480]  podcast they're not gonna stop with anybody and that lets you know they've got the internet
[52:29.480 --> 52:34.200]  kill switch in place they've got the censorship in place they've got big tech ready to make
[52:34.200 --> 52:39.160]  their move they've been discrediting the president they've been discrediting his family the cabinet
[52:39.160 --> 52:49.160]  and all his supporters are getting sued threatened attacked harassed assessed this is the criminal
[52:49.160 --> 52:53.200]  group we let take over the country and then Trump got in and they're like whoa you're
[52:53.200 --> 52:58.160]  not doing that and all over the world populace are getting elected and the globalist are
[52:58.160 --> 53:04.880]  indicting them threatening them shooting them stabbing them a leader of Brazil almost died
[53:04.880 --> 53:11.960]  stab in the stomach because he's a populist trying to fix the nation what an incredible
[53:11.960 --> 53:19.360]  time to be alive here let's play this clip from MSNBC where they're talking about oh
[53:19.360 --> 53:24.400]  if you get rid of Trump and Pence then it's the speaker of the house and then we've got
[53:24.400 --> 53:28.920]  Pelosi and and of course I told you this years ago Hillary's always intending to run again
[53:28.920 --> 53:33.920]  she just knows she's unpopular doesn't want to announce the last minute and now it's all
[53:33.920 --> 53:41.160]  over the news that she's planning to run and that she's telling people she's going to run
[53:41.160 --> 53:45.760]  I told you there's a reported info wars dot com Hillary is already running for president
[53:45.760 --> 53:50.360]  of 2020 she just hasn't made the announcement yet breaking Hillary Clinton runs for president
[53:50.360 --> 53:55.360]  2020 presidential candidate preparing her second run against Trump but is already raising
[53:55.360 --> 54:02.320]  money already going around doing the polls and in the Las Vegas in London gambling schemes
[54:02.320 --> 54:06.200]  she's already the number one Democrat candidate and Bernie's had a heart attack he's still
[54:06.200 --> 54:09.640]  in the hospital Biden's raised less money than the other three candidates they're in
[54:09.640 --> 54:18.440]  front of him everybody knows Biden is just a placeholder Biden didn't know he was a placeholder
[54:18.440 --> 54:24.360]  this is the place we're in a power struggle and the elected president surrounded by cowards
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.080]  and traders making up stuff he never said when they get the transcripts of the NSA recordings
[54:29.080 --> 54:33.680]  because there's recordings to Trump didn't do any of this they don't care Trump knows
[54:33.680 --> 54:43.680]  he's surrounded he is dotting every eye crossing every day so here they are fantasizing about
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.480]  how they're gonna put Pelosi in as the president and they mean it and if we sit there and let
[54:48.480 --> 54:54.440]  them they'll do it no discussion of her corruption her son on the gas company no discussion of
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.960]  all the quid pro quo no discussion of all the failed wars no discussion of all the
[54:58.960 --> 55:03.120]  illegal spying no discussion of all the open borders no discussion of all the things they've
[55:03.120 --> 55:08.920]  done it's all how Trump's bad all this hysteria and everybody getting threatened that supports
[55:08.920 --> 55:16.800]  Trump hey you better get in line because when we take over you're dead if you don't if for
[55:16.800 --> 55:21.880]  instance Donald Trump I mean you know it's hard to imagine 20 Republicans having enough
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.160]  courage to vote to convict to be honest even if they were given you know multiple different
[55:26.160 --> 55:29.920]  counts where they could vote yes and someone no another it's very hard to imagine it but
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.520]  let's say that happened if Mike Pence were to become the head of state Mike Pence is
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.680]  as deeply involved as Donald Trump is so you really don't change anything if Mike Pence
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.840]  is in place and if all of the other people that were involved all of the conspirators
[55:41.840 --> 55:47.080]  remain in place and you still particularly have William Barr who is somebody who is completely
[55:47.080 --> 55:53.560]  now out of the realm of being the president of the public's lawyer and just acting as
[55:53.560 --> 55:58.680]  we just heard Elizabeth Holtzman say to deep six investigations against Trump and to raise
[55:58.680 --> 56:04.640]  investigations against his enemies how does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer
[56:04.640 --> 56:11.280]  at the top of this sort of you know web of corruption but Pence is then at the top of
[56:11.280 --> 56:18.000]  it well I think a couple things happen one the American voters will actually see and
[56:18.000 --> 56:24.200]  I remain sort of a Polly Anna that I believe facts ultimately matter and that in fact even
[56:24.200 --> 56:30.680]  20 Republican senators might come to their senses and say the country is at risk if I
[56:30.680 --> 56:36.400]  don't vote this way and the facts are clear and I think in this case we have very clear
[56:36.400 --> 56:42.640]  facts there is and Liz and I talked about this before the show you could impeach Pence
[56:42.640 --> 56:49.280]  first the problem is that Donald Trump then has to name his replacement but I think that
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.760]  maybe a deal could be struck where he was told if you don't make a replacement then
[56:54.760 --> 57:00.280]  Nancy Pelosi does become president and so you are going to be impeached and convicted
[57:00.280 --> 57:07.000]  you need to make this replacement so that the proper party contains remains in power
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.880]  so that's the plan terrorize everybody get control of the executive branch make the Republicans
[57:13.880 --> 57:17.920]  are all being threatened and intimidated by the removal of Trump roll over the Democrats
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.320]  then have their new Homeland Security to control of all 50 states elections which Obama signed
[57:22.320 --> 57:26.320]  executive order to do before he left and there's never a free election in this country again
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.000]  we become Venezuela and they send out all the thought police and all the rest of them
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  to start the arrest of conservative leaders that's the official Democrat plan so we're
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.680]  in the middle of their attempt to run this hot go and they've got former deputy CIA director
[57:39.680 --> 57:43.800]  saying they're going to stab the president in the back that's openly sitting the directives
[57:43.800 --> 57:52.680]  to murder the president the gauntlet has been thrown down every major Democrat candidate
[57:52.680 --> 57:58.200]  has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi auto firearms and now Buddha judge
[57:58.200 --> 58:04.440]  has come out and said that it's about political power that's why they want the guns well finally
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.400]  they're being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want so
[58:09.400 --> 58:14.000]  now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny it shows what incredible followers
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.160]  these people are the globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.600]  and they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position
[58:22.600 --> 58:27.800]  in that civil war but it's up to us to understand the big picture to carry the fight to the enemy
[58:27.800 --> 58:33.040]  and the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war that's our mission if

[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:24.680]  a report from miss khalik from being spooks to being spokespersons here it is after years
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:30.560]  in the shadows overseeing espionage kill programs warrantless wiretapping and trapping scyots
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:35.540]  and other covert operations national security establishment retirees are turning to a new
[1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:39.880]  line of work where they can carry out their imperial duties that is propagandizing the
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.360]  public on cable news reborn as cable news pundits these people are cashing in so many
[1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:50.400]  years working in the dark only to emerge in the studio lights of the same networks that
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:55.760]  rail all day every day against state tv from countries america hates i'm talking about people
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:02.360]  like former cia director john brennan who is now an nbc news senior national security
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:09.080]  and intelligence analyst ah yes john brennan a serial liar who has the nation's top spy
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:14.120]  defended torture and lied about u.s. drone strikes killing civilians in a drone program
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:20.040]  he helped architect now he gets to spew his talking points unchallenged on nbc nbc isn't
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:25.080]  alone in hiring former spooks as pundits almost every network has hired former national security
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:31.560]  people to fill its 24-hour news coverage i'm looking at ucbs fran pounzen is a former homeland
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:36.520]  security advisor to president dorge jubby bush he's now a cbs news senior national security
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:42.280]  analyst but cnn takes the cake it's the biggest spook show of all joining us now former director
[1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:46.920]  of national intelligence jim clapper is now a cnn national security analyst retired general
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:52.280]  michael hayden former director of the cia and the nsa the national security agencies the cnn
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:58.360]  national security analyst cnn legal analyst asha ringgapa is a former fbi special agent
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:04.040]  james galliano is a cnn law enforcement analyst and a retired fbi supervisory special agent
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:08.840]  i good to see you joining us now is cnn global affairs analyst and former deputy secretary
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:13.960]  of state tony blinkin blinkin is also former deputy national security advisor and that's why
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:19.160]  oh there's more seriously join me now cnn national security commentator former chair
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.160]  of the house intelligence committee mic rogers we now is samantha vinnagrad who was a senior
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:27.960]  advisor to the national security advisor under president obama and she's a cnn national security
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:32.600]  analyst cnn national security analyst steven hall he's the retired cia chief of russia operations
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:37.640]  joining me now is cnn counterterrorism analyst philip mud a former cia counterterrorism official
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:43.000]  of course this isn't cnn's first dance with the devil back in 1999 during the bombing of kosovo
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:49.960]  cnn let military propaganda experts work out of its newsroom so why is this so bad by hiring
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:54.760]  former spooks these outlets are allowing them to shape their news with constant and at times
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:03:00.120]  willful disinformation that's never challenged or corrected it might as well be state tv it's
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:06.120]  why cnn screens are filled with an endless parade of belligerent war hawks fear mongering the public
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:11.160]  about america's adversaries oftentimes these are the same people that helped lie us into wars when
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:16.360]  they were working for the government it is completely corrupted journalism the whole point
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:21.720]  of what we were supposed to learn from the debacle of wmd is in the iraq war which by the way this
[1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:26.520]  network that we're on was one of the leaders of was the fact that we were not supposed to trust
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:34.040]  intelligence agencies when they say things without evidence and not only did msnbc and cnn use those
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:41.240]  people as their sources they hired them as their news analyst so if you turn on cnn or msnbc it was
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:47.880]  basically state tv it was cia tv these so-called analysts are forever loyal to their former employers
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:54.600]  whether it be the cia fbi nsa dhs or any of the other agencies that make up america's so-called
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:59.320]  intelligence community after they retire they go on to shape the news propagandizing for the
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:05.000]  abusive national security state they spent their careers working for and they're never ever challenged
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.480]  by their corporate media colleagues because they spent so many years inside the security state
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:14.600]  their instinct will always be to defend it no matter its abuses and they often have contracts
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:19.400]  with foreign governments and various security companies that benefit from whatever talking
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:23.720]  points they're spouting to the american public and don't even get me started on the retired
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:29.080]  generals turned war pundits whose connections to weapons contractors are never disclosed imagine
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:34.200]  if these networks hired former oil executives as climate change analysts this whole cia media
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:40.120]  revolving door is just as absurd it's propaganda under the cover of expertise it's scandalous
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:45.960]  it's polluting journalism and it allows career spies to abuse our airwaves to disseminate self
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:56.040]  serving disinformation and pro-war hysteria welcome to the spook show
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:05:03.080]  my friends i've seen a lot of donald trump just like you have and my goodness yesterday's press
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:08.760]  conference when they came in on him with all their garbage the foreign reporters the u.s reporters
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:14.600]  these little political sellouts these whores he just tore them to bits and it's one thing to hear
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:20.040]  it if your radio is there it's powerful but if you see it it's all at band dot video you've got
[1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:25.640]  the full press conference we've got my boil down of how epic it is it's all about video and i just
[1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:31.320]  you've got to share this with people because trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders this was amazing
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:36.600]  and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it so in full wars america trump all of us incredible
[1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:42.280]  things are happening and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band dot
[1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:47.800]  video and i gotta tell you we've done great video work we've done great films we've done so much
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:52.840]  but websites are not our thing well now they are i'm so proud of band on video folks check it out
[1:05:52.840 --> 1:06:03.240]  there's a lot of new features band on video you are listening to an info wars dot com front line
[1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:10.840]  report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance extremism and defense of
[1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:21.400]  liberty is no vice all right ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna be completely honest with you just so
[1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:26.520]  you can get in your own mind just how serious i believe all this is and i've proven that i got
[1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:30.680]  a pretty good political sense of what's going on in a world of people trying to whitewash what's
[1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:34.520]  happening i haven't saw the austrian-american statesman when i've been looking just the other
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:41.480]  day in the paper was you know uh the whole country is now in alex jones's wheelhouse talking about
[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:48.600]  civil war martial law coups well it's not that the country's in my wheelhouse i've been aware of
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:57.400]  what's going on below the surface for a long time and about the different power structures that are
[1:06:57.400 --> 1:07:05.160]  battling for control of the united states because the united states pretty much runs the world
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:12.120]  and so the united states goes bad the world goes bad i mean china's super evil russia's got massive
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:17.320]  corruption problems and can't hardly take care of itself the united states has been in that prime
[1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:23.640]  position to really help lead the world with soft power instead we've been taken over by multinational
[1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:30.440]  corporations and others and have been demoralized culturally and politically so we can be controlled
[1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:36.520]  and that's not my opinion that's in the wiki leaks hillary talking to professors of psychology
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:45.640]  and media about increasing cultural division to control us it's so evil and if you turn on any
[1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:51.400]  movie or any show most of which are funded by the chinese communist it's totally anti-american
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:59.000]  garbage anti-family anti god anti christ when i say anti christ i don't even mean that in the
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:05.640]  biblical way i mean it in the biblical way isn't that funny not from a christian perspective it's
[1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:14.440]  they are anti christ they are the opposite of christlike and it just is it's it's it's not even
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:19.480]  like the bible claims it it's now in your face they keep babies alive and they sell their organs
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:23.560]  bernie sandras says kill babies in the third world to save the earth
[1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:31.800]  because he's a liberal it's okay to say kill brown babies i mean these people are unbelievable
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:37.160]  though we've got to really be careful as nici said you stare into the abyss too long you become
[1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:45.480]  the abyss i have been on air 25 years and i don't have stage fright i don't have a problem
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:50.600]  get on on air i do a lot of preparation for the shows and i've never really been nervous or had
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:59.960]  problems doing the shows every day i can almost not do the show anymore and it's not from pressure
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:07.880]  in life or what i'm gonna do on air it's like these issues are so real so huge it feels surreal
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:15.000]  to be on air being a major leader fighting this and then watching everybody else go around
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:21.320]  their business like it's normal to to tune in to see an nrms nbc randomly and they're like we need
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:27.400]  to arrest and kill the president and then they make up a bunch of lies because i'm informed i know
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:32.920]  they're lying and to watch brian stelter say a huge lie and then look at the camera like a like a
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:38.040]  cat with a canary cotton its mouth looking totally guilty just saying these huge whoppers
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:47.640]  and then to watch them threaten everybody i mean here's another big frustration of mine
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:54.200]  i know a lot of stuff behind the scenes that i'm not at liberty to say from where i got it
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:58.840]  or what they told me i'm just told information to incorporate it into what i'm doing and the
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:03.320]  people that have told me stuff over the years have been proven to be very smart and very accurate and
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:12.360]  and to know this country is really fighting for its life against really bad people that if they
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:21.640]  get full control are going to break the economy trigger major uprisings to finally sink the nation
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:27.960]  and then come back in and loot it later and it's going to be horrible fascism with a leftist
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:34.600]  management system extracting all the wealth taking it offshore i mean if you think america
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:40.040]  has been screwed over so far that was just the initial phases of getting us domesticated while
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:47.800]  they sold out what they could they are going to take everything you've got in an existential gang
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:58.200]  raping of this country the globalists have a lot of old scores to settle a lot of dominance that they
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:05.640]  want to carry out because if they can hog tie like a billy goat and rape this country publicly
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:09.800]  they will have a feather in their head nobody's ever gotten a stick in their head and that's what
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:25.320]  this is really all about so i'm just going to tell you something here's another problem about all this
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:31.000]  i have a great crew they're awesome folks if i would have gotten up here at 8am this morning
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:39.720]  and nothing but send them clips i wouldn't have half the clips together i wanted
[1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:44.040]  i mean there's the clips where they said we're going to remove the president
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:51.320]  outside of an impeachment extra judicially that's been on cnn that's an important clip
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:54.600]  i'll have it for you tomorrow i never even got around to tell them the crew to get it
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:59.320]  or i could play all the other clips for democrats say they're going to kill the president or kill
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:05.240]  his family or or how they're going to target all his grassroots supporters and quote level us
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:12.680]  and destroy us so we can never rise against them again these are quotes i already played a bunch
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:17.800]  of them today but when you've got a cacophony of these people saying it
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:24.920]  you just have to sit back and really say to yourself
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:32.840]  they're saying they want to take over and destroy us because we're just good decent people
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:38.680]  and won't accept their corruption that means that we're going to have to take over
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:45.400]  and deal with them because they're never going away they're never stopping they're coming for
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.560]  your kids they're coming for your guns they're coming for your property they're coming for your
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:57.720]  birthright they are entitled worst of the worst globalist hired multi-generationally
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:03.960]  by multinational corporations the chai comms and others because they fundamentally hate america
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:09.960]  and hate god and really are just bad people and it's all evidenced by the terrible things they do
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:15.640]  the lies they tell how they control propaganda worldwide and a normalizing pedophilia trying
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:20.520]  to break up the family trying to i mean it just came out with a big major italian
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:30.360]  genetic engineer facility just did test of the major vaccines and they've all got a mutated full
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:37.000]  human genome that isn't even from a human it's been made in a lab put in them with 500 and something
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:44.840]  cancer genes added to it carried by viruses into your cells show that your body then replicates
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:51.720]  a mutant humanoid and basically gives you cancer but it's worse than that before it gives you cancer
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  it goes into your testicles and mutates the sperm to carry all of the cancer genetics 500 plus cancer
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:07.480]  genes into the new baby when it meets the egg informs the zygote and i didn't just believe
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:11.000]  mike adam's report even though he's a smart engineer i went and read the reports out of idli
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:16.840]  i went and looked at the test and i already knew this was going on but my god these people are
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:23.880]  evil the folks running things have done it through compartmentalization so it's very small groups and
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:30.040]  it's very sophisticated weapons that who's going to be able to get in there with these new crisper
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:37.400]  systems and go in and then scan it and and be able to discover and this major lab in idli did it
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:44.360]  it and so in the m mr shot in the hepatitis shots in basically all the big shots you're getting
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:51.560]  there's a full human genome of a whole it's a man of a man but it's not human it's humanoid it's
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:57.800]  all of its mutated every gene is mutated and it's got 500 plus cancer traits added to it
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:07.560]  and then it's carried by viruses as 560 cancer genes abnormal dna genetic modification a potentially
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:13.080]  hazardous genes the whole thing's been mutated yet mandated to be injected into every child i mean
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:24.200]  what in the hell is going on here i mean this is beyond anything in the science fiction movie
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:29.720]  and see the globals don't want us to break into the highest levels of the black state the dark state
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:35.720]  the black budget project they don't want us to find out what else is going on but private labs are
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:42.360]  able to scan this now and are finding these bio weapon engineered systems to mutate the human
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:49.640]  species a new humanoid is being injected into you in quote gene therapy to create the new person
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:58.920]  and it's a cancer-ridden psychotic you know i'm angry because i'm not just going to sit here
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:04.200]  and take this scientific dictatorship that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines it's
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:07.960]  putting fluoride in the water to brain damages and then it's trying to literally destroy our
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:13.560]  families and organize us into a bunch of dumb down slaves so they can then carry out or orderly
[1:16:13.560 --> 1:16:19.560]  extermination i'm not putting up with it and our information our truth is devastating to the scumbag

[1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:27.720]  then i'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m central david night will be back 8 a.m central
[1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:35.480]  another show's come on after my broadcast but we've just joined us again this is the alex
[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:43.800]  jones show on sunday you have to understand that the president says that we're in the middle of a
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:50.360]  cold civil war and that they're trying to invoke a form of extrajudicial martial law to remove the
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:56.680]  president and that this is an illegal coup now that is exactly what it is we are at the point where
[1:20:56.680 --> 1:21:00.440]  they are reading fake transcripts the president never said or wrote
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:14.040]  in this house intelligence committee chambers they're doing the same tactic when i tuned in
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:21.800]  to cnn and msnbc this week and then they were doing the same tactic on comedy central and on
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:30.360]  saturday night live on mbc now obviously you know that's a joke but it's creating
[1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:39.560]  this whole illusion it's a war on reality and they're saying we're going to force a deal with
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:45.640]  the republicans that they'll all go to jail if they don't remove trump and put in
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:52.840]  in hello see do you want me to play msnbc cnn they're all saying
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:00.440]  three articles were on info wars dot com this weekend with cnn msnbc
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:07.320]  and one of the sunday morning shows i forget which one all saying well what will happen when
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:14.360]  trump's removed one way or another people like oh well you know they don't have the votes in the
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:21.000]  senate they're going to continue to threaten people and their families until they think they
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.360]  get the votes or they're going to try a 22nd amendment move saying the president is mentally
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:34.040]  unfit they're already saying that and the urgency of this is so serious that you didn't hear the
[1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:39.560]  president the last few times they tried to remove him say this is a coup this is an attempt at civil
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:47.880]  war this time they really mean it and they're really trying to do it because they know that
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:52.440]  bernie's had a heart attack biden's obviously had a stroke and can't talk three candidates ahead
[1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:56.120]  of him have made more money than he has the democrats have raised less than half the money
[1:22:56.120 --> 1:23:01.320]  they did last time around in a presidential election this far in the wheels are coming off
[1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:05.960]  everyone's turning against them everyone's fleeing their cities all the dead people voting
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:09.880]  isn't getting them elected the election fraud they're involved in is coming out
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:13.880]  trump is exposing the clinton's and child trafficking that was in the news friday
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:19.720]  they're exposing all the corruption in romania and hungry and ukraine with the clinton's and
[1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:26.840]  obama's looting and so the whole deep state is scared and it's making its move and you watch
[1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:30.040]  inspector general reports coming out
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:37.160]  the democrats have been told back down stop it stop trying to sabotage the economy have a real
[1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:43.640]  election and we'll leave you alone the democrats aren't stopping so bar is there if they won't back
[1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:51.880]  down and make a deal to go forward with the indictments and the democrats have said we're
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:56.680]  playing a game of chicken we're not turning off and trumps not turning off so you got the two
[1:23:56.680 --> 1:24:01.000]  vehicles coming at each other they're both going 180 miles an hour
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:08.520]  and that's where we are so i can sit here with a headline about hey trump just called up the
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:16.040]  marine corps reserves for a national emergency within the united states which will come a
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.320]  little warning in threats to the homeland those are quotes
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:27.960]  and folks that know have read the order it's unprecedented i've read previous orders that
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:31.480]  they do every year in case the marines are needed to go under the civil authority
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.360]  that's all in there but there's a bunch of new language in there
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.440]  about emergency that comes with little warning threats in the homeland
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:52.200]  threats are not things like hurricanes threats are attacks so whether this is 100 for that or
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:57.000]  not doesn't matter because the president already says there's an ongoing coup and we're in an
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.320]  emergency it's a whole free number to join us i want you to get your specific take on this
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:05.160]  where you think this is going what we can do to legally and lawfully stop this from happening
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:10.920]  but what do we do is the big question if they kill trump what do we do if they get the internet
[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:16.280]  kill switch which they admit obama put in where they can route all websites coming to the us through
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:21.960]  one government website or group of sites they've already set that up to quote trusted media they've
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:27.000]  got all this set up when trump got through on them they weren't ready yet they've been building and
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.160]  getting ready and getting the censorship in place and getting all the controls in place
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:33.880]  so they can try to take him out they think they're ready
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:41.320]  and so they're attempting to make their move what are we going to do about it eight seven seven
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:45.160]  seven eight nine two five three nine is the number to call eight seven seven seven eight nine
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:51.640]  alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine and tomorrow i'm gonna open the phones
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:55.880]  up for people that think trump should be removed and think we should all be locked up in prison
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:59.800]  i'm gonna do that during the week they show tomorrow because there are a lot of people
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:04.200]  all over the news saying do that think about their rhetoric kill trump put him in solitary
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:10.040]  environment stabbing that's being said by not just pundits but former deputy directors of the cia
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:10.760]  like phil mud
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:22.040]  he said it again friday somebody's gonna stab him in the back like caesar he better watch out
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:29.480]  and he's up there all hyped up angry red face somebody's gonna stab the president in the back
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:35.720]  i'll tell you in any other time if george washington was president and somebody that
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:42.120]  had run covert operations killing people you know washington signed death warrants said we're
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:46.760]  gonna stab the president in the back washington would write a letter he'd hand it to the army and
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:53.240]  he'd say take him out and that guy would be either running for his life or dead within 24 hours i
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:59.480]  don't wish any harm against phil mud he's a little globalist wimp turd but he's up there for one
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:04.520]  reason to create the illusion of confidence well we got seven ways of setting to get the president
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:08.600]  oh we're taking him out oh he's a traitor oh he's an idiot oh he's a piece of crap oh we're gonna
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:13.320]  kill him oh we're gonna stab him in the back oh trump's the enemy you know all these agencies
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:18.600]  are gonna get him come on agencies get him come on agencies kill the president phil mud isn't gonna
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:24.840]  kill anybody he wants to get you to go kill him he wants to get enough people ready to do it so
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:30.680]  when somebody gives the order to shoot the president's vehicle in any tank missile the order's taken
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:38.040]  let me assure all of you people trying to gear a coup up if you physically remove the president
[1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:43.160]  but you know they're gonna kill him or they might just electroshock therapy him a bunch
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:46.920]  they didn't know who he is and say oh he had a stroke or whatever that's another way they do it
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:55.000]  that's a hushing mubarak if they do that you have released forces you will never contain again
[1:27:56.280 --> 1:28:01.080]  i just to guarantee i'm not talking about from me i just know history nothing's worked you are
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:07.960]  you are going to be just annihilated i guarantee you all these people shooting their mouths off
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:13.320]  and calling for violence within a few weeks of this happening almost all of them will be dead
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.280]  and whatever group comes in it won't be the group that thinks it's about to get power the first
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:24.840]  thing the new group's gonna do is kill all the people that behave like this and acted like this
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:29.560]  and then open the drawbridge that's always done by fascist communists by ancient rulers it's a
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:35.640]  it's guaranteed you overthrow an elected due government of good people your traders like that
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:40.920]  you don't worry about alex jones coming after you're dead the globalists are gonna kill all of you
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:46.520]  you're such idiots you're throwing out the hedge of protection and due process this country had
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:50.760]  your fools you think there's just one more third world country you're overthrowing you're really
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:29:00.600]  doing is overthrowing yourselves the gauntlet has been thrown down every major democrat candidate
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:06.600]  has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms and now buddha judge has come
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:12.680]  out and said that it's about political power that's why they want the guns well finally they're
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:17.880]  being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want so now they're just
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:22.920]  trying to normalize all this tyranny it shows what incredible followers these people are the
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:27.560]  globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war and they know that the minions
[1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:32.680]  trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war but it's up to
[1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:37.640]  us that understand the big picture to carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before

[1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:13.720]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:13.720 --> 1:33:20.440]  baby i'm gonna teach you what it loves all about tonight all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:25.640]  if you just joined us us marine reserve units activated for emergency within the united states
[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:31.240]  close quote which will come at any to little warning sites threats in the homeland
[1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:39.240]  and it talks about helping the civilian authorities and under the command of the president
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:45.240]  so what does that sound like well the president says that there's a coup moving forward against
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:49.560]  even there certainly is by a pack of criminals that have sold this nation out and are pissed that
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:52.360]  they thought they had the country down forever and now they realize they don't
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:58.600]  but if you look at all the other things they're doing and the things that they're engaged in
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:03.880]  i really have a lot of mixed feelings i mean we're fighting we're taking the country back a lot
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:08.440]  of good things have happened but it also makes you really sad to know that we've had this
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:12.840]  bigger group of criminals in control bipartisanly for so long that
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:19.000]  they really think they can remove the duly elected president they really think they can shut down
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:25.960]  talk radio and shut down popular internet shows and censor all the the the nationalist
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.560]  i mean you look at the project veritas documents in the videos and it's the google and twitter and
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:36.520]  facebook employees how much they hate america and how they ban people that like american flags and
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:42.680]  how much they hate trump and hate alex jones and how they shadow ban everybody and how they're not
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:49.720]  going to let president trump win again and that was two three years ago and then now here we are
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:54.440]  they really think they can get away with this and they've got the censorship in place
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:34:58.840]  but they don't have the marine corps they don't have the military
[1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:05.640]  they have groups of people inside the bureaucracy who are still operating for the bad guys but
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:11.240]  that's the split inside the government right now so we're in a civil war in this nation
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:14.760]  between the bureaucracy that's pro america and the bureaucracy that's anti-american
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:21.000]  and the media is held by the globalists that are anti-american and is trying to make those of us
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:26.120]  that are patriotic and have common sense the bad guys it's not working so now they're moving
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:30.520]  forward to remove the president outside of impeachment and they're saying it all over the news
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:37.240]  and brennan and clopper are saying we're going to remove trump without impeachment
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:43.640]  well how are you going to do that well they've shed on msnbc on joy reed well we're going to
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:48.600]  do it by threatening other republicans and making a deal with them that they won't all go to president
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:56.200]  if they put polosi in that's the wild eye we won't send you on the president if you if you put polosi
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:02.920]  in they're a group of terrorists they're a group of mad dogs no borders no wall no usa at all they've
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:09.960]  gotten away with so much that they think they can do this right now so i'm going to take your calls
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:19.080]  jared kenneth chase cadwick benjamin and others on this live global sunday broadcast and we were
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:23.720]  supposed to be off the air by now we were supposed to not be here where they did all this you know
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:28.040]  it was big independent media that blew the whistle on polosi and her daughter trying to not seat
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:35.720]  trump as the president trying to have the delegates not put him in in 2017 and then they
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:39.400]  tried to remove him all those other ways they tried to get in impeachment started then they tried to
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:44.040]  find russia gate evidence they tried to test having women come out and say trump had assaulted them
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:48.360]  on cabinaw that blew up in their face so they said the coveted kids assaulted and did bad things
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  that didn't work they had jesse schmollett and hundreds of other events they've been caught in
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:56.920]  everything they do turns to crap so now they say it's time to kill the president and they have
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:05.320]  all these famous powerful people in government come out and say it to legitimize it and they say
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:09.880]  don't let trump supporters have dinner go to their houses don't let them get gassed don't let them
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:16.360]  go to the grocery store get in their faces now they're saying go to their houses attack them
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:25.000]  and they're saying if you don't want to go to prison i played it last hour it's on info wars.com
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:31.800]  and news wars.com joy reed show fantasizes they're not fantasizing folks they mean it to get the
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.520]  rid of the president they say if you don't want to go to prison run up the white flag they can't
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:41.320]  intimidate trump they can't make him back down they tried to demonetize all the conservatives
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:45.400]  three years ago when trump won that didn't work then they tried to censor everybody that didn't
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:49.960]  work so then they banned everybody now they're taking nra members bank accounts away merchant
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:58.040]  accounts away everyone's congress people and now they're saying you do what we say or we're gonna
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:07.080]  hurt you well i'm not gonna start any fights but these slime bags are crazy enough to come to
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:11.640]  everybody's houses they've been planning it they've been preparing it so let me tell everybody
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:15.960]  something they killed trump you better know if you're tucker carlsson your alex shones your
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:27.880]  sean hannity your matt drudge your congressman newness congressman jordan
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:39.640]  you're one of those type people they're coming after you and you get ready in fact i would i
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:44.760]  would suspect when they move on trump they're gonna move directly on a couple hundred people
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:52.920]  simultaneously and then they'll go down the phases and everybody can decide at that point
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:56.520]  what they want to do you want to try to get on airplane get out of here now that's not gonna
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:03.080]  work out no y'all can do that already no i don't think you are because these people never expect
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:08.680]  to get hit back and that's the point they're talking about putting us in jail torturing us
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:12.840]  killing everybody you know we're they're up there trying to organize this you know so we're just
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:20.360]  saying oh really okay because see if you thought a few spaces ahead you think alamoing trump is
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:28.360]  going to make people hate him instant invincibility the dead trump is a thousand times more powerful
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:35.240]  than the living one in fact if i wanted to destroy you globalist once and for all i'd do exactly what
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:40.360]  you're doing but you are little handmaidens of satan and god uses satan to carry out his larger
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:46.680]  plan satan doesn't take orders from god just got made satan knowing what satan would do satans are
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:52.520]  testers so it's just my job to lay out the facts and then people can decide which side they're on
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:58.600]  i just think you're a bunch of fools all right let's take phone calls let's talk to chadwick
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:03.800]  in utah chadwick thanks for holding them we're gonna ryan and others welcome chadwick hey thanks
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:10.200]  alex first-time caller long-time listener you actually uh i tripped over you in 2011 on youtube
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:16.520]  you woke me up i was uh at the front language institute learning persian farsi so well god
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:20.920]  bless you sir what's your view on this crazy time we're in the we're in a civil war the president
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:28.360]  says there's a coup going on i mean we're here we are here and uh you're the reason i mean you
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:35.000]  motivated me to take action politically and legally and lawfully knowing that the if the
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.160]  hospital or comes all of us military veterans um and i talked to a lot of them you know i i i run
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:47.400]  the veterans talk it's your new talk for the republican party and we're ready and uh i think
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:51.880]  we're at this point where we need to i remember stewart rhodes talking about how he wanted citizens
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:57.880]  to organize into like you know small a teams um sort of in a proper way i think all military
[1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:03.640]  veterans need to be doing that um you know going from a low ready to a high ready in terms of
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:08.280]  getting ready to assist the president and the marines and any sort of uh
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:15.160]  you know hope and faction locally where we're all at i mean i think let me ask you this question
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:20.840]  why do you think the the globalist funded left is so secure i mean they are literally running
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:24.360]  around a fireworks factory with a flamethrower right now i mean they are out of their minds
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:32.440]  yeah because they know their time is short and uh you know if they're gonna go down i mean they're
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:35.800]  gonna go down no matter what so i think they're gonna make a move they have to they've got no
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:40.760]  choice they can't let this exactly so so they've already started a bunch of stuff though i just
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:46.440]  wish the president would just be honest about this and declare an emergency and and just grab a
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:50.200]  couple hundred of these people and indict them and the whole problem you could grab 10 of them
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:54.040]  and they would all turn tell and run i just don't know why we're playing this game of
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:59.000]  chicken right to the moment they bust a cap in the president maybe i mean obviously he's been
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.360]  trying to he's been trying to walk that tight rope of not playing into their false narrative of
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:09.080]  looking like a fascist looking like a dictator because like you said they've projected everything
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:15.240]  they've done on him right and so they've accused him of being you know the unlawfully
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:19.320]  elected leader you know they've accused him of being a dictator and all these things and so
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:25.480]  obviously we all understand that are constitutionalist all of us uh oathkeepers we understand it's
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:30.440]  actually the president's job to go execute all these people post exactly let me ask you this

[1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:10.360]  above the law that doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:15.640]  it's communist and socialist power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore
[1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:21.320]  well trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:26.280]  countries and cultures just so you can say the communist chinese the david rockefeller put in
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:33.240]  power are better than everybody that is a sick freakish joke and i will not stand by and watch
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:39.080]  humanity turn over to these people and i beg god for the strength and the will to have the discernment
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:44.440]  to help be part of their defeat and i've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and god is
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:51.000]  delivering because god is great thank god for his son jesus christ and now let's move forward against
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:47:11.480]  the nw you're listening to the alex jones show live from the info wars dot com studios you're
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:23.960]  listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:33.480]  well i gotta tell you ladies and gentlemen this is one hell of a time to be alive look at this
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:38.280]  many of these calls i can tomorrow i'm just gonna clear the decks and just take calls i really am
[1:47:38.280 --> 1:47:43.240]  i'm gonna come in here because folks they're openly saying marshal law they're openly saying kill
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:47.560]  the president go after his supporters are openly saying all of this the president says there's a
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:55.400]  coup happening it is by a bunch of globalist criminals and you just got to ask yourself
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:01.800]  what do we do to stop this i mean that's really the frustration here is that you look at the
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:06.280]  rhetoric of the globalists and their minions they hate america they hate the already born
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:12.280]  children they're just bad and they've shown who they are and put their war face on and say we're
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:17.400]  getting your president we're killing and we're gonna kill you if you don't get on board well
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:23.000]  i'm sure it's all not gonna bow to that like i have no fear of these people i have fear that i'm not
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:27.720]  working hard enough to beat them before this disintegrates into whatever's about to happen
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:33.160]  let me tell you most of the people lined up wanting all this this big fight they're looking for
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:39.000]  because they never been in a fight in their life and the veterans are awake folks that's all i can
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:48.120]  say let's go to uh let's go to so many here to talk to let's go to michael and houston michael
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:53.960]  you're on the air thanks for holding hey michael hey michael welcome sir
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:49:02.280]  how are you this is uh michael uh out of houston so there's there's two ways to restore the republic
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.480]  the first way is through the courts and the second way is the way that it appears trump
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:15.400]  is finally taking action which is through the military and doesn't do it uh it's not going to
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:23.800]  be good either polosi's gonna come in or hillary's gonna come in if they complete the coup and there's
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:30.360]  a few things there's a few ways it can play out and if we all know through the courts it's not
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:36.440]  gonna work the courts are corrupted the lawyers are all corrupt the judges are all paid for they
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:45.160]  all got skeletons in the closet there's there's no way to possibly restore the republic back to
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:51.160]  its original intent through the courts and so if trump has the military like you say here in this
[1:49:51.160 --> 1:50:00.680]  report and i read up on it too they bring in the military and start taking out some of these people
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:06.840]  that are trying to complete this coup it it can really make a difference and it could really
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:15.560]  set the set these people back well i know this i mean i mean the criminals up there phil mud former
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:22.760]  deputy director of the cia uh for quote anti-terrorism direct action that's going and killing people he
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:28.520]  didn't do it he would order it little bureaucrat that guy saying kill the president and stab him in
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:34.440]  the back and you know slobbering on tv i mean it that's obscene no but no other country would put
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:40.360]  up with that that guy would be in big trouble but again they're just up there roaring and screaming
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:44.760]  and yelling and calling for war with us and how they're gonna torture us and how they're gonna
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:50.520]  put us in prison and we better submit to them it's just the tolerance of this country has
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:56.200]  has put it in a very bad position god bless you i appreciate your call sir okay uh let's go ahead
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:51:02.440]  and take a call from chase in california chase what do you make of all this hey thanks for taking
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:08.360]  my call alex just takes a long time welcome go ahead i was yeah i was watching uh meet the press
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:12.200]  i don't like watching it but i do it because i gotta make sure i know what the enemy is planning
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:16.760]  and exactly like like what you're talking about today john brennan was on there talking to old
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:22.680]  chuck todd sleepy eyed chuck todd and john brennan was acting like the con man he has to act confident
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:26.920]  because he's so nervous but i want to bring up something that was a little more concerning
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:33.800]  chuck todd he brought up these uh statistics he said 40 of america is getting false information
[1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:40.040]  and 60 is getting reality from us and can we actually govern ourselves as a nation still
[1:51:40.040 --> 1:51:45.960]  and when you think about that question asking a propagandist to one another we really have to
[1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:51.320]  take a step back and realize we need to get information from alex jones from our own sources
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:56.840]  from the resistance 1776 on info wars on youtube there's a lot of places where you can get your
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:01.560]  information and make your own decisions not just from the propaganda from john brennan
[1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:06.600]  and chuck todd and everyone at george stephanopoulos those are the ones giving you the false
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:11.720]  information america wake up thank oh i think america knows that now thank you for the call
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:18.760]  great points oh yeah they blow up on cnn on abc on mbc whenever republican senators
[1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:24.120]  or republican house members bring up the corruption and of of of biden or any of these people they
[1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:28.440]  go how dare you that's not true that's all this is about it's all about how trump's bad because
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:33.720]  he's stopping their gravy train let's continue here with bob in pennsylvania you're on the
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:40.840]  air bob thanks for calling hey alex the uh call up of the marine reserve is really important
[1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:45.000]  because they're tasked with protecting the president the army navy air force protect the
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:51.880]  country marines protect the president um and i think it's in response to the un troop movements
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:57.160]  that are being reported by the truckers in the midwestern states of indiana now there's a lot
[1:52:57.160 --> 1:53:03.720]  of un troops on the highways that have been living in the fema camps that uh the former president
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:10.600]  authorized i believe it was december 16th right before he left office now um by the way obama
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:16.280]  did create stay behind networks billions of dollars put all these new subgroups into agencies
[1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:20.520]  that trump's trying to shut down right now another reason they're pissed they left stay behind
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:26.440]  governments and they said we want the un to come in and occupy the us and our borders and the un a
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:31.800]  few months ago said they agree and are ready to do that so we have treaties and shadow agreements
[1:53:31.800 --> 1:53:37.160]  there really are a lot of foreign troops uh and un troops here uh even uh as you said at the old
[1:53:37.160 --> 1:53:42.600]  fema centers and the rest of it that's really true and remember when before obama left uh his his
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:49.240]  attorney general loretta lynch said we need local cities to bring the un in to replace the police
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:55.000]  in a quote smart cities initiative so this all sounds crazy but this is really going on remember
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:00.680]  beto and others file complaints with the un over trump and the border remember that yes sir
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:09.560]  yes sir um your first caller mentioned um the x military uh perhaps getting together they are
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:16.120]  already organizing and if you will get in contact with his former uh comrades in arms i'm sure some
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:22.360]  of them are organizing a couple things our president needs to do um he has to take his case
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:29.080]  the american people on tv um i think time that with accelerating attorney general bars indictments
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:36.840]  and maybe call for a multimillion man bar in dc you know i think all that's great the indictments
[1:54:36.840 --> 1:54:40.920]  need to be accelerated the crimes are all out in the open as soon as they start taking down some of
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:45.560]  these crooks that'll bring the whole system down but those crooks are threatening the rest of the
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:49.880]  system that if they go down they're going to go down that's why the system's so scared because
[1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:54.520]  trump is forcing this confrontation because the clinton's and others never back down so
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:59.960]  trump can't back down because they never back down i appreciate your call great point sir thank you
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:05.640]  take some more here let's go ahead and talk to demetrius in illinois demetrius thanks for
