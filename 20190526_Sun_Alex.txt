[00:00.000 --> 00:21.160]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:21.160 --> 00:32.800]  well by European Union law which the EU dictatorship ignores constantly they were supposed to release
[00:32.800 --> 00:42.560]  the election results polls opened on Thursday and ran through today tonight at 2100 Greenwich
[00:42.560 --> 00:48.520]  meantime but as of five minutes ago before I went live they have headlines saying here are
[00:48.520 --> 00:56.560]  the election results but they don't show the election results and that is very very unusual
[00:56.560 --> 01:02.440]  you know they've got some exit polling and things like that we're going to be watching that ball as
[01:02.440 --> 01:09.240]  it unfolds coming up here because it's another big referendum against globalism they don't have
[01:09.240 --> 01:13.280]  clean sweeps in Europe with parliamentary systems because they stagger it kind of like the House
[01:13.280 --> 01:19.400]  representatives is staggered we're only part of it is up for election every two years same thing
[01:19.400 --> 01:26.560]  with the Senate but in their system it'll take two or three more elections to ever fully vote the
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.680]  European Union tyrants out but exit polls and numbers show they are losing big time the globalist
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.960]  are losing big time and it brings it is successful the EU was done Theresa May obviously already
[01:37.960 --> 01:44.720]  resigned on Thursday French far right beats Macron in EU election that's right she beat him
[01:44.720 --> 01:52.560]  that is Marie Le Pen who's like basically Ron Paul or Alex Jones or Matt Drudge or Tucker Carlson
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.520]  she's not extreme right wing she's just a populist their dad's a famous war hero she's already
[01:58.520 --> 02:04.200]  beaten his party in the election but just like Merkel lost last year she's still in office they'll
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.200]  take another election or maybe more to unseat them but that is a huge victory nationalists
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.200]  expected to make gains across EU and European elections with mainstream parties hoping to
[02:14.200 --> 02:19.640]  cling to power because if they have a hundred percent in a parliamentary election that would
[02:19.640 --> 02:26.400]  probably unseat them but it's only 65% win 65% of the seats they can hold on to power and that's
[02:26.400 --> 02:32.080]  what it looks like is happening right now EU elections Europeans head to the polls and last
[02:32.080 --> 02:39.040]  day of voting as the UK awaits results so was supposedly under EU law supposed to be out at
[02:39.040 --> 02:47.200]  2100 Greenwich Mean Time that was a couple hours ago it is not out it is not out ladies and
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.520]  gentlemen again time was discovered and basically documented with the first clocks in England
[02:51.520 --> 02:58.000]  it's a famous contest that's why we have Greenwich Mean Time the world is pegged to that time but
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.440]  we will again continue to track it as it all unfolds and becomes final okay we should know
[03:03.440 --> 03:09.680]  all the details by the end of the broadcast we are live it is Sunday May 26 2019 I am your

[04:15.160 --> 04:22.280]  that had already been telegraphed by the president and others but I confirmed it and now it's in the
[04:22.280 --> 04:29.720]  news the last four days and the establishment is crapping a brick factory the entire brick building
[04:30.680 --> 04:38.040]  not a brick uh Trump has them on treason the justice department's actually looking at
[04:38.040 --> 04:44.200]  treason charges and by the way Dick Cheney's wife even came out and said that on national news this

[05:58.600 --> 06:10.440]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[06:29.320 --> 06:40.440]  it's sunday may 26 2019 and i can announce here exclusively to you
[06:41.080 --> 06:53.400]  on this sunday evening that president trump and large sections of the judiciary the legislative
[06:53.400 --> 07:01.720]  the executive agencies of the executive the cia the fbi are choosing sides right now
[07:02.600 --> 07:10.280]  and rats are leaving the sinking ship of the globalist controlled deep state
[07:12.920 --> 07:15.560]  now i was in dc as everyone knows a month ago
[07:15.560 --> 07:25.800]  and you notice a week after i got back facebook announced that my name is banned my image is
[07:25.800 --> 07:33.320]  banned and any positive mention of me will get you banned beyond 1984 why do you think that was
[07:35.720 --> 07:39.320]  well i've tracked it they they never banned me for the reasons that they say
[07:39.320 --> 07:45.800]  every time i talk about trump moving against the deep state and how there are large sections
[07:45.800 --> 07:49.880]  of the government that are still loyal to the republic and how trump needs to take action
[07:49.880 --> 07:56.840]  how that's his only course the deep state the national security system that is controlled
[07:56.840 --> 08:01.320]  by the deep state to a great extent it's been trying to block trump's reforms they've listened
[08:01.320 --> 08:06.200]  to my phone calls with trump and they've also listened to the phone calls of other people with
[08:06.200 --> 08:12.120]  trump and that's why they're particularly pissed because trump does and research is what i say
[08:12.120 --> 08:17.160]  and acts on it and they've admitted that this isn't about tooting my horn but it's why you
[08:17.160 --> 08:23.800]  have to realize that they went so far as to say you're not just banned on facebook your name is banned
[08:23.800 --> 08:33.560]  buddy that is beyond fantasy land this is not a harry potter book it's not a harry potter movie
[08:33.560 --> 08:42.280]  i'm not voldemort folks and they are in atlantic monthly when the washington post at new york
[08:42.280 --> 08:48.520]  times just last week calling me a apex predator saying i've got to be basically arrested now
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.560]  no no i didn't launch any wars and kill any people i don't have a criminal record but why
[08:55.560 --> 09:02.520]  am i the one who must not be named because i actually do my homework now that i spent three
[09:02.520 --> 09:11.800]  minutes breaking that down remember i got back from dc and anyone that knows this information
[09:11.800 --> 09:21.400]  does not say this on air because they will be audited they will be harassed they will be threatened
[09:21.400 --> 09:32.680]  they might be physically attacked antifa will come to their house so when i went to dc i met with three
[09:32.680 --> 09:45.560]  people in media in us intelligence and in government who had all met with the president two days before
[09:45.560 --> 09:54.920]  i got there and these are guys in suits and high rise buildings in dc some of which are household
[09:54.920 --> 10:02.120]  names with sweat in air conditioned rooms and i know why i'm sweating too running down their heads
[10:02.120 --> 10:06.120]  and they said no he's making the move we were just in the meeting with him two days ago you're right
[10:06.120 --> 10:13.000]  it's going down and they've got total proof they're working with other governments other agencies
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.960]  other corporations it's much worse than you know they actually even had a plan to assassinate the
[10:17.960 --> 10:25.800]  president so now it's gone into red sirenville okay this is not a drill this is not a game
[10:27.240 --> 10:30.440]  and they said trump is going to move he's going to declassify everything within a month
[10:31.880 --> 10:35.720]  and all hell's going to break close so you better dig in and get your audience ready
[10:35.720 --> 10:44.760]  and boy weren't you right about all this alex pat me on the back
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.560]  you know we thought potas was a little crazy two years ago he was listening to you
[10:50.280 --> 10:54.120]  these are the conversations where's that get into those conversations this is real world this is
[10:54.120 --> 10:54.760]  history happening
[11:00.200 --> 11:03.800]  trump has come out in fact i forgot to send you guys that clip he did it
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.240]  probably jumped from the helicopter to go to air force one on friday go to japan
[11:08.280 --> 11:13.400]  and he came out and he said what he's been saying there's been an attempted coup it's
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.320]  got to be dealt with but that is basically treason and we've got to bring the people to justice that
[11:17.320 --> 11:26.200]  did it trump then signed an executive memorandum ordering all 17 u.s intelligence agencies
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.400]  to prepare for him in the next seven days and of course they're gonna try to block it but
[11:33.400 --> 11:39.480]  he's given the order all declassification of all the russia investigation everything
[11:41.720 --> 11:45.480]  now that is pulling the trigger on the shot hard around the world but remember
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.240]  they're still deep stayed in place they brag in the news that oh he'll sign an order but we'll
[11:51.240 --> 11:55.160]  just put it in the bottom of the paper and he gets so busy he doesn't find out for a month we didn't
[11:55.160 --> 11:55.560]  do it
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.440]  brennan a few months ago trump said i'm removing your security clearance you're leaking all this
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.080]  this info to the press it's illegal i said watch the bureaucracy won't actually remove
[12:07.080 --> 12:14.840]  his security clearance it's in the associated press today they did not remove it he's the president
[12:16.280 --> 12:20.520]  that's that is his prerogative his jurisdiction his sandbox
[12:21.960 --> 12:27.000]  didn't happen and the media is like oh well it was the bureaucracy just kind of ignored the
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.120]  president exactly they're ignoring him on almost everything it's treason it's mutiny
[12:34.120 --> 12:37.960]  it's criminal it's out of control the same group tried to remove him
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.040]  is trying to block his agenda to turn the economy and the country back on and his bum
[12:42.040 --> 12:49.400]  rushing our borders to collapse it remember what he just said eight days ago my campaign for president
[12:49.400 --> 12:54.840]  was conclusively spot on nothing like this has ever happened in america politics a really bad
[12:54.840 --> 12:59.960]  situation treason means long jail sentences and this was treason what did i tell you a
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.960]  month ago when i was in dc treason is the charge they're looking at it's what they're going with
[13:05.960 --> 13:13.640]  it's what it is and trump says why water this down go all the way well now liz cheney
[13:16.360 --> 13:22.600]  went on national television this weekend the stories up on info wars dot com it's from the
[13:22.600 --> 13:29.160]  hill dot com statements by agents investigating trump could well be treason
[13:31.880 --> 13:38.520]  now again the president wouldn't be bringing this out and if you listen to cheney she is the
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.400]  establishment they realize this is out of control they realize the sellout to china is is worse than
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.440]  they thought they realize the populace won't put up with this and trumps winning so even the neo cons
[13:48.440 --> 13:55.240]  now are joining with trump this is the rats leaving the sinking ship this is the collapse of the power
[13:55.240 --> 14:01.960]  structure this is the return of america but it isn't done yet we are entering the prime zone
[14:02.760 --> 14:07.320]  histories books are being closed on the globalist and they will pay for what they've done
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.480]  but their power is being cut off completely right now they're a shadow of their former
[14:11.480 --> 14:17.560]  selves but they're still deadly dangerous and the new chapter of our future destiny is being
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.360]  written and the world knows it this is an incredible time but trumps taken the gloves off
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.760]  he's not taken them off he took them off a month ago he got all these people in there and he said
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.720]  we're going to war these people are coming after everybody they're a bunch of liars and the dims
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.200]  are having are collapsing they're stuttering they can't even talk the media tries to claim it's
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.640]  doctored it's not with nadler falling down you know having a seizure or whatever and it's just
[14:43.640 --> 14:50.920]  all emblematic of how they're circling the toilet bowl we come back with shaney statements by agents
[14:50.920 --> 14:58.360]  investigating trump could well be treason and who directed them and how does it go expect to see page
[14:58.360 --> 15:09.720]  and struck and or and mccabe and others indicted within 30 days that's the current information
[15:09.720 --> 15:16.120]  so now the russian collusion is a proven lie when did the trial for treason begin trump asked
[15:17.720 --> 15:24.280]  many many many many months ago and now here we are so they wanted to silence us they wanted to

[21:40.280 --> 21:48.840]  law under when they're supposed to release the results and even though the european union
[21:49.560 --> 21:54.760]  parliament is ceremonial because the e you bureaucracy is a dictatorship that tricks you
[21:54.760 --> 22:01.960]  into joining via trade deals it's still a referendum on them and has the e you set to collapse
[22:01.960 --> 22:09.640]  we're going to be breaking it all down as it unfolds tonight but let's get back to what i was
[22:09.640 --> 22:15.720]  just mentioning articles on info wars dot com and news wars dot com it's from the hill dot com
[22:16.440 --> 22:23.480]  list chaining statements by agents investigating trump could well be treason and once you're charged
[22:23.480 --> 22:29.320]  for that trying to overthrow an elected government working with foreign powers as they got caught
[22:29.320 --> 22:34.120]  doing well it leads to who gave the orders we already know who gave the orders brennan and
[22:34.120 --> 22:44.840]  clapper got smoked out a month ago remember they went on cnn where traders go to die politically
[22:45.560 --> 22:54.120]  the old boneyard there for dead donkey globalist and they said we were ordered by obama and
[22:54.120 --> 23:00.440]  Samantha power to spy on trump as a candidate bingo gotcha already knew it already knew it gotcha
[23:01.000 --> 23:09.160]  gotcha gotcha gotcha obama gotcha hillary now we just got to have the will to go ahead and go into
[23:09.160 --> 23:15.400]  that corner of the room with that cornered rat and scoop it up and take it outside to the animal
[23:15.400 --> 23:22.200]  control vehicle and take it away but if we don't it's going to sit there and it's pile of feces
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.840]  where it lives hillary and brennan and make a bunch of filthy little gremlin babies after midnight
[23:27.720 --> 23:32.920]  we'll be dealing with forever all the antifa all the brainwashing at the universities all the
[23:32.920 --> 23:40.280]  anti-aoc saying collie flowers racist i'm gonna get to that i mean there's no end to how they project
[23:40.280 --> 23:47.480]  division on everything but there's list chaining congresswoman from Wyoming dick cany's wife
[23:47.480 --> 23:53.640]  which signifies the median point between mainline conservatives and nationalists and the establishment
[23:53.640 --> 23:59.000]  that's where chaney swims around they have her come out and say this this is the bushes this is
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.720]  the establishment throwing in the towel and saying this is gone too far it's out of control
[24:03.720 --> 24:09.720]  we'll lose a civil war we better throw in with trump the establishment went too far
[24:10.600 --> 24:15.640]  globalism is dying it's being repudiated why would our own elites sell the country out when
[24:15.640 --> 24:20.920]  it's dominant and has superior systems the chikoms even if you were sociopath why would you
[24:20.920 --> 24:26.760]  feed america feet first into a woodchipper because if you have little ding dong syndrome like
[24:27.640 --> 24:34.200]  nadler who's like having seizures at tables and policy they've been born and bred to hate this
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.280]  country it doesn't make any sense from even a cold-blooded standpoint what they're doing
[24:40.280 --> 24:48.200]  and that's why they're done people can ignore bleeding hard americans like me and my ancestors
[24:48.200 --> 24:52.760]  your ancestors have built the country but they can't ignore the reality of signing ourselves
[24:52.760 --> 24:57.720]  over to the chikoms who want to literally piss in our face there's some exercise of their coming
[24:57.720 --> 25:03.320]  of age and their their hegemonic right to rule give me a break learn to wipe your ass first
[25:03.320 --> 25:09.320]  learned how to get running water unless we teach you
[25:12.040 --> 25:20.680]  let's go ahead and go to congresswoman from wyoming list cheney struck and page who were
[25:20.680 --> 25:26.200]  in charge of launching this investigation and they were saying things like uh we must stop this
[25:26.200 --> 25:30.760]  president we need an insurance policy against this president that in my view when you have
[25:30.760 --> 25:35.800]  people that are in the highest echelons of the law enforcement of this nation uh saying things
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.680]  like that that sounds an awful lot like a coup and it could well be treason and i think that we
[25:40.680 --> 25:44.600]  need to know more we need to know what was jim comey's role in all of this these people reported
[25:44.600 --> 25:50.120]  to him andy mccabe reported to him what was comey's role in that and that is what the attorney general
[25:50.120 --> 25:55.640]  is going to be focused on let me so the average listener that we should roll over the video for
[25:55.640 --> 26:00.920]  TV viewers of anderson cooper acting like a demon last week the average viewers like we've been
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.840]  hearing this for two and a half years on your show what's the big news list cheney just went on
[26:06.840 --> 26:15.240]  national sunday morning television to say we're looking at treason charges it's on it's happening
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.280]  it's a done deal democrats didn't back off trump said i've done nothing wrong
[26:20.840 --> 26:24.520]  you've been proven wrong you've been caught in all these crimes just let us industrialize the
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.640]  country let us rebuild the defenses let us control the border and their answer is no we're going to
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.720]  overrun you we're going to collapse you we're going to say you're a nazi and we're going to
[26:35.720 --> 26:44.040]  harass every business you've gotten all your family because we're full of diseased bravada
[26:47.720 --> 26:52.200]  so i'm going to go to break here and i just want to remind the listeners that this is an

[26:58.680 --> 27:03.000]  just say it it's been the crew and some people like matt drudge link into our articles here in there

[27:09.080 --> 27:16.360]  supporting us and spread the word you are the info war you did this and we are not completely
[27:16.360 --> 27:20.920]  winning but we're starting to win it's like a 12 round boxing match we're in round eight and
[27:20.920 --> 27:27.320]  the judges called about now we we're barely winning i mean we're winning right now we haven't won but
[27:27.960 --> 27:33.000]  so don't get cigars out folks like the wolf says in pulp fiction let's not start doing you know what
[27:33.000 --> 27:41.000]  yet but the globals are playing with fire like mc jaggard said and there's real men and women in
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.160]  this world of every race color and creed that have read blood and love god and when we wake up
[27:45.160 --> 27:50.920]  up the system gets scared well guess what the system the status quo is trying to make average

[34:19.720 --> 34:27.560]  gentlemen it makes you a slave where are our instincts okay i am overflowing with news here but
[34:27.560 --> 34:35.480]  but quite frankly the news that trump is saying it's treason in two press conferences he did
[34:35.480 --> 34:40.360]  before he was in japan we have those clips we may play some later but it's on record the fact
[34:40.360 --> 34:46.280]  that list cheney's on national tv saying it congresswoman from wyoming very establishment
[34:46.280 --> 34:55.080]  the fact that all this is going on is just huge and they're normally will by law release the
[34:55.080 --> 35:02.520]  the total e u election results by 2100 greenish meantime i just talked paul watson during the
[35:02.520 --> 35:08.200]  break uh it's it's almost midnight over there it's 11 30 at night he said no it's the results aren't
[35:08.200 --> 35:14.440]  out but they're saying exit polls show exactly what drugs report dot com saying massive win for
[35:14.440 --> 35:21.880]  nationalist populist briggs itters uh i mean the chron has been devastated by lapin it's looking
[35:21.880 --> 35:27.240]  much worse than what polls even showed well no kidding polls showed trump losing by 15 points
[35:27.240 --> 35:34.680]  he'd be delivering so it is one incredible time to be alive right now now let me shift gears or
[35:34.680 --> 35:42.760]  something the democrats put out tons of memes tons of comedy videos they put out all sorts of
[35:42.760 --> 35:48.600]  distorted stuff on trump they put all sorts of videos of you know uh where i have a triple chin
[35:48.600 --> 35:53.960]  and all this stuff they're famous for that and remember when trump two years ago was first in
[35:53.960 --> 36:00.440]  japan they go feed koi and and the and the japanese leader dumps a little bit and then
[36:00.440 --> 36:05.800]  dumps it all and trump copies it seeing in blew it up to cut it out of context and said that trump
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.320]  was engaged in a faux pas uh that that that you know that trump put his foot in his mouth that he
[36:11.320 --> 36:21.880]  killed diplomatic uh etiquette and discourse none of it was true so trump's chief legal advisor
[36:21.880 --> 36:29.160]  rudolf juliani tweets a video that has polosi slowed down a little bit and they go oh my gosh
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.440]  you put out doctored video my gosh you're a fraud we need to censor trump's trump needs to be taken
[36:34.440 --> 36:41.640]  off facebook that's in the news they're saying take trump off facebook he put out a doctored video
[36:41.640 --> 36:47.640]  ladies and gentlemen i don't even play the videos every day or two four or five times a week it's on
[36:47.640 --> 36:53.160]  my list of videos that the crew gives me in fact document cam shot this please i mean sometimes i
[36:53.160 --> 36:59.720]  have like 50 videos today it's only like 20 something and it's polosi stuttering and not able to talk
[36:59.720 --> 37:06.280]  we don't ever even cover this but just like when hillary clinton collapsed that time they didn't
[37:06.280 --> 37:11.560]  show her collapse they showed the stumble and said i made it up no she fully collapsed so here's real
[37:11.560 --> 37:18.840]  undocked video of polosi seaproof polosi has trouble talking it's up on info wars dot com
[37:18.840 --> 37:26.440]  and news wars dot com and share this video here it is well nancy polosi's daughter's come out and
[37:26.440 --> 37:33.080]  she says that it's despicable that the republicans and juliani tweeted out a video that was quote
[37:33.080 --> 37:39.320]  doctored of her mother slurring her words and you know what it has been doctored it's been slowed
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.720]  down some remember jim acosta months ago said that we doctored a video we grabbed the microphone and
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.240]  pushed the lady away at the white house but all we did was zoom in that's not doctored the president
[37:51.240 --> 37:56.680]  came out and agreed with us that it wasn't doctored but yes it is doctored to slow it down in fact i
[37:56.680 --> 38:03.320]  don't know why people even did that because almost every time she talks she slurs every other sentence
[38:03.320 --> 38:10.840]  so i'm gonna play you a undocked compilation of her at regular speed but folks we saw hillary clinton
[38:10.840 --> 38:15.480]  fall down a month before the election and the media wouldn't even show the part where she fell down
[38:15.480 --> 38:21.560]  they claim we made that up they would just show her stumble we saw dadler basically having some
[38:21.560 --> 38:30.600]  type of petty mall seizure in new york a few days ago the democrats are a bunch of old globalist
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.080]  that are hanging on to power with a bunch of race baiting and they're preparing the new crop
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.920]  of mentally ill aoc to come in claiming cauliflower's racist even though it's the Arabs at first
[38:40.920 --> 38:46.520]  discovered it named it just total insanity ladies and gentlemen as if whites discovered cauliflower
[38:46.520 --> 38:53.960]  that it must be bad hey aoc cauliflower grows in new york yucca doesn't but imagine that level of
[38:53.960 --> 38:59.960]  mental illness where you think that all the plants that are in latin america are yours and no one
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.240]  else's and if they aren't latin american plants being grown in new york it's racist lady that's
[39:05.240 --> 39:13.080]  crazy that's insane you grow what grows in your area i'm digressing here ladies and gentlemen
[39:13.080 --> 39:19.000]  here is the compilation there's only a small part of it take hours to play at all of her
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.440]  acting like she's having a mental meltdown it's absolutely incredible that this is the main
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.800]  opposition against america's recovery this is who the globalist has their front person and they
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.680]  want us to believe that it's not reasonable to talk about how she's acting and what she's saying
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.880]  then we'll show you a couple of videos of just the last week of joe biden who's either drunk a bottle
[39:39.880 --> 39:47.240]  of bourbon or he's got serious brain problems and the guy has had major brain surgeries that they
[39:47.240 --> 39:52.440]  admit he's had part of his brain removed it's reasonable to ask about people's health it's
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.160]  reasonable to point this out democrats always do it to republicans but they want to tell you
[39:57.160 --> 40:02.120]  that you can't do it well guess what we're going to continue on doing it here at info wars dot com
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.840]  republicans wrote a bill that abandons farmers uh uh farming families it weakens weakens the
[40:08.840 --> 40:15.080]  farmers safety net president trump's month full month months delayed we're fighting to expand

[45:14.360 --> 45:20.760]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[45:20.760 --> 45:26.680]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[45:26.680 --> 45:32.680]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting

[46:42.160 --> 46:57.160]  Five different types of caffeine, doesn't last a crush.
[46:57.160 --> 47:19.160]  Five different types of caffeine, doesn't last a crush.
[47:19.160 --> 47:32.160]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:32.160 --> 47:40.160]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and I've covered maybe 10% of the news that I've prepared for all weekend.
[47:40.160 --> 47:51.160]  I also shot seven reports yesterday. We've only aired one of them here and these are important weapons in the fight for liberty.
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.160]  These are very informative pieces that are up on inforwars.com.
[47:56.160 --> 48:06.160]  I'm going to air one of these in the last segment of the next hour. CNN caught framing a poor innocent woman for racism.
[48:06.160 --> 48:21.160]  This is a very, very important video on newswars.com.
[48:21.160 --> 48:34.160]  I'll share it on your email, share it on your text message, that gets around the sensors, share it on Facebook, share it on, however, the point is, is that whatever they don't want you to share is what you should be sharing.
[48:34.160 --> 48:40.160]  And next hour we'll have more of the EU election results coming in. It looks devastating for the globalist.
[48:40.160 --> 48:57.160]  They're not two party where winter takes all. It's staggered over three elections over six years. And so even if patriots win most of the seats, it's still only a third of the seats.
[48:57.160 --> 49:06.160]  But it's definitely signals curtains for the globalist because Merkel's lost three rounds in Germany. She's about to leave office.
[49:06.160 --> 49:14.160]  Macron's lost the last two rounds. Spain's lost two rounds. Italy lost three rounds. Now has a nationalist in place. Greece's lost three rounds.
[49:14.160 --> 49:27.160]  The globalists are losers. Hey, we're going to be globalist bankers and not pay any taxes but make you pay them all and bring in third-world populations and teach them how much you suck as our political army against you.
[49:27.160 --> 49:29.160]  Yeah, that's not going to work.
[49:29.160 --> 49:36.160]  Oh, by the way, the EU was Hitler's plan. Not going to work.
[49:36.160 --> 49:48.160]  And Paul Watson will be on with me and Owen Schreuer tomorrow at the very start of the show, 11 a.m. Central, right after David Knight as the first three hours, the David Knight show, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. weekdays.
[49:48.160 --> 49:57.160]  And we have human. We have human intelligence. We have you. I have myself. I have this crew. You are the power. You are the resistance.
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.160]  I'm not afraid of the word. Nothing can stop you. And yes, we were fighting an uphill battle forever.
[50:02.160 --> 50:07.160]  And they censored us. They attacked us. They lied about us. They demonized us.
[50:07.160 --> 50:12.160]  And then when they demonetized me on YouTube, it took $6 million of our funding away.
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.160]  Sounds like a lot of money. It's not what you got. 100 employees and bandwidth and crews.
[50:16.160 --> 50:23.160]  And then they took our sponsors away. Our listeners just kept stepping up. We got more focused. We stepped up.
[50:23.160 --> 50:29.160]  We're kind of like Spartans now. We're down to bare bones, but they just keep thinking, hey, we're suing you.
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.160]  Hey, we're trying to take your kids away. Hey, we're trying to put you in prison. Hey, we're lying about you.
[50:34.160 --> 50:41.160]  Hey, we're trying to destroy you. Give up. No, I'm not giving up because you're bad. You're attacking me.
[50:41.160 --> 50:49.160]  You think I'm one of your little cowardly minions where you attack me and then I roll over? No, it's the other way around. I fight harder.
[50:49.160 --> 50:54.160]  Not because I'm a hero, but because I love justice. I'm not a slave.
[50:54.160 --> 51:04.160]  So let me get into this piece. I shot a special report on this yesterday when Fox had guests, CNN had guests without me even trying to find it.
[51:04.160 --> 51:13.160]  I saw it on the news. Major publications came out and said the right wing has attacked AOC. Our Lord and Savior, he's right.
[51:13.160 --> 51:26.160]  Collie Flower is racist. Now, the video is up there. I shot a special report last night. Leftist defend AOC's Collie Flower is racist statement.
[51:26.160 --> 51:34.160]  And, you know, I saw her do that and you think it's idiotic, but it's not idiotic.
[51:34.160 --> 51:49.160]  When you go to a modern Western college now, everything's microaggressions. Everything is see the world through what color you are and see the world.
[51:49.160 --> 51:59.160]  Why do you think there's this big operation to discredit Martin Luther King right now? You see everywhere with all these fake FBI files, the rest of it.
[51:59.160 --> 52:06.160]  Because folks, they don't want to have a black guy that's well-spoken saying, judge people by what they do, what they stand for, not what color they are.
[52:06.160 --> 52:14.160]  The left and the globalists want you to be in victim mentality and all about what color you are so they can control you.
[52:14.160 --> 52:18.160]  So AOC goes to New York Community Gardens. And I saw this Thursday. We covered it briefly.
[52:18.160 --> 52:28.160]  And I went and looked up the New York Community Gardens because back in the day, I had a community garden that I would go with my kids who are older now.
[52:28.160 --> 52:35.160]  And we had a community garden at Camp Mayfield Park.
[52:35.160 --> 52:41.160]  There was a community garden there. I think it's still there. Many years ago, we went and planted things that, hey, what grows there well?
[52:41.160 --> 52:50.160]  We had a little plot like 10 feet across, maybe 5 feet wide, little plot under smoke trees. We planted things that would grow there in partial sun.
[52:50.160 --> 53:00.160]  We didn't think, are we white? Are we black? Are we Hispanic? We thought, what grows here nice with the peacocks and the river right next to it?
[53:00.160 --> 53:06.160]  It's all beautiful and there's a big art house and all this stuff. But yeah, big tough guys wouldn't tell you that, but I'm the type of guy.
[53:06.160 --> 53:10.160]  I had a little community garden with my kids. You want to go plant stuff with your kids? I had a garden at the house too.
[53:10.160 --> 53:17.160]  But we had a little community garden. I had some good photos of sweet memories for three or four years.
[53:17.160 --> 53:22.160]  We had a community garden. I think it was my mom's idea. In fact, it was her idea.
[53:22.160 --> 53:27.160]  You start covering one subject. You kind of access your memory. Remember, oh, I had a community garden.
[53:27.160 --> 53:35.160]  But the thing about a community garden is you plant whatever you want. Whatever will grow. You shine up. It's your plot.
[53:35.160 --> 53:40.160]  You say you're going to sponsor it like a piece of highway. You're going to pick the trash up and it's yours.
[53:40.160 --> 53:54.160]  But AOC shows up and she walks around and puts in this fake Latin accent that she doesn't usually speak in and goes, we are under attack.
[53:54.160 --> 54:06.160]  Why you wonder why we not come to garden? It is because there is cauliflower. It makes it hard for us.
[54:06.160 --> 54:14.160]  The colonial cauliflower of the races. But we will plant yucca.
[54:14.160 --> 54:24.160]  Talk about a weird stereotype of Latin Americans. And so, wait a minute, cauliflower was first in Africa, got named by Arabs.
[54:24.160 --> 54:28.160]  It's named after Cyprus Mediterranean. Who cares if it came from Western Europe?
[54:28.160 --> 54:37.160]  It doesn't. She goes, she's a white plant and goes, we have white people. They plant white plant.
[54:37.160 --> 54:47.160]  Meanwhile, those community gardens are totally every race you can imagine. But who would project that but meth had crazy eyes?
[54:47.160 --> 54:56.160]  But this is the religion. This is the globalist. This is their plan. And then her defenders say, it is true.
[54:56.160 --> 55:07.160]  The cauliflower, like milk, like okay, sign his back. And she even puts on this fake accent she doesn't even have.
[55:07.160 --> 55:13.160]  People are watching this believing though, cauliflower is coming to get them. Here it is.
[55:13.160 --> 55:24.160]  People say like, why do you need to do that? That's too hard. But when you really think about it, when someone says that it's too hard
[55:24.160 --> 55:34.160]  to do a green space that grows yucca instead of yucca, I don't know, cauliflower or something.
[55:34.160 --> 55:41.160]  What you're doing is that you're taking a colonial approach to environmentalism.
[55:41.160 --> 55:49.160]  And that is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements.
[55:49.160 --> 56:04.160]  Because they come with a colonial lens on them. And it should be no surprise that sometimes a lot of these projects don't work out occasionally.
[56:04.160 --> 56:12.160]  Because our communities are naturally in tune to live in an environmentally conscious way.
[56:12.160 --> 56:20.160]  So white people are bad for the environment. But yucca doesn't even grow in New York.
[56:20.160 --> 56:24.160]  And then some plant from Africa, in the Middle East, you say it's white people because it's white.
[56:24.160 --> 56:30.160]  I mean ding dong, you're crazy, bong bong, bong bong, insane asylum.
[56:30.160 --> 56:43.160]  And then they had Kathy R.U. on Tucker Carlson hysterically going, oh, I agree. The cauliflower is scary. It's white.
[56:43.160 --> 56:49.160]  Folks, this is bonker land. It's like we have black floors in the studio.
[56:49.160 --> 56:52.160]  Because that's what the designers recommended looking for TV.
[56:52.160 --> 56:57.160]  I'll let them say, Jones has black floors so he can walk on black people.
[56:57.160 --> 57:05.160]  See how that schizophrenia works? No one would ever think that unless it's like cauliflower is white.
[57:05.160 --> 57:14.160]  I must fight the white devil. Oh my lord, they're here colonizing me. And then here's her defender on Tucker Carlson.
[57:14.160 --> 57:22.160]  Well, it's part of monocropping. So our colonial ancestors grew cauliflower.
[57:22.160 --> 57:29.160]  So they're cropping the same old, same old vegetables, not good for the environment because it's the same nutrients in the ground.
[57:29.160 --> 57:37.160]  And it actually hurts the environment to have the same old, same old. So the corn, the cauliflower is colonialism.
[57:37.160 --> 57:43.160]  So she's talking about diversifying our vegetables as we should diversify our culture.
[57:43.160 --> 57:54.160]  Back hour two. I just...info war. The most banned network in the world.
[57:54.160 --> 58:00.160]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more. Thanks for calling, Tom.

[59:43.160 --> 59:46.160]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[59:46.160 --> 59:53.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.160]  You're listening to a frontline report. Sunday, May 26, 2019.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.160]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:18.160]  We've got the good news. We've got the bad news on EU elections and who's winning, who's losing.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.160]  We'll cover it in T minus six minutes.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:28.160]  But right now, uh, the full Tucker Carlson interview from Friday's up.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.160]  We have the full AOC 30 minute in the gardens of New York.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.160]  You can go to New York and plant whatever you want.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:41.160]  At a community garden, I looked it up.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.160]  So the idea that white people are planting cauliflower because it's a white plant.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.160]  When it's not, imagine that mental illness territorializing cauliflower.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.160]  Or if you like Mexican food, you're culturally appropriating.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.160]  That's what's culture does. You appropriate what's good.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.160]  As I've said, cowboy hats, chaps, all that was taken from the Vicarra.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:11.160]  So Mexico, because it was smart to wear chaps in thorny bushes when you're on a course and cowboy hats and sombreros work really good.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.160]  Yeah, we appropriate stuff. Everybody appropriates what works.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:21.160]  Look at all the Western stuff has been appropriated, but that's the mental illness where no teachings taught at college.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:30.160]  All they teach ladies and gentlemen is that white people are killing the environment and that white people are bad.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:35.160]  And by the way, I'm not lionizing brown people 99% of the time.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160]  They're not the one pushing it.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.160]  It's weird white leftist that want to radicalize minorities over to their control.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:50.160]  But AOC, who looks like a walled method, says the earth sending in 12 years.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:57.160]  She then has Kathy, are you?
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.160]  Kathy, are you?
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.160]  And the full show talking about not only is cauliflower colonial show is corn.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:20.160]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, corn, according to archaeologists and anthropologists shows up about 10,000 years ago being cultivated by the Mayans in southern Mexico and what is Guatemala today.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.160]  But corn is from the Americas.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:30.160]  So now, though, you see, in the leftist brain, she thinks that white people are eating corn.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.160]  Now any Mexican would laugh at AOC.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.160]  That's just some New York creature that, oh, hello.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160]  I thought like this.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.160]  Oh, corn bad corn.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:47.160]  And the, the, the, the cauliflower is white.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.160]  This is the mental illness.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:56.160]  Now the leftist in defending her attacking corn as a white vegetable.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160]  Who cares?
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:03.160]  Who first started growing it or cultivating it?
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.160]  I mean, again, I like sake.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.160]  Japanese invented it.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.160]  I like scotch.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.160]  The Scots invented it.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160]  I'll watch a football game.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160]  America invented it.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160]  I'll watch soccer.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]  Who cares?
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160]  It's mental illness.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.160]  When you look at anything, see it through the lens of race.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:33.160]  So now, in defense of AOC, the only is cauliflower racist.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.160]  Let's kind of holly Hitler behind the scenes.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.160]  Corn is yellow.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160]  That's almost white.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.160]  Here it is.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.160]  Well, it's part of mono cropping.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.160]  They are colonial ancestors through cauliflower.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.160]  So they're cropping the same old, same old vegetables.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.160]  Not good for the environment because it's the same nutrients in the ground.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.160]  And it actually hurts the environment to have the same old, same old.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.160]  So the corn, the cauliflower is colonialism.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:08.160]  So she's talking about diversifying our vegetables as we should diversify our culture.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.160]  So yuka instead of cauliflower is the way to go.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.160]  So folks, let's stop there.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.160]  You see how the spin works.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  The earth's dying in 12 years to whatever AOC and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds say.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.160]  And only use words we say are your racist.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.160]  It covers it all.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.160]  And so they can just spit it.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.160]  Okay, cauliflower is from the Middle East and Africa and named after Cyprus and Mediterranean.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.160]  Well, just jump the corn, say it's racist.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160]  Let's just move on from there.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.160]  This is cuckoo land, folks.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160]  Cuckoo land.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.160]  But they're not stopping.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160]  They're doubling down.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160]  It wasn't just her on this show.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  Headlines everywhere.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.160]  Republicans defend racist cauliflower.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160]  God Almighty.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:05:15.160]  If this isn't psychological warfare, what is it?
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.160]  But with a discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's 240 a bar.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160]  No one can top that.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.160]  And it funds liberty in the fight against the globalists.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.160]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.

[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:22.160]  We've got major EU election results that are just starting to come out next segment.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.160]  But first, Dems panic as bar kicks spigated to overdrive.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:36.160]  And now you've got Liz Cheney, the Republican from Wyoming, Dick Cheney's wife, who represents the establishment,
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:45.160]  realizing that they're not going to win this against Trump, saying it's treason what the Democrats and others did against the president.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:50.160]  Folks, any way you cut this cake, any way you slice this pizza,
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.160]  any way you read the tea leaves,
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.160]  any way you look out the window in the morning, think it's snowing or it's raining,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.160]  or it's sun shining,
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:06.160]  the globalists are screwing the pooch, effing the football,
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.160]  engaging the cluster, you know what?
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:14.160]  And that just, I got a big repertoire of semantical lexicon that's about as big as they come.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:23.160]  Sometimes good old fashioned, Saxon is the way to describe it.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.160]  Sometimes the Saxon just rolls off the tongue.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:32.160]  Even if I can't say the Saxon on FCC control radio and TV,
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.160]  I can remind you of the beautiful Saxon language that the Normans told us we couldn't use.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.160]  And that's what it all comes down to, folks, is remembering where you come from.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160]  Wherever you come from, it's beautiful, it's amazing.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.160]  Don't give in to the globalists.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.160]  So, I want to air this special report.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.160]  Dim's panic is bar, kick spy gate, the overdrive.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.160]  And then this little Alex Jones is the Trump presidency.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.160]  CNN panic is their massive layoffs take place.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:04.160]  And then I'm going to get into the good news and the really bad news of the European parliamentary elections.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.160]  The results are just now coming in.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.160]  Kind of a new group of fighters coming your way.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.160]  Our subpoenas are not optional.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:19.160]  In what has become an unprecedented partisan abuse of legislative power,
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.160]  the Democrats have made a series of moves intended on undermining the executive office
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.160]  at the expense of the levers of our constitutional republic.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.160]  We have some 34 days.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.160]  Some 34 days as the Mueller report was made public.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:43.160]  This is the number of days that the Trump administration has been above the law.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.160]  The impeachment process is going to be inevitable.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160]  It's just a question of when, not if.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:53.160]  My position on impeachment is what it has always been,
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.160]  and that is the president of the United States of America needs to be impeached.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.160]  In the epicenter of the madness,
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:06.160]  Washington D.C. impeachment zealots are scurrying around the hallowed halls of Congress
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.160]  in a desperate bid to distract the public from the growing panic
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  regarding the spy gate investigation into the Obama administration
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.160]  that could pull the rug out from under the Democrats' chances in the upcoming election.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:26.160]  You look at the origin of the investigation, where it started, how it started, who started it,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.160]  whether it's McCabe or Comey or a lot of them.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.160]  The Mueller report, I wish covered the origins, how it started.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.160]  Just to ask you about DOJ, investigating the origins of the Russia probe,
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.160]  do you think they'll find anything any wrongdoing on the part of the Obama administration?
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.160]  I have no idea what DOJ is doing. Thanks.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.160]  Do you have any comment on them exploring the origins of the Russia probe,
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.160]  investigating the investigators? Do you think it's a worthy cause to do that?
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160]  I'm not coming. Thank you.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.160]  Let's remember who Mr. Barr is, let's examine his conduct,
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.160]  and let's treat his statements in this new investigation for what they really are.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.160]  Treat them like Trump re-election campaign press releases, because that's what this is about.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160]  But what do you do about it?
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.160]  Well, we need the media to be sure that they point this out, that this is an attorney general
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.160]  who is clearly acting like President Trump's own Roy Cohen,
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.160]  who thinks he's there to defend the president.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.160]  Associated Press reports President Donald Trump granted Attorney General William Barr
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.160]  new powers to review and potentially release classified information
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.160]  related to the origins of the Russia investigation.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.160]  Trump explicitly delegated Barr with declassification power,
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.160]  noting it would not automatically extend to another attorney general,
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.160]  and only for use in the review of the Russia investigation.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.160]  Before using the new authority, Barr should consult with intelligence officials
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.160]  to the extent he deems it practicable.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.160]  The concern from Democrats seems to be that Barr can't be trusted,
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.160]  and there might be selective release of information.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.160]  Does that pretty much sum up the worry about him?
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160]  Yeah, that's a fair concern.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.160]  I mean, when you have someone else who's outside their organization
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.160]  now able to say, for whatever reason, I'm going to now...
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.160]  it's declassified, but also potentially make it public,
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.160]  that's very scary to other intelligence agencies.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.160]  Outside of Washington, D.C., congressional state Democrats
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.160]  are wreaking havoc on the future of the presidential election,
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.160]  whether their constituents want it or not.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:39.160]  18 states are considering bills that would require presidential candidates
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:43.160]  to disclose their taxes in order to be on the 2020 election ballot.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:48.160]  Out of those 18 states, only Vermont would require candidates
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:54.160]  for governor and other statewide offices to disclose at least part of their tax returns.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.160]  The Democrats creating legislation that only applies to others,
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.160]  not to their own corrupt tax returns.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.160]  Meanwhile, as the Washington Times reports,
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.160]  the Nevada Senate approved a national popular vote bill.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.160]  The bill intends on undermining the electoral college
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.160]  and now goes to Democratic Governor Steve Sysilak's desk.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.160]  Assembly Bill 186 would bring Nevada into the national popular vote interstate compact.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.160]  Nevada would become the 16th jurisdiction to join the compact,
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.160]  along with 14 states and the District of Columbia.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.160]  The 2020 presidential election is shaping up to be a complete mess.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:37.160]  John Bown reporting.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:10.160]  All of them were designated dangerous individuals and organizations.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.160]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.160]  They call me dangerous.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.160]  Danger is my middle name.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.160]  Dangerous like hurting other people,
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.160]  or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.160]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.160]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.160]  Infowars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.160]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.160]  Infowars' content is useful to him.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160]  Infowars' personalities align with them.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.160]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.160]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.160]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.160]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal feud.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:01.160]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.160]  aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.160]  or harmful content and we're working hard to completely remove groups
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:15.160]  if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.160]  Screw your rules. Your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.160]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:27.160]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.160]  We need a digital fill of rights.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.160]  They're becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.160]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say,
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.160]  well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.160]  You are a bad person. You should be censored off the internet.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.160]  Bad, yes. Get out of here, Alex.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter,
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.160]  but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.160]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is,
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.160]  I'm sorry to say, the Infowars president.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:04.160]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.160]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:13.160]  Brian Stelter is so sad to have to say that Trump's the Infowars president.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.160]  You know, I loved all the disinfo of the last few years.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.160]  Trump doesn't like Alex Jones.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.160]  Trump's with QAnon.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.160]  Oh, Alex is getting arrested.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160]  Oh, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:29.160]  And then, of course, Trump tweets a bunch of our stuff and it's all, it's all bull.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160]  I'm not saying all the QAnon folks are bad either.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160]  It's just a bunch of cutouts.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.160]  You don't know who they are, but on there 25 years, this is just crazy.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.160]  But regardless, we've got the EU election results.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  A lot of them coming in, some good, some bad.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160]  Overall, they're very exciting.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.160]  We'll hit those quickly.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.160]  And then we will hit so many other points straight ahead.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:16:17.160]  NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  We looked at the best selling products out there and we made it even better
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.160]  and we lowered the price.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:20.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:27.160]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host and I've got some very disturbing news for you.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:34.160]  You know that the globalists are going to sit on their hands and watch every establishment globalist
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:43.160]  lose from Brazil to Iceland to Spain to Italy to the UK.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.160]  They were going to strike back by banning and censoring anybody that told the truth about
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:53.160]  nationalism and free market and capitalism and anybody that opposed the Islamic invasion.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.160]  They were also going to engage in an election fraud.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.160]  The EU took over the UK without a vote more than 30 years ago.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.160]  The public three years ago voted to leave, three years later they didn't leave.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.160]  The Prime Minister had to resign because she tried to sell the people out with an EU plan
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:13.160]  that was even more draconian than what they'd been under before.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:20.160]  They had an unelected system with 93% of their laws made by the unelected EU bureaucracy.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.160]  And so now, normally they give you election results by Friday.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.160]  They had UK elections on Thursday.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:32.160]  Parts of Europe have their parliamentary elections Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.160]  But by law, by 21 hours, Greenwich Mean Time.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.160]  That's like four hours ago.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.160]  They were supposed to release the election results, but they didn't.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.160]  And now they're reporting.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160]  I've got all the articles right here.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160]  Just print it off minutes ago.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.160]  40% of the UK is reporting.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.160]  All of Europe's reporting.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:04.160]  But the UK that voted first, they still are not reporting.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.160]  Isn't that just sweet?
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160]  All the crimes the EU commits.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160]  All the things they engage in.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.160]  You don't think they'll engage in fraud now?
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:21.160]  Now, the landslide's been so big for Le Pen, the nationalist that Macron has lost.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.160]  It doesn't mean he'll leave office, but his party lost this round.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.160]  And parliaments go generally in thirds, not in 50-50s.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.160]  We'll take another election, don't see.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.160]  Hell, Merkel's lost three in a row.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.160]  She's still in there.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:40.160]  Le Pen beats Macron in France as nationalist gain in EU vote.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160]  Reuters.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160]  Oh, they're gaining.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.160]  The right and the Greens gain ground in European elections.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.160]  AP.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.160]  Green wave and EU vote amid climate crisis.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.160]  Yes, gotta pay the Rothschilds those taxes.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.160]  40% counted so far.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.160]  33.8% hard Briggs Itters.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:06.160]  Conservative letter 23.8 remains 40.8.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.160]  But they're already announcing that Tommy Robinson's lost.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.160]  They're saying Nigel Farage is projected to win by landslide.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.160]  The leader of the New Briggs It Party, only six weeks old,
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:23.160]  talked about a year ago, but really launched it six weeks ago.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160]  Put a ring on it six weeks ago.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.160]  He's set to get the most seats of any party in Europe.
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.160]  Tommy Robinson blacked out everywhere, demonized,
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.160]  attacked thousands of Muslims showing up trying to physically attack him.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.160]  Media would say, Tommy did it.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.160]  We showed you the raw footage here.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.160]  Well, here's this statement from Cassandra Fairbanks.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.160]  Just a little while ago, says social media, the platform,
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.160]  interfered with his ability to campaign.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.160]  I don't want to say it's a concession, but here it is.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:57.160]  The whole way people use, Trump won his campaign on social media.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.160]  Brexit was won on social media.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160]  I'm banned from all social media.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.160]  So my ability to fight a fair campaign has gone,
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.160]  orchestrated and organized by the government.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.160]  So do I think I stand a chance?
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.160]  I think it's nearly impossible to fight that.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.160]  How can you fight a whole establishment of funding?
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.160]  The union funded 100 billboards of lies against me.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.160]  I can't even count right.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:23.160]  So again, the UK had its polls on Thursday.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.160]  We were supposed to normally learn the next day.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  We said, oh, you'll learn on Sunday.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.160]  They've still not released poll results,
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.160]  but I guess they've told Tommy he lost,
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.160]  which is some of the tricks I've noticed they play.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160]  Because by the way, I don't like Al Gore.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  I hate Al Gore.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160]  I also don't like, I hate George W. Bush.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:48.160]  But remember, they had Gore go ahead and concede
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.160]  until he figured out what was happening.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.160]  United Kingdom, not available.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.160]  Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia,
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.160]  Romania, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands,
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:09.160]  Malta, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Latvia, Italy,
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.160]  Ireland, Hungary, Greece, Germany,
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.160]  France, Finland, Estonia, Denmark,
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.160]  Czech, Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria,
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.160]  Belgium, Austria.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.160]  All open days later, all giving full results.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:37.160]  Ireland giving full results, but not England.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.160]  Because a lot of special things are happening right now
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:49.160]  to make sure those reports never come out.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.160]  Tommy Robinson is a rock star in England.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.160]  My parents are Anglophiles, if they're anything.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.160]  They go to England at least once a year.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.160]  They like the Netherlands too.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:09.160]  But they go to the Netherlands in England every year.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.160]  Yeah, 40 years ago, my mom had teacups with the Queen.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.160]  She doesn't like her now.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.160]  The point is, they like England.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.160]  That's where we're from.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:26.160]  And they're in taxicabs.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.160]  They're everywhere.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160]  It's just like, we love Trump.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.160]  We love America.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.160]  We love Alex Jones.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.160]  Do you know him?
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.160]  You're from Austin.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  I'm not bragging.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]  Oh, look, I'm a big guy.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  My parents are mobbed by Trump and Alex Jones supporters
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160]  in England.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.160]  They've been in Paris and they've been in Athens.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160]  People go, oh, you're from Austin.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160]  We love Alex Jones.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.160]  They tell them that they're my parents.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.160]  The guy took them around for three days for free in Athens
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.160]  and bought them dinner because they were my parents.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160]  Same thing happened in England.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.160]  They were giving them free taxi rides.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  I mean, it's on fire.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.160]  But Tommy Robinson thinks he may have lost.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160]  Yeah, right.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.160]  You know, we're not sword losers here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.160]  We've seen the censorship.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160]  We've seen the manipulation.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.160]  We've seen the control.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.160]  Yes, Tommy Robinson has gotten the highest independent voted
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.160]  history, but still not enough to win the seat.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.160]  If you even believe that, that's Avi Yemeni, who's a UK
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.160]  Commonwealth slash Australian citizen also in Israeli.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.160]  Good reporter reporting on that.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.160]  So that's the facts.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.160]  But the good news is.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.160]  Forage winning.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:51.160]  They're thrown in the towel for.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.160]  What's happening with McCron?
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:58.160]  Strangely enough, where the voting started on Thursday.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.160]  They can't tell you yet.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.160]  That tells you the hanky-panky is going on.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.160]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.160]  The very same UN globalist program to collapse European
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.160]  borders and bring in 15 million military aged men in the last
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.160]  six, seven years is the same program we're under now.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:19.160]  And the bad news is as much as Trump tries to secure our
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.160]  Republic, I don't want to put a wet blanket on the recovery.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:27.160]  But the truth is we got bad news for you on the other side
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.160]  that needs to be heard.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  We're going to fix this.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.160]  There are millions of illegals being dumped every few months
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.160]  on the streets.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.160]  It's collapsing local governments and the reports are in.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.160]  We'll break those down on the other side and talk about how do
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:44.160]  we stop this and how do we expose the Democrats who invited
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:49.160]  this and who advertised this and who engineered this?
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.160]  It's all coming up live at newswars.com.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.160]  Spread that link.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.160]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160]  dictators.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.160]  They are technocrats.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.160]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.160]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.160]  your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.160]  merge with AI gods.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.160]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.160]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.160]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.160]  we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.160]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  forearslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.160]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was

[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.160]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.160]  over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160]  It is amazing.

[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:10.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:15.160]  When I grow up, I want to pro-human future beyond the stars.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:20.160]  And I commit my soul with all my energy towards the feet of the enemy.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.160]  Now God take control of me as I'm weak.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:36.160]  Only you can guide me, direct me.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.160]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.160]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.160]  I want to be clear about something for everybody.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.160]  And I'm not knocking guys that like to play football
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.160]  or be in baseball or power lifters
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.160]  or guys that like to arm wrestle in their whole worlds
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.160]  about how the biggest, baddest dude in the planet
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:03.160]  and they all try to intimidate other men.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.160]  We have a technocracy.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.160]  We have globalist scientists that are studying how we operate.
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.160]  Nerds, basically.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.160]  Global nerds are bad, but these are nerds.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.160]  We have mad scientists that have built this world government
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.160]  that takes humanity out of its normal operation
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:24.160]  and into this false system to deconstruct us
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.160]  and to render us down to nothing.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.160]  And that is the ultimate assault.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.160]  That is the ultimate enslavement.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.160]  And so as a man, I want to resist that
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.160]  not because I'm big and bad and tough,
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.160]  but because I care about humanity
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.160]  and I see the wages of this system
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.160]  are lower IQ, cancer, failure, depression, death.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.160]  That's why I don't worry about myself
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.160]  because I realize we're all dead anyways if we don't change this.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:57.160]  You don't just think this planet
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.160]  is going to sit here with us on it
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.160]  and we're going to launch this big operation into space
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.160]  without something trying to kill us in the womb
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:13.160]  as above so below the sorcerers say.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:22.160]  So I'm going to be very clear about this for everybody right now.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.160]  I'm not worthy to bring you this information,
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:30.160]  but I'm also not trying to prey on you.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.160]  So I'm here to give it to you.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:38.160]  And the fact that I'm the person delivering this information
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:44.160]  is a very scary prologue to where we're going.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:50.160]  You understand?
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.160]  There's a barbarous evil in the universe.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:58.160]  There's a barbarous evil in our own hearts.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.160]  And if we don't temper that and be better men and women,
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:07.160]  civilization and our very souls will be lost.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.160]  And so that's all I'm really trying to say to people
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.160]  at the end of the day is this.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.160]  I'm sitting around the radio like,
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.160]  hey, look, Trump says there was treason
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.160]  and they're getting ready with treason charges
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.160]  against the deep state.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:27.160]  How sad is that for our country?
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:33.160]  And how dangerous is that for our country?
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.160]  I mean, this isn't just some radio show
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.160]  where I'm just saying all this.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:44.160]  I was in D.C. a month ago.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.160]  And I wasn't there getting all the answers.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.160]  I was there giving the answers and vice versa.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.160]  But this isn't make believe land.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160]  This isn't Game of Thrones.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.160]  This isn't Netflix.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.160]  This is real world, folks.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.160]  This is where the rubber meets the road.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.160]  This is where the fights happening now.
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.160]  And I see all these incredibly strong men.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.160]  They could be black.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160]  They could be brown.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.160]  They could be pink.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.160]  I guess there are some folks that are white.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:23.160]  And everybody thinks, oh, I'm going to go watch Avengers
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.160]  Endgame and I'm going to go to the mall
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160]  and I'm going to go work out.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.160]  It's all like this candy land.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.160]  If you're not conscious and you're not involved
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.160]  in the fight for humanity and what it stands for,
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.160]  you have nothing.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't judge people
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160]  that have had abortions.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160]  I know they lie to you and they tell you,
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]  oh, it's not a baby, whatever.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.160]  And, you know, you're broke.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.160]  Your girlfriend's 20 years old, whatever you pay for it's done.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.160]  And the baby probably doesn't feel too much pain
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.160]  up to the second trimester.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:06.160]  So I'm not judging, but I'm simply saying,
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.160]  still stuffing out a life and sometimes
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.160]  the most beautiful flowers grow in the mud.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:15.160]  Some of our best people come from single mothers
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:21.160]  and from poor people and from people that are bad.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:26.160]  And when you realize that it's not a woman's right,
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.160]  as they say, but it's a religion of the globalist
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:34.160]  to kill babies and to tell you they're not human
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:37.160]  when they're the most innocent purists of all our people.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.160]  A clear slate that we can project God's will on
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.160]  and watch amazing things happen.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.160]  Do you really think your soul's going to be safe?
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.160]  Do you really think your life's going to be safe?
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.160]  When we've killed 100 million Americans
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.160]  since Roe v. Wade in 1974.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.160]  Cancer rates are up tens of thousands of percent.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.160]  Autism's up 30,000 percent.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.160]  Neurological disorders are up 20 plus thousand percent.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.160]  Our IQs are dropping.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.160]  We're dying.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:25.160]  Because anybody that doesn't value children
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:29.160]  is divorced from God.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.160]  So I don't judge people with that abortions
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.160]  because you didn't know what happened.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:38.160]  You were lied to like the thief of the murder on the cross.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:40.160]  And one of them said, I don't see you, God.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.160]  The other said, I see you.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.160]  God said, your sins are wiped clean.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.160]  I'm not here like some Pharisee
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.160]  telling you have all these sins and you're a piece of crap.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  I'm just telling you that you better get right
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.160]  with the maker of the universe.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.160]  And you better decide what team you're on.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.160]  Because this planet doesn't just sit here in space as a joke.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.160]  You're like in the middle of God's creation in space
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:08.160]  with a sun and stars and everything around you
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.160]  and all the divisions above you and below you.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  And you laugh at God and say there is no God.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:20.160]  When God's looking at you, because all God can do,
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.160]  God's omnipresent is create a new God.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.160]  Doesn't mean you are a God yet or you want to be a God,
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.160]  but a consciousness, a free will,
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.160]  a free system that has free will that can make its own decisions.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.160]  That's what God creates.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.160]  And God gives you all of this and you piss on it.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:47.160]  If you don't protect the seeds that God's created,
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.160]  God will cut you off forever.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.160]  And the enemy wants you to do that because they want you cut off.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  They have already lost.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:58.160]  They want to suck you down with that pick they're in.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.160]  So, I'm going to air this final powerful report.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:05.160]  Seeing and Caught Framing Woman for Racism.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.160]  It's on infowords.com.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:14.160]  They want us shut down because it shows what frauds they are.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:19.160]  But another big report that I talked about last week
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.160]  that we never even aired, but it just went live on infowords.com
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.160]  where pro-choicers support aborting children up to age three
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:33.160]  directly from Dr. Peter Singer and Peter.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.160]  This is what it's all really about, folks.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:41.160]  You know, the day is about your soul and eternity.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:44.160]  All right, let's go to this piece of the report.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.160]  I hope you share the report she has on infowords.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.160]  The children are counting on you.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.160]  Here it is.
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.160]  What's the difference between a little tiny heartbeat
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.160]  and her heartbeat?
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.160]  They're still heartbeats for a human.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.160]  It's not about the heartbeat.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.160]  It's about the mama.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.160]  It's about the mother's choice.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.160]  So, when do we cut off abortions at what week?
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:06.160]  I think at three years old is when we should.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  You think at three years old is when we should stop aborting children.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.160]  How many times I tell you?
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.160]  That's Peter Singer, man.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.160]  Give me an argument for that.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.160]  I need a moment.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.160]  How many times I tell you?
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:22.160]  I'm age three.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:27.160]  You know, a lot of countries have a lot different views on life
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.160]  and when life begins, when life begins.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.160]  When does life begin for you?
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.160]  Um, I don't know.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.160]  Are we even really alive?
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.160]  So, you get that?
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.160]  You don't have a soul.
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.160]  You don't have free will.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.160]  Just give up.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.160]  Imagine if Caitlyn, which I would ever want to have,
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.160]  and pulled out a knife and just slit her throat,
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:45.160]  grabbed her by the hair and went,
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.160]  you don't live either with the police would arrest her.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.160]  Because she's a human.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.160]  According to her, nobody was alive.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.160]  Give yourself the safe.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.160]  I got another idea.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:43:03.160]  No, I won't.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:41.160]  I'm at info wars dot com and news wars dot com.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.160]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.160]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams,
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.160]  and it's all free to air.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.160]  Anybody can use it.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.160]  We upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.160]  People go to info wars dot com and news wars dot com.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.160]  That's where they find it.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.160]  You know, there's what things called websites.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.160]  You just go there.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.160]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.160]  Thanks for calling Mike.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.160]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.160]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.160]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.160]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.160]  Ever since I've been listening,
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.160]  I've been buying your products.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.160]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.160]  The bone broth.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.160]  The bone broth.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.160]  The bone broth.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.160]  The bone broth.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:15.160]  The bone broth.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.160]  The bone broth.
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.160]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.160]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.160]  It tastes like oval team.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.160]  It tastes like oval team.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.160]  It tastes like oval team.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.160]  It tastes like oval team.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.160]  Like good.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.160]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:32.160]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.160]  I've used the super male vitality,
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.160]  a host of other products.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.160]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.160]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160]  and keeping us on air.
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160]  I'm thanking you.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:44.160]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.160]  with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.160]  the true bone broth.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]  It is next level.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]  It really is good.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.160]  Well, thank you.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.160]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:45:22.160]  Thank you.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.160]  Thank you.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.160]  I'm going to go ahead and grab a pack of our
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:24.160]  black chewable tablets.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:54.160]  Thank you.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:00.160]  And get the visual.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:21.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:25.160]  It shows the manager asking the men to prove that they could pay before they ordered.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.160]  Susan Littlefield shows us how the story captured the country's attention.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.160]  We got to do it.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:32.160]  Hey, because you never have money when you come in here.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.160]  We never have money.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.160]  This video is the talk of the nation.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.160]  Her name was Dominique Moran.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.160]  She was a young lady from South Carolina who was going to college.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  She moved to Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:47.160]  She got a job at Chipotle, one of her two jobs.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160]  Remember her last year?
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:56.160]  That viral video where there's a woman behind the counter refusing to serve a group of innocent
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.160]  black Somalis.
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:05.160]  Well, later they had to admit once surveillance footage was released that these men resemble
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.160]  the exact men who kept coming in day after day and ordering the food.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  And then as soon as the food was brought forward, grabbing it and running out or swiping a bad credit card
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.160]  and grabbing the food and running out.
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:20.160]  But that didn't matter.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.160]  You see, these young men knew what they were doing.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:30.160]  They came in, large group, and started videotaping right away because this is the age of Jesse Smollett.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.160]  This is the age of theater.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:40.160]  This is the age of you don't just come into a restaurant and behave however you want and walk all over them.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.160]  No, no, no.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:47.160]  In the process, when people fight back, you then turn yourself into a victim.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:55.160]  Because that's the ultimate crime in the leftist world is fighting back against their rapacious activity.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.160]  But now, pigs are flying.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160]  Hell has frozen over.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:10.160]  CNN has come out and admitted that an internet mob falsely painted a chipotle employee as a rapist.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:14.160]  So, so.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.160]  But now, hell has frozen over.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.160]  Pigs are now flying.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:35.160]  CNN, one of the chief architects of this hoax last year, covering their ass from lawsuits, obviously, has come out and said how an internet mob falsely painted a chipotle employee as a racist.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.160]  It's ruined her life.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.160]  She lost her job.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.160]  She gets death threats everywhere.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.160]  Her name is all over the internet.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:53.160]  And all she did was stand up against what was obviously a criminal gang who will not respond back to CNN or anybody else.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.160]  But it fit into the Jesse Smollett narrative.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.160]  And that's how this whole system works.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:09.160]  We live in a country now under such mind control that AOC is out walking around community gardens in New York.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.160]  And says, look, cauliflower. It's white.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.160]  It's European.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160]  It's colonialism.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.160]  It shouldn't be here.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:23.160]  This plant is an invasive species.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:26.160]  Why is it yucca from Latin America being grown?
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.160]  Because it doesn't grow there, sweetheart.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:33.160]  And cauliflower is from Africa and the Middle East, dumbass.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:39.160]  But see, she's the perfect poster girl for the ignorance.
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.160]  Where the hall has the Irish name Lynch on it at a college.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.160]  They remove it because the word Lynch scares people.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:58.160]  Or Martin Luther King bust have been taken out at colleges because we talked about all the children together with God in the future.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:03.160]  He didn't have LGBT because those terms didn't exist then. He's got to come down.
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:10.160]  It's a way for the corporate system and the leftist universities to denounce everything and anything when they want.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:16.160]  And why is this story so important about this poor young lady whose life's been ruined?
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.160]  It's important because I experienced the exact same thing.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.160]  This isn't about me, but it's about how dangerous the left is.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:31.160]  It isn't just empire stars like Jesse Small at the stage events for ratings and money in racial division, who then gets off.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:36.160]  When I went into Lucy's Fried Chicken a few months ago, it was national news.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:42.160]  The leftist came to my table three times and said, we're going to get you. We're going to hurt you. You're going to die.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.160]  F you. Eat, eat, SH, you know what, T.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:53.160]  And finally, when I walked out from the inside area, the outside, they were waiting for me saying I was going to die.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:57.160]  And I finally stood up and said, F you back.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:03.160]  They all edited the video, uploaded to Reddit, tens of millions of views, Alex Jones attacks innocent people.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:08.160]  But you know what? The moral of the story is the left finally found a bottom.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:18.160]  The Austin American statesman sent their leftist head political reporter, Jonathan Till love, who'll probably get fired for this, to the restaurant.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.160]  And they said no, Mr. Jones was inside. He complained they were coming over, threatening him. He went outside.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.160]  He was already leaving. We didn't throw him out. We threw them out.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:32.160]  And the statesman didn't say Alex Jones vindicated the headline. Alex Jones stood up to bullies.
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.160]  They just said, OK, confrontation. And Alex Jones didn't start it.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:41.160]  But that was finally the left finding some semblance of a soul.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:46.160]  All the other publications that I attacked these people, just randomly in a restaurant.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.160]  F you son of a bitch, you want to fight? Let's go. Just randomly. I'm a crazy person.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.160]  And did CNN finally find its soul?
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.160]  This poor young woman didn't do a damn thing, but stand up against a bunch of thugs,
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:07.160]  using their color as an excuse to run around and engage in all sorts of bizarre activity.
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:14.160]  Because that's the truth, man. Cauliflower in races is a damn plant. Milk in races. Stuff that's white isn't racist.
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:20.160]  This is mental illness. And it's what our colleges have turned into. The chai comms don't put up with this.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.160]  They're funding all this mental illness here to bring us down.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:30.160]  We've got to reach out to the leftists. We've got to reach out to them because they have been so radicalized.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.160]  They have been so brainwashed. They really believe, folks, that we're all Nazis,
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:40.160]  but George Soros fought Nazis when it's the opposite.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:45.160]  But really what they are as followers, they could be white, they could be black, they could be old, they could be young,
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:51.160]  who are looking for a way to be in power, looking for a way to have value.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:57.160]  Instead of producing and being part of the American system, they see conquering America as a way to have power.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:01.160]  So if you can say you're being thrown out of restaurants and everybody's treating you bad,
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:06.160]  and if you can say cauliflower is racist, and if you can say Bernie Sanders holds up a piece of chicken that was good,
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:14.160]  he's racist, you think you can then dominate reality by labeling it what you want it to be so that you can be the victim.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:18.160]  The universe doesn't work like that. And this is a globalist psychological warfare program
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:22.160]  that has been put in place to cripple you.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:28.160]  I know our viewers and listeners, most of you, get this better than I, but I'm talking to the folks out there like Antifa,
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:34.160]  who all look like they're half dead, no methamphetamines, that literally believe that there shouldn't be free speech in this country,
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  and who are cheering on censorship and all this. You're authoritarians, you're dirtbags,
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:47.160]  and you're funded by the big corporate media and the big banks, and you're protected, you're the establishment.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  God Almighty.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:54.160]  The truth is CNN did this because their ratings have plunged to almost zero, and they're getting sued.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:56.160]  Word is they're getting sued over this.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:59.160]  They try to say Fox News and ABC said they're almost racist.
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:06.160]  No CNN, we all saw you top story for weeks. You were leading this.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:11.160]  And as it matter, you went back and changed all the headlines of the articles the way back machine and all the videos happened.
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:21.160]  And again, it just shows how, just like when Jesse Smallett or the Covington kids or anything, they just frame people.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:27.160]  But the truth is people are now going and checking on what you're reporting and finding out what liars you are.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.160]  That's it for this long live transmission.
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:34.160]  All these videos have been posted at infowords.com and newswords.com.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.160]  The globalists are blocking us and censoring us because the truth is effective.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:41.160]  But whether you're old, young, black, white, I don't give a rat's ass.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  If you love freedom and you love justice and you love speech, email these videos.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.160]  Text these messages, these video links.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.160]  Share them on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:52.160]  Stand up against the censorship.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.160]  And don't cheer when leftists get censored.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:57.160]  That's starting. This is all a corporate power grab.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:01.160]  Let's stand together or hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.160]  You got to go read CNN's article, though, man.
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:05.160]  They're really trying to cover their buck.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:09.160]  And it goes through all the horrible things you went through.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:15.160]  And the whole outrage mob on the Internet coming after her, destroy her, and how she got fired,
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.160]  and how she's collapsed, and has her life destroyed.
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:21.160]  Because she's a liberal.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:24.160]  She did everything she was supposed to do.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.160]  But she was just used as a tool on the larger agenda to destroy everybody.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.160]  She's just not the victim.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:34.160]  You want to be real victims? You leftists are the victims you say you want to be.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.160]  You're the victims of a corporate mind control program
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.160]  to make you a bunch of chip on the shoulder mental patients
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:45.160]  that'll never be able to get a job and never be able to figure out why you're so helpless.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.160]  The globalists don't want rugged individualists.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.160]  They don't want people to build their own systems.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.160]  They want followers. They want slaves.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:57.160]  Just like George Carlin always said.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:59.160]  It's a big globalist club and you ain't in it.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.160]  And the globalists are pushing racial division.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:03.160]  They're the ones pushing all of this.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:06.160]  I'm Alex Jones from FullWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:12.160]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.160]  Alright, we've got more live feeds coming up tonight at mfullwars.com
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.160]  Ford's last show to thank all our local TV and radio stations
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.160]  picking up the broadcast.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:23.160]  We're just pro-Americans promoting common sense and freedom.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.160]  That's why we're under attack.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.160]  We're against aborting babies after they're born.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.160]  We're against world government. We're against radical Islam.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.160]  We're against communism. So we're the bad guys.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:37.160]  But the truth is, the truth's resonating.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:39.160]  We're winning. Thanks to you.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:41.160]  So spread those links to newswars.com.
