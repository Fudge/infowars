[00:00.000 --> 00:13.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.280]  it's Sunday July 14th 2019 we're gonna be live here for the next two hours as I
[00:46.280 --> 00:56.280]  am every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time the Democratic Party has
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.900]  called for fire bombing ice facilities we have their quotes here they have
[01:00.900 --> 01:04.280]  called for killing ice officers they have called for abolishing the border
[01:04.280 --> 01:08.040]  completely and collapsing the nation for good making us a failed state like
[01:08.040 --> 01:13.200]  Mexico or beyond and now there was a firebombing yesterday of the building
[01:13.200 --> 01:21.320]  and cars the man firing a semi-automatic rifle at the ice individuals the local
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.840]  police showed up and shot the man dead he was instantly identified online as a
[01:26.840 --> 01:35.040]  member of antifa and the redneck revolt and he said that he was there to
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.640]  liberate the facility we have his manifesto it's up on info wars calm the
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.560]  governor being a terrorist being a Democrat came out and said that the man
[01:47.560 --> 01:53.360]  was there to burn up the illegal aliens they're actually running a hoax on CNN
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.280]  as of this morning saying the man is a right winger who was trying to burn up
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.480]  the people because Trump ordered him to stories up on info wars calm go watch the
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.400]  governor say it the governor says he did it for Trump these people will lie
[02:09.400 --> 02:13.520]  folks they will lie like nothing you've ever seen
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.240]  when shroyer went out to the holy legal alien probably legal a medium
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.520]  demonstration they had yesterday in Austin and the anti of a folks were
[02:22.520 --> 02:31.600]  wearing shirts that said smash ice and on the shirts shows ice having their
[02:31.600 --> 02:41.120]  face smashed in so that is the refrain so that's where all this is going armed
[02:41.120 --> 02:49.360]  rebellion in the United States against the idea of a border even existing and
[02:49.360 --> 02:56.200]  now the lefts believing its own propaganda even Joe Biden's being confronted
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.960]  all over the country from California to New Hampshire with crazy-eyed people
[03:00.960 --> 03:08.160]  going how dare you deport three million people under Obama and they all look
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.560]  like they've caught him and they're the moral superior people and Biden starts
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.160]  laughing at him and says yeah most of them were convicted felons criminals
[03:16.160 --> 03:24.840]  rapist murders they go we don't care no borders no wall no USA at all and so
[03:24.840 --> 03:32.800]  that's the fantasy land here that these folks believe in a very serious
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.720]  situation and when you watch the three or four videos that Owen shot live on
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.840]  the streets yesterday they're on info wars calm all of these people are white
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.560]  they're all telling us how bad white people are and they all look like they
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.680]  have chromosomal disorders and I don't say that with pleasure this is a very
[03:54.680 --> 03:59.800]  dangerous group of mutants that are somehow susceptible to the satanic
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.440]  signal that the globalist are putting out the fact they came over as they
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.400]  always do and said we love Satan we love the devil we love the stink we love
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.400]  being failures they try to try to rub their armpits on Owen and without
[04:12.400 --> 04:16.320]  looking I kept running into videos all over the country of the same thing we
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.400]  love Satan we love stinking we love killing children and then just giggling
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.120]  and laughing with pleasure and if you look at the women in these videos again
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.040]  they they look like they were babies never taken out of their cribs didn't
[04:29.040 --> 04:32.200]  get enough milk maybe they've done studies on them a lot of them have
[04:32.200 --> 04:38.520]  shriveled brains and this is what this is all come down to also groups have
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.800]  left us mainly white went and took over ice facilities and ran up Mexican flags
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.640]  in two locations across the United States that's all coming up but this is
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.040]  what America's total tolerance and paying for sex changes and all the rest of
[04:53.040 --> 05:01.920]  us cause giant groups are spoiled rotten babies that want war it's not only
[05:01.920 --> 05:05.440]  that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the
[05:05.440 --> 05:09.160]  other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.160]  reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's
[05:13.160 --> 05:16.760]  not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign
[05:16.760 --> 05:19.840]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old-school
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.840]  american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and
[05:24.840 --> 05:28.160]  freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[05:28.160 --> 05:31.240]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize
[05:31.240 --> 05:34.840]  organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and
[05:34.840 --> 05:38.040]  then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by
[05:38.040 --> 05:41.600]  big corporation or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[05:41.600 --> 05:45.760]  manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or
[05:45.760 --> 05:49.680]  hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the they are the bridge
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.680]  from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom
[05:53.680 --> 05:56.480]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[05:56.480 --> 06:02.120]  platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth
[06:02.120 --> 06:17.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[06:17.680 --> 06:37.480]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[06:37.480 --> 06:45.160]  ladies and gentlemen we're broadcasting worldwide on this sunday July 14th 2019
[06:45.160 --> 06:51.760]  global transmission info wars dot com and news wars dot com are the number one
[06:51.760 --> 06:56.080]  censored websites in the world but facebook last week officially calling
[06:56.080 --> 07:00.920]  for their 2.4 billion members to engage in violent attacks they said it is not
[07:00.920 --> 07:04.960]  violent in terms of service to organize alex jones and paul joseph watson's
[07:04.960 --> 07:10.520]  murder it became national news and facebook said oh that's a typo no it
[07:10.520 --> 07:15.960]  was very very clear that this is a test antifa across the country took down

[07:21.240 --> 07:24.880]  and giving you details of with our articles at news wars dot com next
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.320]  segment and we will also be getting into all of those facebook announcements how
[07:30.320 --> 07:33.840]  they're calling for terror attacks against myself paul watson and saying
[07:33.840 --> 07:40.680]  you're authorized promote up to their death so murder is their game you also
[07:40.680 --> 07:48.560]  have a facility in washington state that was fire bombed the building was
[07:48.560 --> 07:53.520]  fire bombed cars were fire bombed and terrorists who fire bombed ice facility
[07:53.520 --> 08:01.480]  wrote a manifesto i am antifa he was a member of the redneck revolt a grip
[08:01.480 --> 08:04.840]  it's already had some of their leaders arrested for going to trump
[08:04.840 --> 08:10.600]  supporters homes and threatening their small children with firearms that's
[08:10.600 --> 08:14.800]  right well he was a big member of that we have all the videos of him at their
[08:14.800 --> 08:19.800]  events upon info wars dot com terrorists who fire bombed ice facility wrote in
[08:19.800 --> 08:25.800]  manifesto i am antifa said attack was motivated by his opposition to
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.400]  concentration camps that's an article on info wars dot com and news wars dot
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.520]  com as of today the governor of the state is saying that it was a trump
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.920]  supporter trying to burn up the illegal aliens that is now all being announced
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.160]  but if you go to the info wars dot com article you can scroll down you just
[08:46.160 --> 08:55.400]  click on these hd photos from their own facebook and on their own facebook they
[08:55.400 --> 08:59.480]  have the man that was shot dead trying to kill police shooting at them after he
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.720]  was trying to burn down the ice facility successfully burned up some of the
[09:03.720 --> 09:13.600]  vehicles so ladies and gentlemen that is the point that we have reached here in
[09:13.600 --> 09:23.080]  this society in this culture and that is what the system is pushing and trying to
[09:23.080 --> 09:29.800]  conjure is an outright explosion of society and a revolution in the streets
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.840]  almost every netflix show has black people being oppressed in the future in
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.280]  the past in the current and illegal aliens revolting and the white people
[09:39.280 --> 09:44.440]  being devils and communists rising up and killing them and there are a lot of
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.600]  mentally ill weak-minded people but if you're a tv viewer you can see in the
[09:48.600 --> 09:57.780]  photo right there the anti-fabomber was a member of the Puget Sound JBGC and you
[09:57.780 --> 10:01.680]  can read right there they were also again part of the John Brown gun club
[10:01.680 --> 10:09.160]  John Brown famously went around shooting and killing people and so that is part
[10:09.160 --> 10:14.080]  of that fan club they have been coming out to Trump events all over the country
[10:14.080 --> 10:19.480]  threatening to blow people's heads off including Owen shroyer on the streets of
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.560]  Austin trying to simply go to a vigil for a woman shot and killed by an illegal
[10:23.560 --> 10:27.200]  alien in the back they would not let him out of the park the Austin police let
[10:27.200 --> 10:33.360]  them brandish AK-47s and threatened to kill Owen part of the John Brown gun
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.600]  club of course the John Brown fan club and gun club is also something with the
[10:39.600 --> 10:44.400]  new black panther party supports they go around saying oink oink bang bang kill
[10:44.400 --> 10:49.400]  the police and our own Owen shroyer again went out to the illegal alien
[10:49.400 --> 10:55.840]  sanctuary city events that took place Saturday here in Austin and cities all
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.760]  over the country and people were wearing shirts saying smash fascism
[11:01.760 --> 11:09.040]  showing anti-fub punching ice officers in the face and I also have the articles
[11:09.040 --> 11:11.320]  here I'll get to later where we have different Hollywood stars and others
[11:11.320 --> 11:18.160]  remember calling for firebombing ice facilities I don't have to fear because
[11:18.160 --> 11:27.360]  CNN profiled the very same redneck revolt John Brown gun club in Washington the
[11:27.360 --> 11:37.480]  very man who did this was profiled in the group as a hero fighting Nazis and so
[11:37.480 --> 11:45.200]  that is exactly what's going on here and these people mean business anyone who
[11:45.200 --> 11:49.480]  disagrees with them it doesn't want world government doesn't want communism is
[11:49.480 --> 11:57.040]  a Nazi then on the left side they're famous hiring actors and others to pose
[11:57.040 --> 12:03.120]  as Nazis it was even in mainstream news that Charlottesville a year and a half
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.240]  ago or so actually hired a bunch of crisis actors to come augment the real
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.280]  Nazis and play as role players you can actually hire these companies to rent a
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.080]  mob to rent demonstrations they call them Astro turf first time I ever saw
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.240]  this was like 15 years ago in New York I went out to cover the UN event and there
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.720]  were thousands of people getting off buses being handed their signs that
[12:27.720 --> 12:31.520]  looked like they were handmade but have been mass produced and they were being
[12:31.520 --> 12:35.600]  told off a script what to say that's why the rest of them never talk when you go
[12:35.600 --> 12:40.440]  up these leftist events 99% don't talk except one leader that's because these
[12:40.440 --> 12:47.640]  are hired individuals ladies and gentlemen only paid about $200 a day to
[12:47.640 --> 12:54.080]  go out and do what they do true useful idiots in every way so we come back I'm
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.200]  gonna get into the details of where the American flags were pulled down the
[12:57.200 --> 13:01.560]  Mexican flags were run up that's on news wars.com we have the cities the specifics
[13:01.560 --> 13:05.400]  show you all that video then we're gonna get into the specific videos that we
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.480]  also have one in fours.com of the terror group that this gentleman was a part of
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.920]  and video and photos of him brandishing firearms at Trump events threatening to
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.840]  kill people and CNN again profiled them as wonderful wonderful people I've been
[13:22.840 --> 13:28.240]  telling you this is coming when you have Joe Biden saying that we're gonna get
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.120]  physical now to take over the country and you've got any means necessary out of
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.880]  all these politicians mouths and AOC and Ilhan Omar saying you know that
[13:37.880 --> 13:42.240]  America is fundamentally bad now we have new clips of that coming up they're not
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.360]  going to stop ladies gentlemen they believe we're weak they believe we put
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.840]  up with so much of this in the past and Antifa is funded by big foundation
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.120]  money George Soros Alexander Soros part of the State Department still funding
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.360]  them Trump hasn't reversed that yet the because there's all this previous funding
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.840]  put into government endowments and private endowments to carry this out
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.640]  we're facing hundreds of billions of dollars that's been invested to take
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.760]  this country down and to capture it. This has been done by powerful multinational
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.320]  corporations that are using leftist rena mobs as their front for the
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.520]  stabilization but make no mistake ahead of 2020 we're now only a year and a
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.560]  quarter out from the real heart of that election the elections already really
[14:25.560 --> 14:31.880]  kicked off we're just a few months away from you know the actual year 2020 then
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.360]  we're just eight nine months to the countdown so this is an incredible time
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.120]  to be alive and that's why they want a silenced that's why they want Christians
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.800]  and conservatives and libertarians and nationalist and pro-gun groups and
[14:44.800 --> 14:49.280]  pro-family groups taken off the air taken off the internet because they're
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.680]  planning big moves they're going for broke they're going to go all the way
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.440]  and the fact that you are seeing them begin these violent attacks and that the
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.480]  governor I have the article we come back that the governor of the state or this
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.760]  firebombing an attack happened where he was trying to kill ICE trying to burn
[15:10.760 --> 15:18.280]  the building down that he did it for Trump these people have no bottom they
[15:18.280 --> 15:24.240]  will do anything anytime so whatever you do whether you're listening on AM FM the
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.840]  internet shortwave however you're listening it is job number one that
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.080]  this transmission but they've admitted that the Trump social media censorship
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.040]  summit info wars is the number one target of censorship for a reason we
[15:37.040 --> 15:41.120]  work hard we're focused we're dedicated and we've helped with your help build a
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.840]  resistance for the globalists that's kicking their butt but if we're not on
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.000]  the air to fight in this next year and a half the globalists believe they can
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.920]  win believe they can move so to boil that down when they're able to shut down
[15:52.920 --> 15:56.520]  independent media they're going to make their fascist move keeping everybody on
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.680]  air keeps them at bay

[17:14.640 --> 17:19.760]  epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[17:19.760 --> 17:26.320]  know is right and what they know is true as long as we stay true to our clothes

[18:00.920 --> 18:04.280]  Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air thanks for holding yeah I just want
[18:04.280 --> 18:07.960]  to say your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a lot of people here out
[18:07.960 --> 18:11.800]  in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[18:11.800 --> 18:15.680]  with these wars I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.000]  go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.920]  defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it I mean if
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.000]  Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way I
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.720]  think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be
[18:28.720 --> 18:31.800]  praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex
[18:31.800 --> 18:35.200]  is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived

[20:48.280 --> 20:54.840]  Broadcast so we've got American flags getting pulled down at ice centers we've
[20:54.840 --> 21:00.440]  got fire bombings we've got people shooting trying to kill police and the
[21:00.440 --> 21:06.560]  left is praising it on one hand separately the governor of Washington
[21:06.560 --> 21:10.800]  state saying he was there trying to burn up the precious illegal aliens and
[21:10.800 --> 21:17.520]  behind this is the giant hoax that there's concentration camps and that
[21:17.520 --> 21:20.840]  we're killing people the truth is hundreds of thousands have died in
[21:20.840 --> 21:25.640]  Mexico it's a failed state Latin America is collapsing thousands a week starved
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.880]  death in Venezuela people are trying to make it here in mass they are smuggling
[21:30.880 --> 21:34.760]  children they're smuggling drugs they're coming across with diseases and we're
[21:34.760 --> 21:39.080]  not doing one tent the searching and checking we did at the Statue of Liberty
[21:39.080 --> 21:44.040]  and Ellis Island but all of these weak-minded individuals who literally
[21:44.040 --> 21:47.320]  look like they've been put in a microwave oven when you look at all the
[21:47.320 --> 21:51.840]  anti-fun leftist believe they're fighting fascists believe they're fighting
[21:51.840 --> 21:56.520]  Nazis believe like in some virtual reality they're captain America battling
[21:56.520 --> 22:04.280]  red skull and you read this guy's manifesto we'll get to in a moment he
[22:04.280 --> 22:07.600]  talks about the dream and how great his life is and now he finally gets to fight
[22:07.600 --> 22:13.680]  Nazis and how the trans community taught him to be battle ready I'm not
[22:13.680 --> 22:21.280]  kidding and that they are the vanguard that will save everyone and how it's
[22:21.280 --> 22:25.680]  just time to start killing anybody that's in law enforcement or that supports
[22:25.680 --> 22:30.040]  Trump and the communist overthrow is gonna be beautiful don't think about it
[22:30.040 --> 22:36.000]  just do it I'm gonna read it to you in a minute and that they have to kill Warren
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.240]  Buffett and Elon Musk and all these other people by the way Elon Musk wants
[22:40.240 --> 22:45.480]  real freedom and real empowerment for folks overall and Warren Buffett's the
[22:45.480 --> 22:49.320]  biggest recipient of the Baker bailout and is a globalist insider he pushes all
[22:49.320 --> 22:52.680]  this fake leftist garbage about higher taxes because he actually gets that tax
[22:52.680 --> 22:57.760]  money but most of the people he lists as manifesto other than that like Buffett
[22:57.760 --> 23:01.560]  and others are the globalist financing the very antifa movement through
[23:01.560 --> 23:08.440]  George Soros it's incredible these people are so stupid but first stories on
[23:08.440 --> 23:13.040]  news wars calm let us replace us flag with Mexican flag outside ice facility

[23:23.680 --> 23:28.320]  nation's lands let us remove the US flag and replace it with a Mexican flag
[23:28.320 --> 23:32.640]  outside an ice processing center in Aurora, Colorado to protest the
[23:32.640 --> 23:36.600]  detention of illegal immigrants and upcoming deportation rates folks they
[23:36.600 --> 23:46.720]  release 90% of them and again 90% never show up to their amnesty to their court
[23:46.720 --> 23:54.320]  hearings for political or religious asylum they're not coming here for asylum
[23:54.320 --> 23:57.720]  they're coming here for the welfare and to be inducted into the Democrat
[23:57.720 --> 24:04.360]  control system it's up 635 percent from Obama to Trump we're being bum rushed
[24:04.360 --> 24:08.800]  Europe's being bum rushed this is organized and these people sit there
[24:08.800 --> 24:13.560]  freaking out and crying going oh my gosh the Nazis they're killing them inside
[24:13.560 --> 24:19.120]  and it's all made up hoaxes coming up the former head of the board patrol talks
[24:19.120 --> 24:23.120]  about what it's like to open a tractor trailer up when the cartels aren't paid
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.120]  all the money they want there's 15 20 30 40 50 dead men women and children hugging
[24:29.120 --> 24:33.320]  their children dead who died in 150 degree heat in the back of the trailer
[24:33.320 --> 24:37.880]  just because the coyotes felt like killing them they find them dead every
[24:37.880 --> 24:44.520]  week in the Southwest in 18 Wheeler the smugglers get them across they don't pay
[24:44.520 --> 24:50.400]  the final leg somebody doesn't wire the money everybody dies and that is
[24:50.400 --> 24:56.720]  gringo's fault El Norte's fault you don't see these folks the meth head
[24:56.720 --> 25:00.880]  professors and all the anti-faculty and bitching about that no no no it's all
[25:00.880 --> 25:05.120]  how it's all how well the women's facilities and for the kids are real
[25:05.120 --> 25:09.160]  nice with big movie screens remember the mineral crowded in your damn right
[25:09.160 --> 25:12.440]  they're crowded in Congress wouldn't fund building more centers they're
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.400]  simply checking them for disease and finding out they're not already a
[25:15.400 --> 25:22.560]  convicted murderer and they turn them loose that that needs to be changed this
[25:22.560 --> 25:29.640]  is crazy but the left's been told any control the border is pure evil but oh
[25:29.640 --> 25:32.440]  the left will throw you off their evergreen college in Washington state
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.960]  if you're white they have no white people weekends and no white people
[25:36.960 --> 25:40.120]  allowed at the sir that area white people got to pay more to get into a rap
[25:40.120 --> 25:45.000]  concert all this racist crap from Antifa and the left that is funded by the
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.440]  establishment they're the useful idiot cannon fodder on the ground now there's
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.960]  several videos on info wars.com and news wars.com but everybody's got to go look
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.440]  at this because if you look at the video up close it's all a bunch of old hippies
[25:59.440 --> 26:05.600]  and a bunch of Antifa and hardly any Mexicans but Mexicans on average are
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.520]  very nationalistic if they're from Mexico and they run up the Mexican flag
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.440]  and everybody's like whoa because the left identifies taking the country down
[26:15.440 --> 26:34.120]  with success here's that video
[26:34.120 --> 26:40.360]  so there are illegal aliens leftist Antifa cheering the American flag being
[26:40.360 --> 26:45.200]  taken down the Mexican flag being run up this is about being conquered people are
[26:45.200 --> 26:51.360]  fleeing Mexico's it's failed but they want you to now become Mexico with all
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.320]  the trappings of that now let's get into the manifesto itself you won't hear
[26:56.320 --> 27:05.160]  about on CNN you're gonna hear he was trying to burn up the poor people in
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.600]  the processing center that's what you're hearing from the governor you talk
[27:09.600 --> 27:14.480]  about lying and when you read over this the terrorists who fire bombed the ice
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.600]  facility in Washington State your stay release a manifesto before the attack
[27:19.600 --> 27:25.000]  stating I am Antifa and said the attack was motivated by his opposition to
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.120]  concentration camps close quote the United States 69 year old William van
[27:31.120 --> 27:35.960]  sportson was shot dead by police had been through mall off cocktails the
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.760]  building and nearby cars on Saturday morning according to his manifesto a
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.160]  copy of which was obtained by Jack Pacific van sportson was armed the
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.720]  they are 15 and stated I am Antifa the rest of the manifestos a rambling
[27:51.720 --> 27:55.560]  advocacy of identity politics mixed with a stereo about concentration camps
[27:55.560 --> 28:00.120]  was clearly suggest that van sportson was radicalized by fringe rhetoric from
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.080]  the likes of Alexandria Cortez or AOC at one point in the manifesto van
[28:06.080 --> 28:10.920]  sportson thanks his trans comrades close quote explains that he was armed
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.160]  with a semi-automatic weapon suggesting he clearly planned to commit a
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.080]  massacre yeah I was shooting a police the Antifa gun club that van sportson
[28:19.080 --> 28:26.360]  attended also lock its Twitter down following the revelations but not

[32:01.320 --> 32:04.120]  Marcus you're on the air thanks for holding yeah yeah I just want to say
[32:04.120 --> 32:07.680]  your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a lot of people here out in
[32:07.680 --> 32:11.560]  New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with
[32:11.560 --> 32:15.480]  these wars I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to
[32:15.480 --> 32:19.280]  a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in
[32:19.280 --> 32:23.240]  the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it I mean if Trump buys into
[32:23.240 --> 32:26.040]  this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way I think he can be
[32:26.040 --> 32:29.120]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend I
[32:29.120 --> 32:32.040]  agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're
[32:32.040 --> 32:35.600]  trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man I would
[32:35.600 --> 32:39.040]  love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love to see what you're

[32:50.880 --> 32:54.960]  war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that

[33:13.280 --> 33:20.040]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[33:20.040 --> 33:23.680]  lines of the info war
[33:23.680 --> 33:33.400]  I can't even believe I'm saying it here's an example I'm gonna cover this
[33:33.400 --> 33:43.920]  the last two segments of the show today I got a call well first Joe Biggs came
[33:43.920 --> 33:50.600]  up to me he was working for info wars in 2016 in July we had platinum passes
[33:50.600 --> 33:56.320]  they're actually bright red the best passes you can get at the RNC they were
[33:56.320 --> 34:00.000]  behind the scenes through the Secret Service I could walk right up to the
[34:00.000 --> 34:08.120]  rooms the president was in just I mean I had the best passes and so the Secret
[34:08.120 --> 34:13.240]  Service I'd given those passes to Biggs that like eight of them the Secret
[34:13.240 --> 34:16.800]  Service come over to Biggs they're like hey we love what you're doing with Hillary
[34:16.800 --> 34:22.080]  and all the rest of stuff by the way she had major medical problems and do you
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.280]  know about them and Biggs is like we'll know I've you know I've seen drudge
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.840]  talk about it stuff that's really your first question that there's a photo
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.480]  of Biggs and I at the RNC and they told Biggs well in about three weeks we're
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.600]  gonna contact you or your boss and give you the inside scoop it'll be an
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.480]  intermediary it actually wasn't the Secret Service after that it was someone
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.080]  from another federal agency came to Austin and I'm not gonna get into the
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.120]  details but it's like you see in movies where you meet in a parking garage
[34:51.120 --> 34:56.880]  basically this was in between two parking garages and they they told me the
[34:56.880 --> 35:00.920]  whole deal she said brain tumors she said they have to take her out the
[35:00.920 --> 35:06.600]  medication so she can give a speech but then when she goes off it she has
[35:06.600 --> 35:12.960]  seizures up to every hour and you have to understand I came on air in August with
[35:12.960 --> 35:16.400]  Joe Biggs we've got to find those interviews and I said the Secret Service
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.440]  says she has a black ambulance and that we've got to follow her around the
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.360]  country and that will catch her collapsing and that they have tents in
[35:25.360 --> 35:31.320]  case she collapses always set up behind wherever she's speaking well Millie
[35:31.320 --> 35:35.520]  Weaver a few weeks later caught him again in Cleveland she traveled to
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.440]  Cleveland and Hillary was in a tent for an hour later came out we've got those
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.720]  reports somewhere a lot of you heard them or saw them and then we didn't catch
[35:45.720 --> 35:59.120]  it we didn't catch it but who did catch it was a Dutch videographer on 9 11 a
[35:59.120 --> 36:05.800]  Dutch videographer on 9 11 just a month later or less in DC when she falls down
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.400]  and has the convulsion they throw in the back of the car like a side of beef I
[36:11.400 --> 36:17.680]  shot a special report on this yesterday and I guess we got busy or whatever but
[36:17.680 --> 36:23.880]  in the special report we didn't add her collapsing into the black ambulance we're
[36:23.880 --> 36:27.960]  gonna add that the special report we're gonna air that at the end of the show
[36:27.960 --> 36:34.800]  today and we also were unable to dig up the original Millie Weaver report where
[36:34.800 --> 36:38.760]  she's collapsed inside the tent you'd think something like that would be like
[36:38.760 --> 36:45.760]  re-airing old Super Bowl clips or something but I will assure you that I
[36:45.760 --> 36:51.440]  could find the videos and so I'm gonna stay here tonight one way or the other
[36:51.440 --> 36:57.120]  because I was up here all day yesterday and and they found the video they just
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.680]  put another shot of another ambulance following her we broke the black
[37:01.680 --> 37:08.640]  ambulance bigger than Dallas Texas here in probably 10 shows and then it all
[37:08.640 --> 37:12.920]  happened just like we said now guess who does know how accurate we are
[37:12.920 --> 37:17.160]  Hillary Rodham Clinton that's why she's financed all these lawsuits it's why she
[37:17.160 --> 37:20.800]  basically wants me dead if anything happens to me her and her criminal
[37:20.800 --> 37:26.400]  combat of the number one suspects but we're gonna find the old Joe Biggs
[37:26.400 --> 37:31.360]  interviews and my announcements here from August 2016 if you can find them on
[37:31.360 --> 37:34.000]  YouTube or something send them to us remember all our YouTube stuff got
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.120]  taken down we've got it somewhere here in our archives and we're gonna show you
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.480]  where I laid out the specifics of she has a black ambulance before it ever
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.160]  been seen and how she's fallen down every hour or so and then magically a
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.120]  month later it happened because why am I bringing up this old news I got a call
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.760]  from similar type folks that have given us good info before and they said
[37:56.760 --> 38:00.960]  listen Joe Biden's mad the Democrats were throwing him out of the bus he's mad
[38:00.960 --> 38:04.120]  that they're pulling up all these race card things he's having a lot of health
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.040]  problems at 76 he's slurring his words he's shooting his mouth off behind the
[38:08.040 --> 38:13.640]  scene saying I'm gonna drop out f this these people don't appreciate me screw
[38:13.640 --> 38:18.840]  the Democratic Party if they keep this up I'm gonna bring dirt on everybody I'm
[38:18.840 --> 38:25.440]  being told this last Wednesday then I see on Friday night a speech he gave where
[38:25.440 --> 38:32.760]  he's slurring his words he can't talk and he says why am I here why am I doing
[38:32.760 --> 38:38.960]  this it just walks off the stage so I shot a special report last night on this
[38:38.960 --> 38:43.360]  and we're gonna update it a little bit with a few of the clips I just mentioned
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.320]  and then we're gonna air that in the last two segments tonight because I'm not
[38:48.320 --> 38:59.720]  saying 100% he is gonna drop out but the same caliber of sources told us that he's
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.920]  saying he's planning to and if you look at where everything's going I think that
[39:03.920 --> 39:10.880]  sounds very very credible now listen I went out on a limb three years ago three
[39:10.880 --> 39:17.040]  plus years ago I guess right about three years ago now when the RNC was
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.640]  happening like didn't Trump even give his speech like tonight three years ago I
[39:21.640 --> 39:28.080]  forget the point is right around this time but the secret service by then
[39:28.080 --> 39:32.120]  hated Hillary so much that we were being cheered all over the city of Cleveland
[39:32.120 --> 39:38.320]  going through secret service checkpoints we'd get pulled over going
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.880]  through the checkpoints with our Cleveland PD escorts and they you know
[39:42.880 --> 39:46.880]  sometimes look at the back and see all our guns and wave us through but the
[39:46.880 --> 39:52.200]  point is is that this was secret service telling us that we were gonna get this
[39:52.200 --> 39:56.200]  information and I was behind the scenes being told this big was told it I was
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.840]  also told it so I was waiting for the info it came through and it was solid
[40:00.840 --> 40:09.160]  gold now I was also told about Lolita Express and about Jeffrey Epstein and
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.680]  about the flight logs and about all the kids and about the initials and the
[40:12.680 --> 40:18.320]  flight logs and Dan Bongino on this show like four years ago in the middle of the
[40:18.320 --> 40:22.440]  campaign said Hillary better watch it because a lot of secret service agents
[40:22.440 --> 40:27.000]  saw what was going on raised the alarm so Bill Clinton stopped tearing his
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.480]  secret service detail with him so oh Fox News the Wall Street Journal New York
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.320]  Times everything you know about Jeffrey Epstein I told you about Jeffrey Epstein
[40:36.320 --> 40:42.880]  ten years ago now he was a CIA deep state slash possibly Mossad person using
[40:42.880 --> 40:48.880]  sex operatives and underage kids to frame people for international espionage
[40:48.880 --> 40:54.520]  that's now come out in the news and we told you about his island ten years ago
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.480]  and we had guest on that told you about the flight logs all of this hell we were
[40:59.480 --> 41:06.040]  talking about the flight logs and all this four years ago with Roger Stone he
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.480]  wrote a book about it so you got it all here first so when I get up here and I
[41:10.480 --> 41:14.440]  shoot a special report saying our high-level sources say Biden shooting
[41:14.440 --> 41:21.120]  his mouth off about quitting you see it in videos where Democrats go you hate
[41:21.120 --> 41:25.160]  Mexicans you deported three million people and he goes first off a bunch of
[41:25.160 --> 41:28.160]  more Mexicans and a lot of more murderers and killers what are you supposed
[41:28.160 --> 41:33.200]  to do I'm proud of that they just start screaming at him and and and Biden has
[41:33.200 --> 41:38.880]  basically just had enough now are my sources suddenly lying to me well all
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.640]  they gave me was good info before maybe now they're giving or maybe Biden
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.760]  doesn't mean it maybe he's throwing a fit I probably say every day around the
[41:46.760 --> 41:52.520]  office ought to just quit I don't mean it but this is big news I mean we don't
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.520]  make stuff up we said she's got a black ambulance she's falling down every hour
[41:57.520 --> 42:02.600]  the Secret Service said listen that's all we're gonna tell you look into her
[42:02.600 --> 42:08.240]  having brain surgeries for tumors that's our own record and they said just go
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.160]  research it and you got a lot of crew right just follow around the campaign
[42:12.160 --> 42:16.240]  trail follow the ambulances follow the medical tents they're having to help her
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.960]  walk they got to take her off the drugs they said we're not exactly sure if it's
[42:20.960 --> 42:29.960]  a brain tumor back or or what it is but she's going downhill and it happened it
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.280]  was all there it all happened exactly the way we said and I'm gonna find the
[42:34.280 --> 42:37.640]  articles now I'm gonna find the videos the headline to search me something like
[42:37.640 --> 42:44.320]  this Secret Service says Hillary Clinton having convulsions info wars.com but
[42:44.320 --> 42:50.840]  doesn't matter I will find it I will get I will play it if the hair lifts the
[42:50.840 --> 42:54.720]  admiral and the water rises over Bear Creek we are still gonna give you that
[42:54.720 --> 43:05.720]  back to the Antifa Manifesto when we come back so the Info Wars model is a
[43:05.720 --> 43:09.920]  self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and
[43:09.920 --> 43:13.280]  free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.800]  sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale
[43:17.800 --> 43:22.120]  of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[43:22.120 --> 43:26.120]  self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic
[43:26.120 --> 43:29.720]  structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the
[43:29.720 --> 43:33.200]  audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[43:33.200 --> 43:36.720]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.600]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they
[43:40.600 --> 43:44.080]  want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability
[43:44.080 --> 43:48.360]  to do that and at the same time support press support speech support letting the
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.120]  audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold and
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.000]  it's the ultimate American Democratic expression and experiment and it is the
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.680]  celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[44:00.680 --> 44:07.000]  Info Wars the most banned network in the world yours and listeners I wouldn't be
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.240]  here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.200]  seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.000]  tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.480]  week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars you
[44:22.480 --> 44:26.000]  went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I feel very strong and I
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.600]  feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart don't you know
[44:29.600 --> 44:32.800]  that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.960]  with your word of mouth and your prayers your financial support because I'm
[44:35.960 --> 44:40.640]  committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm gonna be
[44:40.640 --> 44:44.440]  destroyed and it's not gonna be fun but that's not what's important the enemy
[44:44.440 --> 44:48.640]  could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God you're
[44:48.640 --> 44:52.440]  being used by God this is Providence so I salute you and I thank you for all
[44:52.440 --> 44:58.240]  you've done from the bottom of my heart Info Wars the most banned network in
[44:58.240 --> 45:03.040]  the world talk to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air thanks for
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.160]  holding yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a
[45:07.160 --> 45:10.440]  lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that
[45:10.440 --> 45:14.880]  almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.840]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.600]  could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it
[45:22.600 --> 45:25.800]  I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.800]  way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.080]  praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is
[45:32.080 --> 45:35.840]  I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man I
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.280]  would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I would love to see
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.920]  what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[45:42.920 --> 45:47.360]  gone into this war you won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[45:47.360 --> 45:51.040]  like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.840]  the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a
[45:54.840 --> 45:59.000]  fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.720]  calling I just want listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this
[46:04.720 --> 46:08.680]  stand against us and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info
[46:08.680 --> 46:13.360]  war 50% off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff
[46:13.360 --> 46:15.960]  we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.680]  moving a ton of okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or
[46:19.680 --> 46:22.560]  something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the
[46:22.560 --> 46:25.040]  infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.520]  millions and millions and millions of dollars a product I want to expand not
[46:28.520 --> 46:32.200]  contract and for six months we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.480]  winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this I like
[46:36.480 --> 46:39.240]  to be expanding I like to be winning I like to be fighting and we are winning

[46:42.680 --> 46:46.040]  be tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have time to get it to dry up we
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.440]  got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.800]  really gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me or you or
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.040]  anybody else me the Democrats now we're going into a full revolutionary fervor
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.120]  funded by foreign banks the chai comps so go to infowarstore.com
[47:02.120 --> 47:07.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:21.320 --> 47:29.600]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's alex jones
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.840]  ladies and gentlemen so much news is breaking at infowars.com and newswars.com
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.960]  that I can't even keep track of it we have stacks of articles where Hollywood
[47:39.960 --> 47:44.720]  scum and others have called for burning down ice facilities where antifa has
[47:44.720 --> 47:49.760]  called for it Ilhan Omar has called for eradicating the existence of ice we
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.840]  have another video where she says that she's a better American than natural
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.640]  born that she's gonna teach you how to be an American her evil is only outdone
[47:58.640 --> 48:06.440]  by her arrogance it is it is simply insane simply insane so we're gonna be
[48:06.440 --> 48:11.240]  going over all of that in his manifesto here in just a moment you know I mentioned
[48:11.240 --> 48:17.040]  our articles and videos from August of last year I mean August of 2016 three
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.400]  years ago saying that Hillary Clinton was having convulsions and collapsing
[48:21.400 --> 48:30.200]  according to Secret Service being put into a black special ambulance well the
[48:30.200 --> 48:36.960]  video the articles of the the photos are all right here on infowars.com
[48:36.960 --> 48:45.880]  that's infowars.com infowars.com Secret Service leaks Hillary's health to the
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.320]  press this is our article and I'm going to find the interviews I did
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.600]  specifically saying black ambulance before it was ever seen and one month
[48:55.600 --> 49:02.320]  before she collapsed why am I saying that the same type of sources have given
[49:02.320 --> 49:07.800]  us other good information say Biden is saying he's going to drop out of the
[49:07.800 --> 49:13.680]  race now maybe he's only angry the way he's being thrown to the bus I don't
[49:13.680 --> 49:21.960]  know but that's what we've run with because it's come from sources that were
[49:21.960 --> 49:27.640]  real Secret Service and so if they were wrong I would just say they're wrong but
[49:27.640 --> 49:32.680]  it's still a credible source nobody's perfect people change their minds but
[49:32.680 --> 49:35.880]  why would they say she's in a black ambulance and just look for the black
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.320]  ambulance and that she's having convulsions all the time Joe Biggs was
[49:40.320 --> 49:46.320]  told this I was told this I was told I wasn't to be given more info then the
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.960]  meeting was why aren't you catching it it's happening just put your reporters
[49:50.960 --> 49:56.240]  on her ass the rest of media knows the left's covering it all up and it turned
[49:56.240 --> 49:59.520]  out we will catch her falling down and being picked up we catch her shaking and
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.480]  disappearing we caught it in Austin we caught it in Cleveland but somebody else
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.720]  caught it again just a citizen journalist from the Netherlands when she
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.040]  completely collapsed having a convulsion so I'm already digressing into this
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.360]  aren't I when I tell you that this is big that they're saying Joe Biden is
[50:18.360 --> 50:21.880]  saying I'm sick of this why am I doing this I want to get out of this the
[50:21.880 --> 50:25.440]  Democratic Party are idiots they are destroying themselves where they are
[50:25.440 --> 50:31.520]  morons it's the same thing that Pelosi saying to Ilhan Omar and AOC and the
[50:31.520 --> 50:35.600]  rest of them and so maybe he's just venting but that story is on info wars
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.960]  dot com I didn't just grab that out of the air and then just decide to say
[50:40.960 --> 50:51.600]  that now there's a story at info wars dot com and news wars dot com that just
[50:51.600 --> 50:56.400]  broke it just broke ladies and gentlemen so I'm gonna read it to you from right
[50:56.400 --> 51:07.160]  here and this is a big deal it's a very big deal and everyone needs to
[51:07.160 --> 51:13.680]  understand this woman is a monster this is again at info wars dot com Ilhan
[51:13.680 --> 51:17.720]  Omar calls for eliminating existence of border patrol officers Congresswoman
[51:17.720 --> 51:21.440]  Ilhan Omar has called for eliminating patrol officers because of their views
[51:21.440 --> 51:26.840]  towards black and brown people despite the fact that 51% of CPB agents are
[51:26.840 --> 51:33.480]  Latino and this is her calling for this just days ago and now you see this fire
[51:33.480 --> 51:36.920]  bombing attack we have rogue agencies that have no accountability no
[51:36.920 --> 51:40.200]  transparency in how they are conducting their businesses we know they have
[51:40.200 --> 51:44.360]  spoken in the most vile ways about immigrants we know they have certain
[51:44.360 --> 51:48.840]  views about what brown and black people deserve said Omar total out of control
[51:48.840 --> 51:53.680]  race baiting will have that video for you when we come back so we should be
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.120]  having conversation about eliminating their existence she added before
[51:57.120 --> 52:00.360]  accusing war patrol agents of terrorizing migrants according to customs
[52:00.360 --> 52:04.080]  and border protection over half the agents who guard the borders between the
[52:04.080 --> 52:08.320]  u.s. and Mexico the u.s. and Canadian or Hispanic number is from 2008 was
[52:08.320 --> 52:13.760]  probably even higher now probability to portray CPB agents is some kind of
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.120]  vanguard watch premises clearly wholly inaccurate and hysterical this is par
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.000]  for the course when it comes to ill on Omar the left crusade against border
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.640]  security has kicked in the high gear the New York Times publishing an op-ed this
[52:26.640 --> 52:30.920]  past weekend the call for the doxing and public harassment of border patrol agents
[52:30.920 --> 52:37.240]  and now Antifa wears the shirts all over the country showing border patrol
[52:37.240 --> 52:44.120]  being killed police being killed stabbed with bayonets punch in the face and it
[52:44.120 --> 52:51.600]  says we beat them in the 1940s we can beat them again and it's nothing but
[52:51.600 --> 52:58.760]  delusional low IQ method types who believe though they're literally again
[52:58.760 --> 53:04.640]  Captain America fighting Red Skull so I will get to the manifesto I will get to
[53:04.640 --> 53:08.160]  Ilhan Omar I will get to the firebombing attack and the shooting attack on the
[53:08.160 --> 53:14.920]  ice facility by a known Antifa militarized unit that's the most
[53:14.920 --> 53:18.840]  militarized and the most violent the most extreme of the terror organization
[53:18.840 --> 53:24.720]  Antifa and this guy went and firebomb and shot up this the facility shot at the
[53:24.720 --> 53:28.920]  police and got killed said he was going to do it and the governor says he went
[53:28.920 --> 53:36.920]  to hurt the ice detainees that stories on info wars.com and news wars.com as
[53:36.920 --> 53:41.120]  well that's the magnitude of these people it's not just that they're out
[53:41.120 --> 53:47.640]  killing people it's that we're trying to kill people it's that they then have the
[53:47.640 --> 53:52.560]  media lie about who they are and what they're doing and they think they're
[53:52.560 --> 54:00.760]  rock stars in these mental illness bubbles of New York City, Portland, Oregon,
[54:00.760 --> 54:07.200]  Seattle, Washington, San Francisco, California and LA they're just crazy people
[54:07.200 --> 54:10.880]  that work for multinational corporations work for George Soros an actual
[54:10.880 --> 54:17.600]  Nazi collaborator and they are just the weakest-minded followers who now think
[54:17.600 --> 54:22.880]  it's their green light their wink and a nod to go out and attack people it's very
[54:22.880 --> 54:30.480]  interesting the most ever Democrats most ever white because that's who went
[54:30.480 --> 54:36.040]  around harassing black people in the 50s and 60s and 70s was again white
[54:36.040 --> 54:40.920]  Democrats but now they're still a racially based system but now they see
[54:40.920 --> 54:45.400]  the numbers are dwindling white population so they jump on board be the
[54:45.400 --> 54:50.200]  biggest cheerleaders that white people are the devil truly the scum of the
[54:50.200 --> 54:53.960]  earth we've got so much more to get to today but these people mean business and
[54:53.960 --> 54:59.480]  we've told you the violent attacks are gonna intensify and the fact that blue
[54:59.480 --> 55:04.640]  cities defend and protect these slime bags everywhere has only encouraged it
[55:04.640 --> 55:09.360]  to get worse so I promise I'm gonna be a little bit more not not not focused but
[55:09.360 --> 55:14.120]  but but judicious about the time because I digressed off into Hillary and Biden
[55:14.120 --> 55:18.480]  planning to leave the race and all the rest of it just to point out as I was
[55:18.480 --> 55:24.680]  remembering you last few days just how incredible we were over the target with
[55:24.680 --> 55:32.080]  our exclusive information on Hillary being so sick and how even now I've had
[55:32.080 --> 55:36.520]  people I know go really you got a source saying Biden's talking about quitting
[55:36.520 --> 55:41.120]  yeah of course I do think I just made up a black ambulance the Hillary falls
[55:41.120 --> 55:44.280]  down and has convulsions that she does it on tape and it's put the black
[55:44.280 --> 55:49.160]  ambulance you think I just magically made that up the one out of quadrillion
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.280]  gazillion this bugillion impossible infinities we just make that up and it
[55:54.280 --> 55:59.840]  comes true it's impossible I told you about the New World Order I told you
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.400]  about Jeffrey Epstein I told you about the cell phones watching you I told you

[56:11.360 --> 56:15.640]  it's not hard to find but you've got to have the will to admit it's real and
[56:15.640 --> 56:21.240]  it's happening and yes I get pissed when I talk about it this isn't a game folks
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.120]  it's not a joke this is the real world and a lot of our fellow countrymen and
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.640]  humans are falling to this evil they're falling to this malaise they're falling
[56:29.640 --> 56:33.680]  to this virtual reality put out by MSM where they really think they're fighting

[59:57.880 --> 01:00:04.880]  you
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:16.880]  you
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:24.880]  from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:35.080]  i'm about to get into the manifesto the gentleman that fire bombed the
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.960]  building cars were shooting a police and got killed yesterday and the bigger
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.760]  twist the specifics of the governor saying he did it for trump try to hurt
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.960]  the people inside i mean you just can't make this stuff up but first we have a
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:53.960]  report by greg reese milkshakes to mall off radicalization of leftist ponds go
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:00.200]  full-blown terrorist and when you read the manifesto of the sky you again you're
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.880]  listening to a delusional fruit cake and it's very very frightening and scary to
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.960]  see how these ponds have been radicalized here it is on friday evening
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:16.200]  hundreds of protesters overtook the flag polls outside the ice facility in
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.640]  aurora colorado they raised a mexican flag and upside down american flag with
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:29.680]  abolished ice spray painted on it and it upside down blue lives matter flag less
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.680]  than a day later a man armed with a rifle through incendiary devices at an
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.600]  ice detention center in tecuma washington a car in the parking lot was
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.320]  torched you know what going to pause this report too powerful some stations
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.360]  don't care there's five minutes i'm gonna come back and i'm going to play it
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.320]  next segment and get in the manifesto because here's the thing when i get
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.920]  really irritable like i am right now it's because i'm angry at myself that i
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.000]  haven't done enough to stop this and there's also the sycophantic thing from
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.880]  the left oh you worship the police now i've been very critical about police over
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.920]  the years and i'm an expert on the police state which is the corrupt
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.160]  government using the police as an instrument of oppression the police
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.040]  have had their major problems but in response to the globalist tyranny
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.680]  we've actually seen a lot of reforms by the police and if i have to choose the
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:31.280]  globalist chai com funded over our own municipal police obviously i'm going to
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.560]  choose that and you watch how the whole corporate media has been demonizing
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.360]  police for decades it's incredible you know i noticed like six seven years ago
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.480]  that when we would bash bad police or police that the media claim were bad
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.000]  that we would be monetized by youtube but oh it'd be promoted to the front page
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:58.760]  of youtube but if i get a positive profile on police they would hide the
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.640]  video and that was really the final straw i guess like eight nine years ago
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:11.760]  when i started figuring out the big picture and so now this country is
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:19.360]  descending into a civil war and it's like watching your family be destroyed
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.360]  in front of you because we live here this is our nation and there's no
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:31.520]  restraint on the left with ilhan omar and just all the things they're doing and
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.240]  the way they've been inciting all of this and it's only getting worse by the
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:43.040]  minute so we come back we're gonna play his report because i got really upset
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:53.800]  when i saw greg's report and then i went live on air and had forgotten that
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.680]  when i was talking about american flags being taken down and mexican flags being
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:05.040]  run up that i didn't even point out they flew the american flag upside down with
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.800]  a ballish eye spray painted across it with a blue lives matter flag upside down
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.240]  pissed all over and it just shows how the msm and the corporate media and the
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:22.320]  universities have successfully radicalized giant armies of jerks many
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:28.160]  of which came to this country for a free ride and then disrespect us the entire
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.560]  time and that's where my frustration comes in is that you know i get a period
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.440]  about leftist being in a child sex and child torture and then i say all this
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.840]  crazy stuff and i'm not making it up but i talk about i'm torturing toddlers to
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.080]  death and drinking their blood that's real confirmed cases okay i'm telling
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.160]  you you cannot underestimate how evil these people are and their servants are
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:56.480]  just the scum of the earth all right well we'll be back in 60 seconds
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.520]  robert barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.960]  become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.360]  social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.840]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.760]  members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.760]  members of the public in the audience that care about this have to bring real
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.360]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.880]  will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.280]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran american
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.560]  economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.520]  depression the informer's audience is the fuel that flames the the light of
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.800]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.560]  make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.000]  big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.520]  meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.240]  telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.920]  gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.280]  just thought
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:14.680]  welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones hour number two of the Sunday broadcast
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.160]  globalists and their leftist mobs know that America and the world's waking up
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.560]  the corporate fascism and the guise of world government and so they're
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.000]  resisting with Ilhan Omar AOC Joe Biden they're all calling for physical
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.440]  revolution any means necessary overthrow the government just last week in
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.560]  full wars dot com ran the story Ilhan Omar's calls for eliminating existence
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:45.800]  of border patrol officers themselves here she is we have rogue agencies that
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:52.880]  have no accountability no transparency in how they conduct their business we
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:07:01.440]  know that they have spoken in the most vile ways about immigrants we know that
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:08.320]  they have certain views about you know what brown and black people deserve yeah
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.960]  and so we should be having a conversation about eliminating their
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:23.640]  existence reforming you know this this the the agencies that deal with the most
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:31.000]  vulnerable which are children and women and and we are continuing to allow for
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.880]  them to to terrorize people who are running away from them you know most
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:44.800]  horrific circumstances and that's one in humane and and that can sit well
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.240]  with the American values that we have that sort of really clearly carries
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.680]  about dignity and humanity right okay decade old numbers is the board
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.000]  patrols about 55% Hispanic about 10% black the numbers are its way above that
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.680]  they're not official but looks like about 65% Hispanic now the idea that
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.720]  they're Nazis or these are concentration camps is asinine these are failing
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.400]  borders failed states that we border they're pouring across one-third or
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.240]  kidnapped children that's mainline numbers Obama invited everybody to come
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.480]  in they say if you have a kid you get in free everything's free and when people
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.200]  get here they're pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags in
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.520]  places like Aurora, Colorado yesterday and then Ilhan Omar fled a failed state
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.640]  married her brother to do it has been caught in income tax fraud that she's
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.240]  pled guilty to and paid fines never worked it in her life just came and got
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.200]  on welfare and then and then runs tax camps she's criminal and then she she
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.120]  flees Somalia that has bombings every day and women are not elected to
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.560]  government women are basically chattel they had giant bombings and machine gun
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:04.400]  attacks at the only working hotel basically in the country yesterday they
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.560]  don't have working airfields they don't have electricity in most areas but she
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.280]  comes here I have another clip coming up and talks about how Americans born here
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.600]  are not patriotic she's a real American and she'll teach you how to not be
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:24.640]  evil and then Trump said which please go back to Somalia if you want to come
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.320]  here from Somalia and you want to be part of the country that's great but
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.720]  here's the deal please don't come from the most barbarous backward place on the
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:39.840]  planet and lecture us all day about how great you are she's nothing but a
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:49.280]  parasite nothing but a parasite so I want to go to Greg Reese's report here
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:55.360]  it's short but it's powerful titled milkshakes to mall off cocktails
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:01.240]  radicalized leftist pawns go full-blown terrorist here is the report
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.440]  on infowars.com please find it please share it America in the world's
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:12.640]  counting on you only you can stop the globalist here it is on Friday evening
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.860]  hundreds of protesters overtook the flag polls outside the ice facility in
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:24.320]  Aurora Colorado they raised a Mexican flag and upside down American flag with
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:31.360]  abolished ice spray painted on it and it upside down blue lives matter flag less
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.360]  than a day later a man armed with a rifle through incendiary devices at an
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.280]  ice detention center in Tacoma Washington a car in the parking lot was
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.520]  torched and investigators say the suspect threw flares at a propane tank
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:50.080]  trying to make it explode ultimately four officers opened fire killing the man
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.520]  the Democratic Party is running their platform on radical open border policies
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.360]  raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:08.080]  undocumented immigrants if the border goes then our Constitution goes with it
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.240]  Antifa has been using Molotov cocktails in Europe and now the dangerous trend
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.880]  has officially arrived in the US and the mainstream media supports them they are
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:25.760]  strictly principled anti-fascist it says it right in the name Antifa anti-fascism
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.960]  which is what they were there fighting I think that a lot of people recognize
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.720]  that when pushed self-defense is a legitimate response to white
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:38.120]  supremacy neo-nazi violence when you go to cancer treatment the radiation is
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.320]  tough treatment but it is meant to remove the cancer but who is really to
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.560]  blame there are elected government officials who support Antifa and fill
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.000]  their minds with radical claims of the Holocaust happening on our southern
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.480]  border the United States is running concentration camps on our southern
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:05.200]  border and that is exactly what they are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez your
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.920]  colleague who was at the border with you compared the facilities to a
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.920]  concentration camp do you agree with that comparison absolutely I mean there's a
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.080]  number of experts that say this is because it's traumatic there are camps
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.880]  and people are being concentrated this is very simple I don't even know why
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.720]  this is a controversial thing for her to say we have to really truthfully speak
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.640]  about what's taking place and this is why it's really important for us to
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.080]  abolish ICE there is no plan in sight and nobody is having the real
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.520]  conversation is there a natural limit to this kind of immigration how many
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.800]  resources does America really have to share with the rest of the world are we
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.440]  as rich as we assume we are are you how many poor people can we realistically
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.000]  accept before we're not that rich at all but increasingly resemble the countries
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.560]  from which these people are fleeing now it's possible there are good answers to
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.720]  these questions logical answers on the other hand if there are answers why is
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.240]  the left trying to prevent you from asking the questions for info wars.com
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:21.280]  this is Greg Ries infill wars tomorrow's news today told you they've been
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.920]  calling for firebombing facilities about some of the articles here now they're
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.240]  doing it and the governor says oh they did it to hurt the illegals and remember
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:35.960]  about 90% of them get released and they never show up 90% are released within
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:45.040]  two weeks and then 90% never show up to their amnesty hearings to their political
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.360]  asylum hearings you know the judges are rubber stamping it they just don't show
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.360]  up of course you can't blame them you know the courts are backlogged for years
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:14:01.800]  our borders broken just like Somalia has a broken border and here's Ilhan Omar
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.480]  with pleasure in her eyes knowing we have a conscience going they are
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.360]  concentrating camps give me what they want I control your country now who is
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:17.160]  I say here she is just yesterday the stories up on news wars.com everybody
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:23.520]  needs to get this out saying that she's a better American Ilhan Omar says she's
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.840]  more patriotic than natural born citizens and will teach them to be
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.160]  American again the average person spent three months at Ellis Island the most
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.160]  open time in our history being checked for diseases some were released right
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.520]  away most in three months some six months some were sent back on ships it
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:47.560]  was found they were criminals we have the most open country in the world right
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:53.280]  now and we're the bad guys for bringing this snake in from her failed country
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.760]  here it is something that I get criticized for all the time it's not what
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:08.360]  you think so don't don't gas it is that I am anti-American because I I criticize
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:19.000]  the the United States and I I I believe as an immigrant I probably love this
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:30.760]  country more than anyone that is naturally born and because I am ashamed of it
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:37.280]  continuing to live in its the hip-hop its hypocrisy that I work so hard to make
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.840]  sure that others who've had that like why just be American why don't you be more
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.600]  like an American can continue to say that why can't you be more like an
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.640]  American because it used to be a very positive we're gonna come back with the
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:59.120]  rest of this because she's gonna teach us don't worry as we witness the most
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.440]  disastrous geological activity in recorded history the globalists are
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:09.720]  backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war borders are
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:15.240]  being broken and sovereignty is being challenged the world is going to change
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:20.520]  and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:26.480]  strong when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could be gone
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.920]  in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days having

[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.960]  epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:24.520]  is right and what they know is true as long as we stay true to our cause as
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:31.240]  long as we remember our great history as long as we never ever stop fighting for

[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.240]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.920]  oh yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.360]  lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.200]  almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.120]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.960]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.320]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.200]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's the
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.000]  time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.600]  to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements

[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.760]  want to get to his manifesto which has been
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.080]  out for a day the media is still saying a right-wing terrorist
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.600]  attacked an ice facility trying to burn up precious
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.880]  immigrants that's your controlled press they're worse than bag dad bob remember
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:20.360]  the propagandists in the 2003 at rock war he said the u.s had been
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:25.560]  pushed all the way into the ocean and all that same level of garbage
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.840]  but right now here's ilhan omar
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.480]  continuing with how you know she will teach americans how to be americans
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.680]  she's a better patriot and she will teach you here it is
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:40.520]  why don't you be more like an american can continue to
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:45.000]  say that why can't you be more like an american because it used to be a very
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.560]  positive thing um we export american exceptionalism
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.120]  the great america the land of liberty and justice that is
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.040]  you know if you ask anybody in uh walking on the side of the street
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:02.600]  somewhere in the middle of the world they will tell you america the great
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:08.760]  but we don't live those values here um and so that hypocrisy is one that i'm
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:14.440]  bothered by i want america the great to be america the great
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.080]  well she's better than the governor of new york saying america was never great
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.760]  it'll never be great oh she's saying oh it used to not be fascist now it is
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.960]  because if a mother wants to make her son cut his genitals off at age eight in
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:29.080]  the state of texas the court's rule it's gonna happen
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.680]  and if i got to pay for abortions in travis county it's gonna happen i mean
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.440]  the idea that we're this oppressed state for the left is a joke the left
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.280]  is censoring and oppressing everybody
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.520]  you've got this individual oh by the way we're having the three percenters on
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:50.200]  from spokane and from seattle tomorrow uh the the very folks that knew this
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.000]  individual and know the redneck revolt group the terror
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.600]  group they're going to be joining us people that have basically had guns
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.920]  pointed at them uh by the now dead firebomber
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:09.000]  william van sporenzen now he's got a long manifesto
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.360]  the full things up on info wars dot com you got to go read this for yourself
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.520]  but he just goes on to say that america is now run by nazis
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.120]  fascism serves the needs of the state serves the needs of businesses and your
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.840]  expense who benefits jeff bezos warren buffett
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.720]  elon musk tim cook bill gates betsy devos george soros i mean george soros
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:34.520]  is the main funder of antifa along with
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.680]  alan sander soros but that's a known fact it's mainstream news the federal
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.720]  filings uh we've got internal antiva documents
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:48.520]  it just shows these people don't even know who's feeding them
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:55.320]  and then he continues he says to my comrades i regret that i will miss
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.680]  the rest of the revolution thank you for the honor of

[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:04.120]  hey i'll yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.480]  to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.560]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:15.480]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.680]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:22.040]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.160]  presidency it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.120]  him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.240]  just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.080]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.520]  80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they

[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.480]  okay so we're going to get to this special report that i
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:34.600]  put out last night but i had to add a few things to it like the original proof
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.040]  that we broke that she was in a black ambulance and collapsing they actually
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.320]  found it so that's going to be in this report updated from the one that's
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.080]  posted info wars dot com that joe biden is looking
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.840]  to exit the 2020 election that doesn't mean he's going to do it
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.160]  just like it doesn't mean we're going to catch her in a black ambulance
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.560]  collapsing and having seizures but we did we did
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.360]  because the sacred service told us had another little federal agency dropped by
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:07.160]  and i said what's the info you've been given the info alex follow her
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:11.720]  black ambulance well give me more info you've been given the info we're not

[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.160]  something about things worked on to the very last moment
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.040]  so what i want to do is i'm going to go to the original report this is going to

[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.040]  presidency over we believe in free speech
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.480]  that's why i'll end the gag rule the global gag rule that prevents
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:30.520]  money from getting to NGOs will look
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.120]  we'll look for enforceable commitments they'll produce
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.880]  emissions reduce emissions
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:43.880]  you
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.520]  info wars tomorrow's news today
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.360]  you're about to exclusively get what is undoubtedly
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:10.520]  the biggest news in the 2020 pivotal presidential race between
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.480]  donald trump the presumptive republican nominee
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:18.440]  and the giant field of over 20 democrats joe biden
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:23.640]  is privately complaining to staff crew and security including his secret
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.640]  service detail that he has because he's the former vice president
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.280]  that he is 76 that he is slurring his words
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.520]  that he is having memory problems and that he is even having coughing fits
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:41.160]  similar to hillary clinton if elected he would be the oldest
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:46.360]  president elected in u.s history he'd be 82 years old by the time
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.040]  his first term is served and a little bit later i'm going to break down
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.600]  how joe biden was forced to run by the political establishment by the
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.560]  democrats and is now being thrown under the bus
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:01.480]  and that's the report we've also gotten is that he is complaining
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.760]  that he was convinced to do this and told that he would win and that he would
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:09.080]  basically run without opposition and now he's had the democratic party
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.160]  turn on him he's had obama turn on him and his legacy is being destroyed
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.920]  right in front of his eyes as part of a larger cheap trick
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:23.560]  but here is the big exclusive news joe biden is currently
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:29.640]  intending to drop out the 2020 race potentially even before the next
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.080]  debate coming up at the end of the month in detroit
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.640]  he's looking at dropping out before or possibly right after
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.960]  if he can what was the words i was told gracefully
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.800]  exit if they attack him on the stage he is intending to release massive amounts
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.120]  of dirt on the other candidates to regain
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:57.000]  his legacy as he sees it and then he will exit saying the democratic party
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.480]  is falling apart and destroying itself mirroring what nancy polosi
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.080]  the speaker of the house has been saying about aoc this is
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.640]  huge exclusive breaking news we've just received some video
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.720]  former secretary of state hillary clinton stumbling as she left the 9-11
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.040]  commemoration in new york city this morning statement from clinton's
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.520]  campaign says she felt overheated is she a no-show
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.320]  we'll find out it seems like there has been some kind of a time delay
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.080]  uh everybody's just waiting and kind of trying to kill time
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.680]  there's a lot of dead time happening it is critical
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.800]  if you're a new viewer or listener to understand something
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:43.880]  before i go further this is paramount in july of 2016 we had the highest level
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.920]  presidential passes at the rnc in cleveland myself and joe bigs were
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:53.320]  separately approached by secret service they said in the next
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.880]  month they would have a critical message for us
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:59.560]  about hillary clinton's health but that we needed
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:03.000]  to shadow her on the campaign trail and look for a black
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.560]  ambulance that's all they would say a month later a representative
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:11.400]  met with us in austin and laid out the facts that
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.240]  she has had multiple brain tumors removed that she would have to go off her
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.160]  medication before speeches and that she would then have epileptic
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.080]  seizures without the medication and that we needed to shadow her
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.160]  everywhere we almost caught her the next week in cleveland again
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.400]  collapsing and having to be brought to a tent she collapsed at other events as
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.840]  well the democrats were all in even her constituents on covering this up
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.720]  since then she's been caught falling down having seizures many times
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.000]  so some of the similar type individuals i'll leave it at that
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.480]  contacted me wednesday and said alex joe biden doesn't want to be on the
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.280]  campaign trail he has secret service obviously
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:55.640]  guarding him he's the former vice president he is really tired of being
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.920]  thrown under the bus by the democrats having his legacy destroyed
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.120]  he was promised that even though he's 76 and has health problems
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.280]  that he was going to be protected by the system he now knows he's being set up
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.520]  he's not sure why suddenly obama and others will hardly even talk to him
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.560]  suddenly he's not raising as much money as he was and he's
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.840]  complaining saying why am i here why am i doing this he's
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.920]  he's coughing he's saying he's having memory problems uh he's he's getting
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.120]  medical checkups for problems with his brain
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.280]  he already had major strokes before he almost died from embolisms
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:32.760]  i uh i had two cranial aneurysms and they literally had to take the top of my
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.920]  head off i mean they take a saw and they cut your head off
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.040]  what are my chances of getting off this table and being completely normal
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:44.200]  he saw your chances of living are a lot better
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.720]  and so when i asked the sources i said well
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:53.080]  are you sure he's gonna drop out they said yes he's looking for a way to exit
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.600]  he's not sure if he's gonna do it right back
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.280]  i talk about this on the air and i know it stinks into people but i've decided
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:05.320]  that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.000]  six years ago before all the censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.560]  it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.600]  best and why they were and i'd have doctors on our experts to explain why
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.800]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.600]  support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.000]  supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.840]  and the left always has headlines everywhere
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.640]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:34.360]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:37.080]  the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.760]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.040]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.760]  different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.360]  not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:54.120]  medicine chest infowarstore.com or triple eight
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.360]  two five three three one three nine

[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:01.640]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.240]  yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.360]  people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.200]  almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.720]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.320]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.160]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.880]  it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:28.840]  it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:31.880]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.720]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.160]  80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:44.040]  do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.720]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.000]  we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.920]  to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.160]  fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:02.920]  i just want listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.440]  against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.280]  war 50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:13.480]  marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:17.000]  and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.120]  dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.840]  all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:26.280]  millions and millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand not
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.800]  contract and for six months we've not been able to stand still the enemy's
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.480]  been winning and i have labored and labored and labored and labored on
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.600]  this i like to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.480]  are winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we need to be

[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.560]  into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:51.000]  then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.800]  or you or anybody else i mean the democrats now we're going into a full

[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:06.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:20.360]  all right let's go back to part of the report that's on info wars dot com joe
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.280]  biden planning to exit 2020 race he's eyeing to do it doesn't mean he will
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.080]  but this is real information and then we have a
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:30.120]  third version of this even more added data that's going to be
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.720]  uploaded tonight when the full show gets uploaded there'll be a third version
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.880]  has even more information added to it but here it is live
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:43.000]  sure he's gonna drop out and they said yes he's looking for a way to exit
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.520]  he's not sure if he's going to do it before the debate
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.520]  at the end of the month or after but he is mightily pissed
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.880]  because they knew he had health problems when he started the campaign and
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:57.000]  they've gotten a lot worse almost like it's a
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.840]  a curse or something and so now there's a new video
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.480]  that's on info wars dot com joe biden stumbles slurs costs through speech
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.760]  wonders what am i doing and that's exactly
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.720]  what i was told by our sources that are guarding him
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.200]  is that joe biden is saying dammit why am i doing this what's happening
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.080]  and he kind of goes in and out almost like Alzheimer's
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.120]  where he's cogent and well spoken and then all of a sudden
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.520]  not cogent not well spoken and again once off the campaign
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.840]  now there's a slim chance he's gonna try to stay in but but
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:39.080]  even if biden tries to stay in how does he stay in when every speech he has
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.920]  slurred words every speech every sentence has problems
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:46.280]  where he's mixing up words where he is having coughing fits
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:51.240]  worse than hillary how at 76 is he gonna go through the grueling debates
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.760]  and the campaign and the lights in the next year and a half
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.080]  no joe biden is a smart guy joe biden has been a very
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:01.880]  intelligent person though he's worked for the dark side
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:07.560]  and he knows he cannot stay in now maybe they intended for biden to go in and
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.880]  win but now that they see he's sick they're
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:13.240]  planning to attack him i guess until he drops out so
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.320]  you're about to see what happens i don't know all the thinking
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.440]  i don't know every angle that goes into this but you're getting exclusive
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:24.760]  information so here's his speech yesterday and then we're
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.680]  going to play the speech that i commented on when he first
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.880]  launched his campaign on april 31st of this year
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.240]  with slurring his words not being able to speak
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.320]  i asked has he had a second stroke and that's why
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:44.280]  facebook said that they finally banned me off instagram
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.520]  because i was involved in election meddling asking if somebody's had a
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.600]  second stroke who's already had major problems is very very
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.600]  reasonable but again i'm supposedly fake news no
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.240]  we're real news and they're scared of us they've been said on cnn msnbc
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.400]  he's gotta be banned because he's the one that said hillary was falling down
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.920]  and he's the one that now says biden's has trouble talking
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:14.600]  biden has trouble talking on the videos hillary was falling down she fell down
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:18.920]  on camera and had a seizure they're trying to take us off the
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:22.920]  air because we have credibility and they know we're telling the truth so
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.520]  here's the latest of it and then here's the one that got us banned when we first
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.200]  questioned this months ago and see that's how leadership works when you're
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.600]  the first to question something when nobody else will
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.680]  and it turns out you're right the inside sources contact you because they know
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:41.320]  you're not controlled and will tell the truth
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.320]  that's why info wars dot com and news wars dot com are tomorrow's news
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:51.400]  today as president united states i would uh
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.960]  remind the world that we are the united states of america we do not coddle
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.400]  dictators the united states of america gives
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.080]  hate no safe harbor but we know more charlottesville
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:11.240]  no more health sinkings the challenge of following this disastrous
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:15.400]  president ever will not be just to restore the reputation
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:19.000]  our credibility donald trump and the democrats
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.640]  demagogues around the world are leaning into these forces
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:26.920]  that triumph of democracy and liberalism
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:32.280]  over fashion and autocracy that has driven all our economic process
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.080]  and progress we believe in free speech that's why i'll end the gag rule the
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:40.120]  global gag rule that prevents money from getting to
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:44.360]  ngo's we even talk about family planning
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:49.320]  but president tom took those words those literal words nation of immigrants
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:53.000]  out of the statement the mission statement of our citizenship and
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.720]  immigration services we have to be honest about excuse me
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:04.840]  to be honest about because we've neglected we've neglected
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.880]  the basics by strengthening by strengthening
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:14.120]  by strengthening folks we're virtually any
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:20.760]  we're virtually energy independent he has he has
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:25.400]  i don't know how to say it from he's alienated us
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.760]  from the very democratic allies we need most
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:33.640]  and partnerships built on coercion to take on
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:39.640]  non-traditional threats like weaponized corruption
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:43.960]  we cannot be a credible voice on the proliferation of nuclear
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:47.960]  security and on proliferation of nuclear security
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:52.520]  we'll look we'll look for enforceable commitments
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:56.840]  they'll produce emissions reduce emissions
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.920]  and again here's biden three months ago his first speech
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:05.080]  went off like a derailment of a train and this is what got us banned further
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.000]  because dirty americans are supposed to keep their mouth shut and not talk
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.200]  about what they observe think maybe hillary takes on
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:18.360]  kind of an urban accent when she's in front of blacks so does aoc so so
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:22.040]  maybe he just thinks that these union workers are mentally retarded
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.760]  maybe that's why i'm not making fun of other people
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:28.200]  i'm really worried about biden they just have a big spoke
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:33.160]  he's up to tell us about wall street and let's go back to him
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:36.040]  all my time in public life from what's i've gotten involved
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:40.120]  the country wasn't built by wall street bankers CEOs
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.200]  and hedge fund management if the enterprise is hard times
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:49.400]  everybody took a hit union workers the ua w took extradible
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:52.600]  cuts in their future and their pensions in the left
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:56.440]  to get gm working they also got that last year
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:59.640]  and try to cut wages or freeze wages for the people
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.000]  right today the same is happening in big hospitals in big hospital systems
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.760]  they said about to rethink how we define what constitutes a successful economy
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.640]  folks in america don't think your children have the same standard of being
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:15.160]  they had all right let's stop right there the report goes on
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:19.000]  and you can go to any speech he gives in fact last night i spent about two hours
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  after the children went to sleep just going to youtube and talking
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.520]  me in joe biden and then clicking on his videos and
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:32.920]  watching new ones and he was slurring through almost all of them
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:38.440]  bumbling around looks like hell looks like he's 90 years old
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:44.120]  he's he is 76 how is he going to run well the word is
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.720]  he was told he was going to be given the nomination and now that he's not he's
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:50.360]  getting upset let me shift gears into a subject that's very
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.920]  important
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:58.760]  the democratic party the autobahn society the un they don't want the us to be
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.840]  able to have clean burning coal we have more coal than any other country in
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.160]  the world we have clean burning coal that produces
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.160]  nothing but carbon dioxide that's not monoxide there's carbon dioxide that
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.360]  plants breathe and water vapor we have the clean coal
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:17.560]  and that's going to hurt saudi arabia and other people if we don't need to buy
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:21.000]  their oil if we're energy independent so they fund all these lepis groups to
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.520]  call for our coal to be shut off because we have 10
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.200]  thousand years supply basically that's what this is about if our coal
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.240]  shut off all the oil companies but more money if the oil companies actually
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.960]  lobbying are the biggest funders for the carbon taxes that mainly targets
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.000]  again coal but you look at new york city because they won't let us have these
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.040]  plants coal power plants have been shut down over a thousand of them
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.960]  more and more our energy sources are going out we're having more blackouts
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.000]  across the country like a third world country this happened last night let's
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.280]  play the audio this is in a new york city
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:57.080]  they're up there and the sound just goes off
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.440]  think about that
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.120]  oh and then hours and hours of no power
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.400]  they claim oh a piece of equipment malfunction yeah the equipment sold the
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.920]  nuclear reactors are old a thousand coal plants have been shut down
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.440]  the country is being deindustrialized we can't compete with china
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:22.120]  when they open five new plants a week and up until the time trump got in we
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:25.320]  were closing plants every month we're being
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.800]  industrially shut down but the left who wants all the free crap they're here
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.520]  bitching they also said they want electric cars
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.920]  well electric cars take more carbon than a regular car
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:40.520]  but greg reese cut an ad this week before this even happened talking about
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:44.040]  it for infowarstore.com here it is in closing
