[00:00.000 --> 00:14.520]  Certainly, for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[00:14.520 --> 00:20.520]  that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[00:20.520 --> 00:27.280]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:27.280 --> 00:49.120]  He predicted 9-11, he exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove, he educated
[00:49.120 --> 00:54.840]  us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalist prison planet dominated
[00:54.840 --> 00:57.400]  by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[00:57.400 --> 01:01.200]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.240]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites!
[01:05.240 --> 01:10.160]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.160]  Valley.
[01:11.160 --> 01:21.880]  They falsely edited him, they lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook, they lie that he
[01:21.880 --> 01:30.320]  pushed a child down in a viral video, and now he is being de-platformed by Facebook,
[01:30.320 --> 01:33.480]  Apple, and Google.
[01:33.480 --> 01:38.080]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[01:38.080 --> 01:41.920]  And then we get hit, say, even no longer use our software.
[01:41.920 --> 01:44.760]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[01:44.760 --> 01:47.680]  We just got taken down by YouTube, they just killed our stream.
[01:47.680 --> 01:48.680]  Really?
[01:48.680 --> 01:49.680]  Yep.
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.560]  Americans are actually celebrating this.
[01:53.560 --> 01:55.840]  This is America in 2018.
[01:55.840 --> 02:05.360]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.840]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:09.840 --> 02:11.800]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:11.800 --> 02:19.120]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:19.120 --> 02:25.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:55.880 --> 02:59.520]  You can smell it, you can see it, you can feel it, history is happening right now.
[02:59.520 --> 03:04.920]  The destiny of humanity, to a great extent, will be decided at least how the breaks are
[03:04.920 --> 03:08.160]  going to work with this midterm.
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.440]  World is awakening to the true new authoritarian threat, organized governments, and multinationals
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.880]  working with big tech and big banks to bring in one world government.
[03:18.880 --> 03:22.920]  Really President Trump and other leaders across the world, from Eastern Europe to Latin America,
[03:22.920 --> 03:30.680]  from Africa to Asia to Russia, are fighting hard, and you are waking up, I am waking up,
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.760]  we are all waking up and realizing this together.
[03:33.760 --> 03:37.800]  I am very honored that we were the first to be completely banned four weeks ago, three
[03:37.800 --> 03:41.520]  weeks ago, but now it's everyone, everyone.
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.240]  They're all being shadow banned 96% where no one can find them unless you go to the page,
[03:46.240 --> 03:54.240]  and other people like Rush Limbaugh, President Trump, Matt Drudge, Ann Coulter, Michele Malkin,
[03:54.240 --> 03:57.920]  hundreds of pages, in fact I need that article that came out yesterday on Coulter, she's
[03:57.920 --> 04:05.120]  on today, hundreds of pages of attacks and disinfo is put up front on purpose against
[04:05.120 --> 04:06.120]  you.
[04:06.120 --> 04:13.880]  So anyone trying to search you only sees horrible lies, it's defamatory, it's organized crime,
[04:13.880 --> 04:20.800]  it's just total and complete fraud, just the headline was looking how YouTube just changed
[04:20.800 --> 04:23.920]  this algorithm, and it was an article that got a lot of attention in their state, but
[04:23.920 --> 04:31.120]  it's every conservative, it's Prager, it's Coulter, it's Sean Hannity, it's Tucker Carlson,
[04:31.120 --> 04:36.800]  it's everybody, and it's the head of the election, this is true election meddling, suppressing
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.120]  Americans just talking to each other, and it's a huge time and Trump has now gone both
[04:42.120 --> 04:46.960]  barrels on him, and we'll cover it all, so the battles join, and yes, I've gotten a lot
[04:46.960 --> 04:49.640]  of briefings from the president, I'm going to get a lot more to him, and that's why they
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.960]  banned me three weeks ago, but it's well worth it, because they were going to ban us all
[04:53.960 --> 05:00.520]  in the end anyway, show.
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.640]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is, the real drama can be found
[05:05.640 --> 05:10.560]  here in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater, and we
[05:10.560 --> 05:14.280]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.280 --> 05:19.680]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.200]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.200 --> 05:27.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH, what
[05:27.760 --> 05:32.040]  we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.040]  rainwater.
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.440 --> 05:44.520]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.520 --> 05:50.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.160 --> 05:55.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.480 --> 05:59.880]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[05:59.880 --> 06:04.440]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the US resistance,
[06:04.440 --> 06:09.040]  missed a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.720]  the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[06:12.720 --> 06:17.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of US telecommunications infrastructure.
[06:17.000 --> 06:19.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.560]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[06:21.560 --> 06:22.560]  This is all confirmed.
[06:22.560 --> 06:23.560]  This is not a drill.
[06:23.560 --> 06:27.680]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[06:27.680 --> 06:29.560]  They've officially become state-run.
[06:29.560 --> 06:30.560]  Apple 100%.
[06:30.560 --> 06:36.000]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.800]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones
[06:40.800 --> 06:41.800]  to do that.
[06:41.800 --> 06:42.800]  This is happening.
[06:42.800 --> 06:46.800]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[06:46.800 --> 06:50.560]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[06:50.560 --> 06:55.560]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[06:55.560 --> 06:56.560]  previous attacks.
[06:56.560 --> 07:03.440]  This is a tight-traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt-over-come subversion
[07:03.440 --> 07:04.440]  paradigm manipulation.
[07:04.440 --> 07:09.480]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.000]  We adapt to being pressed to low dosages of oppression.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.880]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.520]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[07:23.520 --> 07:33.760]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system, now attacking the United States with traders
[07:33.760 --> 07:38.560]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[07:38.560 --> 07:43.120]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-com slash big tech banking combined
[07:43.120 --> 07:44.120]  emergency situation.
[07:44.120 --> 07:47.880]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[07:47.880 --> 07:50.760]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[07:50.760 --> 07:56.000]  They want to double-use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.520]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[07:59.520 --> 08:04.000]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.480]  man, a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars, and so they make
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.480]  me a herder of children.
[08:09.480 --> 08:14.080]  And then they build me into this line to then set the distraction while they're actually
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.200]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[08:18.200 --> 08:23.440]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them by
[08:23.440 --> 08:25.240]  being the main distraction.
[08:25.240 --> 08:29.880]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being
[08:29.880 --> 08:30.880]  used against you.
[08:30.880 --> 08:35.880]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[08:35.880 --> 08:37.880]  I have given you the transmission.
[08:37.880 --> 08:39.880]  Now break free!
[08:39.880 --> 08:49.680]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[08:49.680 --> 08:53.400]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson.
[08:53.400 --> 09:06.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[09:06.280 --> 09:12.000]  70 days until the most important election in world history.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.680]  Humanity now prepares its settles at the crossroads.
[09:14.680 --> 09:16.840]  The time for talk is over.
[09:16.840 --> 09:19.280]  We have entered the crucible.
[09:19.280 --> 09:21.480]  It's now up to you.
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.440]  Globalist forces are spilling out their full might and hatred against humanity.
[09:26.440 --> 09:29.960]  Their psychological warfare and deception has never been greater.
[09:29.960 --> 09:38.640]  And if we stay steadfast against it, through this dark time will come our greatest moment.
[09:38.640 --> 09:41.360]  It's here.
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.400]  You can feel the victory.
[09:43.400 --> 09:45.280]  The enemy can feel their defeat.
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.400]  We're going to win the midterms unless there's criminal fraud we couldn't imagine which
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.400]  is happening.
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.960]  But regardless, we've won the battle, we've won the war already by standing through and
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.160]  the seeds that are planted now of censorship, the seeds of bullying and the seeds of oppression
[10:02.160 --> 10:08.240]  will give root to mighty oaks of liberty that will stand the storms of the future.
[10:08.240 --> 10:13.720]  That when our ancestors look back on now, this will be seen as a time of calm, a time
[10:13.720 --> 10:18.920]  of plenty, a time of ease as we face the real crises that are coming.
[10:18.920 --> 10:21.440]  This is only a preparation for the future.
[10:21.440 --> 10:28.560]  If we can't beat John Podesta and Hillary Clinton and the Rockefellers and people like
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.280]  George Soros, really, who are we?
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.360]  We're going to face far more superior, far more powerful foes in the future.
[10:36.360 --> 10:41.160]  And by then, when we face those foes, we will be stronger, though most of us will be six
[10:41.160 --> 10:43.680]  feet under.
[10:43.680 --> 10:53.720]  I was very frustrated yesterday because I know that we have the chart to get out of
[10:53.720 --> 10:54.880]  this.
[10:54.880 --> 10:59.280]  I know we have the path and I know we're right because I've read the enemies on statements
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.520]  and I've seen their own plans and I know how to beat them.
[11:02.520 --> 11:12.040]  And so I get mad at myself that 100% in my mind, I hold their entire battle plan and
[11:12.040 --> 11:15.200]  I know how to beat it like that.
[11:15.200 --> 11:22.400]  And so much of the victory depends on me and you and all of us together executing on the
[11:22.400 --> 11:27.440]  information we have, and that means laying it out in a step-by-step format.
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.880]  So by the middle of next week, we're going to put out a four or five page memo, very
[11:30.880 --> 11:35.840]  simple with bullet points with proof because I tend to give you too much information.
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.160]  Now that's good to do, but at this point it needs to be battle plans, information, warfare,
[11:41.160 --> 11:42.160]  the truth.
[11:42.160 --> 11:47.160]  And then I just get caught in the total minutiae of wanting to prove every point when we know
[11:47.160 --> 11:52.400]  we're telling the truth, we have all the facts, and then I get very, very angry.
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.800]  And I really get angry because the president is surrounded by a bunch of cowards.
[11:56.800 --> 12:10.160]  The president is a lion surrounded by hyenas and jackals and war hogs and cobras.
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.760]  And it's totally real, it's so epic, evil doesn't just exist, right when the evil was
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.520]  about to take over, something good rises up, it's stubborn and willful and ready to execute
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.520]  the truth.
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.640]  Doesn't matter what the vessel is, you expect, look at the Bible, most of the vessels God
[12:24.640 --> 12:30.560]  raised up to crush evil were more evil than the evil, but they were not wicked in their
[12:30.560 --> 12:31.560]  heart.
[12:31.560 --> 12:39.680]  And so we are now, ladies and gentlemen, at the most epic moment ever.
[12:39.680 --> 12:45.520]  And the knives are not for the president because he proved they were suppressing the economy
[12:45.520 --> 12:46.680]  on purpose.
[12:46.680 --> 12:54.720]  He proved the fraud and he showed you 4.6 growth rate, he said in the campaign, China's
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.920]  got 10 for decades, we're America, we could have five.
[12:59.920 --> 13:07.280]  They said, you lunatic, you'll never get three less than two years out, he said 4.6.
[13:07.280 --> 13:10.200]  The truth is, we can build anything and do anything we want.
[13:10.200 --> 13:14.240]  We have to have motivation, we have to believe in ourselves.
[13:14.240 --> 13:19.960]  And the enemy has been demoralizing us, you study propaganda, you study authoritarianism.
[13:19.960 --> 13:26.600]  What the media and the government and the Democrats do is 101.
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.280]  Those that didn't go to college, not that it means anything, but that means the first
[13:30.280 --> 13:31.280]  level.
[13:31.280 --> 13:39.000]  101, first day at class, they demoralize your ass.
[13:39.000 --> 13:48.160]  And I knew the globe was real, but I'll be honest with you.
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.960]  I guess the spiritual conversion rate is quicker now because 20 years ago when I was covering
[13:52.960 --> 13:58.560]  stuff, only on top people were really bad, low level Republicans were bad, low level
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.960]  Democrats were bad, but they were misled, they weren't inherently evil.
[14:03.960 --> 14:10.760]  Democrats now, because that's where the universe works, things divide the two sides, have chosen
[14:10.760 --> 14:13.360]  pure evil.
[14:13.360 --> 14:15.880]  And I don't mourn it that it's a hard enemy to beat.
[14:15.880 --> 14:23.040]  I'm mourn it because I feel their spiritual death and when I see them do horrible things
[14:23.040 --> 14:29.280]  to me or my family or you, they think they're hurting me, but not in the way they think
[14:29.280 --> 14:31.760]  because they're Satanists, they're all about themselves, it's not that.
[14:31.760 --> 14:40.080]  I mourn their loss, I, oh my God, there's that many of them are corrupt, I mean almost
[14:40.080 --> 14:42.560]  all of them want to destroy everything.
[14:42.560 --> 14:51.760]  They revel in being liars and trying to stop prosperity and then Trump and I get to know
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.120]  what Trump's going through because no one after Trump, except for, I don't say this
[14:57.120 --> 15:05.240]  with pleasure, no one is attacked like me except for Trump and why is it?
[15:05.240 --> 15:09.440]  Because the enemy started saying like two years ago, Trump and Jones are channeling
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.800]  each other, they're the same spirit and they're all under the occult, I'm not into that stuff.
[15:13.800 --> 15:16.920]  But then I thought, oh that's just propaganda and then I realized and I've run into them,
[15:16.920 --> 15:21.520]  they think I'm Trump and they think Trump is me, but you know, weird metaphysical thing,
[15:21.520 --> 15:25.800]  it's actually true, there's always the big thing up here, there's the rebel, the outlier
[15:25.800 --> 15:33.440]  that has the, it's a thing in the metaphysical and so they figured this out now, they figured
[15:33.440 --> 15:39.560]  this out and so they're trying to destroy me as a symbol to get to you, but then they
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.240]  don't think about a Matt Drudge like the 10th planet coming through, they don't think about
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.360]  other foreseen forces and the way God works because it's not just Trump, it's not just
[15:48.360 --> 15:53.200]  Jones, it's you, the people, that's the real tie to the universe that's unstoppable and
[15:53.200 --> 15:59.800]  when you decide you're done with the globalist, they're gone.
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.800 --> 16:09.560]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.480]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[16:14.480 --> 16:19.240]  that can alert you that something is wrong, hear how heart and body extract is making

[18:00.240 --> 18:05.600]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.920]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.920 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.800]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.800 --> 18:38.300]  symptoms.
[18:38.300 --> 18:40.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.480 --> 18:41.480]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.480 --> 18:46.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.920 --> 19:05.080]  Check to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.520 --> 20:14.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:14.840 --> 20:21.640]  The answer to tyranny is the human spirit from 1984, with God's light shining through
[20:21.640 --> 20:22.640]  our sails.
[20:22.640 --> 20:26.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:26.560 --> 20:35.720]  Human souls are but mirrors of God's consciousness, like ships upon an endless sea, with the consciousness
[20:35.720 --> 20:42.920]  of God blasting out, filling their sails, travel through space and time.
[20:42.920 --> 20:49.880]  All dimensions, all time, all understanding when you're ready for it.
[20:49.880 --> 20:55.320]  A true stairway to heaven, not one offered by Hollywood crank this up, not one offered
[20:55.320 --> 21:01.960]  by the globalist, not one offered by drugs in the system or power over others, but through
[21:01.960 --> 21:08.920]  staring into infinity, staring into the burning bush, and removing the bush, and staring
[21:08.920 --> 21:11.320]  in the mind of God.
[21:11.320 --> 21:15.800]  Lest ye be ready, you will surely die.
[21:15.800 --> 21:21.800]  It's your soul will go on.
[21:21.800 --> 21:28.680]  Our shadows taller than our souls.
[21:28.680 --> 21:45.000]  There was a lady we all know, who shines false light, who once the light shows, never goes
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  away, does it?
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.720]  Because you can see God, you can also see the devil.
[21:51.720 --> 21:53.920]  The devil is the light bearer.
[21:53.920 --> 21:57.080]  You don't look at God, the devil's the bush.
[21:57.080 --> 22:01.880]  The devil then tells you he's God, but he's not.
[22:01.880 --> 22:07.760]  The great mysteries now are unlocked to the world, as we enter the final age of Earth,
[22:07.760 --> 22:13.640]  and the age of the universe begins.
[22:13.640 --> 22:20.240]  God's finger reaches down to give us the fire of heaven, the Promethean fire, but who will
[22:20.240 --> 22:21.480]  take it?
[22:21.480 --> 22:25.240]  Not the big tech giants, not the globalist, they've decided their God's there on Earth,
[22:25.240 --> 22:29.480]  they don't want that finger to reach down.
[22:29.480 --> 22:33.600]  Ancultors joining us, I'm a bad guy, I forget to tell the folks to promote that Ancultors
[22:33.600 --> 22:34.600]  coming on.
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.160]  She had been on like 15 years, I wasn't a left winger, I wasn't a right winger, but
[22:38.160 --> 22:43.040]  I would just kind of get little bonus points attacking her when I got her on, and I talked
[22:43.040 --> 22:46.440]  to her briefly at the RNC, but you know, I think overall she's a good lady, very smart
[22:46.440 --> 22:50.520]  lady, very influential lady, and the real reason I want her on is I want to try to brief
[22:50.520 --> 22:59.520]  her just briefly and have her talk as well about the whole situation with the globalist
[22:59.520 --> 23:04.320]  and the deep state takeover that finally the President is listening to.
[23:04.320 --> 23:09.720]  So I am super, super excited about Ancultor set to join us for a nice interview coming
[23:09.720 --> 23:12.120]  up in the next segment.
[23:12.120 --> 23:18.120]  But again, she's totally buried, she's shadow banned, but then they also bury in Google
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.960]  her hundreds of searches where you see anything she has to say.
[23:21.960 --> 23:24.360]  She's on C-SPAN, it's banned.
[23:24.360 --> 23:31.440]  She's on Fox News, it's banned.
[23:31.440 --> 23:35.720]  So you're going to get to actually hear from her, that's what they do, they ban you, then
[23:35.720 --> 23:42.520]  they misrepresent what you have to say.
[23:42.520 --> 23:47.000]  So we're going to be breaking it all down with her coming up.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.200]  But 70 days out from the election, what are we going to do?
[23:52.200 --> 23:57.480]  70 days out with everyone being shadow banned, a lot of people being totally banned.
[23:57.480 --> 24:03.320]  I mean, Swedish national campaigns that are about to win, you know, the Prime Minister
[24:03.320 --> 24:07.920]  ship, they're being banned, Christian parties in Africa are being banned.
[24:07.920 --> 24:15.600]  Facebook, Google, YouTube, it's subsidiary, Apple, they are on a jihad.
[24:15.600 --> 24:20.520]  And Twitter have been one of the worst, and they knew they were one of the worst.
[24:20.520 --> 24:26.400]  And so they knew people were watching them very, very, very, very, very, very, very close.
[24:26.400 --> 24:31.560]  And so they went, oh, we won't ban Alex Jones, because I'm already shadow banned, 90 plus
[24:31.560 --> 24:32.720]  percent.
[24:32.720 --> 24:37.200]  We won't do that.
[24:37.200 --> 24:39.240]  And so they act like I'm the token person that's there.
[24:39.240 --> 24:45.200]  But I love how tech giants met last week in secret, print me that article please, to stop
[24:45.200 --> 24:46.200]  election meddling.
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.400]  Oh, the Russians are all powerful.
[24:48.400 --> 24:52.080]  We'll ban all the conservatives to make sure Russians don't do anything while they're
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.800]  manipulating the election.
[24:53.800 --> 25:00.200]  Shadow banning conservatives 96 percent was 93 percent last week, because the polls keep
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.360]  showing a huge red wave, and so they're being forced to act like authoritarians.
[25:05.360 --> 25:07.480]  They're being forced to act like dictators.
[25:07.480 --> 25:15.040]  They're being forced to openly ban conservatives free speech across the board in an attempt
[25:15.040 --> 25:18.480]  to get people to behave and go along with what they want.
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.040]  But people are like, we don't care if you totally censor us.
[25:21.040 --> 25:23.600]  We're not going to stop, and we're going to go on local radio, and we're going to buy
[25:23.600 --> 25:26.680]  ads in the paper, and we're going to call C-SPAN, and we're going to call the Congress,
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.200]  and we're going to go out when Trump's there at rallies and go, they're not censorship,
[25:30.200 --> 25:36.040]  they're not censorship, they're blocking you, and now the president is on your tail with
[25:36.040 --> 25:43.160]  antitrust executive orders and banking executive orders and sanctions, real sanctions.
[25:43.160 --> 25:50.760]  And top Republicans are signaling they're ready for Trump to fire sessions.
[25:50.760 --> 25:55.280]  And so you guys, I'll tell you this.
[25:55.280 --> 26:00.440]  I give us a 60-40 chance we win the midterms, and you guys get totally devastated and indicted
[26:00.440 --> 26:04.120]  for this, because the quarter's not being given now.
[26:04.120 --> 26:05.480]  You guys pushed too far.
[26:05.480 --> 26:09.200]  You went after Trump's family, all of it, when you're involved with the Russians, everything
[26:09.200 --> 26:10.200]  else.
[26:10.200 --> 26:15.520]  But even if you were to steal the election and get through, I've looked at every possible
[26:15.520 --> 26:23.760]  destination along your planned permutations and your entire operation, and I've looked
[26:23.760 --> 26:37.360]  at every outcome, and let me just say this, there isn't any outcome where you win.
[26:37.360 --> 26:40.920]  And I have an evil laugh because I know you don't like it, because I can, you know, I
[26:40.920 --> 26:46.320]  just like to get to me, but the point is, is that you guys think you're going to execute
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.480]  this, you're not going to execute crap, and the globalists know I don't just make statements
[26:51.480 --> 26:56.000]  on air that aren't true or that aren't backed up.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.920]  You are facing hammer war.
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.360]  You are facing, you are, you are bringing down the gates.
[27:03.360 --> 27:06.400]  You think taking down these controls is destroying us?
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.520]  You are removing gates that we don't remove, because we know who we are.
[27:11.520 --> 27:19.240]  But once you remove the gates, once you let us in, we will visit judgment on you politically,
[27:19.240 --> 27:22.320]  economically, culturally, lawfully.
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.520]  That's why you're so scared of my voice, because you know it's judgment.
[27:26.520 --> 27:28.720]  It's judgment day.
[27:28.720 --> 27:30.640]  Judgment day cometh.
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.640]  Judgment day is so close, and justice is good.
[27:34.640 --> 27:35.640]  Justice is right.
[27:35.640 --> 27:42.600]  That's a quote from Tom, can we come in with justice for all next segment?
[27:42.600 --> 27:49.080]  Ah, we just want to have our families and live and have prosperity, but you've got to
[27:49.080 --> 27:53.840]  control the prosperity, you've got to control us, and that's where we will never let you
[27:53.840 --> 27:55.040]  control us.
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.720]  You will, you lesser things will never run our lives.
[27:58.720 --> 28:03.640]  So now you have summoned us to destroy you politically.
[28:03.640 --> 28:10.440]  You have gone to the altar, and you've prayed on gods, ancient gods.
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.880]  You've summoned the Titans, and they will arrive.
[28:15.880 --> 28:19.080]  Now that said, we'll get into the politics of this, the mechanics of it, but Congress
[28:19.080 --> 28:20.080]  must act.
[28:20.080 --> 28:23.080]  The President must act now to defeat them quickly before we go into the next phase.
[28:23.080 --> 28:26.280]  The next phase is the next phase.
[28:26.280 --> 28:27.760]  These people that did this are delusional.
[28:27.760 --> 28:30.320]  They'll run from what they're about to release.
[28:30.320 --> 28:31.320]  We must stop them now.
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.880]  Please don't forget we're listening to supported amazing products across the board from t-shirts,
[28:35.880 --> 28:40.480]  the books, the films, the shortwave radios, to non-gmo, heirloom seeds, to amazing supplements

[28:49.960 --> 28:54.120]  that local radio or TV station you're listening or watching right now.
[28:54.120 --> 28:59.720]  It's that human free will outside their technocracy that is a victory.
[28:59.720 --> 29:02.440]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat, not true.
[29:02.440 --> 29:04.480]  Actually, you are what you can't absorb.
[29:04.480 --> 29:08.040]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are
[29:08.040 --> 29:09.040]  they?

[29:57.520 --> 30:00.200]  That's dyln.co.
[30:00.200 --> 30:06.520]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[30:06.520 --> 30:12.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[30:12.920 --> 30:20.160]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[30:20.160 --> 30:22.360]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[30:22.360 --> 30:26.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.760]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[30:29.760 --> 30:33.600]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodide in it.
[30:33.600 --> 30:34.920]  You cannot beat that.
[30:34.920 --> 30:38.680]  For children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[30:38.680 --> 30:45.840]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[30:45.840 --> 30:50.280]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[30:50.280 --> 30:53.120]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[30:53.120 --> 30:56.240]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[30:56.240 --> 31:00.160]  against us, so we need your support.
[31:00.160 --> 31:04.560]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.560 --> 31:09.280]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.280 --> 31:10.800]  to detoxify the body.
[31:10.800 --> 31:15.640]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.640 --> 31:17.160]  It's made in the USA.
[31:17.160 --> 31:22.080]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[31:22.080 --> 31:23.920]  the body, and it supports the info war.
[31:23.920 --> 31:26.200]  It is a classical 360-win.
[31:26.200 --> 31:30.680]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[31:30.680 --> 31:35.360]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.360 --> 31:36.360]  get.
[31:36.360 --> 31:39.560]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.560 --> 31:44.600]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[31:44.600 --> 31:49.840]  can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[31:49.840 --> 31:52.560]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.560 --> 31:55.840]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:55.840 --> 31:59.920]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[31:59.920 --> 32:00.920]  We knew it was coming.
[32:00.920 --> 32:02.920]  The whole thing was for me, leg.
[32:02.920 --> 32:08.200]  First demonize infowars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[32:08.200 --> 32:13.520]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[32:13.520 --> 32:20.040]  children and Islamophobia, and then voila, two weeks later ban infowars completely off
[32:20.040 --> 32:26.480]  of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[32:26.480 --> 32:32.960]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link,
[32:32.960 --> 32:36.560]  whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.720]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter, and give us your
[32:40.720 --> 32:44.960]  emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[32:44.960 --> 32:45.960]  own platform.
[32:45.960 --> 32:51.000]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.680]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[32:55.680 --> 33:03.480]  to point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[33:03.480 --> 33:31.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:31.560 --> 33:43.440]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was
[33:43.440 --> 33:48.160]  the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it
[33:48.160 --> 33:51.520]  was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hub, it
[33:51.520 --> 33:53.200]  was the wonder of despair.
[33:53.200 --> 33:57.600]  We had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven,
[33:57.600 --> 33:59.200]  we were all going directly the other way.
[33:59.200 --> 34:04.920]  In short, the period was so far unlike the present period that some of the noisiest authorities
[34:04.920 --> 34:10.720]  insisted on it being received for good or evil in the superlative degree of comparison
[34:10.720 --> 34:11.720]  only.
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.840]  Ann Coulter, a true icon of Americana, joins us, first time she was on 15 years ago, I
[34:17.840 --> 34:22.680]  was just trying to make points I guess, but I got to meet her in person at the RNC in
[34:22.680 --> 34:28.760]  an interview, I appreciate her joining us to talk about the onslaught, the Blitzkrieg
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.200]  against the First Amendment, the other cowards in Washington are scared to cover it, they
[34:33.200 --> 34:37.840]  all want jobs I guess with Google or Facebook or Apple later with $3 trillion between them.
[34:37.840 --> 34:41.840]  But Ann Coulter has hundreds of videos on YouTube that are negative about her, force
[34:41.840 --> 34:48.660]  fed, show to eye, 96% of conservative sites are buried, they block everything, shadow
[34:48.660 --> 34:57.760]  bandings at over 93%, I'm completely blackballed, and the left has openly come out when Obama
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.920]  saw that Trump won and set up this office of countering propaganda in the Pentagon,
[35:02.920 --> 35:08.160]  but it's part of the CIA and that I've learned is the group with no attention that is working
[35:08.160 --> 35:12.760]  with the leftists and the media to have the mainstream media fact check all conservatives
[35:12.760 --> 35:18.840]  and ban us and then put their results on top ahead of manipulating the election and then
[35:18.840 --> 35:25.840]  Senator Warner, Wyden, and Murphy are all in Obama's defense authorization saying they
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.840]  would run the counter to Trump, so Trump needs to remove this, this is a cancer, Ann Coulter
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.920]  joins us to talk about being one of the most banned people in the world and where she thinks
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.920]  this is going with only 70 days left before what I think is the most important election
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.920]  not just in US history but world history, Ann Coulter thanks for joining us.
[35:44.920 --> 35:47.960]  Absolutely, good to be in the bunker with you.
[35:47.960 --> 35:52.680]  Well, we're in the bunker, you heard my little two minute rant, you're the expert on this,
[35:52.680 --> 35:56.640]  what would you call this period in history?
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.360]  It is like nothing, I think this country has seen before, I mean what they've done to you
[36:03.360 --> 36:11.680]  and many others, the left the resistance, a military term by the way, if Trump had lost
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.480]  the election and as Hillary did, said I'm joining the resistance, they would have said
[36:17.480 --> 36:24.320]  this is a dog whistle to the KKK, it's a military term and then imagine if right wingers started
[36:24.320 --> 36:30.560]  beating up Hillary supporters, as we have seen, left wingers and anti-fog beating up
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.120]  Trump supporters, I think the country would recognize we're in the middle of a fascist
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.840]  uprising, but no because the fascist uprising is being cheered on and encouraged by the
[36:39.840 --> 36:45.680]  mainstream media, it just goes, it goes without comment.
[36:45.680 --> 36:53.040]  But for the resistance to suddenly act as if they don't like conspiracy theories, I
[36:53.040 --> 36:59.200]  at least actually, well I argue against conspiracy theories, I don't try to ban them, I'm thinking
[36:59.200 --> 37:03.120]  that argument and free speech works on that.
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.720]  When we're living through the biggest conspiracy theory of all, this Russian nonsense invented
[37:08.720 --> 37:14.080]  by Hillary as she always does, when she's caught in some sort of scandal, she did with
[37:14.080 --> 37:19.560]  Jennifer Flowers, she went on TV and talked about some man in Arkansas, that's right
[37:19.560 --> 37:20.560]  wing conspiracies.
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.920]  Right up forward to explain Monica Lewinsky, both of which turned out to be true, when
[37:25.920 --> 37:31.600]  her healthcare plan went down, she accused the media of buying into and promoting right
[37:31.600 --> 37:37.240]  wing talking points because you know how the media just hangs on, well my every word, just
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.760]  whatever I put out there, they're repeating right there in the New York Times, it's just
[37:41.760 --> 37:46.640]  been absolute madness that went from her every time there was, she's caught in some scandal,
[37:46.640 --> 37:53.200]  she finds some mysterious bad actor, malefactor Linda Tripp conspiring against her and her
[37:53.200 --> 37:54.200]  husband.
[37:54.200 --> 37:58.560]  So when the Democrats are caught in the middle of WikiLeaks, which was very embarrassing
[37:58.560 --> 38:05.040]  for the Democrats there, they were sabotaging Bernie Sanders, Democrats all over Capitol
[38:05.040 --> 38:06.600]  Hill were furious with it.
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.840]  They were running Google, they were gaming everything, they were getting the questions
[38:10.840 --> 38:13.400]  beforehand from CNN.
[38:13.400 --> 38:20.440]  And that's when Hillary concocted the conspiracy of Russia and Trump conspiring to steal the
[38:20.440 --> 38:21.440]  election from her.
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.280]  At the time, as you'll read in my book, Resistance is Fusile, how the Trumpating left
[38:26.280 --> 38:32.040]  lost his collective mind, at the time all the mainstream press, the New York Times,
[38:32.040 --> 38:37.000]  was utterly skeptical, could barely control their laughing over Hillary's conspiracy
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.480]  theory about Russia saying, well, paraphrasing, wow, even the John Birchers didn't come up
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.480]  with something like this.
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.040]  Well, yeah, they said that, they put it out, Hillary has the Russian problem with Uranium
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.040]  1.
[38:49.040 --> 38:55.040]  Oh, she has plenty of problems, including colluding with Russia for that Russian dossier put
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.040]  together by Christopher Steele.
[38:57.040 --> 39:03.000]  It was only after Trump won the election that suddenly all these respectable news outlets
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.760]  that had ridiculed Hillary's Russian conspiracy theory at the time, when she was using to
[39:07.760 --> 39:14.080]  deflect from the Wikipedia leaks, suddenly they went back and, oh my gosh, maybe there's
[39:14.080 --> 39:15.760]  something to this Russian business.
[39:15.760 --> 39:23.040]  Now, they're the ones dragging this country through a completely demented conspiracy between
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.240]  who, the Trump campaign, there was no Trump campaign.
[39:26.240 --> 39:31.400]  I mean, it would be weird enough to say, it was Donald Trump, I mean, that was it.
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.800]  Really, he didn't have advancement and pollsters and expensive campaign consultants, his idea
[39:36.800 --> 39:42.400]  was, I know, I'll fly around the country giving speeches and pushing popular ideas, and that
[39:42.400 --> 39:43.400]  will win me the White House.
[39:43.400 --> 39:48.280]  They laughed at him throughout his campaign, and then when it worked, oh my gosh, there
[39:48.280 --> 39:53.000]  must have been a secret conspiracy with a campaign that didn't exist.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  You're absolutely right.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.200]  Let me ask you this, Ann Coulter, because you're one of the most banned people after
[39:58.200 --> 39:59.200]  me.
[39:59.200 --> 40:02.320]  I don't even like that distinction, but I'll go with it.
[40:02.320 --> 40:03.560]  Why are you so banned?
[40:03.560 --> 40:08.000]  Why is Prager, he's as banned as you and I?
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.360]  Why are they doing this?
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.920]  It's so authoritarian, and then they call for us all to be banned in thousands of articles.
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.280]  Then CNN goes, Friday, Trump's crazy.
[40:18.280 --> 40:19.880]  No one's banning anybody.
[40:19.880 --> 40:24.440]  When anybody can look at the numbers, it's like 96%, so what's going on there?
[40:24.440 --> 40:30.480]  Oh yes, well, you have about 800 million followers.
[40:30.480 --> 40:39.360]  That's why you're banned, and with Prager and me, they tried to, I don't know about Prager,
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.360]  I know very specifically how the media has treated me throughout my life.
[40:43.360 --> 40:46.240]  So talk about yourself, because you're one of them, you're one of the top five most
[40:46.240 --> 40:47.240]  banned people.
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.560]  I suspect that's true.
[40:51.560 --> 40:57.400]  When I first started going on TV, or slander and treat it and godless and so on, their
[40:57.400 --> 41:02.560]  idea was, okay, we'll bring her on TV, we'll treat her like she's David Duke, so we can
[41:02.560 --> 41:07.000]  just what they did to Trump, we'll communicate to the public, do not read this person, do
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.720]  not listen to this person, we'll scowl when she walks on, we'll yell at her, we'll take
[41:11.720 --> 41:15.280]  some joke out of context and blow it up into a huge big deal.
[41:15.280 --> 41:20.160]  But every time they did that, people would hear enough of me on TV to realize that they
[41:20.160 --> 41:25.000]  believed me and not the media, whomever the interviewer was, would end up looking bad,
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.760]  I'd sell lots of books.
[41:26.760 --> 41:31.600]  So I'd say about five books back, they just decided, that's it, we're going to pretend
[41:31.600 --> 41:37.440]  she doesn't exist, and I mean, the only solace I have is it's got to be driving them crazy
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.480]  as I keep writing these books, they must have interns running in.
[41:40.480 --> 41:45.120]  Look at what she says here, we've got to attack her, settle down Dennis, we're not putting
[41:45.120 --> 41:46.120]  her on air.
[41:46.120 --> 41:51.640]  Let's talk about your new book, Resist is Futile with a great title, but that's it,
[41:51.640 --> 41:57.080]  they couldn't beat you by misrepresenting what you said, so now they are just banning
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.720]  you completely, even though it's killing the NFL, it's killing Hollywood to ban conservatives
[42:01.720 --> 42:07.200]  to be anti-American, they're all really destroying themselves in the process.
[42:07.200 --> 42:13.400]  Well, the danger is, I mean, it hasn't happened yet, but I have to say I've worried about
[42:13.400 --> 42:20.560]  this for some years now, it sounds like a science fiction nightmare of mine, that I just wake
[42:20.560 --> 42:27.120]  up one day, try to click on to, you know, the Breitbart Report or email with Matt Drudge
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.440]  and it would just shut down, I wouldn't be able to get through, there would be no Breitbart.com,
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.160]  there would be no Daily Caller, we won't be able to communicate.
[42:35.160 --> 42:40.480]  Well, stay there because de-platforming and the Chinese social score model is what they're
[42:40.480 --> 42:45.920]  bringing here, they're trying to cut our software off that runs infowars.com, inculturantculture.com,
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.040]  her new book, we'll talk about it, she's telling the other side, Resist is Futile,
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.120]  an amazing headline, what an amazing name, can't wait to read it, and then we'll talk
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.800]  about what does Trump need to do with 69 and a half days left to counter this perch.

[46:33.120 --> 46:37.480]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[46:37.480 --> 46:43.320]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[46:43.320 --> 46:49.280]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[46:49.280 --> 46:52.160]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[47:03.440 --> 47:21.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.400 --> 47:25.400]  All right, Ann Coulter, one of the top selling political authors of all time, is with us
[47:25.400 --> 47:26.400]  her new book.
[47:26.400 --> 47:27.400]  His resistance is futile.
[47:27.400 --> 47:28.400]  We're an amazing title.
[47:28.400 --> 47:30.400]  I've read many of her books.
[47:30.400 --> 47:33.920]  Thank God for Ann Coulter helping get the ground ready for Donald Trump, and Trump's
[47:33.920 --> 47:38.040]  not perfect, but he's under attack because he's a real president.
[47:38.040 --> 47:45.520]  And specifically, the Democrats have met with Senator Warner, Wyden, and Murphy, and I've
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.480]  got all that we're going to put it on screen, executive orders Obama signed before he left
[47:49.480 --> 47:55.480]  office taking defense authorization money, Pentagon money, and using it to quote counter
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.280]  right wing media, which they all call Russian.
[47:58.280 --> 48:05.800]  So when you see CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, involved as Project Veritas exposed, in everybody's
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.880]  accounts censoring us, it's the perfect storm of dying media, the Democratic Party, and
[48:10.880 --> 48:14.560]  big tech all merging to steal the 2018 election.
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.200]  They admit they're doing it, and I know you're aware of all that.
[48:18.200 --> 48:19.320]  You've been shadow banned.
[48:19.320 --> 48:20.400]  You've been completely blocked.
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.600]  They put nothing but negative search results, 10 pages deep in front of you, used to you'd
[48:24.600 --> 48:27.280]  be number one with what you did because it was popular.
[48:27.280 --> 48:30.560]  They've broken their algorithm to try to steal this election.
[48:30.560 --> 48:32.640]  I think they've jumped the shark.
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.000]  I think it's going to backfire when Hillary couldn't control the media, when she tried
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.120]  to control Google, it didn't work.
[48:38.120 --> 48:43.920]  Now they've openly taken the dying dinosaur media, who aren't just now failed news, they're
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.640]  now anti free speech, stasi, and put them in charge.
[48:48.640 --> 48:51.760]  This is beyond, like you said, a science fiction novel.
[48:51.760 --> 48:57.120]  So what, A, what's your take on that and B, as you're being unpersoned like I am?
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.320]  What do you think the president is the only guy in government speaking out against this?
[49:01.320 --> 49:02.600]  What do you think he should do?
[49:02.600 --> 49:03.600]  What should Congress do?
[49:03.600 --> 49:12.400]  Well, there are things that can be done, and just to reiterate what you just said, consider
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.560]  how strong liberals consider their arguments.
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.760]  They've got all of the mainstream media, 100%, ABC, NBC, CBS, all of the cables, the major
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.000]  news, newspapers, the major news magazines, they've got Yahoo, AOL.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.120]  They have the swamp in Washington.
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.760]  They've got Hollywood.
[49:31.760 --> 49:37.400]  They have Silicon Valley, and now they're down to the last corners of the internet.
[49:37.400 --> 49:40.200]  Oh no, conservatives can speak to one another.
[49:40.200 --> 49:41.200]  We must shut it off.
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.760]  I have to say, if I were advising liberals with their insane opinions, I'd say, yep,
[49:45.760 --> 49:46.760]  that's what you got to do.
[49:46.760 --> 49:51.280]  You got to shut off free speech on the internet.
[49:51.280 --> 49:58.200]  And it reminds me of Robert Mueller's indictment of the 13 Russians, which I describe in my
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.360]  book.
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.240]  The most interesting thing about that indictment, and that Mueller being terrified of these
[50:05.240 --> 50:12.400]  Russian bots and their woke blacks Instagram account, is that the Office of Special Counsel
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.240]  knows less about social media than even the senator's questioning Mark Zuckerberg.
[50:17.240 --> 50:23.280]  They have no idea how it works, and the argument is basically that 13 Russians, with a few
[50:23.280 --> 50:30.680]  Facebook ads, managed to overwhelm the entire American media, which also kind of had its
[50:30.680 --> 50:33.840]  finger on the scale, making it very clear you are not to vote.
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.520]  Oh, New York Times, 98% chance the Hillary was going to win, and so instead of saying
[50:38.520 --> 50:41.680]  America had a populist movement, oh, it's the Russians.
[50:41.680 --> 50:47.200]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, and Russians, 13 Russians, you know, if 13 Russians can overwhelm our
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.120]  entire media, I got to tell you, Alex, I hope they're running our country because things
[50:51.120 --> 50:52.620]  would run so smoothly.
[50:52.620 --> 50:54.120]  No, I agree.
[50:54.120 --> 50:57.040]  Are they giving us 4.6% growth rate?
[50:57.040 --> 51:02.360]  Are they giving us a rebuilt military, thousands of factories, wow, the Russians really love
[51:02.360 --> 51:03.360]  us.
[51:03.360 --> 51:10.760]  Yes, and they put Trump in the presidency, so thank you, Russia.
[51:10.760 --> 51:13.760]  There are things that can be done, but the overall point, I think-
[51:13.760 --> 51:19.160]  But that'll be the headline deceptively, not sarcasm, and culture thanks Russia, and culture
[51:19.160 --> 51:21.480]  thanks Russia for electing Trump.
[51:21.480 --> 51:27.880]  Yes, they've become, that's one of my favorite parts of the resistance, how, you know, they
[51:27.880 --> 51:33.880]  always make fun of right wingers for being, or, you know, Christians, someone who's afraid
[51:33.880 --> 51:36.480]  someone in some places is having fun.
[51:36.480 --> 51:41.600]  No, that's them, they have become the moral scolds, they have become the man-
[51:41.600 --> 51:42.600]  Bus kills.
[51:42.600 --> 51:48.640]  Yes, and the big, but the big briefcase going in, and no, humor is gone, they have no sense
[51:48.640 --> 51:55.400]  of irony, sarcasm, they're the ones who will go on and patrol social media tweets and apparently
[51:55.400 --> 51:56.400]  bots.
[51:56.400 --> 52:05.680]  But the end result is, I think these huge avenues of First Amendment speech, Google,
[52:05.680 --> 52:11.880]  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, they have to have the First Amendment applied to them.
[52:11.880 --> 52:17.480]  These idiot conservatives at certain places, I won't mention like National Review, you
[52:17.480 --> 52:21.680]  know, they think they're so brave and brilliant, saying, well, it's not the government, so
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.360]  it doesn't violate the First Amendment.
[52:23.360 --> 52:29.120]  No, I'm sorry, at some point, when you have a total monopoly on how people can communicate
[52:29.120 --> 52:36.800]  with one another, we do have legal concepts like natural monopolies and utilities.
[52:36.800 --> 52:42.440]  And unless they start living under the First Amendment, I think the law should force them
[52:42.440 --> 52:43.440]  to.
[52:43.440 --> 52:47.560]  Right now, the law is written in such a way so that they are simultaneously publishers,
[52:47.560 --> 52:52.240]  so they will determine who can be heard or seen on their airwaves, so they're acting
[52:52.240 --> 52:53.240]  like a New Yorker.
[52:53.240 --> 52:54.240]  And immune.
[52:54.240 --> 52:59.040]  Yeah, and also, yeah, totally immune from suit.
[52:59.040 --> 53:03.360]  So I'm sorry, you don't get those kinds of privileges in a country that still believes
[53:03.360 --> 53:04.360]  in free speech.
[53:04.360 --> 53:10.040]  Exactly, they ran a Hill article, a fake poll at the methodology, and then they're paying
[53:10.040 --> 53:11.440]  for it as an ad.
[53:11.440 --> 53:15.400]  Majority of Americans say, ban Alan Jones, they took me as a target, misrepresented
[53:15.400 --> 53:19.680]  what I said, now they're banning everybody else after me, and thank God, Trump's trying
[53:19.680 --> 53:22.720]  to move against him and culture as our guest.
[53:22.720 --> 53:25.320]  Talk a few minutes about, we only have like four minutes left, I hope you'll come back
[53:25.320 --> 53:30.680]  soon, there's so much that's happening, 15 years is too long, about your term, resistance
[53:30.680 --> 53:31.680]  is futile.
[53:31.680 --> 53:34.800]  This is obviously, that's from Star Trek, I've made that point, the university's the
[53:34.800 --> 53:39.920]  left, everything is, they're saying resistance is futile, but like you said, they've already
[53:39.920 --> 53:45.720]  banned us everywhere, Hollywood, TV, everywhere, now they want to control people talking to
[53:45.720 --> 53:51.360]  their cousins on Facebook, I think they've jumped the shark, I think this is backfiring.
[53:51.360 --> 53:56.920]  I certainly think over all the resistance is backfiring, I mean, I find myself reacting
[53:56.920 --> 54:01.760]  this way, I've been a little testy with the president for not even starting the wall,
[54:01.760 --> 54:06.600]  his central campaign promise, and then the left goes off on some crazy, you know, the
[54:06.600 --> 54:12.080]  access Hollywood tape, oh, he admits to committing sexual assault on it, no he didn't, he said
[54:12.080 --> 54:16.600]  they let you do it, that is by definition, it's like Elvis, he said the women are jumping
[54:16.600 --> 54:17.600]  on you.
[54:17.600 --> 54:22.640]  Yeah, it was, it was, he was actually talking about celebrity culture and with some degree
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.040]  of disapproval, all of which I go through in my book, the craziness over Charlottesville,
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.600]  and how it was in a dog whistle to, I don't know, again, the Klan, it's always the non-existent
[54:32.600 --> 54:38.920]  Klan, most people in the Klan are putting in expense reports with the FBI, by saying
[54:38.920 --> 54:44.400]  both sides, both sides, both sides, they come out with these outrageously unfair attacks
[54:44.400 --> 54:49.360]  and they drive me right back into his corner, now, you know, look, if Democrats care about
[54:49.360 --> 54:54.480]  their fellow Americans, the working class, the middle class, even computer programmers
[54:54.480 --> 55:02.440]  who are losing jobs to the H1B workers, can't we join together and do good things for the
[55:02.440 --> 55:03.600]  people already here?
[55:03.600 --> 55:06.920]  It's not like Trump is a down the line Republican, it's not like we don't have one of the most
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.400]  open borders already, exactly, somebody asked this question, what happens if they win the
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.720]  midterms of Democrats, what happens if they lose, that's the key questions, well, A, what
[55:15.720 --> 55:18.840]  is your prediction for the midterms, and what happens either way?
[55:18.840 --> 55:25.560]  Well, I'm worried, the historical odds are that we are going to have a blue wave, so
[55:25.560 --> 55:33.000]  the odds are Democrats do at least win the House, since the Civil War, they'll definitely
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.640]  impeach him, they'll impeach him for a hangmail, it doesn't matter, their base is white-hot,
[55:37.640 --> 55:41.960]  and I think it'll pretty much be the end of a lot of the Trump agenda on the optimistic
[55:41.960 --> 55:47.680]  side, they will look crazy if they impeach him, and most of the things Trump promised
[55:47.680 --> 55:52.040]  during his campaign, he doesn't need Congress for, he doesn't need Congress to build a wall,
[55:52.040 --> 55:56.000]  he's the commander-in-chief, look at your pocket constitution, it's his job to protect
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.840]  the borders, so maybe he could get back to the things he promised during the campaign,
[55:59.840 --> 56:04.200]  if once Congress is completely cut off to him.
[56:04.200 --> 56:11.040]  So you're kind of predicting, since the Civil War, whoever's in power loses the House, but
[56:11.040 --> 56:16.120]  things are a little different now, gut level, what do you think, Ann?
[56:16.120 --> 56:17.920]  I really don't know.
[56:17.920 --> 56:18.920]  I don't know.
[56:18.920 --> 56:22.360]  So if they win, I say when I don't know.
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.360]  I agree.
[56:23.360 --> 56:27.720]  So if they win, they go crazy, what happens if they lose?
[56:27.720 --> 56:34.640]  Well, it'll be a lot of fun, they'll go crazy, but it won't be the end of the Trump agenda,
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.440]  we'll still, and by the way, we are probably going to hold the Senate that much, I'll predict.
[56:38.440 --> 56:42.240]  And it also depends a lot on what Trump does over the next few months, I think he needs
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.080]  to go back to campaign mode, do nothing, his calendar should be blocked off September.
[56:47.080 --> 56:52.520]  No, I agree, how do people go against the President, that's given him a 4.6 growth rate,
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.600]  how do you piss on prosperity?
[56:55.600 --> 57:00.800]  That's true, but you never know what's going, I mean, I was just down at the New York Stock
[57:00.800 --> 57:06.520]  Exchange yesterday asking them, come on, it's got to fall, there's gravity, it can't keep
[57:06.520 --> 57:12.680]  going up forever, and oh boy, watch out when the stock market falls.
[57:12.680 --> 57:18.160]  All right, the new book is Resistants Futile and Culture, Inculture.com, great to have
[57:18.160 --> 57:22.280]  you back on, hope we don't totally get put in a gulag here, we're both being magically

[59:53.000 --> 01:00:18.280]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[43:35.940 --> 01:00:50.400]  hard to turn that music off, little junior brown surf medley, trying to get
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.720]  Roger on the skype, I know he's thought that he's pretty close to being indicted by Mueller,
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:00.200]  that his house surrounded this weekend, then I saw a headline that he says he's about
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.640]  to be indicted, so I wanted to get him on to get into that.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.680]  I did not plug any last hour, any products or anything, because I get so busy, I get
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:16.920]  so obsessed with the news, I don't plug, I don't sit there and then plug every segment
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.960]  like other talk show hosts do, and that's my biggest problem.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.760]  I'd have done that over the years, before all the shadow bang and the rest of it, we'd
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.680]  be sitting on top $20 million or something to fund ourselves for a few years, but we're
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.680]  not.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680]  We're not.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.720]  So I'm asking listeners to get products you need that are really high quality, the best
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:43.800]  supplements out there, the best air filtration, the best water filtration, and to go to infowarstore.com.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.240]  By the way, when you have the top of the line products, like bodies that we can click on
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:02:01.640]  right there for TV viewers, and it's a 95% curcumin, the leading competitors are 3%, curcumin
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:08.920]  comes from the tumor, so good for you on so many fronts.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.880]  When you go for something that's California standard, which almost no one could pass,
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.560]  and that is the best 95%, and you may have contracts with the companies that they're
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:25.120]  going to test it, and it's going to be at that, well, it's been five, six months since
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.840]  we got more in.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.880]  And so I've been flipping out on these companies saying I'm going to go to somebody else, even
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.600]  though you're the top company, and so they got us 3,000 bottles of it, and it's going
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.840]  to sell out in a couple of weeks, and then it might be October until we get more bodies
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.680]  and folks, leading competitors are $67, because it's patented to be able to have curcumin
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.280]  at 95%, and it's got other ingredients that accelerate it, and it's so good for inflammation,
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:59.400]  antioxidant, just, I mean, tumorics are amazing, it's curry, but it's the concentrate.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:05.480]  I mean, in one tablet, it seems like the equivalent of eating a whole bag of curry, basically.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:12.880]  So bodies, we got a limited shipment after being sold out, and it's about to be gone,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:20.880]  and my guys are like, listen, it has 4.9 stars, 98% reviews, nobody else has got that, everybody
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.240]  loves it, Alex, shallot at full price, we need to fund the operation.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:31.520]  I believe in selling it 50% off, because when it comes back in October, I want to say it's
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.240]  been sold out, and then have a bunch of it, and everybody use it, and then love it, and
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.080]  sign up for auto-ship, and get an additional 10% off, just how I operate.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.200]  Bodies, joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support,
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.720]  my wife played competitive tennis for a long time, did a lot of weightlifting, she heard
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.600]  her hip or elbow, she's able to get back into weightlifting, after she went to medical doctors
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.960]  to prescriptions, you name it, none of it worked, she went on bodies, she was taking regular
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.520]  turmeric, and I said baby, that's not real turmeric, I looked up the brand, it's like
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.520]  10%, maybe, I said how about this, a month after she was on it, she's back in tennis,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.000]  everything else, this is like five months ago.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.840]  So she had a baby and some things as well, but the point is, from our research, this
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:26.800]  is the very best turmeric compound out there, 95% are cumanoids, Boswella, Satara, Extract,
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:33.200]  organic, experiment, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, peppering from black pepper, it's
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:39.520]  all there, m4store.com, m4slime.com, and it will be sold out for a while when it's gone,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.720]  so if you want bodies, get a 50% off at m4store.com, and of course, there's also 50% off, really
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.560]  it's more than that, the ultimate bone broth formula, read about how great that is, and
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.080]  it funds our operation, so we've got super silver, 25% off as well, m4store.com, Roger
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080]  Stone's right here.

[01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:23.040]  newsletter, we are the renaissance, and we are winning.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.240]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, Cody Wilson, the inventor of the 3D printable gun that's
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.680]  all over the nose, and me in studio, whether this is a fellow Austinite, crumbs weighed
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.120]  in on it, don't really agree with what he's saying, but there's so much to cover.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:41.080]  In the brief time we have Roger Stone, thank you for joining us, she got a dental appointment
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.920]  I know for broken tooth, it's in the news that you're saying you now believe you will
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.080]  be indicted by Mueller, we talked this weekend, you weren't sure, is that accurate in the
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.440]  Hill, the Wall Street Journal, and then let's also get into Trump finally going, millions
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.320]  are being censored, it's criminal, they've banned 96% of conservatives, yeah, they're
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:03.160]  stealing the election, so let's cover both those topics, Roger Stone, former head of
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160]  the Trump campaign.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.600]  Well, Alex, it's kind of a conundrum, because first of all, I know that the special counsel
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:16.500]  has no evidence of Russian collusion on my part, or trafficking in allegedly hacked emails
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:22.640]  with WikiLeaks, that didn't happen either, any other nonsense pertaining to John Podesta's
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]  emails.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.640]  On the other hand, I'm a realistic man, I know that I've been under government surveillance
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.960]  since June of 2016, no probable cause for that of course, I know the special counsel
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:41.120]  has had full access to all my financial and bank records, I know that at least 12 of my
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.840]  current or former colleagues have been interrogated by the FBI, I know that at least four of
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.400]  my current or former colleagues have been dragged in front of the grand jury, and we
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:08:00.320]  both know that a runaway special counsel with a political agenda can indict the proverbial
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.320]  ham sin.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.760]  And he's desperate to cover up his real uranium one ties and the rest of it, so let me ask
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.800]  you this, what if they are going to indict you, what's the time frame, and what do you
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.120]  think it'll be, not obviously Russia's just like everything else, that they're going to
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.040]  claim obstruction, are they going to claim that you lied to the FBI, what are they going
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040]  to say?
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.560]  Well, I've never been interviewed by the FBI or the special counsel, I don't-
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.360]  So, I was trying to say, perjury to Congress?
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.920]  No, because there is no perjury, my testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Adam
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:37.000]  Schiff and Alec and Eric Swalwell notwithstanding is 100% truthful and accurate and I stand
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.720]  by every word, no, Alex, it's a conundrum, they're feverishly looking for-
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720]  IRS?
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.720]  Like Manafort?
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.720]  IRS?
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.520]  No, I don't think so, because I've paid my taxes and I didn't-
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.600]  No, I understand you didn't do anything, I'm saying, what do you think they're cooking
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.600]  up?
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:59.040]  Yeah, it's perhaps some bogus campaign finance violation, because I've been active in American
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040]  politics for almost four years.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.280]  Yeah, we know that's what they're looking into is you and the Danny Williams stuff,
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.880]  all totally legitimate, when we know they've asked people about me and you and money in
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  campaign.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.560]  Oh, no, there's no question, it's interesting that all 12 of my former associates have been
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.480]  questioned by the FBI, I've been asked about my relationship with Alex Jones and my relationship
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:27.840]  with Infowars, it's a witch hunt and when I go out to start to raise the money to defend
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.200]  myself because this threatens to destroy me, Alex, it threatens to destroy my family,
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.400]  I'm not wealthy, you can go online and see a story that says Roger Stone is worth $20
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:45.360]  million in your dreams, that's a planted story, probably put forward by David Brock or some
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.360]  other-
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:52.320]  Oh, let's go forward, they have articles saying Americans say Ban Jones and oh, they agree
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.200]  in polls, it's a fake poll, it's an advertisement they're putting out in a huge media buy, no,
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.880]  no, I know your finances, you're almost bankrupt, we don't want to get into it, I'm not worth
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.600]  the money they say I am, they count the equipment in my office, maybe three or four million,
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:12.240]  but that's all equipment, so exactly, this is total fraud and what's scary is, they're
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.480]  asking about me constantly, they have the New York Times, the Washington Post, camped
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.320]  out in Austin, they keep asking everyone where's the money, Russians, campaign money, where's
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.120]  Alex's campaign money, I've never taken any campaign money, but you can see them just
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.400]  trying to have that New York Times hit piece come out the day I'm arrested.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:37.120]  Yeah, I think that's exactly what they have in mind, let's break this down for our audience,
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:42.560]  we both know what my crime is, what your crime is, our crime is very simple, we supported
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.600]  Donald Trump for president and we helped defeat Crooked Hillary, there's our crime in the
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:54.360]  nutshell, now the question is, will the witch hunt get us in the meantime, or will the president
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.360]  act first?
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:00.320]  Let's say we'll pay back by this witch and her criminal crew work, no it won't, Trump
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.120]  must take action, so how does he do that?
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.520]  Well there's a number of things he can do, let's start by firing Don McGahn, the White
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:13.120]  House counsel who keeps urging him to take no action and who's gone over the side, 30
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.440]  hours of interrogation or I should say 30 hours of interviews with the special counsel,
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.440]  30 hours that's longer than an entire day, what could he possibly have to say about Donald
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:30.400]  Trump in that 30 hour period, I would can him so fast his head would spin, secondarily
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.720]  declassify all of the government documents pertaining to the illegal unconstitutional
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:45.200]  FISA warrants, number three declassify all of Hillary's known emails, number four declassify
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:53.120]  all of the emails that Huma Abedin forwarded to her husband Anthony Weiner, we now know
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:00.120]  of 700,000 emails, only 3,000 of them were reviewed by the FBI and those were handpicked
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:07.280]  by none other than Peter Strock, step number four fire Jeff Sessions, step number five
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.720]  fire Rod Rosenstein, step number six fire as deep into your justice department as you
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.400]  need to to find a man or woman committed to the rule of law, those are the steps the
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:24.320]  president must do and then go on a massive offensive in dieting all these enemies, well
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.400]  it's very simple and take all their notice they're all groveling for their security
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.720]  clearances and they use that to direct their operatives still in government take all the
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:39.560]  Obama people 50 deep all of their clearances, well in order the immediate arrest of Bill
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:46.160]  Hillary and yes Barack Obama because you see you see Alex, no person is above the law remember
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.320]  when they told us that endlessly after Watergate those sanctimonious liberals no person is
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:58.240]  above the law well Barack Obama sold weapons to ISIS in violation of the law and he should
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:05.520]  be prosecuted for it, Bill and Hillary profited from a massive criminal scrim scheme called
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.800]  the Clinton Foundation and don't forget Haiti, you know just Haiti just goes on and on and
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:17.360]  on so you have to turn this on them, I agree this is total offense, they have their knives
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.040]  sharpened for the president his family, the only option is total political war, well
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.720]  and you know again I did say here on info wars that very good sources told me that Robert
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.840]  Mueller is targeting Donald Trump Jr. I didn't say that because I don't like Donald Trump
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840]  Jr. I like Donald Trump Jr.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.880]  No you broke that a week and a half before it's all confirmed now, there's no question
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.480]  they're looking at him for some kind of process crime, originally I was told it was lying
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:50.760]  to the FBI, now I'm told they're going to try to implicate him in Michael Cohn's payments
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.280]  to Stormy Daniels, payments that I believe based on vast experience, even the former
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.160]  head of the federal election commission says they're totally legal, perfectly legal, perfectly
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.000]  legal, perfectly legal, so you know it is the president's got to get off defense and
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.880]  on offense, he has the power, they don't have the power.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.320]  Even the LA Times and others in San Francisco Chronicles say and even Hayden has said and
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.160]  the Democrats even you know they said leave him alone, you're about to make Trump mad,
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.720]  let's get him, if we win the midterm, stop, stop, they go you're about to piss him off,
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.840]  exactly they know he's got all the power now, use it.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.280]  Could not agree more, look the president appears to be reaching his boiling point, he seems
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.960]  to have figured out the internet censorship issue.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.520]  He's going with his gut, how good is that?
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.200]  And he talks about us without mentioning our name, those whose names I can't mention
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.440]  have been banned on social media.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.640]  You can't ban one guy, that's wrong, the fake news is CNN.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.640]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.640]  So Mr. President.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.720]  I'm confirmed, he's ordered everybody, he doesn't care what Kelly said, anything we

[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:15.800]  We are the revolution here and they seek to silence us, above all, the takedown of info
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:21.920]  wars was part and parcel of their efforts to mount some bogus prostitution of Roger

[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:15.400]  You know, Australia's a good example, Canada's a good example, the UK is a good example, why?
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.920]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:24.960]  Somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue, but this is something
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.680]  we should politicize.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.520]  I'm not going to carry a gun, I don't want to be involved in a gunfight.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:37.760]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:47.560]  up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.960]  Go ahead, make my day.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:55.000]  So the notion that gun laws don't work is not borne out by the evidence.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.760]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:07.080]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.280]  from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.680]  We'll make it harder for law abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:22.240]  In many cases, the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.800]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.440]  their family from violence.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:35.120]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.800]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.120]  The average American does not have that.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:45.960]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.200]  I mean, look at the team of security you got.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:22:05.640]  This is the most banned news transmission in the world.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.840]  And we've got one of the most dreaded individuals as well from the left, the man who first launched
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:15.720]  five, six years ago here in Austin, Texas, the plan for a 3D printable gun.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:19.120]  And Trump's pro-second amendment, but he likes to be law and order, he's saying he doesn't
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.920]  know this is a good idea.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.440]  Criminals are going to get guns regardless.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.320]  He's put tweets out, Cody Wilson's here with us in studio.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.600]  He's got some big announcements.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.000]  He's going to exclusively share with us right now.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.120]  Amazon, of course, has banned books that even promote what he's doing.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.200]  So what a time to be censored.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.880]  Few people have been censored as much as I am, but you have.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.400]  Cody Wilson, great to have you here with us.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.400]  So good to see you, man.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400]  Good to see you again.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.720]  Well, go ahead, tell us what's currently happening here where we're both, both in the center
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.720]  of the news here.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.680]  Man, when I saw you get de-platformed, I was like, uh, Alex, no, I couldn't even read
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:55.760]  the think pieces about why it was a good idea before I got kicked off of my e-commerce
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.760]  and my stuff got kicked off.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.440]  Oh, I was the first domino.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.440]  You are.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.080]  And that we, you literally, our, our intelligency, it doesn't even have the time to formulate
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.560]  justifications for why it's permissible before they're onto the next domino.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.080]  I mean, it's, that's wild to me.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]  They're making their move.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.080]  We're moving so.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.080]  I hadn't called her on.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]  She's a great.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.560]  People, they're making their move on everybody.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.960]  It's not like cool to be banned.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.680]  They're going after everyone.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.880]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.040]  They're contractors of the state where the state can't go.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.880]  They're happy to just push you, uh, themselves and, and, and then the way they did it to
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  you.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.240]  I know plenty of people explained to you over the months, but the, I viscerally react.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.080]  The demonization, the brainwashing.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.960]  That they could all move in concert within a, what, a four or five hour window together
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.960]  and not have to just.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.120]  Which is admitted Sherman anti-trust act section too.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.120]  Yeah.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120]  And that's what all this is.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.840]  Cut and dry illegal, which shows they're going for broke.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:44.080]  It's wild that they think they could display that, that flex of strength, right?
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080]  That they're confident.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080]  You're right.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.080]  It's like having a gold grill and driving a Mercedes.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.080]  They're flexing.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.120]  They get to unperson you and you're a big guy, man.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.400]  If they can unperson you, they can unperson me like that.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.840]  But the real message was we're doing it to him.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.320]  Everybody better line up.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.000]  It's a test ahead of the midterms.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.360]  I completely agree.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.440]  And you, you saw, you've reported to hear the, these meetings that they're all having
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.080]  before in advance of the midterms.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.880]  I mean, this is, this is clear out in the open.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.880]  They don't even hide it.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:14.400]  Why do you think Tim Cook, who runs the slave factories in China, meets with them, launches
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.480]  it all, does it, and they don't care because I think they're scared.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.880]  I think it's showing strength in the face of fear.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]  I think that's true.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.840]  They wouldn't move so blatantly if, if there's, if their team wasn't in need of signs of
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.840]  strength like that.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.760]  But at the same time, it's also a realization of power, which is, they do have the power
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.760]  near total.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.760]  Right.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:38.480]  So 26 companies that banned me in one day or two days comes out to about four trillion,
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.440]  but the top four companies is $3 trillion.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.520]  So $3 trillion has decided we're destroying you.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520]  Market cap.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520]  Yeah.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520]  I mean, that's, it's the big four companies, right?
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.600]  That, that are basically the commons.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.320]  My books and even though all my files, everything's a leak, like legal for you to have Facebook
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.680]  won't let you share the links, right?
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680]  You can't share the links.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680]  Yeah.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]  They're all coordinated.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.320]  And just the new thing is they're banning other people like me or you in concert.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.760]  It's like, it's like, they, they, it's like, and that's what they all met.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.840]  They're now coordinating rapid fire without the need for justification.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.760]  When I was dropped from my e-commerce platform, right, that was, that was hundreds of thousands
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.520]  of dollars in damage to me done immediately without justification.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520]  And it did to us too.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:23.240]  And so that shows in our advertising platform, this shows they've committed, this is a criminal
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.240]  commitment.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.600]  So how does the president strike back?
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.800]  Look, I'm, I'm not willing to say yet that it's imperative that we regulate Facebook.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.800]  I'm not willing to go there.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.600]  Um, I don't know what the result is, but I understand you can have regulations saying
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.400]  there isn't regulation.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.880]  Regulation just means there's a, they've already under CHICOM and globalist control.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.640]  So libertarians are pure as they go.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.520]  Oh, we can't censor this.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.920]  They're already censoring.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.480]  They're already doing it, Cody.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.880]  So then the president says, no, you can't censor unless it's illegal.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.720]  The answer is saying regulation to say no regulation.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:53.720]  You understand that?
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.720]  I certainly understand the argument.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.000]  It's like saying rabbit season is open.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.040]  I hate rabbits.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.600]  I mean, censorship season is open to stop the censors.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.520]  You have to say the law is no censorship.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.440]  I think what we see how that is, that's not censorship.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.720]  That's not control to say no.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.000]  When Alex, like Alex, when, when Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress, these, these subtle
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.920]  maneuvers that they make to indicate they want to be regulated, fine, let them put the
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.080]  noose around their own neck and then fine, it's open season.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.760]  They want to be regulated by Mark Warner that runs the whole show.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.520]  They want all kinds of regulation.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.160]  Google wants to build AI for, you know, I hear what you're saying that they want to
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.880]  use regulation for their plan, but I'm saying instead of going that route, the Democrats
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.960]  have threatened regulation and just by fiat said, do this.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.800]  So we're already under EU Chinese rules.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.920]  They're already standardizing to that and the Democrats, so Republicans go, we're libertarians
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.960]  when the vacuum like, let's say I'm all for freedom, which I am.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.960]  Then you leave the door open and pirates come in and rape and kill your family.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.520]  To watch the conservatives react to your unpersoning, right?
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.880]  They were happy that it was done, right?
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.960]  They're happy to have the left to work, do the work that they wouldn't do to you.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.600]  And so it's each side is doing each other's work right now.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.240]  I don't want to be involved in allowing-
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.480]  Well, may lie, conservatives go after the straw man they built about me and they want
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.120]  to virtually settle the left.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.120]  They still think mainstream media is cool.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.960]  No, no doubt, but I just don't want to be guilty of doing the work to allow at some
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.480]  point some regime to tell some social media platform-
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:21.200]  Okay, so Cody Wilson, the 3D printable gun launcher, the icon of that, with all the big
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.280]  news, we'll come back in the next second and get into what's happening currently with
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280]  you.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280]  But what do we do then?
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.120]  I think, look, my answer here is a technical and financial answer.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.840]  If you have settlement in the browser with cryptocurrency, you can drive financial incentives
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.760]  that prevent consortiums of these interest groups from bounding together, like on YouTube-
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.560]  So you're saying acting as market forces together with free will, we dominate them?
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.200]  I literally believe that Bitcoin is also the answer to questions like this.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.080]  If you make the exchange happen, not the level of clicking the ad, but the level of visitation,
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.160]  the level of unique IP of visitation in the browser, what you do, what you interact with
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.160]  in the content.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.560]  If that's the settlement layer of the financial internet payment layer-
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]  It's direct.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.560]  Right.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.680]  And you have to then be as open a platform as you can be, because that's the only way
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.160]  to survive financially.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.160]  So forcing this-
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.840]  They're forcing us to go point blank.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.160]  So honestly, this is a good opportunity for people to build the infrastructure in crypto
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.160]  currency.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.160]  I agree.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.400]  They're extincting themselves, but they've thought about that, which means the moves
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.520]  they're making, Cody, means they're going to a total authoritarian model now as China
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.520]  and Europe have.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.360]  We have to go to the total libertarian anarchic capital, so we could call it model now.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.720]  I think that's our only hope.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.720]  I don't know that we'll get there, but their ambition couldn't be clear.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.720]  I agree.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.760]  Well, I always wanted to phase into this, because I know it would take time, but they're forcing
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.560]  us to go through the radical evolution.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.680]  But as you know, this is a great opportunity for growth and strength, right?
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.840]  It's great to build your own stuff.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]  I mean, it's-
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.840]  It is.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.040]  But then when we're popular, number one, they're like, Jones, you're number one on both
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.760]  apps on Android and Apple, you're just-

[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.720]  We'll be right back.

[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:19.280]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.960]  Resistance to Titans is obedience to God.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:40.520]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:47.400]  Cody Wilson, the original pro-generator of 3D Printable Guns, is here in studio kind
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:53.480]  of the ground zero of what the establishment calls disruptive technology as humanity builds
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.360]  towards this singularity and they attempt to suppress the fact in the future.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.200]  You can just have your own 3D printable system build a spaceship to take you to Alpha Centuries
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:07.360]  or give you a new brain or cancer treatment, and so this is the real renaissance we're
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.280]  talking about, and so Cody Wilson's here.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.440]  He's made a big announcement to Reuters just a few minutes ago.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:19.080]  He's going to make it here on air right now, and then I want to ask him, how do we counter
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:25.160]  the draconian takeover of the election, massive election meddling, the crushing of all conservatives,
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.520]  libertarians, Christians, nationals, pro-Trump people.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.800]  I mean, it's just unprecedented at a Chai-Kam level, and then the media is trying to go,
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.720]  how dare Trump even criticize it when it's all so naked and real?
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:40.440]  But so let's get into just this moment in history we are right now.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.640]  So I love that the Chai-Kam meme is real now, that a Dianne Feinstein's driver was literally
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.320]  a PRC asset for 25 years or so.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.320]  Oh, the whole thing.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.880]  The Democrats are Chai-Kam operatives.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:50.880]  It's so great.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.000]  You know that politician Lee, I forget his first name, but he was busted selling AKs.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  This was gun control politician.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.640]  He was busted selling AKs to the triads in Shanghai and stuff.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.040]  I'm sure there's going to be a, we're talking about Russian collusion month after month
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.040]  after month.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.400]  I'm sure we'll discover a massive PRC, Chinese Democrat.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.840]  Well, the Chinese communists, I mean, they are the Democratic Party.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  Yeah.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.960]  And my friend, my co-founder, Dinius, says one day the PRC tanks will just roll into
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.280]  the streets and it'll all be complete.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.280]  There'll be a military wing of this anti-human.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.120]  But it'll say Black Lives Matter, someone will just bow down, oh.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.720]  The social justice operation will be complete when the Chinese boots are on the ground.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720]  I love that meme.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.120]  I think it's so good and not wrong, right?
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.280]  Like it won't even be funny because it's so close to the truth that it hurts.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280]  It is insane.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.280]  So make your big announcement.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280]  My big announcement.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.880]  Guys, let's zoom in on this guy, not me here.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:39.880]  He's looking at me too much.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880]  Look, a federal court, where do you want me to look?
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880]  Out over there.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880]  Get number four.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880]  Bam.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.440]  A federal court in Washington has been celebrated for issuing an order yesterday saying that
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.200]  no American has the right to post, of course me, and no American as well as me, has the
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.400]  right to post blueprints for guns on the internet.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:58.400]  I've had this fight for many years with the State Department, but now the state governments
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.440]  would come in and get a judge to give them this kind of order.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.760]  Importantly though, his order doesn't prevent me from doing many other things.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.320]  And one of those things is what I've announced today.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.560]  I'm simply, if I can't post the files online, I'll simply sell them online in force is a
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.360]  good example of this.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.720]  There's no way to prevent the sharing of this information.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.040]  So you can go to my website right now, defcat.com.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:24.360]  You can visit, you can peruse the files, you can click on them, and you can have them mailed
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.360]  to you.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.200]  And of course, this judge has permitted me to email them to you, transfer them to you.
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.680]  I ask you, what's the difference at that point?
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.800]  And you're following the judge's orders, and Reuters put this announcement out.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:38.840]  It'll spin it that Jones is selling illegal guns by letting you have your free speech,
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.840]  just like Reuters did.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.000]  But that says every level, they twist and engage in fraud.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  That's right.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.920]  Yeah, the AP story that I saw today says, well, he's posting them despite the federal order.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.160]  No, no, I'm posting them according to the federal order.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.160]  Do you understand?
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.280]  The judge gave me the authority to do it.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.640]  I'm not contradicting the judge.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.640]  I'm only carrying out his authorization.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.600]  And that's the thing is they spend whatever we do just constantly.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  It's incitement.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.600]  It's incitement.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.600]  And that's the way to sue me, right?
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.320]  Because they see themselves as an element, right?
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.560]  And your fifth column, you know...
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.560]  And you've been sued a bunch.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:08.560]  Oh, so much.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.560]  State governments?
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.000]  Twenty states in this union are currently suing me.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.200]  Now, isn't it funny that no matter how much they sue me, no matter how many courts they've
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.560]  bring me into, I can still give you my files today?
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.840]  Isn't that wild?
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.840]  They've sued me 20 plus times.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.640]  Have they sued you 20 times at the same time?
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.840]  No, no, I think you got me beat here.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.840]  But I mean, it's insane.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.840]  No, you're getting...
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.840]  Look, man, you're in court.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.160]  Well, I see your stuff all the time and I'm always like, you know, Alex Jones, and a lot
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:36.200]  of your stuff is free speech stuff.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.080]  A lot of our stuff is simply about...
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.080]  Oh, they always make up.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:43.800]  The reason a bunch of stuff's been thrown out is that when it finally gets down to brass
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:46.760]  tax, we show the judge we didn't say this.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.760]  It's just lies.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.760]  Yeah.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.360]  What the problem is that anyone can just come into court and sue you any time they want
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:55.480]  and you have to spend two years sorting it out when it was nothing, you know?
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:58.480]  And this is what, at the end of the day, the states have decided to do for me.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.920]  Because of course, I didn't lose when I sued the State Department for five years.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.200]  I ended up with a license to publish my files.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.480]  Yeah, remember, Obama had the State Department say no.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.480]  Right.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.480]  I had to suffer that for five...
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:12.000]  They claimed to some export deal, even though you were a U.S. citizen in America.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.320]  They claimed, because it's the web, they claimed that you were a foreign distributor.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.800]  That's right, an exporter, yeah.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800]  And I had to beat that.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.280]  It took me five years to beat that.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.040]  Now I built another company, I had fun, right?
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:26.080]  And I grew because of that oppression, right?
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.840]  And now I put my files online and these state courts would come in and say, what, I don't
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.000]  have the right to share that with Americans?
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.400]  And we've already won the case.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.080]  And that's what the left doesn't get.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.840]  We're not into victimology.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:39.640]  We're not victims, as Tommy Robinson says.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.640]  We're targets.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.680]  And I don't think they understand metaphysically, they think everybody's losers like them.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.680]  The more we get attacked, we get the more hardcore folks that actually support us.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.720]  That's right.
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:53.760]  Every single setback in my career, I think like yours, has only been an opportunity for
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.880]  further expansion, for further participation.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.160]  Because you were a winner and didn't crawl in a hole.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.160]  Right.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.160]  And I'm not going to crawl in that hole.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.520]  A lot of folks crawl in a hole.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.520]  Of course.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.120]  Look, when 20 states rained down on your head, Alex, I had, in Pennsylvania, I had 45 minutes
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.480]  to prepare for a TRO hearing with a federal judge, right?
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.240]  I mean, that's, they just, it's law fair.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.200]  They just want to hit you, hit you, hit you until you shut up.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.200]  That's the point.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.400]  That's the one thing that you can do.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.800]  I'm about to say, say what you want about you.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.280]  You're a maverick and a trailblazer.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:26.480]  You have been beating the snot out of them.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.840]  Not even using a bunch of big lawyers, which, which my lawyers are great, but I wish I could
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.840]  do it like you're doing.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.880]  I mean, you're, they are really going to hate your, they really got to hate your ass right
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.880]  now.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  Yeah.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:37.880]  They're upset because what, what do you do?
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:38.880]  I have this.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  Let's say here's the prop.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  I have this license, right?
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:41.880]  Think the license from the state department.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.760]  A state government can't come in a federal court and strip that for me.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.280]  So the battle is even worse than it was.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280]  Yes, exactly.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.280]  It's your creation, it's your thing.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.440]  And if people, exactly, it's a, they have quite a hilt decline because they know it's
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.040]  killing America to ban a design.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.160]  Frankly, yeah, they would do anything to stop this culture, our American gun culture, even
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.600]  going into federal court and saying, your honor, any computer assisted speech of any
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.520]  kind has no first amendment value.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.160]  These are the literal things that they file in federal court.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.680]  Cause it's like the file tells me how to drill out their own system.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:14.240]  It's like they're saying it's, it's like trying to ban a book that tells you how to make dynamite.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.240]  Right.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.240]  Right.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.240]  Which Amazon has no problem doing.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.240]  Someone posted a book of my plans, right?
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.240]  Amazon takes it right off.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.400]  I mean, you, they're happy to do it all.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.280]  And then once it's dynamite, then it's conservatism, Christianity, family.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.280]  And then that's what it is.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.920]  It's like, once they set that precedent easily, easily, and without justification, right?
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.160]  Oh, here's a, here's a book on the American gun culture gone from Amazon.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.160]  What's the justification?
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:39.440]  Well, you know, by the way, now that they've been banning you and me, it's suddenly it's
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  an avalanche.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.720]  It's everybody, which I think is going to backfire.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.360]  I mean, they're banning everybody and their mama right now.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.920]  At least we can see it so publicly.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.600]  I think that's what's so valuable about it.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:49.920]  Let your enemies show you who we are.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.920]  No, no, I agree.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:58.960]  So, Cody Wilson, and of course, the Fitz distributor website, DEFDist.org, DEFDist.org.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.800]  Why are they being so naked and brazen and crazy right now?
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.320]  Again, I think it's like we said about social media.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.480]  At some point, these Democrats, they feel like they have a certain lock on the, on cultural
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.280]  power and that if they just knock one or two people off, they've, they've got it.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:16.880]  But this contradicts their religion, which is that one day they'd finally end American
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.040]  gun culture.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.040]  They'd finally suspend it.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  But of course, we're presenting that the exact answer.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  It's bigger than ever.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.920]  We're, we're presenting that it's going to explode, right?
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.480]  It's going to expand the free exchange of ideas.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.480]  So is this their battle of the bulls for those that don't know?
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.240]  Like we take them to the beaches, we were about to go into Germany proper.
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:32.760]  The Nazis launched their counter-offensive.
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.320]  I mean, I think the Democrats and all this, this has a smell of Zeb Dietrich and battle
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.320]  the bulge.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:39.760]  There's some sincere desperation here.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.520]  They understand if they lose this one, that this is the second amendment online.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.520]  Those were the front line.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.520]  It's going to be a fight.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.520]  We better get ready.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.520]  Hey man, and I don't take it lightly.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:50.880]  Like you said about lawyers, my lawyers aren't cheap and this, this ain't some kind of like
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.520]  student council, you know, after school thing that we're doing here.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.720]  This is, we consider very careful because these judges want you to lose, right?
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720]  They're with the states.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:01.800]  You have to outlaw your them two to one to even have a chance.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.800]  And that's what we've had to do for many years.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.080]  Defcat.com, you can download, you can buy the files.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.720]  We can't download them, but you can buy the files and we can mail them to you and other
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:10.720]  things.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.360]  That supports our legal efforts.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.400]  That's how we're going to beat this.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.440]  Has anybody ever committed a crime with one of your printable guns?
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.400]  I'm sure if they had, someone would have brought it to my attention.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.520]  I was about to say, I mean criminals don't go print guns off.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:26.320]  It's, it's an extraordinarily difficult thing.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.320]  And frankly, you have to be.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.640]  No, they, they steal it out of your house when you're on vacation.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.720]  They want, criminals are smart.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.920]  They want a real gun that works.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.280]  They steal it out of a police car.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.440]  They pick them up out of trash cans.
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.040]  Printing guns is still a very difficult activity.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.240]  Now where do you get guns from a police buyback?
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.240]  That's dude.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.960]  I'm out of the police corruption, but I kind of get cops selling guns at the back door.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.400]  Like old ladies bring like $20,000 shotguns and give them away and the cops like, we're
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.400]  not destroying this.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.400]  I mean, how would you take it and destroy it?
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.560]  All right, we'll be right back.

[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.080]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:06.360]  Just demonize Info Wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:07.360]  to that.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.680]  Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.200]  children and Islamophobia.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:15.200]  And then wallah.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:21.320]  Two weeks later ban Info Wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:24.800]  all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.760]  or whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.920]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:43.160]  email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.160]  own platform.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.200]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.280]  the free Android and iPhone apps and how they can then reach out to others with the
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.920]  information and point out this is the verboten info.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.280]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:02.160]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.800]  in Fuller's life.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:04.800]  It take hours.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.920]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price, it's stronger, it's the other equation in probiotics,
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.280]  it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.760]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months, it's got the preglonone, that's the
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.680]  precursor to all the natural hormones in your body, then it's got all the minerals and the
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.160]  vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:29.800]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.280]  fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.640]  can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.120]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.320]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:49.080]  So thank you all for remembering infowars.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.520]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.520]  the word.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.520]  So thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.920]  Cody Wilson is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, and then when we start the third hour, we're
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.120]  going to take your phone calls today on what do you think Trump should do to stop internet
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.960]  censorship, what's the right move, 69 and a half days out, so we're going to give the
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.320]  number out here in just a few minutes and we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.280]  But let me get this out here because I'm on air and I'm so busy I've barely been plugging
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.440]  you that if I don't plug we won't be here.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.960]  We have 95% curcumin and curcuminoid.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.400]  The leading competitors in turmeric products have 3% on average.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.800]  It's a total joke.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.600]  It's a total fraud.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.360]  We have 95% curcuminoids, but it's very hard then at California standards to be able to
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.120]  bring you this.
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:13.760]  So we're even looking at a new manufacturer, even the manufacturer we have from the top
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.760]  organic manufacturers in the country, they just can't get enough of it.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:20.720]  So we have a couple thousand bottles left of this and it may be until October or maybe
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.720]  even November, December until we get more, but despite that I want you to see how great
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.480]  it is for joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammatory support,
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:35.920]  immune support, turmeric root extract, 95% curcuminoids, baswella, satara extract, organic
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:43.240]  experiment, sage, lemon balm, and thyme leaves, and pepperine from black pepper and so much
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.240]  more.
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.520]  So go to infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, look at the hundreds and hundreds of reviews,
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.720]  five-star reviews, 98% ratings.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.120]  This is the strongest we could come out with and other folks sell it for really expensive
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.240]  and then rip you off with seven, eight, nine, especially in turmeric.
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.040]  Sometimes they have some companies mark it up 15 times because if you put 3% curcumin
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.440]  in there and everything else, the bottle costs more than what's in it.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.440]  Not with us.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:13.440]  You're getting, the bottle's just full of two months supply, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.600]  We also have the ultimate bone broth formula that has the turmeric and the chaga mushroom
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.000]  and the bee pollen and the alfalfa powder and so much more.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  That's $19.95.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.680]  It's very close to cost, but I did a quadruple order on this because it's been sold out for
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:27.680]  five months.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.760]  Mix it in with your whey, mix it in with your smoothies.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.280]  It is incredible.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:37.960]  The collagen, the bone, all of it that is in it, it's amazing.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:42.520]  So find out about that at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, but whatever you do, support
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.840]  the broadcast, sign up for auto-ship, get additional 10% off.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.960]  That way you can cancel any time, but you get that discount and that way you don't have
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.560]  to remember every month or every two months, three months, however you want to set it,
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.400]  where it comes to you and you get additional 10% off and every order gets 5% off with
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.560]  Patriot points on your next order.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:02.800]  So there's a lot of specials, free shipping and infowarsstore.com, free shipping on orders
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.120]  of $50 or more, so be sure and take advantage of that as well.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:07.880]  Okay, getting back to Cody Wilson.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:13.520]  I want to take Trump to the woodshed, I know he wants to sound judicious, his tactic, and
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.320]  I've talked to folks close to the president, very close to him, and I've talked to people
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  like Ted Nugent on tape, and he said, don't worry, Trump will say what they want to hear
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:26.560]  to neutralize the opposition, and then he moves forward.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.000]  But you know, he is, bump stocks, he doesn't think do anything, they're pretty much workable,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.400]  so he says, go ahead and ban those.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.080]  I don't like that philosophy, but I get what he's saying from a political perspective.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.920]  That's the same thing he came out, we've got a tweet here we can put on screen.
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.800]  I'm looking at 3D plastic guns being sold to the public, already spoke to the NRA, doesn't
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.920]  seem like to make much sense.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:50.080]  Now, maybe he's saying you compete with the gun industry, and maybe they don't like it,
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.160]  so answer the question of what you think of the president, and then you're inside baseball,
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:58.800]  you're the top expert on this, is the gun lobby against you, or what is Trump thinking?
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.360]  I don't think there's a lot of daylight between me and the gun lobby on this issue, really.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:09.120]  That's what's at issue here in this litigation, is a set of rules about transfer of authority
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.880]  from the State Department to the Commerce Department, it's all very dry, administrative
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.880]  law stuff.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.880]  Federal.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:18.360]  But ultimately it affects actual exports of weapons and stuff, and their related technical
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.360]  data.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.520]  So look, it's just a side effect of this transmission of authority that my company and other people
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:25.520]  like us.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:29.360]  But I could transfer and sell the plans for a Remington 700, and it would take a machinist
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:32.920]  to do it, and a metal smith, but they wouldn't try to block that.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.680]  They want to, they actually want to, that's what some of this is about.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.080]  But actually what's at controversy in the court is not whether that we can sell it,
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.600]  it's whether you can just put it on the Internet.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.120]  And of course you and I both know that these plans are all over the Internet, they've always
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:46.120]  been, but you know, we want-
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:48.760]  So they want to penalize people that hold the files?
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.000]  They'd like to, but they'd also like to-
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.440]  So this is book burning?
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:54.560]  They want to penalize you from putting it into the Internet, right?
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:58.160]  This definition of this as an export, though the State Department has given up this power.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.680]  Don't they get it if they ignored you, it would have gone nowhere, that it makes it sexier
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.680]  that they're on this jihad?
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.720]  Look, I get it, I don't know when they'll get it, but this will continue, obviously.
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:11.720]  More people will download my, or will buy my plans at defcat.com because of news like
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.000]  today, because they know that people don't want them to have it, that's the primary driver
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  of the interest.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.880]  You're never going to make an AR-15 from scratch, you're never going to do that.
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:24.720]  But you might want the blueprints because you know the Attorney General of Pennsylvania
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:28.440]  doesn't want you to be able to do it.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:31.600]  They're never going to stop the flow of information, this is really the canary in the coal mine
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:32.600]  for the singularity.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:36.720]  Talk about that, I mean, explain from your view the singularity and what this means,
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.360]  I mean, you're never going to stop any of this.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.400]  I did, it's interesting you use that, yeah, I named this operation Integral Accident and
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:48.200]  in theory that means if information can be shared in any way, in this age it can be shared
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.200]  in every way.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.800]  So there is no limitation, there's only the explosive immediate speed of information from
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.800]  any corner.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:58.840]  So of course, if I'm able to sell it to you, if I'm able to email it to you and send you
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:02.320]  a link to it, this is virtually as good as you being able to download it.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:06.480]  So don't they get by the Streisand effect trying to suppress that it takes something
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:11.000]  from a signature explosion and then duplicates it to a whole other level?
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  When these states came into court to stop my website a month ago, I just had meager
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.400]  downloads in the hundreds and they pushed it, right, they drove all that traffic there.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.160]  Everyone knew they came to court to shut it down and it went to the hundreds of thousands,
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:27.320]  right, it went to the tens of thousands, other websites popped up who say, I don't know
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.440]  if you can trust this, who say millions of downloads?
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:33.360]  Well, let me explain this, bring it myself.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.600]  As above so below, yes, the power of the digital spreads the key, but it also gets the technocrats
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.880]  the power to kill it.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.040]  We have now, it's like 2 million downloads on Apple, a million downloads on Droid.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.240]  We can look at the, for a new thing, it came out like a month ago right before we got banned,
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.800]  we have a new app come out.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:51.240]  We're number one on both news apps, top 20 apps worldwide.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:55.040]  They just delisted this code where you've got a hand search it, you can find it.
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:58.240]  So it's like I won the ND 500, but they said it exists.
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:02.800]  So the power of digital is two fold, I guess when you're on their platform, because we're
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.480]  number one, and five stars, but you don't see it.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.320]  I'd use that in reverse.
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:14.480]  The power that this judge had to tell me not to share files online is the power to authorize
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.640]  me to sell them.
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:21.120]  So look, everything contains its own antithesis, the catastrophe conceals the opposite catastrophe.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.600]  Every action has Newtonian physics.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:26.280]  Yeah, it's just how it is when we live in an internet age, and you don't get the vote
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:27.280]  on that.
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:34.680]  So, let's go back to the zenith or the genesis, the progeneration of when you first had this
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:38.240]  idea of what you wanted to UT or whatever, six, seven years ago, or how long ago?
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.880]  Yeah, it was a long time ago, yeah, six years ago maybe, yeah.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.480]  All right, so tell us about that.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:47.080]  Well, look, I was at UT and I had this idea, and I decided that it was really a Sange,
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.080]  it was WikiLeaks.
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:51.800]  I didn't have a word for it, but it seemed like what a Sange was doing in Cablegate was
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.800]  more important than Romney and Obama and all the stuff I was watching on TV, that wasn't
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:57.800]  politics, that was non-politics.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.120]  This was like the horse and buggy being replaced with a Model T.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:06.400]  What a Sange was doing was real, present, immediate activism, which affected the life
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.400]  of nations, you know, and it's affected real politics.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:12.120]  And I thought, my God, you know, it's the internet.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.800]  What could you do with WikiLeaks that could affect other aspects of the political?
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.040]  And I thought, what is WikiLeaks for guns?
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:19.040]  And that was it.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.200]  I've been on that road for six years.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.880]  And to show that you were able to have one of the first 3D-printable guns, popularize
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:27.800]  it, all from just in your dorm thinking about this.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:28.800]  That's right.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:29.800]  It cost me nothing to build that gun.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:31.480]  It cost me 18 grand in a few months.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.760]  Oh, it was like an M4, right, or AR-15?
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.760]  I did build parts.
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:37.760]  You're right.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.480]  I would come in here and be like, look, Alex, I built an AR-15 part.
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.040]  So what was the first 3D chambering?
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.960]  We built parts, but then eventually in 2013, we built an entire gun.
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:50.280]  Every single component was printed on a 3D printer, and that was what really expanded
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.280]  people's minds.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.280]  They were like, oh, no.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:55.160]  And that's like going from handwritten Bibles to printing press.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.720]  We don't think of it as a big deal, but it's like Gutenberg.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.560]  Conceptually, it was like, whoa, it was the whole concept, the whole proof of concept.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:04.680]  And they challenged that for years.
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.120]  Just the idea that you could do it, the idea that you could share it and tell other people
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.120]  how to do it.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.120]  And there it is.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:10.120]  That's the gun.
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:11.120]  I remember this right outside Austin.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.720]  That was the first gun, well, credited as being completely printed on a 3D printer.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.400]  Now, I don't regard that as an especially important gun.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:22.960]  It doesn't work well, but it was its information that was its concept, and it was a demonstration
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:26.280]  that was like the Wright Brothers, the Kitty Hawk.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.000]  It wasn't an F-18 or it wasn't a stealth bomber.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.320]  I'll let you say it, but I do know, but I mean, it's still the first ones would count.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:38.080]  We think of that at the Smithsonian as is more important than, you know, an SR-71 Blackbird.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.320]  It's been called because only 50, 60 years later, we got an SR-71 Blackbird.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.120]  It shows human trajectory.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.240]  I think this is what's being challenged in court as well.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.240]  The states say...
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:48.240]  It's human trajectory.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.240]  They say future developments.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.240]  We have to stop future developments.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:53.000]  Sorry, you don't have a cause of action to stop future developments.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  You don't get to come into federal court on that question.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  Jesus Christ.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  Excuse me.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.440]  We have a lot of Christian stations.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:59.440]  I am a Christian.
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:04.680]  I have verbal control, and I respectfully say I'm not taking Lord's aim in vain.
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:08.880]  I'm saying, wow, God is amazing that we're made in God's image as creators.
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:14.720]  And whatever we can imagine, there were physicists 150 years ago with equations for atomic weapons.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:16.560]  And 60, 70 years later, they had them.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.120]  I mean, just think of the power of the human mind.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.120]  It's amazing.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:22.000]  And we've been through this controversy legally.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.400]  In the Cold War, you know, there was...
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.480]  Yeah, what about the guys that drew up plans for atomic bombs?
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.880]  I mean, you're like, you know, you have a court stop them because their brain came
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:28.880]  up with it?
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.880]  The Supreme Court has said no.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.000]  Of course, there's a First Amendment interest in publishing secrets for the H-bomb.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.800]  Is a plastic gun as dangerous as an H-bomb?
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.240]  Can we handle the Promethean fire of the gods?
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:44.640]  Cody Wilson, final segment straight ahead, then your phone calls.

[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:10.000]  Cody Wilson is our guest.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.600]  Cody, Trump trying to get our morals up, trying to expand our economy.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:18.040]  If you disagree with Trump, tell us it's fine and we're not a cult.
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:21.520]  I tell you, what amazing time to be alive and to see the full system throwing their
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:22.520]  weight against him.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.740]  What would you call this point in history we are?
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:26.920]  Whoa, that's a big question.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:27.920]  I don't know.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:28.920]  Is this the i-generation?
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:29.920]  Oh, God.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:30.920]  We're on a bridge.
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.040]  On the other side of this bridge, we can see the post-liberal.
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:36.040]  We can see it now.
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:38.520]  I don't know what it looks like, but we can see it.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:41.000]  And that's got everybody upset because all politics has been-
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.160]  And they're trying to hold us back and they can't do it.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.280]  Everything's been about maintaining the post-war liberal world order, right?
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:51.280]  And this is why I think you're so great about it because you've conditioned people for this
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:54.320]  mental template that there is an InfoWars.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.320]  Absolutely.
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.320]  What's happening to me in court?
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.920]  It's a war over the information related to guns.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.960]  It is a literal InfoWars and Virilio's terms.
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.480]  I'm happy to be here, man.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:04.920]  They are preventing the new politics of the future from happening.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:08.360]  They want it stillborn, if they could, take any power.
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:13.120]  Because the real future will be the real College of Ideas and a real individualist collectivism,
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.600]  where individuals take action, but everyone then votes really on what's real and the best
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:17.600]  and we just go, pew.
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.600]  There's a-
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.920]  I mean, it's like, can you say it like, pew.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:25.880]  Limitless asymptotic accelerations of science, techno-science, economic powers.
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  I'm begging for memes.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.000]  Usually when I do this, they have little goblins come out.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.280]  It would be my honor to be part of the meme.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:34.280]  Let's do it together.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.280]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:36.280]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:37.280]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.280]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.280]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.280]  Thank you.
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.280]  Pew, pew.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:42.280]  Thank you for that.
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:43.280]  Take that, Hillary.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:49.840]  If I could- I just prayed that someone would make something out of that.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:50.840]  Send it to me, please.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:51.840]  I love it.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  That's my favorite thing in life is I make memes out of them.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.280]  They used to pay to have mean memes against me and they didn't get, I liked it and they
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.800]  finally figured out and stopped funding them.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:03.880]  Alex, there was a special mission that I know of in Austin to convince you that Bitcoin
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:04.880]  was a good thing.
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.320]  It was a special- they were going to meme you into believing in Bitcoin.
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:08.320]  Did it work?
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.320]  Did it take-
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:10.520]  I mean, I think cryptocurrencies are great.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:11.520]  Is that right?
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:12.520]  Yeah?
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:14.360]  Do you- can you buy things in your store in cryptocurrency?
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.080]  We- we- I think so.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:17.080]  Yeah?
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.320]  If you can't, use BTC pay server.
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.040]  It's great, open source software.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  I would love to see them for words except Bitcoin.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.040]  Pew, pew, pew.
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.040]  Pew, pew.
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.040]  Pew, pew.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.320]  That's good stuff, man.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.320]  What can I tell you though?
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.280]  What can I tell you?
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.280]  About what?
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:36.480]  You wanted me to ask you to say something about Trump?
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:37.480]  Tell me your favorite color.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:38.480]  Yeah?
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:39.480]  Black, man.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.480]  Not a color.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.480]  Yeah.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.480]  Yeah.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.480]  It's all color.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.480]  What's your second favorite color?
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.480]  Blue.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:46.480]  I'm wearing a lot of blue.
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.480]  Blue's nice.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  Yeah?
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.480]  You a fan of that?
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:50.480]  Do we not have a stream on Facebook?
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.480]  Is that- is that- they just pull us down?
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:52.480]  I- I think as you were on, yeah.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:53.480]  Yeah.
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.480]  Damn.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.480]  You know what happened to me on YouTube yesterday?
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:56.480]  Oh, it's- it's- they're doing it to everybody.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480]  It's like-
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:58.480]  Yeah.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:02:59.480]  It's like a fight that-
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:02.480]  I went to college, I'm an S.J.W.U.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.480]  George Soros funds me.
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.480]  I saw something.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.480]  I just agree with- I have power.
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.480]  It's like a real video game.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.480]  Shit.
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:10.480]  Oh.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:11.480]  50,000 people are watching.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:12.480]  No.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.480]  Let me tell you-
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:14.480]  You are related.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.480]  You are a Nazi.
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.480]  I'm funded by Soros, a real Nazi, but I said you are.
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:20.480]  That-
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480]  That's fantastic.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.640]  If there's a- if there's one thing you're allowed to say on- in the inter-edits, what
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:28.920]  food you like, what music you like, what else?
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:29.920]  That's about it, I think.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:30.920]  What's your favorite music?
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.920]  Yeah.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.920]  I think that's- that's accessible.
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:33.920]  That's- that's the range of public discourse now.
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:36.520]  And even then, you got to be careful not to like some type of music.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.520]  That's cultural appropriation, of course.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:39.520]  Uh.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:40.520]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.080]  You're stepping into a wider world.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.760]  Crotten and Venture Cody Wilson, another fellow Austinite, and we salute- you were
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.920]  the best websites for people to find your evil information.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:49.920]  Hmm.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.920]  You can purchase this information at defcat.com.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:54.720]  That supports our efforts in court right now.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.720]  It ain't cheap fighting 20 state governments.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.720]  And of course-
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:58.920]  You just donate there?
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:03:59.920]  Mm-hmm.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.200]  Yeah, we have a donation pledge there, and you can join Defense Distributed, which is
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.200]  our organization.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.160]  And you've got your nice girlfriend over here.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.360]  I have my- I have my associate, my professional-
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.720]  I hope that's a- I hope that's a very professional relationship.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:12.720]  I assure you that it is.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:13.720]  Nothing but the highest-
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:16.720]  Because any relationship with a man or woman's kind of illegal now, so.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:19.160]  Well, look, I mean, it- it is made to be, isn't it?
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.160]  There's a-
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.160]  Oh, it's evil.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:23.000]  There's a real screen against it, but we maintain the highest professional standards at Defense
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  Distributed.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.720]  We are a- a defense industrial technical company equal opportunity employer-
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.720]  And you work very hard.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.360]  We work in Austin, Texas, for the advancement of all, for the common man.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:33.360]  Well, we should come by your factory and do a report on it.
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  Oh, I love that.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]  Cody Wilson.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  I love that.
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360]  We're going to come back and the number-
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.360]  Oh, have you heard the latest on South Africa?
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  I don't think you've heard this yet.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.860]  It's on newswars.com.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:44.160]  It's quite, uh, the little jewel.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.720]  In fact, I had that an hour ago and never covered it, because somebody reprinted it.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.720]  Help me, I'm weak.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.720]  Ha-ha.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.720]  I'll be right back.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:51.720]  Stay with us.
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:52.720]  Thanks, Cody.
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.720]  I'm a pro biotic.

[02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:15.960]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:21.880]  The Cape of Good Hope, the first white settlement on the African continent, was settled by Dutch
[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:25.720]  farmers in the 17th century.
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:32.760]  The lineage of these Dutch farmers are known today as the Boer, or as Afrikaners, and for
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:37.440]  many years they have established themselves as much as any of the many tribes living in
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.840]  the Cape today.
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:47.520]  When the Dutch arrived at the Cape in 1652, the land was too arid for crops, and was only
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:53.680]  inhabited by a small few pastoral nomads, known as the Koikoi.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:59.360]  The Dutch settlers proved themselves to be masters in the art of dry land farming, and
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:05.520]  dedicated their lives to fostering the region into abundant farmland.
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:11.120]  Over the years, South Africa grew in abundance, and dozens of African tribes migrated to join
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:15.040]  the growing settlement in the Cape of Good Hope.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:20.280]  Aside from being the only white people, the Boer blended in with everyone else, and for
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:24.280]  generations they lived in relative harmony.
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:30.760]  They had their issues, but conquest of land was respected and honored by local tribes.
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:36.720]  It was Britain who most rigorously challenged the Boer's existence there.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:41.440]  Once the French invaded the Netherlands, England sought control of the Cape in South
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440]  Africa.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:50.800]  The Boers were devout Christians who found deep purpose in the stewardship of their farmland,
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:55.440]  and they had serious disdain for British rule.
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:08:01.400]  Britain began imposing taxation upon the colony, they sent missionaries in to stoke the flames
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:10.040]  of discord between the Afrikaners and other local tribes, and in 1795 the British invaded
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.960]  the Cape of Good Hope.
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:17.000]  This led to what is known as the Boer Wars.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:23.600]  The Boer's resistance against the British was greater than most, but after killing 30,000
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:29.200]  Afrikaner women and children in the first ever concentration camps, the British had
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:33.800]  finally broken the Boer's spirit to resist.
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:39.600]  South Africa officially became part of the British Empire in 1910, and almost immediately
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:45.000]  following this, the British government began imposing some of the most racially divisive
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.800]  laws in history.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:55.080]  By 1948, these divisive laws gave birth to apartheid, which was defined by an authoritarian
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:09:02.720]  political culture based on bascap, white supremacy.
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:08.400]  Apartheid created so much racial division between the Afrikaners and the African tribes
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:16.440]  that by the 1990s, violent Communist Party the ANC had easily risen to power.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:22.080]  The ANC took orders from communist Russia, and they trained in the art of revolution.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:29.000]  They proudly sing songs about killing all the white farmers, and create laws that legalize
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.480]  the theft of private property.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:36.960]  Racism is not the problem in South Africa.
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:44.080]  Before the racially divisive laws implemented by British rule, there was relative harmony.
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:51.400]  What this is, is yet another communist takeover of a once great sovereign nation.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:57.160]  What we are witnessing now is perhaps the classic communist move.
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:03.560]  Kill the farmers, starve the nation, mass murder of the population so that the communist
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:09.480]  control freaks can carve up the remains and take whatever is left for themselves before
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.600]  the whole thing slides into the abyss.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.600]  The mainstream media, desperate to keep their audience from awakening to the truth, remains
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:25.640]  mostly silent about the South African crisis, aside from spinning it as a so called right
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:27.880]  wing conspiracy.
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:33.400]  But to the many who are waking up today, this only reveals their devout capitulation to
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.240]  the thieves and tyrants who own them.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:59.920]  This is Greg Ries reporting for infowars.com.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:01.560]  And we are back live.
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:04.360]  Powerful peace by Mr. Ries.
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.720]  It's really the communist secret program for the world.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:14.280]  Go into a place that almost no one lived in 400 years ago that white settlers came to
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.800]  build farms in the middle of the wasteland.
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:19.040]  Africans move in from all over Africa.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.040]  African populations explode.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.480]  If you go back to the history books, people got along very well.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:26.200]  The African tribes still fight with each other.
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:30.400]  But the Christians kind of navigated that and Christianized a bunch of groups.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:32.920]  And then the British come in.
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:36.880]  They take over, not against the British people, but the British empire, because the gold and
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.400]  silver and diamonds that were there are more than anywhere else in the world.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:42.000]  And they take over.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.980]  And then they create the racial laws that blacks don't have rights to create the division
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:50.480]  for control.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:57.320]  And then all these years later, you've got the brainwashed communist blacks and whites
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.760]  and others hating the white Africaners.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:03.880]  And here's the next big piece of news.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:04.880]  Bombshell.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:13.680]  It's on newswars.com Bombshell, South Africa, forcing farmers to repay bank loans on seized
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:14.680]  lands.
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:16.880]  Did you hear me right?
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:24.120]  They're taking not just old farms, but farms that people bought, the scrub brush.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:26.760]  And they're saying, we're going to take your land.
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:36.000]  This is another South African news, but then if you owe millions of dollars or millions
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.160]  of South African currency for it, you've still got to pay it back.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:42.280]  No one's ever done that.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:46.520]  Even the Soviets and the Nazis, they took your land, they would just ignore bank loans
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  or whatever.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.680]  So this is next level, but the commies always work with the banks.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.200]  Bombshell, South African, forcing farmers to repay bank loans on seized lands.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:01.320]  And farmers will still be expected to repay loans on land, even if it is seized by the
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:05.080]  South African government, according to statements made by Ned Bank.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:09.840]  We'll pull this up on newswars.com so I can show folks a screenshot, please.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:16.720]  A screenshot of an email ostensibly sent by a Ned Bank client services resolution manager
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:23.000]  asserts that borrowers with mortgages on expropriated property, again, the South Africans say, we're
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  not going to steal it.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  We're not going to kill you.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  We're going to make you dead.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.680]  A screenshot of an email ostensibly sent by Ned Bank on the biggest banks in South
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:39.760]  Africa, client services resolution manager asserts that borrowers with mortgages on expropriated
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:46.120]  property will be obligated to continue bond payments, whether they are compensated by
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:49.120]  the government or not.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:52.800]  Dear customer, thank you for your query, your question.
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:59.120]  You have raised with regard to the impact of land expropriation to your bonded property.
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:04.640]  Ned Bank is not privy to what provisions may or may not be for land purchasers whose land
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:09.520]  is encumbered and what the proposed review committee would come up with to address this.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.480]  However, we believe a balance needs to be achieved between the parliamentary agenda
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:16.040]  and the particular law of contracting.
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:18.240]  You're sure the banks are involved in all this, of course.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:23.400]  It is important to note that home loan agreement is subject to a contractual agreement and bond
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:29.240]  payments remedy due to payable until such a time that the bond is paid in full, irrespective
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:32.480]  of any form of land appropriation.
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:36.280]  Of course, that's an act of God, the government taking it, so you're null and void.
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.720]  This is just fraud, my view, with a with or without compensation.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:42.560]  So you're going to pay with or without compensation.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:47.720]  We would encourage you to continue with bond payments until such a time as a termination
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:50.280]  is made, the time of which is also unknown to us.
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:53.880]  We trust that our response meets with your expectation.
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:00.320]  I just like telling Jews being sent to a death camp, we're going to pull your teeth
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.360]  out for the gold and take everything you've got.
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:07.800]  We already took your house five years ago, and if you've got any bank loans, we're going
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:13.000]  to still say you owe those even in death.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:21.400]  So death and taxes, how about that, ladies and gentlemen, and then it just gets worse
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:22.400]  from there.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  I'm going to go to break.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.200]  I'm going to take first-time callers specifically when we come back on one issue.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:32.560]  What do you think of the censorship and what should Trump do to counter it 70 days out?
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.920]  That is the only question we're answering.
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:36.000]  I want to hear from you.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.080]  I love you, but I want you to have a good phone, be ready to answer that question.
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:50.080]  I want to ask you that because I respect you and want your view, first-time callers, 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539-877-789-2539.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.200]  Whatever you do, spread the live links until folks on local stations ought to tune in.
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:56.200]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:58.480]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.520]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other

[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:55.760]  It's time for you to choose a side, and it's a total absolute sure-win, no-lose equation.
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:21:07.960]  We should get Shooter Jennings back on.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:09.040]  He hadn't been on in years.
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:11.520]  He defended me real nice on Joe Rogan.
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:18.520]  By the way, at the end of the show, I got a statement to make on Joe Rogan.
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:21.520]  I talked to him at length.
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:28.800]  One day it was a Saturday morning, so he gave me a call.
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:31.080]  You guys got to remind me, or I won't remember to do it.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:36.080]  It's important, because he raises hundreds of millions of people a month, and it's been
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.840]  a big controversy, or a bunch of stuff.
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:41.520]  Joe's a great guy, so I got a statement to make at the end of the show, or on that,
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:42.520]  if the crew reminds me.
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  You guys remind me to do that?
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.160]  Because you know me, out of sight, out of mind.
[02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:49.040]  You guys give me a Roger on that?
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:52.040]  I could just remind me.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:56.080]  We got Larry, we got John, we got Joe, we got Jeremiah, we got Mike.
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:57.720]  Here's what happens.
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:09.560]  I started out on talk radio 23 years ago, and I would just, the calls came in, and I
[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:10.720]  didn't even have a call screener.
[02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:14.080]  I'd say, call in, and when I'd go to break, I had one guy run on the board, but he wouldn't
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:15.080]  have a call screener.
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:16.800]  I'd say, where are you calling from?
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:19.720]  And just, I'm going to go to you right when you come back, so I'd go to the calls, and
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:20.720]  I'd love calls.
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:27.440]  Then, I started doing a show out of my house, with GCN, with the satellites, and it was
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:28.640]  always like remote.
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:34.560]  They were up in Minnesota, I was in Texas, and we'd take the phone calls, and sometimes
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:40.200]  they'd sit there for 30, 40 minutes and say I had a bunch of phone lines, and it was always
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:41.200]  different.
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.240]  I'd have to announce the caller, and have the person there put them on air, and it becomes
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:45.240]  a little annoying.
[02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:48.920]  So, I kind of went crazy yesterday, and I apologize, I've got a lot on my mind, and
[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:51.120]  I'm trying not to be a jerk.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:54.320]  Callers wouldn't be there, or callers wouldn't be ready, or callers phones are bad, or their
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:59.000]  radios are on, and you do five or six those in a row, I go crazy.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.320]  But, John Harmon, I've worked with for 15 years, now has come down to M4s in Texas, from
[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:06.320]  Minnesota.
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:09.600]  We've got a great crew out there, and he does affiliate relations, but for the next week
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:15.160]  or so, he's going to sit in when we take calls an hour a day, and so we get you ready,
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:18.960]  and I get to you, and you're not holding more than 20, 30 minutes, and you're off, and then
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:22.160]  if you're already holding, we just shut the phones down and open them up again.
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.080]  That way, nobody ever holds more than 30 minutes.
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.920]  And the spirit of that, we're going to go to Aaron, Mike, Joe, John, Larry, and others
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:33.800]  right now on the incredible stuff happening in this country, Trump fighting back against
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:39.760]  the censorship, praise God, what does he need to do next, 70 days out from this election,
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:43.960]  all the amazing things unfolding, what a time to be alive, I mean they are censoring everybody
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:49.120]  and their dog, I mean, and they're admitting they're doing it, it's so illegal, it's so
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:54.480]  organized with big tech together, and they've taken 70 days out, Republicans doing nothing
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:59.720]  as a green light to go crazy, I've made this my big issue, they shadow banned me and then
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:04.800]  fully banned me, first person in world history, on a geopolitical level, it's happened to
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:11.400]  because they feared it, three and a half weeks ago, because they feared you, and I think
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:15.160]  it's backfired on them, but it's still up to all of you how concerned you are about
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:18.880]  this and the stories that are on infowars.com, but I'm betting on you, I believe in you
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:23.680]  and I love you and I thank you, so let's go to a caller in Canada, let's go to Mike
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:29.400]  in Canada, Mike here on the air, thanks for calling, hello, yes, sir, welcome, oh, I'm
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:35.200]  in New Hampshire, that doesn't matter, you're on air, so see, how you doing, it's happening
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:40.120]  now, at least the state was wrong, but it's okay, you got my name, that's all that matters,
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.560]  it's all that matters right now.
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:47.120]  I was calling about the censorship as well, I mean, I'm on, I mean, like a Facebook group
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:52.520]  too, like, because like, if I post something on my Facebook, you know, I don't really want
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:57.440]  people to see it at all, but I mean, I'm part of a group and I do it there, and that group
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:03.720]  literally got like, quieted down, I didn't see anything from the group at all, and then,
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:08.440]  I guess it got shadow banned, so they made a new one, but I mean, we're doing it on that
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:12.320]  one now, but speaking of like that, I have a few friends that are like, Democrats and
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:16.760]  all, I mean, on Facebook, and that's fine, you don't bother me, but their stuff is always
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:21.120]  at the top of my feed, and their stuff is everywhere, boom, boom, boom, boom, all day
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:28.120]  long, Democrats, this now, this thing on Snapchat, or CNN, well, totally, I mean, if you look
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:32.960]  at Ann Coulter's feed, my feed, Trump's feed, hundreds of pages of their garbage were nowhere,
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:37.400]  and like you said, the last few months, suddenly, you had all these friends, you were talking,
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:40.720]  friends aren't allowed to talk, you sit down and shut up, prisoners, suddenly, nobody can
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:44.480]  talk to each other because you're all shadow man, but does that make you vote Democrat?
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:46.080]  No, I think it makes you get pissed.
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:50.560]  Yeah, I mean, to be honest with you, my parents are kind of Democratic, and look at me, I'm
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:55.080]  listening to Alex Jones, you know, I'm tired of it, so, I mean, I mean, I don't believe
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:56.080]  that.
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.560]  Hey, to your parents, does your son deserve to not be able to talk to other friends on
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:25:59.560]  Facebook?
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:02.640]  Is that American parents, and they should really vote for Trump?
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.680]  No, I mean, like, my dad, he voted for Trump, but I mean, like, you know, like, just with
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:10.320]  the things he says, I'm like, dude, you're a Democrat sometimes.
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:16.640]  Well, is your dad proud now that the 4.6 growth rate, and, I mean, it paid off?
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:19.640]  He is, he is proud, he is proud of that, so.
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:20.640]  Well, what about your mother?
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:24.640]  Is she gonna side with you in your free speech, or side with the censors?
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.720]  Is she gonna side with trillion-dollar companies trying to rob you of your birthright, or is
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:29.720]  she gonna side with you?
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:35.000]  I put her in my truck, and I'm taking her there, and she's voting, so she ain't gonna
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.320]  vote Democrat this time, but it's all right.
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:41.840]  But anyways, I mean, like, in Facebook thing, I just couldn't believe it, like, every single
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:45.600]  one of my Democrat friends, I mean, I don't got problems with them, but it just drives
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:48.240]  me crazy all day long, you know?
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:53.440]  And then a few friends of mine that are conservative share something, it's like, one to every 25,
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:54.440]  you know?
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:59.960]  Brother, I see it on my own iPhone that, you know, and iPhones are glitching out, and I
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:05.040]  know this weird spam and crazy stuff flying up, and CNN's always popping up at MSNBC without
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.880]  me asking, and just, it's in the feed, I turn it on, it's like, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz,
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:12.360]  and it's just like, wow, you know?
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  It's crazy, isn't it?
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:17.760]  Yeah, I think, sorry to interrupt, but I have an idea, I think, maybe, I know it's gonna
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:22.400]  be a big idea, but maybe, because when I voted for Trump years ago, I'm in New Hampshire,
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:26.600]  when I voted for Kelly Ayotte, because she was the Republican, and I got home, and she
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:31.120]  goes, I wrote for Mike Pence and the presidency, and I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:35.840]  So I was wondering, and she ended up losing, because she didn't vote for him, but anyway,
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:41.480]  I was wondering if you guys could maybe make a list of like, who the patriot is in every
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:42.480]  state, you know?
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:45.400]  No, I hear you, you know, folks who've done that, just look at whoever Trump endorses,
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.800]  not all of them are perfect, but I trust the president, he's smart, I'm gonna say it, he's
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.200]  smarter than I am, at 72, he's got more stamina.
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:56.520]  And when he endorses us, who I'm backing, he isn't perfect, but we've just got to back
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:58.960]  him, because he's in the center of things, God bless ya.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:01.840]  We're gonna go to break, thank you Mike, and they did say to Hampshire, I don't know why
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:02.840]  the hell I said Canada.
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:07.960]  See, even when they do a perfect job, I screw up, so I just gotta stop caring so much.
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:10.440]  The truth is, I care so much, folks.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:14.040]  I mean, we advise the president, we've got all the documents, we've got the proof, other
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:17.240]  people are scared to tell him what's going on, and they're coming down on me because
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:23.320]  they know it, and I've kind of not said it the last year, I hope, and they'd figure,
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:28.040]  I wasn't actually as influential as I am, but they got everything tapped, so they're
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:30.640]  coming down on me, because Trump's a real deal, folks.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.600]  We come back, Larry, John, Joe, Aaron, Chuck, Rodney, bam, bam, bam, you're called straight
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:36.600]  ahead.

[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:13.320]  got to keep that diesel trucking, just knock that down a hand and give him hell, I'm gonna
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:17.200]  listen to that when I drive out of the office today, some good stuff right there, Charlie
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:25.880]  Reed, that's good, I want to go to Corey and Gracie and everybody here in just a moment,
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:29.760]  here's the deal, I don't want to wish ill of the dead, even at all, Hitler, even though
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:35.280]  he was a really bad guy, or John McCain, it's just bad luck, but the worship festival, John
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:41.520]  McCain eating five, ISIS al-Qaeda backer, open borders, anti-gun, favor the Democrats,
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:46.640]  Trump's main enemy calling him a traitor, and just Lindsey Graham worshiping him for
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:53.600]  like the last hour on Fox News, can we punch that up for TV viewers, I mean they're trying
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:58.560]  to kill the First Amendment and steal, I guess he just finished, and steal the election
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:08.520]  right now, I mean they're trying to do everything they can, and all I'm hearing about is John
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:14.000]  McCain, what about the First Amendment, could we have a five days in laying in state for
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:19.200]  that, maybe flags that have staff, for the, I tell you what, let's give McCain five years
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:25.640]  to have staff, in fact let's take flags down forever, because he's like God, stole five
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:31.440]  hundred billion dollars, you name it, he's a great guy, anti-American guy, I agree he's
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:37.600]  the best person, I mean he's, I guess according to them, better than Jesus, can we just have
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:41.960]  a week at half staff for the First Amendment, I'm sorry it doesn't matter, everything our
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:47.800]  veterans and our ancestors fought for, all being flushed down the toilet, no, I think
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:53.840]  we should burn the Bill of Rights and Constitution in offering to John McCain and his father and
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:36:01.160]  his father corrupt admirals, because throwing the election to Obama and saying Obama isn't
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:07.320]  connected to radical Islam and all that is lies, well that's a good thing, because everybody
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:21.120]  said so, so I want to apologize for America even existing, now like the old Vikings did,
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:25.480]  when their wife and kids died, they'd kill them and burn them up on a boat with them,
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:30.120]  I'm not saying do this, but maybe I'm being hateful to McCain if all of America isn't
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:34.840]  blown up with nuclear weapons, because of his death, just nuke the entire, blow the
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:44.160]  planet up, because this old corrupt, lying, globalist piece of trash is God, just George
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:51.640]  Soros, the Nazi collaborators, that's all, I mean should we, I'm asking the question,
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:56.280]  should the earth be, should they use the fission fusion, anti-matter weapons, the Air Force
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:02.840]  admitted 12 years ago they have, to forget the planet, blow up the solar system, hell,
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:10.240]  forget the solar system, the galaxy, how about the universe, and like a royal Viking power
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:20.280]  destroy creation, because of McCain, walking around I was going, he was powerful everywhere,
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:27.400]  just what a corrupt joke and all these fawning sycophants worshiping him, I mean please God,
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:32.280]  I tried to be nice about it, but Lord, and then Trump says he's a great guy and his
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:36.800]  family's great and all this stuff and they're attacking for it, it's like good Lord, this
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:45.520]  guy is a globalist, a new world orderer, we're going to go to caller in California, we're
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:49.800]  going to go to Corey right now, Corey thank you for calling today, you're on the air.
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:55.440]  Sir it is an honor to be riding co-pilot with you right now, in the spear against, the spear
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:00.880]  head against, globalism and tyranny, it's good to have you, do you agree with me that maybe
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:04.360]  the Pentagon should blow the planet up in honor of McCain?
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:09.120]  I believe they should, I believe they should, let's just go full nihilist and just take
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.120]  it all out.
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:15.880]  He's so good, he's so close to Satan's heart, I mean he's such a good person, the new
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:23.600]  sense of McCain, sorry.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:30.080]  I have friends who are actually casualties of his war that I fought next to in Iraq,
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:37.320]  and the lies that he said, that he sold us to get us into Iraq, it's really hard to
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:45.920]  look over and I watch the CIA propaganda machine spewing out the, let's deify John McCain,
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:49.640]  it works, even on a woke individual like me, I almost had a tear stream and I'm like, oh
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:53.680]  he died and then I'm like, I wake up and I'm like, screw this, this isn't going to happen.
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:57.880]  Well you know McCain blew up the Death Star.
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:00.560]  Oh, how did he do that?
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:07.120]  He just defeated Darth Vader, but look he helped found the modern ISIS, he's on record
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.120]  doing it.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.040]  I mean the guy was a monster with a voting record like the Democrats, but oh, McCain,
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:21.480]  McCain, why are there so much McCain worshipping, oh, oh I love him, he's so cool.
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:25.840]  I know why there's the worship and it's because of that wonderful executive order that you
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:30.280]  had brought to light the other day, that limelighting, that you should limelight it more, that one
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:32.440]  that Obama had signed in Iraq.
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:36.960]  Yeah, the executive order countering propaganda, exactly, and he helped get it through, so
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:41.040]  it's just all, it's like naming the end of the First Amendment, the John McCain Super
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:46.480]  Highway, exactly, it's like, on the first amendment's tombstone, you say John McCain
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:48.960]  countering disinformation and propaganda.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:49.960]  Yeah.
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:53.360]  Yes, and cahoots with the Clintons and the Obamas.
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.400]  But the way Trump can beat this is to resend the executive order, you said it yourself
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:03.960]  the other day, sir, and you have to limelight that and beat it into their skulls politically
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:05.800]  and spiritually.
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:10.360]  We have to take back that executive order, cut the head off the snake and watch it die
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:12.680]  in front of us.
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:16.440]  I agree, and as you call it limelight, you know, the great Ted Dozier calls it spotlighting
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.840]  cockroaches, and that's what we're doing.
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:22.360]  And look, I hope McCain's in heaven, I hope he had a better day.
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:24.160]  He was horribly corrupt.
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:27.320]  He said it'll be on my tombstone, the Keating Five, no, it's not.
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.040]  It's the whole devil media worshiping you, because you tried to derail Trump.
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:33.000]  God bless you, Corey.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:40.400]  And you know, Trump took the high road and got pissed in his face, basically.
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:44.800]  We're going to go to Canada now, and we're going to talk to Gracie.
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:47.240]  Gracie in Canada, thank you for holding her on the air.
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:48.840]  What's on your mind today?
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:54.840]  We have a conservative vegan, if that's even possible, and we listen to every day here.
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:59.360]  I'm a vegan as well, after every time I finish a giant steak.
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.160]  Now, it probably is healthier with all the stuff in the meat today, but go ahead.
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:03.160]  Don't judge.
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:06.200]  I know that meat has healing qualities too, so I'm one of those people who's very...
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.200]  You're very, very nice.
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:08.200]  Go ahead.
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:14.760]  Now, there was a fully rocked Athena who was vegan online, who promoted your secret 12,
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:15.760]  your V12.
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:16.760]  That is vegan.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:21.600]  She was completely censored and delisted for promoting your V12 online, so I wanted to
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  bring that up.
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:27.040]  She's quite possibly a fan, fully rocked Athena out of Houston.
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:33.320]  The third thing I wanted to mention was that one way to deter the upcoming false flag on
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:38.560]  Trump supporters and Trump supporting media is to have a countdown, the moment that one
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:42.960]  opens your website, gets onto your page, the countdown comes in.
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:49.600]  69 more days left for Democratic operatives to stage false flags, to blame Trump supporters.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:51.400]  I think that's a great idea.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:55.160]  We should have a countdown of the election, countdown to false flag, because you can see
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:57.320]  him setting it up.
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:41:58.320]  That's right.
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:05.680]  And also, yes, a rolling scroll underneath your videos, your live stream on your website,
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:08.720]  that brings people to bit-shoot, real dodgy...
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:09.720]  No, I agree.
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:13.160]  We have even rolling screens on the walls, all the studios.
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:18.200]  We just have to every day not put one generic thing in, but load our headlines in, interspersed
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:23.640]  with newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, and then aim the cameras at that to remind folks, you're
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:24.800]  absolutely right.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:27.520]  Yeah, it's over there on that side right there.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.160]  That's a big thing that lights up right over there.
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:32.480]  It's over on the other side, towards my right, over there.
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:35.360]  We've got it in all the studios, and it's a great point.
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:36.360]  Well, Gracie, you are awesome.
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:38.120]  Thanks for the call from Canada.
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:39.880]  We had a lot of great ideas.
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.960]  We might want to turn on all the stuff we've got, and we need to just load the daily top
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:48.520]  headlines like, banks announced South African farmers have their land taken, must still
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:50.080]  pay the loans back.
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:51.640]  That's a pretty big headliner.
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:55.240]  Trump promises to go after illegal Google censorship.
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:59.600]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:04.320]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:05.840]  to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:08.080]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:10.680]  Pestic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.200]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:17.120]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:18.960]  the body, and it supports the info war.
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:21.200]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:25.680]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:30.360]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:31.360]  get.
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:34.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:39.640]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:44.880]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires to the
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:47.600]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:50.880]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:54.960]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield, infowarslife.com.
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:56.280]  We knew it was coming.
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:57.960]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:03.200]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:08.560]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:11.040]  children and Islamophobia.
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:12.040]  And then wallah.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:18.160]  Two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:22.040]  all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:28.000]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link,
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.640]  whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:35.800]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:40.040]  email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:41.040]  own platform.
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:46.080]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:50.760]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:52.960]  and point out this is the verboten info.
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:55.920]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:00.880]  The scientists at info wars life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:02.600]  and joint support.
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:05.720]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:09.520]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:13.880]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:18.040]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:22.280]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:27.480]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:29.280]  so much more.
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:33.760]  Similar turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:39.520]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:45.520]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:48.360]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:56.320]  Try bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:01.200]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:05.640]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:10.160]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:15.400]  That's why info wars life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:20.600]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, vitamin mineral fusion uses a
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:25.800]  unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:26.800]  your body.
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:31.000]  Using it for a proprietary process, we've managed to make this powerhouse formula into
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:35.880]  a delicious, concentrated drink mix that's loaded with high quality ingredients.
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:40.560]  Perfect for a hot summer day or relaxing at home, vitamin mineral fusion is loaded with
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:44.800]  34 different essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids and more.

[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:29.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are Backline Broadcasting Worldwide.
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:30.120]  I am your host, Alex Schoes.
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.240]  I want to ride back to your phone calls for the next couple of segments.
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:38.440]  Then Paul Joseph Watson from London, England, always loaded for bear is going to be joining
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:39.440]  us.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:46.200]  But first, Joe Rogan, look, I've known Joe since like 98, 99, I've been good friends
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  with him.
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:48.200]  He's a really smart guy.
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:49.520]  He's been a comedian.
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:53.720]  He's always been an entertainer and he never really wanted to get into politics.
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:55.440]  He always wanted to stay out of it.
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:57.080]  I'd call him pretty much a libertarian.
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.080]  He's on a conservative.
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.080]  He's on a liberal.
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:03.720]  He was a pro-gun guy, but he's also, you know, socially liberal.
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:06.760]  And you know, he started his podcast like 10 years ago or whatever.
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:09.200]  And now it's one of the biggest podcasts in the world.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:12.400]  And I never really pushed hard to be on it, but he had me on like last February, not this
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:13.400]  year, but last year.
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:16.440]  It was the biggest podcast he ever did at that time.
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:17.960]  And then they delisted it.
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:20.200]  They didn't allow you to see it on iTunes.
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.600]  Like they've done with us having the number one iPhone app for news on iTunes or Droid.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:26.600]  We were number one on both.
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:28.520]  After just a few weeks of us being banned.
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:29.840]  So they delisted it.
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:35.400]  You can still download it then for wars.com forward slash app, but it's been delisted.
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:40.960]  So I started getting irritated because the media makes such a big deal about the Joe
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:42.880]  Rogan interview.
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:48.400]  And again, or 40 million views total, about six and a half million on YouTube.
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:52.320]  And I know that Joe's a great platform where I could be able to set the record straight
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.000]  a lot of, about a lot of this info is a very wide audience.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.440]  And so he had shooter Jennings on a few weeks ago and I hadn't seen the interviews since
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:01.440]  last Friday.
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:03.160]  It's been about a week to see it.
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:09.400]  And shooter was offending me, but Joe said, yeah, well, Alex is in, you know, all this
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.160]  turmoil, I'm not going to really get him on because I don't want to be in the middle
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:16.160]  of all of this.
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.840]  What was the word he used when he called me Saturday, chaos.
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:25.040]  And so that's what it comes down to, but Joe said, listen, the chaos is so crazy.
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.040]  I guess I got to get in the middle of it because it's not stopping.
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:28.040]  It's not going anywhere.
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:33.160]  So he said, he's having me on a show and I can do it subject to dates, but I'm pretty
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:35.040]  sure I can do it in late September.
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:40.200]  So we're talking a month from now, I'll be on the Joe Rogan experience podcast and that
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  will be a good deal.
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:44.840]  And, you know, I've said some negative things, Joe said some negative things.
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:47.560]  One of his friends told me that, you know, Joe's family had been threatened.
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:50.560]  And when I talked to the friend, they're like, well, I think he was threatened.
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:54.080]  So that wasn't accurate that he was threatened not to, you know, cover the new world order.
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:57.640]  But Joe isn't afraid to have me on.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:01.880]  He seriously is trying to keep control of his show and not turn it just into a political
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:02.880]  thing.
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:03.880]  And I respect that.
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:05.520]  It became such a big deal.
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:09.440]  Now he wants me back on and obviously I want to go on there because I like to go on and
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:12.480]  hang out with Joe and get out in front of the sensors.
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:15.720]  So Joe's a man of his word, he said, I'll be on late September.
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:19.280]  So I look forward to going out to Los Angeles, which I really don't look forward to, but
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:24.160]  I look forward to going to see Joe, one of my most unfavorite places is Los Angeles.
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:25.320]  Sorry if you live there.
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:29.040]  I just, you could pay me not to go there, but I will go there and talk to 20, 30, 40
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:30.040]  million people.
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:32.920]  And I think this interview, and I said, Joe, let me sneak up on it.
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:35.800]  Let me just show up cause they'll try to manipulate and protest or whatever he said.
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:36.800]  I don't care what they do.
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:38.360]  I'm not being threatened and not have you on.
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:39.360]  I want you on.
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:40.760]  I said, he said, go ahead and promote it.
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:44.760]  So here we are like three or four days later, I'm finally getting around to it.
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:45.760]  So there you go.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:48.720]  I'll be on the Joe Rogan experience and he's not censoring anybody.
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:53.880]  I appreciate you having me on coming up on the late part of next month.
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:56.040]  So stay tuned for that.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:57.200]  Okay.
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:59.880]  Let's go ahead and take more calls.
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.400]  You see Justin and Larry and Jessica and Joe and Susie and Ron and Aaron and Steve and
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:10.560]  Chuck and Kevin and Rodney and Chase, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:14.680]  I guess that would be Justin, Justin and Georgia.
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:15.680]  Justin here on the air.
[02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:16.680]  Welcome.
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:17.680]  Go ahead.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:18.680]  It's an honor.
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:19.680]  Welcome.
[02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:23.080]  You've been asking for input on how we should deal with the internet censorship and I just
[02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:28.800]  wanted to say that I think it's important that we reflect back on how did we get to
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:37.040]  this point from 1776, you know, when the founding fathers were incensed over relatively small
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:40.880]  incursions into our liberty, like, you know, not much different from the taxes you pay
[02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:42.560]  when you, when you buy groceries.
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:46.240]  Well, the big thing is they had monopolies where you couldn't even get into land management
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:50.560]  or business or any manufacturing unless you were a British Lord.
[02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:53.240]  So was that monopoly that really made a man?
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:54.240]  Okay.
[02:51:54.240 --> 02:52:00.040]  Well, yeah, you know more about history than me, but I think, like, I think it was Lenin
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:03.760]  that said basically that they wouldn't be able to take America down by brute force.
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:06.800]  They'd have to sabotage us from within.
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:09.600]  And that's exactly what he said and that's what globalism is.
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:14.280]  Then you see Bill Maher and you see Cuomo saying, we want to sabotage America.
[02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:15.280]  America sucks.
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:16.280]  They don't even hide it.
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:20.800]  And the crowds go, yeah, if America bankrupted, yeah, we hate America.
[02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:25.080]  I mean, my God, then they say we're Russian agents because we're making it great again.
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:26.080]  Yeah, right.
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:33.080]  And we see these things like the censorship at the, you know, the high institutional level
[02:52:33.080 --> 02:52:40.080]  we see like a spirit, you know, taking control of the, the arms of government and the big
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:44.920]  tech corporations, but it's like a virus where you can keep kind of cut those tumors
[02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:45.920]  off.
[02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:50.600]  But if you don't get to that little piece of DNA that's circulating from cell to cell,
[02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:51.600]  I agree.
[02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:53.080]  And look, the heart of it is Satanism.
[02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:54.080]  It's Luciferianism.
[02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:55.080]  It's hate of God.
[02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:57.520]  We were founded as a Christian nation.
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:53:01.080]  And at the end of the day, it really is an occultic attempt to dominate America.
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:05.880]  Yeah, I want to, if you don't mind, I want to read you one of the Proverbs of Solomon.
[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:07.600]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:15.280]  Yeah, because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:20.760]  of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.760]  And I'm not saying like...
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:25.200]  No, that means they don't have the fear of God in them or the fear of godly men.
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:26.200]  They have no fear.
[02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:30.680]  We, uh, I'm not saying like we're, we're, uh, we're, you know, I'm not talking about...
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:36.600]  Not going to, but they're wicked works, manifest, they procreate, they grow, they multiply,
[02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:37.600]  they invent evil.
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:41.360]  I'm saying we have like perverted the role of government.
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:50.400]  We have, um, we've changed the duty of government from punishing evil to trying to prevent evil.
[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:51.400]  And what do we do?
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:52.400]  It's beyond that.
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:54.080]  He's trying to preserve evil.
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:55.080]  It's protecting evil.
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:56.080]  Yeah.
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:54:00.040]  When, when a school shooting happens, when some atrocity happens, what do we do?
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:05.000]  We cry out for more rules, more regulations, more chains.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.040]  And I think if we do that with internet censorship, we're just going to get more of the same problems.
[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:12.720]  Well, I mean, if you look at Hillary or Peter Strock or any of these people, I mean, these
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:14.640]  people look like psychotic serial killers.
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:19.320]  I mean, they act like fruitcake, lunatic asylum people, but they all look like something.
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:24.000]  We all know what they, they look like, you know, folks that, uh, they have a lot of trouble
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:25.840]  right now in Pennsylvania.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:26.960]  And that's what it comes in.
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:27.960]  That's who they are.
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:28.960]  They're a cult.
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:29.960]  God bless you, Justin.
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:30.960]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:31.960]  All right.
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:32.960]  Let's talk to Susie in Ohio.
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:33.960]  Susie, Susie.
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:34.960]  Thanks for calling.
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:35.960]  Thanks for holding.
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:36.960]  You go ahead.
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:37.960]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:38.960]  Hi.
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:41.800]  So I just wanted to talk about the censorship stuff.
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:46.080]  Like, I feel like more mainstream conservatives need to make a bigger deal about it and they're
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:47.320]  like doing it to everyone.
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:49.560]  And I think it's going to, it's looking bad on them, though, like...
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:50.560]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:54.640]  It's the number one issue and it's only Trump talking about it and Congress is asleep at
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:55.640]  the switch.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:56.640]  They are banning everyone.
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:59.880]  They're violating your civil rights to talk to people and bragging and they think you're
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:00.880]  idiots.
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:01.880]  Yeah.
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:06.440]  Like even on YouTube or anything, like I've had all my cons and my, a bunch of comments
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:09.440]  censored and stuff like in support of you and I noticed how people will support you
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:10.440]  on there.
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:13.840]  But then on Facebook and Twitter, they're afraid because it's linked to the real name
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:14.840]  itself.
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:19.000]  Well, yeah, that's the message is, hey, you'll all be banned if you don't leave, leave Jones
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:20.000]  in the dark.
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:21.960]  But then notice their ban next.
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:22.960]  That was the test.
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:23.960]  Demonized Jones.
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:25.520]  Can everybody to desert him?
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:26.680]  Drudge didn't desert us.
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:27.880]  The president didn't desert us.
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:28.880]  You didn't desert me.
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:29.880]  So now we've got a fighting chance.
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:33.640]  But yeah, I have to say that what's neck and neck, though, people don't get upset about
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:34.640]  this.
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:35.640]  They can win.
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:36.640]  Yeah.
[02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:40.320]  And also, what about the transport on your phone, Alex, or you were going to talk about
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:41.320]  that?
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:43.640]  Say that again.
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:44.640]  Transport on your phone.
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:47.640]  That's all they keep talking about.
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:49.640]  And you know, I saw a couple of news articles about that.
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:50.640]  It's ridiculous.
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:54.360]  I was like looking up some reporter we're trying to hire today and punched in some number
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:56.040]  and it popped up porn on my phone.
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:58.360]  Everybody's had porn popular phones hundreds of times.
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:03.520]  So I'm sitting with a phone on air showing it to everybody because I couldn't get a URL
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:07.400]  up in the studio and then like something pops up and like, oh my God.
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:10.960]  And I looked at it wasn't the news blurted out because there was nothing there.
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:14.680]  They blurred it to then say something was there and you went to it was some porn menu.
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:17.760]  I probably had porn menus pop up 500 times on my phone.
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:18.920]  So I appreciate your call.
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:23.520]  I mean, it's insane, ladies and gentlemen, there's two types of people, people that look
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:25.440]  at porn and people that lie about it.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:28.320]  But I wasn't looking at porn on my phone.
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:31.600]  I don't take phones on air that I look at porn on.
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:32.760]  And so I saw all that.
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:33.760]  I didn't respond to it.
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:37.200]  I mean, if I respond to half the attacks on me, you know, but then they spun it in one
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:38.200]  article I saw.
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  I saw a whole bunch.
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:40.200]  I only read one.
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:45.800]  It was like Jones who hates gay people or trans people is just like looking at this stuff.
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:47.920]  And it's like, I never said I hate anybody.
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:53.000]  I said, if you're heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is, leave kids alone.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:57:02.720]  But the LGBT community, not all the LGBT, but the LGBT, the LGBT community, LGBT community,
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:05.760]  the LGBT is LGBT pedophile.
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:09.200]  And they literally promote sexualization of kids and say, let us sexualize your kids or
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.200]  you're transphobic.
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:13.560]  So that's the whole entry way to try to teach kids that there are different sex and ruin
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:14.560]  their lives.
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:16.080]  As who said that?
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:18.080]  What's her name?
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:20.720]  She's a lesbian, liberal, but I read a lot of her writings.
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  That's a fat.
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:23.720]  Yeah, Camille Paglia.
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:25.120]  So I mean, there you go.
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:26.600]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:31.040]  They tried to sell that the article I saw, like I was like, you know, I'm this big right

[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:16.840]  to him about what the last caller called it about.
[03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:23.240]  I have been so focused on the president countering censorship and 96% of conservative news being
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:26.840]  blocked and all these people getting deplatformed and kicked off.
[03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:35.320]  I haven't responded to store the news stories that I'm robbing people or that I'm running
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:40.800]  illegal radio stations was isn't true or that I destroyed evidence or that I'm a Russian
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:45.600]  agent or any of this and then do came in he goes I'm glad you responded to that as a
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:50.880]  lady called in because he's like it's on Newsweek it's on this and I'm getting a bunch of emails
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:53.440]  and what is it?
[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:57.360]  Anybody that's got a phone knows you're surfing around the internet typing in URLs.
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:02.360]  They have these traps of the email isn't right or the text isn't right where you type in that's
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:09.600]  like Amazon or Viagra ads or mortgage ads lately it's non-plastic bags has been taking
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:13.120]  my phone over because I'll type something in and I'll get it wrong and so I'm sitting
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:19.240]  there searching Genovese is a company we're promoting yes because I said the morning I'm
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:25.440]  having a sponsor on I want the URL typed on infowarsyes.com and Genovese I'm saying it
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:29.080]  right yes I typed that in and I'm like so they're gonna break something pops up says
[03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:34.040]  you've got a virus and I'm like and then I'm like okay whatever I finally get infowars
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:40.280]  yes up and I go look and then pops up some scream would like some word on it and then
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:43.960]  later they call me that after they go hey I want to not put these videos up because
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:48.080]  4chan says it's you know some type of porn they send me an image and I'm like that's
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:54.600]  like blurred white page I said put it out I don't even know what that is and then it
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:02:00.360]  becomes Jones who's a big homophobe and you know who's a puritan and never had sex with
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:05.920]  a woman he who was totally obsessed with this stuff is blah blah blah and then I went and
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:11.360]  looked on my phone and couldn't even find what they said I found one menu that was a
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:15.680]  Tinder so I guess that's what it loaded it just starts going bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:19.600]  all this porn and it's like you want guys you want women you want trannies who can't
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:25.200]  say that on Twitter a transsexuals and and and I'm like okay I got a tinder out of my
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:30.560]  phone I'm not the puritan here I'm the libertarian I say do whatever you want in your own bedroom
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:36.120]  as long as you don't hurt somebody else but it becomes this big national news story Janess
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:40.280]  okay I say it wrong Janess that's why I tied like Genoese and you know whatever the point
[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:44.360]  is I mean I know it's great products and everything I get I'm teleprompter free I go from memory
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:48.800]  and they were here that morning I go where are my URLs I want them typing it on screen
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:53.240]  I was throwing fits on air about it like everybody said that happened but the point is then they
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:58.960]  spin it that Jones the super right wing Puritan pastor who leads you know major congregations
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:05.160]  of churches and says executes such as such as does this and it's not even true I'm not
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:10.120]  Jimmy Swagger saying if you're with a woman out of wedlock you're going to hell and you
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:16.160]  catch it with hookers that ain't me man everybody knows that so I never even responded to this
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:22.960]  but now it's just day after day after day because they want to distract me from the censorship
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:25.560]  and I'm going to introduce this with Paul we come back we got loaded phones but I got
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:30.480]  to go because Paul's here the war rooms coming up about 55 minutes but I'm going to put out
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:35.280]  special reports at info wars dot com on 96% of conservatives being censored them trying
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.920]  to steal the election by reports the president it's unbelievable we even thought about doing
[03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:46.680]  a trolling deal that 4chan would catch like one second of some pop up we even thought
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:52.040]  by the way like I said this morning they must have a virus on my phone didn't torture me
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:55.560]  too much I mean but I was on Tinder for five minutes I've never actually had a membership
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:04:00.000]  on that my god again I was looking up this female reporter we're talking about hiring
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:07.160]  from London I put her name in and it's not even her and it's you know adult friend finder
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:12.120]  you know that you want you know we got guys a mile away we got chicks two miles away and
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:18.280]  it's like it's like babies I've always said that I've had gay friends I've always said
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:22.040]  I don't dislike you know dudes that take hormones that want to be a woman or whatever I just
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:29.040]  said don't sexualize children like the Catholic priests and all this crap going on so you
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:32.160]  know maybe I should just pull a stunt and go to a live broadcast from a gay bar I mean
[03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:37.200]  if they'd even had me in one of them like here I am you know I mean it's ridiculous I don't
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:42.240]  dislike anybody that's pro-freedom but the left is a cult and it's trying to sexualize

[03:07:04.320 --> 03:07:08.960]  macron's about to get unseated it's all happening she's like well why don't they just get unseated
[03:07:08.960 --> 03:07:12.880]  well they're parliamentaries they might have 10 party 20 parties and they do these coalition
[03:07:12.880 --> 03:07:17.200]  things but i mean they're all hanging on by their fingernails right now and that's why
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:25.360]  they're trying to distract us everywhere into amorosa or into you know the stuff they're trying
[03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:31.360]  to do with us and it's just a joke paul's got a big report coming out tomorrow as important
[03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:37.440]  as the 96 percent of conservatives it's not just 96 percent of liberal sides or your search
[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:41.040]  that means the majority of 96 percent of conservatives are knocked out that's what that
[03:07:41.040 --> 03:07:46.000]  really means and so everyone's learning about this how they only put the negative results up
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:50.480]  how they don't let you talk to people on facebook twitter had a total shadow ban on most people we
[03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:54.320]  had to actually go to the page now they've lessened up because president said it's illegal
[03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:59.920]  now he said the rest of this stuff's illegal and so we're going to have big special reports on
[03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:05.120]  info wars dot com and news wars dot com in the next few days laying out how it's happening who
[03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:12.000]  runs it what's going on but it is they stay behind network in the cia in the justice department in
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:17.280]  the board of governors the FCC to quote counter foreign propaganda but then they just list us as
[03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:21.840]  foreign propaganda and come in and try to shut us down so paul i know you've got a big raft of things
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:27.680]  at prison planet on twitter editor at large been full wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[03:08:27.680 --> 03:08:33.200]  i wanted to get your take on what's coming up but just first good news i never even got this on
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:36.560]  the show today even though i freaked out about it i want to show a few of these tweets after you
[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:41.120]  talk about it what do you make of trump coming out bold saying it's illegal you're censoring millions
[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:47.280]  you leave fake news like CNN up but you're crushing the election this is serious censorship we are
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:52.160]  going to go after you this is a some tweets from a couple days ago here let's let's let's pull up the
[03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:57.520]  the new ones if i can i'm gonna do whatever it takes and i'll actually actually get the ones from
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:01.680]  today social media giants are selling millions yeah that was the one from a few days ago it's
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:06.240]  the big ones today and whatever happens i'm gonna stay here as late as i have to tonight
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:12.480]  to get this out here it is the google search results for trump news shows only the viewing
[03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:19.120]  reporting of fake news media in other words they have rigged for me and others so that almost all
[03:09:19.120 --> 03:09:26.160]  stories and news is bad yeah no no positive news fake cnn is prominent republican conservative and
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:34.640]  fair media is shut out illegal 96 results on trump news are from national left wing media
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:41.040]  very dangerous google and others are supervising voices oppressing voices of conservatives and
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:45.280]  hiding information in news that is good they're controlling what we can and cannot see this is
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:51.520]  very serious situation will be addressed it goes on to say is it illegal so paul what does the
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:56.400]  president do at this point i mean you've got an article you wrote today at info wars dot com youtube
[03:09:56.400 --> 03:10:02.480]  medals in swedish election by deleting right wing content uh and and and sites put up by the opposing
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:08.400]  party i mean this is the new global corporate police censor and you've got mainstream media dying
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:15.120]  dinosaurs like cnn new york times actively as the watchdogs the stasi going around flagging what gets
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:21.120]  taken down and then oliver darcy adds insult to entry and says no one's censoring you it's crazy
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:27.680]  when he's been the captain of it all yeah cnn put out an article saying there's no censorship of
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:33.360]  conservatives that's a conspiracy theory he was the guy lobbying for the past six months in meetings
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:38.880]  with facebook and youtube in direct contact with google youtube and facebook telling them oh by the
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:42.880]  way this violates your policy this violates your policy censor them censor them but there's no
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:49.200]  conspiracy to censors google has responded since trump put out these tweets alex and said that
[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:56.800]  they don't rig their algorithm because they're biased they improve their algorithm and improve it
[03:10:56.800 --> 03:11:04.480]  to produce quote high quality content just so happens that that high quality content is nbc is
[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:10.320]  cnn is the new york time so it's not that 96 of the sites coming up when you type in trump news or
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:17.920]  left wing or anti trump it's that they're high quality who decides what is high quality google
[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:23.040]  the company that was in bed according to the wickleaks emails the pedestrian emails with the
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:29.200]  hillary clinton campaign from day one so you can trust them it's just like when they say oh we've
[03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:34.560]  got these independent fact checkers they're nonpartisan who are they oh it's snopes.com the most
[03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:40.080]  partisan left wing website you could ever imagine so it's just alex it's just high quality content
[03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:44.240]  there's no censorship these are the masters of the universe we just need to trust them
[03:11:44.240 --> 03:11:48.400]  and let's be clear they're not just pushing all the global of cnn stuff at the top and suppressing
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:54.160]  96% of conservatives that's what it really means they're also then flagging and blacklisting and
[03:11:54.160 --> 03:11:59.760]  blackballing and shadow banning and outright banning anyone they don't like who's too effective that
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:05.840]  beats the algorithm so handculture matt drudge shon hannity tucker carlson paul joseph watson
[03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:11.920]  you were 96% no no 97% banned we look we can see the algorithms we had google analytics
[03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:16.800]  and facebook you were 97% banned a year ago paul when you came out and bragged that we'd won
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:22.560]  and dominated and the financial times and others went holy hell it's true why i'm not mad at you
[03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:26.960]  but because we do chew their horn it's not bad until folks were winning but they they took you
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:33.280]  announcing that as a herald because they know we don't lie as as the big victory and so since
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:38.960]  then they've been beavering away but i think they've gone too far paul well of course it was congressman
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:44.400]  quigley a democrat who was in a committee session with a twitter executive complained about one of
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:50.880]  my tweets featuring in a trending news section about a completely genuine real story he claimed it
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:55.760]  was fake news it wasn't fake news they said oh no don't worry we've taken care of that so yeah
[03:12:55.760 --> 03:13:00.240]  they've been doing it all along the facebook video views were another thing that they changed
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:05.120]  at the beginning of the year i mean usually my videos on facebook would probably get at least
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:11.760]  300 000 overnight maybe more after a couple days maybe half a million now it's like 20 000 after
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:18.160]  like two days they so obviously gamed it in their favor and now as he said in sweden with this is
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:23.840]  not just censorship this is election meddling alex we're 12 days away from a massive election in
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:29.520]  sweden with the sweden democrats the anti mass migration party tipped to do really well they've
[03:13:29.520 --> 03:13:36.000]  banned a documentary or a short skit which was a comedy cartoon about the prime minister of sweden
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:40.960]  they've banned a video by alternative for sweden within like two hours they've banned a video last
[03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:45.760]  month by the sweden democrats within hours they're banning all the nationalists in brazil
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:52.160]  that are like americana pro gun yeah in brazil you've got bolsson aro who is who is basically
[03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:57.360]  the brazilian trump he's probably gonna win they bat they're banning huge amounts of facebook groups
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:02.640]  youtube channels it's this is election meddling it's gone way beyond censorship or shadow banning
[03:14:02.640 --> 03:14:06.000]  this is election meddling there's no evidence let me bring this up and i'm gonna get out of
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:09.920]  because you're here to host and everybody loves you trump is getting all our stuff i'm not gonna
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:13.680]  get into how or what i got law firms everything every day we're just flooding him they're really
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:18.400]  pissed but it's happening he's listening paul's you got a big report coming out tomorrow listening
[03:14:18.400 --> 03:14:22.400]  all the stuff they've done and how to counter it but when i know you got guests coming up want to
[03:14:22.400 --> 03:14:26.800]  cover but in a minute and a half we're gonna break this is the big issue paul this is tyranny
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:33.520]  this is illegal what should trump do right now because we've got to take action well we gave him
[03:14:33.520 --> 03:14:39.440]  some suggestions in that document we put out in consultation with media lawyers in dc you can at
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:44.240]  least hire a panel of free speech experts and have them make recommendations you can have a digital
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:50.160]  bill of rights you can look at the communications decency act which already has some teeth and
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:54.800]  let me say again you have all these people in these in these conferences lying and saying no one
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:58.480]  shadow banning when we have their own internal documents we have them lying to congress paul
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:05.360]  and by the way there's just gone up just in the past hour or so a big new white house petition
[03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:10.080]  remember we did that petition it's on change.org left wing website they were literally deleting
[03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:15.280]  signatures well we've got a new one in coordination with some other big personalities up on the
[03:15:15.280 --> 03:15:20.560]  white house website so they can't game this one it's already got thousands of signatures within
[03:15:20.560 --> 03:15:25.920]  just a couple of hours there's an article which i just wrote on informals.com new white house petition

[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:36.720]  easy as quick do it now and let me explain this senator warner widen and murphy threatened a
[03:15:36.720 --> 03:15:41.280]  month ago to take down big tech and nationalize it if they win the election so they rolled over
[03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:45.920]  the democrats trump must exert pressure we're not for regulation but the lack of regulation saying
[03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:51.920]  there is no regulation is allowing the regulation understand that we must act to protect free speech
[03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:57.360]  now. hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[03:15:57.360 --> 03:16:02.720]  mother's house i sued the irs in one i beat the irs then and i've been beating them ever since

[03:17:57.040 --> 03:18:02.640]  really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:09.200]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:18:09.200 --> 03:18:15.760]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:22.480]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:28.640]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:34.480]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:34.480 --> 03:18:41.280]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure
[03:18:41.280 --> 03:18:47.440]  raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:54.560]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it we are
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:19:00.720]  kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're

[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:35.440]  this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show with me paul joseph watson as i mentioned before
[03:20:35.440 --> 03:20:40.880]  the break that big petition up on the white house website is live right now it's got thousands of
[03:20:40.880 --> 03:20:46.320]  signatures within just a couple of hours unlike the change dot org one which had a had a good
[03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:51.600]  trajectory at the beginning but then suddenly mysteriously these thousands of signatures began
[03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:57.040]  getting wiped off the article is up on info wars dot com news wars dot com new white house
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:02.080]  petition demands congress pass legislation protecting online speech the petition it's
[03:21:02.080 --> 03:21:08.240]  short and sweet it reads as follows the internet is the modern public square it's where political
[03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:13.040]  campaigns are four and one where journalism is created and distributed and where grassroots
[03:21:13.040 --> 03:21:18.000]  movements are born yet the free and open internet has become a controlled centered space monopolized
[03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:23.600]  by a few unaccountable corporations by banning users from their platforms these corporations
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:29.120]  can effectively remove politically unwelcome americans from the public square that is repugnant
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:35.600]  to our shared values of free speech and freedom of the press the president should request that
[03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:40.800]  congress pass legislation prohibiting social media platforms from banning users for first
[03:21:40.800 --> 03:21:46.240]  amendment protected speech the power to block lawful content should be in the hands of individual
[03:21:46.240 --> 03:21:55.520]  users not mark zuckerberg or jack dorsi so that is up right now on the white house petition website
[03:21:55.520 --> 03:22:00.320]  if it gets a hundred thousand signatures and it needs to get a hundred thousand signatures
[03:22:00.320 --> 03:22:05.360]  within a month it goes to the white house they have to consider it they have to respond but we
[03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:10.320]  already know that they're considering some kind of action but again this keeps the pressure on
[03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:17.840]  and it generates even more media interest protect free speech in the digital public square go and
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:23.760]  sign that right now if you keep refreshing it the signatures change but i think we got about 2000
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:31.680]  so far once they're all accounted for there's also going to be a special day long live stream and it
[03:22:31.680 --> 03:22:36.480]  looks like that's going to take place on saturday right now we're doing that in coordination with
[03:22:36.480 --> 03:22:42.320]  bright bar it's going to have a ton of huge guests a day long stream i'll probably be hosting some of
[03:22:42.320 --> 03:22:47.760]  it and again just a huge number of great guests that you'll all love and want to hear from that's
[03:22:47.760 --> 03:22:51.760]  probably going to be on saturday so obviously we'll announce details of that in advance and it's all
[03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:57.840]  about drawing attention to this petition because we have stories like this which again i mentioned
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:23:04.560]  before the break youtube medals in swedish selection by deleting right wing content this is not the
[03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:11.200]  first time they've done this and they're doing it again and they're doing it in response to coordinated
[03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:18.800]  brigade campaigns by left-wing pressure groups in abuse of their own terms of service once again
[03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:23.040]  google owned youtube has been caught meddling in the swedish national election on the eve of the
[03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:29.520]  vote the election is in about 12 days time by repeatedly deleting right wing content so somebody
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:35.520]  posted a satirical cartoon that made fun of the swedish prime minister stefan lovren you can't
[03:23:35.520 --> 03:23:43.600]  do that it was deleted within two hours because it was deemed to contain hateful content once again
[03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:51.040]  it's not a slippery slope it's a cliff edge when everything is hateful then you can have no opinion
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:56.560]  you can't even make a cartoon that makes fun out of the prime minister of sweden that's hate speech
[03:23:56.560 --> 03:24:02.800]  you can't do that that's bullying that's harassment like when we call brian stelter mean names boo-hoo
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:08.400]  that's also bullying and harassment the short film entitled to make it right made fun out of numerous
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:13.680]  swedish politicians to their obsession with being politically correct can't do that hate speech
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:19.680]  banned apparently this now qualifies as hate speech in the scandinavian country now there's also a
[03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:24.800]  second example of this where the right wing alternative for sweden party had last month had
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:30.640]  its entire channel deleted it was restored eventually after pressure but then just yesterday
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:38.560]  they had another video removed again 12 days before the election it was made unavailable for
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:44.560]  viewing in sweden so you could see it outside of sweden but obviously if there's a swedish national
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:50.000]  election that's not much help again deleted within hours a right wing right wing content video
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:55.920]  earlier this month a video by sweden democrats who of course are basically the number two or
[03:24:55.920 --> 03:25:01.600]  number three party right now expected to perform really well was deleted without explanation that
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:07.280]  video was an hour and 40 minutes of quotes and historical background on the social democrats
[03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:13.040]  which is the number one party in sweden and their links to nazism so it's all okay to point the
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:17.680]  finger at the right wing all day and call them nazis even when they're not but if you dig into
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:23.760]  the historical links between big left-wing parties and nazism in sweden then you get
[03:25:23.760 --> 03:25:32.800]  deep six within hours that video had over 190 000 views and it was canned by youtube the party said
[03:25:32.800 --> 03:25:38.000]  they were waiting for an explanation i'm not sure whether that came back again that was a month ago
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:43.280]  but again it's all about continuously having to complain about this if they've continuously got
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:48.560]  you on the ropes to the point where every day you're just whining about being censored it's hard
[03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:53.680]  to get your message out it's hard to get your policy platform out and of course this all happened
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:26:01.200]  in sweden after a swedish corporate media group called the bonnie group met with google and demanded
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:06.240]  that they remove hateful content that meeting that private meeting happened back in march
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:13.680]  and ever since then just by coincidence all these right-wing swedish uh political parties again this
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:19.040]  is now at the level where they're censoring political parties not not just individuals have
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:25.680]  had their content removed by youtube after this corporate left-wing pressure group met with google
[03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:32.400]  to demand exactly that so again it's all about creating this precedent where any criticism
[03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:38.480]  any making fun of left-wing politicians is seen as hate speech is seen as harassment and your
[03:26:38.480 --> 03:26:46.640]  content gets wiped off of google this is happening 12 days before a massive election in sweden which
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:51.120]  once again goes to the point this isn't just about censoring individuals this isn't just about
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:57.280]  censoring groups this is about election meddling and this is why it's so important we've talked
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:27:03.440]  talked about robert eppstein who has done studies into democratic elections for example in india
[03:27:03.440 --> 03:27:09.200]  the largest democrat democratic election in the world and found that the simple rank of google
[03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:15.360]  search results can shift millions of votes what facebook users see on the day of an election can
[03:27:15.360 --> 03:27:21.680]  shift millions of votes this is why it matters so it doesn't matter whether you're on twitter or not
[03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:26.400]  it doesn't matter whether you use facebook or not you might not use any of those platforms you
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:34.480]  might not care but this changes the results of elections that's why it matters once again everything
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:40.080]  they do is about power it's not about enforcing their terms of service it's not about protecting

[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:08.400]  this video which i put up yesterday it's called atomized why our culture creates mass shooters
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:12.800]  and then i'm going to get into some more news about this david cat the madden tournament
[03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:19.120]  shooter after we roll this video here it is another mass shooting and another opportunity
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:24.480]  for everyone to exploit the tragedy by blaming their political enemies gun control now this is
[03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:29.120]  the nra's fault vote democrat in november but the shooter was a left winger who hated trump
[03:35:29.120 --> 03:35:35.840]  supporters vote republican is any of that going to explain why mass shootings happen no listen to
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:43.120]  how announcers described 24 year old gunman david cats you are not going to see much emotion from
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:50.000]  our guy brett this dude is a man david cats keeps to himself he's a man of business he's not here for
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:55.440]  the experience and to go out just that in the third he's not here to make friends he's all
[03:35:55.440 --> 03:36:00.560]  business he's focused and to even get him to open up to talk to you about anything it's it's like
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:06.400]  calling these men david cats was clearly a product of his diseased society and culture a culture that
[03:36:06.400 --> 03:36:13.040]  has lost faith in itself and offers nothing but empty meaningless nihilism a neoliberal dystopia
[03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:18.880]  that indoctrinates young people to shun authenticity community and family in pursuit of vapid
[03:36:18.880 --> 03:36:24.960]  consumerism and fleeting fame a culture that informs narcissism prone young people that anyone
[03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:32.000]  can gain instant notoriety by generating enough controversy a culture that celebrates serial
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:38.400]  killers a culture that monetizes gruesome barbarity calling henry reports on the new walking tour
[03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:43.520]  offering jeffrey dommer history at a discount word about the dommer tour surface this week on the
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:51.040]  daily deal site groupon which offered two tickets for 25 bucks a 58 percent discount a deal so hot
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:56.720]  it's sold out in ours a culture that repeatedly tells young white men that because of the sins of
[03:36:56.720 --> 03:37:02.960]  their ancestors they have no legitimate place in the world no right to an identity that they have no
[03:37:02.960 --> 03:37:09.920]  right to a sense of belonging and that their only destiny is to become increasingly atomized a society
[03:37:09.920 --> 03:37:17.120]  that has normalized and accelerated the evisceration of the family unit creating a generation of aimless
[03:37:17.120 --> 03:37:25.120]  disconnected angry young men from broken homes like david cats atomized disparate lonely losers
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:30.720]  whose only way of redressing their own pain of isolation is to inflict physical pain on others
[03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:36.560]  as tomas magrath writes where once a family or community group may have picked them up or supported
[03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:43.120]  them they fall deeper into their failure placing it entirely on their shoulders and that in itself
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:48.880]  makes it easy to sacrifice everything when you have nothing to lose look at the locations
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:54.480]  where mass shootings happen they're all places where the public has organized itself into a
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:38:00.640]  community workplaces schools churches in this case a video game competition where the participants
[03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:07.280]  all shared the same interest the shooter takes revenge for being rejected by the community for
[03:38:07.280 --> 03:38:13.120]  being atomized and as these communities become weaker and more sparse with civic participation
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:20.240]  in rapid decline the smaller they become and the more atomized isolated individuals they push away
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:35.360]  to the fringes this wasn't just a case of cats suddenly snapping because he lost a video game
[03:38:35.360 --> 03:38:41.200]  he traveled from baltimore to jacksonville with his gun he planned this in advance court records
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:48.160]  show that cats had significant medical problems and health care needs was he on ssri drugs that
[03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:55.280]  are known to kill empathy by putting the user in an emotionless translike disassociated state of
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:39:01.520]  mind the majority of mass shooters in the united states were on or had recently been on some kind
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:07.760]  of antidepressant medication will the media ever give this factor the attention it deserves well
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:14.960]  given that pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like prozac zoloft and paxil spend 2.4 billion
[03:39:14.960 --> 03:39:20.960]  dollars on direct to consumer television advertising every single year don't hold your breath will
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:27.200]  the media ever stop making celebrities out of mass shooters with their breathless coverage they've
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:33.920]  had 20 years of mass murders throughout which i have repeatedly told cnn and our other media
[03:39:34.640 --> 03:39:42.480]  if you don't want to propagate more mass murders don't start the story with sirens blaring the
[03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:48.640]  school day had only just begun with the attacker struck don't have photographs of the killer the
[03:39:48.640 --> 03:39:55.680]  17 year olds three-hour rampage ended in his own death don't make this 24 seven coverage the german
[03:39:55.680 --> 03:40:01.360]  chancellor is about to give her reaction we'll bring that to you live do everything you can not to
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:10.400]  make the body count the lead story carnage in the classroom 16 people are dead not to make the killer
[03:40:10.960 --> 03:40:18.080]  some kind of anti-hero dressed in black combat gear the gunman opened fire at random do localize
[03:40:18.080 --> 03:40:23.920]  this story to the affected community and make it as boring as possible in every other market
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:29.760]  because every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder we expect to see one
[03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:34.720]  or two more within a week instead of giving mass shooters the posthumous celebrity they crave maybe
[03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:40.000]  we should just tag them with embarrassing nicknames maybe that will dismantle some of the dark
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:46.240]  romanticized mystique that the media whips up around these killers why are we fascinated by these
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:52.720]  psychotic losers because whenever mass shootings occur it provides a kind of thermometer reading
[03:40:52.720 --> 03:40:58.640]  for how sick our society has become as philosopher guide de bord said in societies where modern
[03:40:58.640 --> 03:41:04.800]  conditions of production prevail all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:11.040]  of spectacles everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation
[03:41:11.040 --> 03:41:17.280]  mass violence provides a depraved societal need for the consumer spectacle just as lynchings in
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:23.200]  america and public hangings in europe did in the past so long as our culture continues to offer
[03:41:23.200 --> 03:41:30.720]  nothing whatsoever of substance authenticity or meaning to young men they'll continue to appropriate
[03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:37.040]  meaning via any means possible so long as young men are taught to be ashamed of their identity
[03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:44.320]  they'll continue to seek out violently transgressive ways to establish their identity so long as family
[03:41:44.320 --> 03:41:50.880]  community and civic society continue to wither and collapse young men will continue to fall
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:55.840]  through the safety net that would otherwise have offered protection young men like david
[03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:05.680]  cats will continue to become more and more atomized now you will have heard in that video report
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:11.440]  i asked the question was the shooter on ssri drugs headline out of daily caller report jacksonville
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:15.680]  shooter was hospitalized for mental illness the video gamer who allegedly shot up a madden
[03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:21.920]  tournament in jacksonville florida was previously hospitalized for mental illness records show
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:29.040]  that on two occasions he was prescribed anticycotic and anti-depression medication the same medication
[03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:34.960]  that's been linked with the vast majority of mass shooters in the united states will the media ever
[03:42:34.960 --> 03:42:40.720]  give this angle the attention it deserves no they haven't and no they won't because
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:46.320]  those big pharma dollars are just too much to resist we'll be back in the final segment of

[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:18.720]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph watson
[03:47:18.720 --> 03:47:26.560]  basically what happened is that the mainstream media lobbied for months to ban info wars they
[03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:32.080]  lobbied big tech to ban info wars they finally caved they finally did it and what effect did it
[03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:38.480]  have it provoked president donald trump into starting a national conversation about not only
[03:47:38.480 --> 03:47:45.200]  social media censorship but election meddling this is the real story here is election meddling so
[03:47:45.200 --> 03:47:50.560]  really we should be thankful that we were kind of the canary in the coal mine that set this all off
[03:47:50.560 --> 03:47:55.600]  and got them finally to pay attention to something that i've been talking about for well over a year
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:48:01.120]  now which is the importance of the algorithm we've got a headline here kudlow we're taking a look at
[03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:06.080]  regulating google while speaking to reporters on tuesday national economic council director larry
[03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:10.480]  kudlow stated that the trump administration is taking a look at whether there needs to be some
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:15.360]  form of government regulation of google and we'll let people know what they plan to do he said we'll
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:19.120]  let you know we're taking a look at it we'll let you know oh but google's a private company you
[03:48:19.120 --> 03:48:24.080]  can't regulate a private company no it's not okay they're meeting on a regular basis they're being
[03:48:24.080 --> 03:48:29.920]  pressured by lawmakers by politicians they're a monopoly they are basically the internet at this
[03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:36.720]  point they're not just a private company it's like if the phone company terminated your contract
[03:48:36.720 --> 03:48:41.440]  because they didn't like what you what conversations you are having with people on the phone that's
[03:48:41.440 --> 03:48:48.320]  abuse that's basically corporate fascism they're working hand in hand with power brokers to silence
[03:48:48.320 --> 03:48:53.600]  people's first amendment rights because the internet the google's the twitter's the facebook's of this
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:49:00.080]  world are the public square if you're not there then you're nowhere so no it's not just a private
[03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:06.000]  company and finally at least they're putting pressure on them at least they're putting them
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:11.200]  on notice of course now google has come out and said oh there's no bias in our algorithm we've
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:16.400]  just improved our algorithm literally i could search for an info wars headline which i wrote a
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:22.720]  few months ago the exact search term with the even with the quotations around it which is supposed
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:28.880]  to only bring up that headline it's not there it happened last week i had to go on a another forum
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:34.960]  that had posted the info wars story to get the link to the original info wars story okay this is
[03:49:34.960 --> 03:49:41.840]  orwellian memory whole behavior oh but they came back and said there's no bias in our algorithm
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:49.360]  we just improved it so we could ensure that high quality content appears in response to users queries
[03:49:49.360 --> 03:49:57.120]  what's the high quality content 96 anti-trump left wing just by coincidence cnn new york times
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:50:03.600]  npr so again they basically admitted to what trump charged them of being behind but just wrapped it
[03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:10.160]  in this vague language oh just just an improvement to the algorithm an improvement that skews every
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:16.400]  perspective on every single issue a few months before the midterms again this is election
[03:50:16.400 --> 03:50:22.080]  meddling and by the way that petition headline on info wars dot com new white house petition
[03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:26.880]  demands congress pass legislation protecting online speech last count it was passed about
[03:50:26.880 --> 03:50:34.880]  3500 signatures go and sign that today it's simple it's easy it literally takes 30 seconds
[03:50:34.880 --> 03:50:40.080]  we need to get that petition passed 100 000 or what's the point in signing petitions that
[03:50:40.080 --> 03:50:44.880]  don't do anything well if it gets past 100 000 the white house has to respond again this generates
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:50.080]  media interest this keeps the ball rolling we have to build up a pressure movement and it's
[03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:54.160]  currently happening there's going to be a big live stream on saturday with a lot of your favorite
[03:50:54.160 --> 03:51:00.640]  personalities so we'll announce more details on that in due course moving on to global news right now
[03:51:01.920 --> 03:51:06.560]  the prime minister of britain who is a complete joke and needs to resign immediately
[03:51:06.560 --> 03:51:13.840]  has publicly supported publicly supported the racist criminal policy being enacted by the south
[03:51:13.840 --> 03:51:19.760]  african government or at least threatened to be enacted of seizing white owned land in south africa
[03:51:19.760 --> 03:51:27.200]  either at one-tenth compensation or zero compensation whatsoever as we've documented this is a policy
[03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:34.000]  that could lead to mass starvation of both white and black people as it did in zimbabwe in the 90s
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:41.120]  and of course incentivize widespread murder of white farmers she's actually come out and publicly
[03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:46.960]  supported it headline out of bright bar tereza may announce a support for south african no
[03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:51.440]  compensation land reform uk prime minister tereza may has announced her backing of the
[03:51:51.440 --> 03:51:56.640]  controversial south african proposal to strip farmers of their land without compensation
[03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:02.240]  as long as the process is done in a legal manner so as long as they put it in the constitution
[03:52:02.240 --> 03:52:07.520]  that they can just seize your land without compensation at gunpoint that makes it legal
[03:52:07.520 --> 03:52:14.320]  that makes it okay no it's morally repugnant it's racist it's criminal why on earth are you backing
[03:52:14.320 --> 03:52:20.480]  this absolute embarrassment to the country the uk pm support for the land reform expropriation
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:25.280]  without compensation which are currently not possible and requires changes to the south african
[03:52:25.280 --> 03:52:30.240]  constitution to implement which they've said is going to happen came during her first trip to the
[03:52:30.240 --> 03:52:35.920]  african continent this week she said the uk has for some time now supported land reform land that's
[03:52:35.920 --> 03:52:41.120]  what they call it land reform literally the government sending people letters showing up on
[03:52:41.120 --> 03:52:46.960]  these farms saying we'll give you one tenth the amount it's worth if you're lucky if you say no
[03:52:46.960 --> 03:52:53.520]  men with guns will come to seize the land just a just a little bit of land reform no that's
[03:52:53.520 --> 03:53:00.160]  criminal that's absolutely criminal and the long-term consequences could be an absolute disaster
[03:53:00.160 --> 03:53:07.440]  for the country jerov batten of uk responded he said tereza may say she supports land reform
[03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:12.000]  south africa that is legal many countries in the world have taken actions which are legal
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:17.680]  but that doesn't make them morally right it's reprehensible that mrs may standing shoulder to
[03:53:17.680 --> 03:53:22.240]  shoulder with the leader of a country who enacts these racist policies this government has no
[03:53:22.240 --> 03:53:26.880]  credibility whatsoever when it speaks of protecting human rights if it looks the other way when i
[03:53:26.880 --> 03:53:31.840]  suppose it international partners commit abuses white farmers are having their land taken away
[03:53:31.840 --> 03:53:35.840]  they're being attacked and murdered for no other reason than their white it should be the duty of
[03:53:35.840 --> 03:53:42.240]  international leaders to speak up against what is a form of ethnic cleansing not condone it by
[03:53:42.240 --> 03:53:48.960]  mealy mouth references to legality and isn't it ironic in fact we put a visit video about this
[03:53:48.960 --> 03:53:54.320]  out a couple of hours ago it's up on my twitter the bowers the african has actually got on with
[03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:59.600]  the south african black tribes for generations it was only when the british came in that they
[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:05.040]  truly ruined the country and created this colonial resentment that led to this clamor
[03:54:05.040 --> 03:54:11.600]  for land reform as they call it and these murders these attacks on white farmers now the complete
[03:54:11.600 --> 03:54:17.680]  joke the complete clown of a prime minister who is trailing in the polls to somebody who literally
[03:54:17.680 --> 03:54:22.960]  sympathizes with terrorists and worship worships venezuela jeremy corbin an absolute joke of a
[03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:28.160]  prime minister that should have been kicked out of office months ago is now publicly supporting
[03:54:28.160 --> 03:54:34.640]  the racist criminal seizure of white owned land without compensation in south africa a policy that
[03:54:34.640 --> 03:54:42.160]  could lead to ethnic cleansing and widespread starvation utter utter stupidity completely
[03:54:42.160 --> 03:54:49.120]  absurd absolutely ridiculous meanwhile in spain a huge boatload of illegal migrants storms
[03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:54.560]  luxury resort beach in spain this is a bright bought headline a boat packed with around 50
[03:54:54.560 --> 03:55:00.160]  illegal migrants beached itself on a luxury resort in spain's costa dilla lose on sunday
[03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:05.200]  and if you go to this article you can actually see the video again it's it's this basically a dingy
[03:55:05.200 --> 03:55:12.400]  of about 20 30 migrants they just roll up to this beach you see it right here this luxury beach
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:17.440]  people is just looking on in awe they just storm the beach and run off if you had isis which by the
[03:55:17.440 --> 03:55:25.600]  way isis invaded a beach in tunisia only a year ago a massacred 38 people most of whom were british
[03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:30.480]  by the way you could get isis terrorists on one of these boats coming from libya coming from one
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:35.600]  of these north african countries just storm in under the eyes of being migrants which the
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:41.440]  spanish government has rolled out the red carpet for they could massacre hundreds of people nobody
[03:55:41.440 --> 03:55:47.280]  would bat an idly there's no security there there's nothing whatsoever they're just letting this happen
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:52.480]  this ridiculous socialist spanish government has opened up this migrant route which by the way
[03:55:52.480 --> 03:55:58.720]  actually results in migrants dying when italy closed off the route to some extent even though
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:04.720]  the eu's trying to blackmail them out of it the number of migrant deaths crossing from libya to
[03:56:04.720 --> 03:56:09.920]  italy halved so they literally saved half the people's lives by saying no we're not going to
[03:56:09.920 --> 03:56:16.880]  roll out a red carpet now spain's doing it easy a video out of tunisia where again an isis militant
[03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:24.560]  stormed a beach with a gun disguised as a parasol an umbrella a massacre i think it was 38 people
[03:56:24.560 --> 03:56:30.800]  most of them were british absolutely horrific and that was one guy that was one guy stormed a
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:37.600]  beat in tunisia not so far away in spain you've got 20 30 migrants nobody knows who they are as
[03:56:37.600 --> 03:56:43.840]  we've seen out of germany there was a story last week where a woman actually who's isis sex slave
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:49.680]  captor she met him on the streets of stuttgart germany because he'd been given refugee status
[03:56:49.680 --> 03:56:56.080]  he was literally an isis militant who had kidnapped and sold women into sex slavery nobody knows who
[03:56:56.080 --> 03:57:02.560]  any of these people are they just show up they run to the nearest town this is absolute bedlam
[03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:09.600]  europe spain particularly right now is committing suicide by letting this happen meanwhile 1000
