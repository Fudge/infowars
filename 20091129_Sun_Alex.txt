[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:22.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.400 --> 00:30.000]  we've got an incredibly important video trends mission lined up for you today thank
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.760]  you so much for joining us Charlie Sheen is coming up in the third segment of this
[00:37.760 --> 00:43.760]  hour with the winner of the 20 minutes with the president contest it is the
[00:43.760 --> 00:51.080]  29th day of November 2009 on this Sunday edition Webster Griffin Tarpley to talk
[00:51.080 --> 00:56.760]  about climate gate in the last 30 minutes of the radio broadcast today and
[00:56.760 --> 01:02.920]  just so many other important police state issues and economic issues that we
[01:02.920 --> 01:10.920]  are going to be covering as well on top of all that for police shot dead in
[01:10.920 --> 01:17.000]  coffee shop in Washington state in a suburb of Seattle killed execution
[01:17.000 --> 01:26.080]  style is it drug related or will they claim that Islamists terrorist did it
[01:26.080 --> 01:34.360]  we are all trying to analyze this right now and find out what's happening but
[01:34.360 --> 01:40.840]  again Charlie Sheen coming up in t-minus 15 minutes from now live with us on air
[01:40.840 --> 01:45.400]  then we're gonna get the winner of the 20 minutes with the president contest
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.200]  video contest that was really the brainchild of Charlie Sheen the idea of
[01:50.200 --> 01:55.120]  taking the 20 key points in a interview with the president an interview a
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.800]  dialogue he wishes would happen to bring more attention to 9-11 truth and why
[01:59.800 --> 02:10.800]  those of us at 9-11 truth question the official fable so that is coming up we
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.000]  are also going to be taking your phone calls later on but the phones aren't open
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.160]  quite yet here is the stack on the climate gate information I have we're
[02:20.160 --> 02:23.920]  gonna be covering this after Charlie Sheen leaves us at about 45 after he's
[02:23.920 --> 02:30.480]  gonna do two segments with us tonight climate change this is the worst
[02:30.480 --> 02:34.240]  scientific scandal of our generation more than that I can't think of a
[02:34.240 --> 02:39.040]  scientific fraud in the last couple hundred years bigger than this other
[02:39.040 --> 02:43.760]  than the Nazis and their scientific fraud everything they did was claimed
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.720]  through their pseudoscience of the Aryan race and the world the global
[02:48.720 --> 02:52.560]  government they were going to build based on eugenics but when you realize
[02:52.560 --> 02:55.840]  that this is part of eugenics the whole global warming man-made global warming
[02:55.840 --> 03:02.680]  movement is then it makes total and complete sense Lord mocked in was on
[03:02.680 --> 03:07.520]  with us Friday for over an hour an incredible interview he went further
[03:07.520 --> 03:11.920]  than he's ever gone in the past he said shut down the United Nations arrest Al
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.120]  Gore the video clips of that and the key article written by Paul Joseph Watson
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.520]  are up on info wars.com and prison planet.com and on Google searches the
[03:22.520 --> 03:27.000]  number one search in the last week has been climate gate so even though a lot
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.440]  of the mainstream media is blacking out this news story and trying to spin it
[03:31.440 --> 03:35.320]  when they do report on it the number one issue on the web is climate gate
[03:35.320 --> 03:43.440]  fully eclipsing the fraud of man-made global warming also I keep getting
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.800]  emails and phone calls here to the office saying I work for the oil companies
[03:46.800 --> 03:53.160]  later I'm going to go over the Guardian the New York Times Bloomberg Exxon
[03:53.160 --> 04:00.520]  chief backs carbon tax that's London Guardian Bloomberg Shell calls for global
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.080]  expansion of cap and trade co2 programs we're gonna play a video clip of an
[04:06.080 --> 04:11.320]  international TV ad running with Dutch Royal Shell calling for a global tax
[04:11.320 --> 04:18.040]  here's another article Shell cap and trade is a good thing so I want to go
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.720]  over that and point out that the media keeps saying on health care that the
[04:23.720 --> 04:27.280]  insurance companies are against it when they wrote the bill and admit it the
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.960]  oil companies are behind the cap and trade scam it's all coming up plus
[04:32.960 --> 04:39.040]  climate change data dump times online times of London the East Anglia head UN
[04:39.040 --> 04:42.920]  University that they got all their data from is now destroyed the data they're
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.920]  in a lot of trouble that's coming up as well stay with us we're gonna cover
[04:47.920 --> 04:54.520]  climate gate then Charlie Sheen alive ladies and gentlemen on this Sunday
[04:54.520 --> 04:59.360]  29th of November 2009 edition stay with us we'll be right back have you ever
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.640]  wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is going to
[05:03.640 --> 05:07.160]  be the most important message you will ever hear solar power generators are
[05:07.160 --> 05:10.600]  now available from solutions from science in Thompson Illinois these
[05:10.600 --> 05:14.040]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.640]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no
[05:18.640 --> 05:22.320]  fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power
[05:22.320 --> 05:27.320]  plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios computers
[05:27.320 --> 05:31.880]  and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts
[05:31.880 --> 05:35.840]  or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[05:35.840 --> 05:40.200]  when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[05:40.200 --> 05:45.360]  solution from science go to my solar backup dot com and get off the grid
[05:45.360 --> 05:56.520]  today that's my solar backup dot com or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365
[05:56.520 --> 06:04.760]  don't wait call today from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy
[06:04.760 --> 06:12.440]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[06:12.440 --> 06:17.720]  well I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard
[06:17.720 --> 06:21.560]  time on Alex Jones your host you have found at the front lines of the info

[06:25.760 --> 06:30.240]  about exposing the world government openly being set up by a private group
[06:30.240 --> 06:35.720]  of central banks across the planet and there could no longer be any denial the
[06:35.720 --> 06:40.320]  head of the UN the head of the EU Al Gore all these world leaders are
[06:40.320 --> 06:45.240]  announcing planetary government is here and the global cap and trade cap and
[06:45.240 --> 06:51.200]  tax system is the funding mechanism for their world government and we are now
[06:51.200 --> 06:56.640]  more than a week into climate gate internal emails and documents from
[06:56.640 --> 07:02.200]  inside the East Anglia University in England the main university sourced and
[07:02.200 --> 07:08.920]  used as one of three climate centers to study man-made global warming engaged in
[07:08.920 --> 07:14.840]  premeditated fraud with the UN the NASA Goddard Space Center and more will give
[07:14.840 --> 07:20.760]  you all the latest developments on that coming up we are also of course going to
[07:20.760 --> 07:26.200]  be interviewing Charlie Sheen alive on air coming up in the next segment on
[07:26.200 --> 07:34.840]  this 29th day of November 2009 on this live Sunday edition Charlie Sheen is
[07:34.840 --> 07:40.360]  coming up this evening with us live on air with the winner of the 20 minutes
[07:40.360 --> 07:45.400]  with the president dot-com contest and we'll give you more details of that
[07:45.400 --> 07:50.200]  coming up this evening very appreciative to Charlie and having the idea to do
[07:50.200 --> 07:54.520]  this and all that he's been doing exposing false flag stage government
[07:54.520 --> 08:00.600]  terrorism like 9-11 we are here to expose frauds we are here to expose hoaxes we
[08:00.600 --> 08:05.320]  are here to tell the truth about what's happening in our planet justice be done
[08:05.320 --> 08:11.920]  may the heavens fall tell the truth let the chips fall where they made okay
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.760]  Friday I wasn't intending to come in and do a live radio show but Jesse Ventura
[08:16.760 --> 08:20.640]  contacted me and said Alex I'm getting ready to do a big media blitz Monday
[08:20.640 --> 08:25.080]  Tuesday and Wednesday ahead of American conspiracy well that's the name of his
[08:25.080 --> 08:30.120]  new book the show was gonna be called American conspiracy the name I coined but
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.760]  so they call it conspiracy theory Wednesday 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. central on
[08:35.760 --> 08:40.880]  true TV their big show of the winter December 3rd next Wednesday so I had
[08:40.880 --> 08:46.120]  Jesse Ventura on for more than an hour Friday and thank God we came in because
[08:46.120 --> 08:51.480]  Lord Moncton Viscount British Viscount contacted us and said I would love to
[08:51.480 --> 08:57.360]  come on Friday so we had Viscount Christopher Moncton on blowing the whistle
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.480]  on the world government takeover plan an incredible interview posted at info
[09:02.480 --> 09:08.520]  wars.com and prison planet.com and he in a devastatingly efficient and focused
[09:08.520 --> 09:15.040]  fashion like a particle beam at the CERN reactor focuses in on all the lies and
[09:15.040 --> 09:19.480]  fraud of climate gated it's an amazing interview I'm tempted to re-air it this
[09:19.480 --> 09:24.120]  week or maybe even next Sunday because it is so powerful Webster Griffin
[09:24.120 --> 09:30.680]  tiredly joining us historian economist to break down the scientific fraud of
[09:30.680 --> 09:35.160]  manmade global warming in the aftermath of climate gate being the number one
[09:35.160 --> 09:40.720]  news story worldwide in the last week and I'm very proud that info wars.com
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.160]  and prison planet.com last Thursday were amongst the first major alternative
[09:46.160 --> 09:54.680]  news websites to link to the wiki links documents with climate gate now what
[09:54.680 --> 10:04.160]  has happened we predicted last Sunday that the United Nations NASA and the
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.320]  British University that were caught doing this would come out and say that
[10:09.320 --> 10:17.080]  the emails were fake but actually what were partially right partially wrong they
[10:17.080 --> 10:22.120]  came out they got called by the Associated Press first that they returned
[10:22.120 --> 10:26.440]  calls to the AP first they got calls seven eight nine days ago from other
[10:26.440 --> 10:33.720]  media and the AP said did you write this and the head scientist Jones and
[10:33.720 --> 10:39.720]  others said yes we did write these emails and there's a criminal investigation
[10:39.720 --> 10:44.600]  on who leaked these now more and more it looks like the media is calling it a
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.360]  hack but it was internal scientists below these guys who were worried about
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.600]  going to prison and that's in the emails for lying that leaked it that's the
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.200]  evidence now beginning to come out but instead they've said well they're taken
[10:57.200 --> 11:04.800]  out of context and mainstream media has written headlines like emails not accurate
[11:04.800 --> 11:09.080]  then you read the sub article it's as well they really wrote this but it was
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.040]  taken out of context people didn't read the whole thousand plus emails and
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.640]  hundreds of internal documents well now the research communities had a chance
[11:16.640 --> 11:21.240]  to go over them and it's even worse than what we said not only is the United
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.800]  Nations NASA and this head climate research facility in England East
[11:25.800 --> 11:32.800]  Anglia University in eastern England caught lying but they're in there
[11:32.800 --> 11:41.480]  talking about how to persecute other scientists they are in the emails talking
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.240]  about how to block peer-reviewed journals from publishing science and real
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.320]  scientific readings that prove them to be liars and they're in there talking to
[11:49.320 --> 11:52.520]  the British government the US government about how to block for your
[11:52.520 --> 11:56.640]  request and they're in there talking to the White House science are John P.
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.240]  Holdren on how to block the release of this information and it turns out the
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.880]  BBC almost six weeks ago five plus weeks before this was released in the
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.880]  mainstream the BBC was given these emails and documents and decided to
[12:11.880 --> 12:16.840]  cover it up so they're in a lot of trouble right now but even more
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.480]  importantly now we've learned that in the documents that were released on
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.160]  WikiLeaks the big site where whistleblowers release information and
[12:24.160 --> 12:28.160]  that University has confirmed that this is their their computer program
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.880]  programs multiple programs that in the code to the program are notes by the
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.280]  programmer for others using it saying this is a fraud it's getting colder
[12:38.280 --> 12:43.720]  here's how you cover it up here's how you manipulate the data so we have the
[12:43.720 --> 12:53.080]  very software from the computer program that was used to integrate all this
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.000]  climate data around the world in the in in the notes on the programming itself
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.640]  saying this is a fraud and a lie now in New Zealand and Australia and it's
[13:03.640 --> 13:09.560]  coming out in Canada as we speak that universities and UN affiliated weather
[13:09.560 --> 13:16.280]  climatology centers have been caught ladies and gentlemen have been caught
[13:16.280 --> 13:20.600]  listen to this we have this all linked up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[13:20.600 --> 13:25.280]  it's London Telegraph the Daily Mail out of Canada all mainstream news that's the
[13:25.280 --> 13:36.200]  big New Zealand papers ABC News Australia they have been caught not just faking the
[13:36.200 --> 13:41.120]  data at the UN climate centers but the nations themselves have been caught
[13:41.120 --> 13:46.360]  cooking the books as well to get the fraud in line because the last decade
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.920]  real climate scientists independent climate scientists would call up
[13:49.920 --> 13:53.840]  universities and groups and get their data and then go match it to the UN's
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.720]  data claiming Australia or Canada or the US or Europe or Russia were hotter and
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.480]  saying well their actual buoy data from the ocean or their actual weather
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.960]  center data shows it was cooling why do you say it was heating did you fake that
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.480]  data they say oh we just made a mistake so they started getting caught doing this
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.160]  a decade ago right around nine ten years ago depending on the nation and so
[14:17.160 --> 14:21.880]  they began to integrate together and get their fraud on the same page this is a
[14:21.880 --> 14:25.720]  massive criminal conspiracy Senator Inhofe has called for criminal
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.560]  investigations Lord Moncton part of the House of Lords Viscount one of the
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.160]  biggest positions in the government over there and the parentage on this
[14:35.160 --> 14:39.440]  radio show Friday called for shutting down the United Nations and arresting
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.360]  Al Gore and arresting the head UN scientist Professor Jones and arresting
[14:44.360 --> 14:51.400]  all of these people so that is all coming up now Charlie she's gonna be
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.440]  with us for two segments in the first segment it's just gonna be Charlie and

[19:15.440 --> 19:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[20:19.120 --> 20:27.600]  November 29th Sunday edition and Charlie really needs no introduction the star of
[20:27.600 --> 20:33.560]  two and a half men star of spin city so many blockbuster films of course the
[20:33.560 --> 20:39.800]  great son of Martin Sheen the brother of Emilio Estevez he had the idea of three
[20:39.800 --> 20:46.840]  months ago to really write his thoughts about 9-11 his questions like six of the
[20:46.840 --> 20:51.400]  10 9-11 Commission members saying that what the official story was a fraud and
[20:51.400 --> 20:56.600]  a lie and there was a cover-up John Farmer the head lawyer saying it was a
[20:56.600 --> 21:04.480]  criminal cover-up Charlie wanted to use his his his notoriety selflessly to try
[21:04.480 --> 21:07.480]  to have a real debate about this thinking gee we've got a new president
[21:07.480 --> 21:11.000]  surely this should happen so Charlie Sheen's with us and in a few minutes we're
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.600]  gonna bring up the winner I don't know if I should announce this or if Charlie
[21:14.600 --> 21:19.200]  should of the 20 minutes with the president video contest Charlie it's
[21:19.200 --> 21:22.480]  great to have you here with us my friend
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.240]  can you hear me yes I can they didn't they didn't punch you up yet that's
[21:28.240 --> 21:32.440]  that's their specialty I'm just joking hey it's good to have you here buddy it's
[21:32.440 --> 21:39.360]  great to be here man I mean really this is an exciting contest we got over a
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.080]  hundred and fifty great entries maybe for listeners that just tuned in give them
[21:43.080 --> 21:47.400]  some background on your questions of 9-11 why you can pull the idea for 20
[21:47.400 --> 21:52.560]  minutes with the president and then the subsequent contest well you know I am I
[21:52.560 --> 21:59.200]  felt because it was our it was our first you know new president in almost a
[21:59.200 --> 22:06.760]  decade and that that the entire movement had been stonewalled so terribly and and
[22:06.760 --> 22:11.080]  so completely by the Bush administration by the mainstream media that I felt
[22:11.080 --> 22:17.120]  based on you know all of his campaign promises and other rhetoric that that he
[22:17.120 --> 22:23.000]  might be the guy that that that I could go to to you know that to establish the
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.080]  message of you know new president new investigation because here we are this
[22:28.080 --> 22:32.040]  many years later and there's just too many unanswered questions there's just
[22:32.040 --> 22:37.640]  too many holes in the story that that you could fly planes through and it just
[22:37.640 --> 22:44.120]  I felt that that that if I created this I guess a piece of you know fantasy
[22:44.120 --> 22:53.120]  journalism but rooted in in and supported in fact that that if if we put
[22:53.120 --> 22:58.400]  this out that it would generate enough attention and enough pressure that you
[22:58.400 --> 23:04.640]  know on on the Obama administration that that they perhaps would be forced into
[23:04.640 --> 23:12.680]  giving me this time but as we all know we are a few months later and nothing of
[23:12.680 --> 23:17.960]  the sort occurred in fact what was really interesting and I think it it it
[23:17.960 --> 23:25.440]  really showed their hand is is how they they they refused to acknowledge this
[23:25.440 --> 23:30.840]  this document other than you know with Fox News and a few others just radically
[23:30.840 --> 23:36.600]  blatant hit pieces on me and and not the facts and not the document and so I
[23:36.600 --> 23:40.680]  think that was really telling that they just went back to their old their old
[23:40.680 --> 23:44.600]  bag of dirty tricks and you know attack the man and and didn't deal with the
[23:44.600 --> 23:50.240]  message you know well Larry King I'm a little bit of inside baseball he wanted
[23:50.240 --> 23:55.960]  to interview you but then couldn't find anyone to debate you and the same thing
[23:55.960 --> 24:00.720]  happened over and over again they wanted to have one-sided events where
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.600]  they would bash you and you couldn't respond or whether they're gonna have two
[24:04.600 --> 24:10.560]  people gang up on you and you against them and so it never happened the the
[24:10.560 --> 24:16.000]  debates never happened because they wanted to have a rigged fight well
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.080]  yeah it was definitely a fixed fight and and and also you know you and I had
[24:20.080 --> 24:25.360]  discussed this and and looked at the emails and in our combined experience we
[24:25.360 --> 24:32.000]  both felt that it was that it was just a you know a minefield and a you know our
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.480]  or a bear trap that that we'd be walking into even though they presented it as
[24:37.480 --> 24:41.040]  though it would be a fair and balanced debate with both sides getting equal
[24:41.040 --> 24:45.760]  time and blah blah blah but I think we both knew that that it was just an
[24:45.760 --> 24:51.280]  ambush you know absolutely I mean you were contacted by so much media that
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.000]  wanted to have one-sided interviews or debates or have you taped and then have
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.920]  somebody else live to counter you that I didn't even contact you about the CBC
[24:58.920 --> 25:03.360]  the Fifth of State wanted to interview you and then they actually released the
[25:03.360 --> 25:07.520]  interview live on CBC in Canada last week and it's actually not just a fair
[25:07.520 --> 25:12.000]  piece it admits that they contacted the FBI this is the first time mainstream
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.400]  media has reported on this and Ted Olson Barbara Olson's husband from flight
[25:16.400 --> 25:22.720]  77 they admitted on CBC that the FBI told them that yeah she didn't make these
[25:22.720 --> 25:27.280]  phone calls she never talked to him it's all a lie so that is a big deal and
[25:27.280 --> 25:30.600]  that's something that came out of this because Fifth of State originally
[25:30.600 --> 25:36.280]  started doing this report just on the issue of Charlie Sheen going public but
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.440]  then you never talked to him because I never told you about the contact and
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.440]  and and so now the truth actually came out that's a big deal oh it's a huge
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.000]  deal and I think that story even broke correctly if I'm wrong I think it was
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.960]  like February of 07 when the FBI first admitted that yes and that's actually
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.600]  one of the 20 bullet points in 20 minutes with the president and I just think
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.680]  that that that that is the mother of all lie that is the one that says wait a
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.160]  minute folks wait a minute if if that call didn't go through if they
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.560]  completely lied about that then how do we explain all the other phone calls
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.480]  how do we explain all the phone calls and and and especially the one that
[26:15.480 --> 26:21.920]  that that gave us our battle cry let's roll you know well of course I mean first
[26:21.920 --> 26:24.960]  they said oh all these phone calls got made and they said they weren't from
[26:24.960 --> 26:31.360]  air phones and at 20,000 30,000 33,000 feet they're making calls phones in 2009
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.480]  don't work from that altitude it's fake and mothers were interviewed saying
[26:35.480 --> 26:39.600]  their son would say it's me you believe me don't you and that would be one way
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.360]  conversations with the few phone calls and now the Barbara Olson call is fake I
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.620]  mean that's just one of thousands of smoking guns I mean how much trouble did
[26:48.620 --> 26:51.760]  we have at your house doing the research writing 20 minutes with the
[26:51.760 --> 26:55.120]  president over those two or three weekends I spent with you Charlie some
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.720]  days 14 15 hours a day you know going back over the research right just trying
[26:59.720 --> 27:05.000]  to boil it down to 20 points it's an it's a orgy of evidence oh yeah no but I
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.080]  think we did a really good job if I can say so myself of picking out the 20
[27:11.080 --> 27:18.640]  that that that were really really just completely bulletproof you know I think
[27:18.640 --> 27:22.080]  the ones that we put in there I think that's why mainstream media had such a
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.080]  problem with it because they looked at it they went oh crap now what now what
[27:27.080 --> 27:31.480]  oh let's just you know let's just accuse him of all that crappy did 20 years ago
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.520]  you know real or imagined and we'll just tear him apart and dismiss this thing
[27:36.520 --> 27:42.880]  and it'll go away you know but but with the contest excuse me which we're gonna
[27:42.880 --> 27:53.280]  talk about it it's given it a second and a and a third wave of life into the you
[27:53.280 --> 27:59.120]  know with YouTube and other media outlets you know and I think it's really
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.680]  important because those videos are going to exist and and be available just like
[28:04.680 --> 28:09.840]  the document will for for years to come you know and and and will continue to
[28:09.840 --> 28:16.880]  fuel debate and hopefully wake people up and you know at some point bring us
[28:16.880 --> 28:22.240]  closer to the truth well said my friend we're gonna go to break we're gonna come
[28:22.240 --> 28:27.440]  back with the winner of 20 minutes with the president.com contest the winner is

[34:07.800 --> 34:14.240]  Alex all right crystal Garcia is the winner tomorrow tomorrow I'm gonna
[34:14.240 --> 34:18.080]  announce second third place myself because I judge those is video 20 minutes
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.240]  for the president it's linked up on info wars dot com charlie we're bringing him
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.000]  up but why did you choose watching that hundred and fifty plus videos one of the
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.920]  first that came in you watched them all why did you choose 20 minutes of the
[34:30.920 --> 34:36.280]  president by crystal Garcia it was just it was so obvious Alex that that was the
[34:36.280 --> 34:41.280]  one to beat and so the fact that it showed up early it it it it gave us
[34:41.280 --> 34:49.440]  something to give us a phenomenal piece to to to gauge the others against or to
[34:49.440 --> 34:54.360]  judge the others against and there was nothing that there was nothing that that
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.840]  that could unseat it as as the front runner and it just it just sat on top
[34:59.840 --> 35:05.480]  and and you know I I I tip my hat to all the other entries and all the other
[35:05.480 --> 35:11.440]  interpretations and and and the and the effort and the heart and the passion that
[35:11.440 --> 35:16.560]  went into all those other creations and I'm I'm I'm so deeply flattered that
[35:16.560 --> 35:23.920]  that people took that much time that much energy to create these videos but
[35:23.920 --> 35:32.360]  crystal is just sent there as as a as a as a as a short film as a mini you know
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.360]  fantasy documentary that just was just head and shoulders above everything else
[35:37.360 --> 35:41.440]  and it really told the story and it boiled down the facts and it was intense
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.680]  and it was it was well produced it was both shot it was well acted it was just
[35:45.680 --> 35:51.560]  there was something about it that was just wow this guy really cares really
[35:51.560 --> 35:57.120]  done his research and and he is clearly the winner let's bring up crystal Garcia
[35:57.120 --> 36:01.480]  right now crystal I mean did you know you were gonna win you introduced it so
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.520]  early how did you get the jump on everybody how did you I mean who are
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.840]  these great actors well that's a that's a few important questions the first thing
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.840]  I'd like to say is I followed the story from the minute that it dropped I went
[36:15.840 --> 36:19.240]  to my wife actually and said oh my god Charlie got to sit down with Obama and
[36:19.240 --> 36:23.280]  then when I heard a week later there was gonna be a film contest I knew I was
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.080]  going to to enter into the fray I knew that immediately and you know I have to
[36:29.080 --> 36:33.880]  say that I might not do well I wouldn't be here right now if I hadn't seen
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.240]  platoon and Wall Street I was heavily influenced by those films when I was
[36:38.240 --> 36:43.200]  younger off and then when I got handed terror storm that woke me up to
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.440]  everything around me and so today I'm standing on the shoulders of you two
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.080]  giants and thrilled to be here and but from the first moment I knew that this
[36:52.080 --> 36:56.440]  was gonna be a contest I knew I was gonna enter it I didn't wasn't worried
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.640]  about winning as much as participating because I feel that everybody has to get
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.360]  this word out exactly and I was so passionate about it I just happened to
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.880]  be I mean I was working on it all day every day until it was finished and I
[37:09.880 --> 37:14.000]  uploaded it very quickly and I just ready to send it out to the world because
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.120]  I figured the sooner the better well I like your attitude because everybody
[37:18.120 --> 37:22.840]  that made a film they contributed to getting the truth out about 9-11 and
[37:22.840 --> 37:26.800]  all these serious questions everyone's a winner I think you won not just because
[37:26.800 --> 37:30.440]  you have the talent but because you had the right spirit Charlie oh yeah I
[37:30.440 --> 37:35.760]  would I would totally support that yeah and and and and crystal maybe you could
[37:35.760 --> 37:41.400]  talk a little bit just about how you interpreted the document into the
[37:41.400 --> 37:46.840]  visual presentation that that that you created what was it that because I asked
[37:46.840 --> 37:50.800]  you during the break did you film all the dialogue and then edit it down or
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.560]  did you you know edit the document and then film that well it was it was a
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.600]  two-fold process the first thing was I didn't want it to feel too stagey I
[38:01.600 --> 38:05.720]  wanted to work more as a film so I felt I needed to trim some of it which sort of
[38:05.720 --> 38:10.000]  broke my heart because I felt that I needed to make a film that would really
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.360]  appeal to the novice of 9-11 rather than our expert viewpoint because we're so
[38:15.360 --> 38:19.280]  familiar with all the points that it just becomes second nature that you you
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.280]  know what what the truth is but for someone who doesn't know anything I
[38:23.280 --> 38:28.440]  wanted to really crystallize it down you know to just those few the fewest
[38:28.440 --> 38:31.320]  things I could that would stick in people's mind where they really had to
[38:31.320 --> 38:36.640]  you know address those points and and many people have told me that you know
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.320]  it's a very powerful piece because of the way I condensed it now well after I
[38:40.320 --> 38:43.920]  shot all the footage I still did a little bit of trimming but I did most of
[38:43.920 --> 38:48.800]  the adaptation with the two main stars Marcio Catalano and Greg Reed who were
[38:48.800 --> 38:55.680]  just fantastic yeah yeah they were for sure yeah well well and did they
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.600]  memorize everything were they were they using cue cards because the dialogue
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.240]  gun you know it's it's it's pretty dense in certain points or is he just
[39:03.240 --> 39:08.000]  referencing as though he's holding the notes like I was in the document well it
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.280]  was a combination there's a lot of complex dialogue so actually in the
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.400]  folders they held the script I got you that's that's I was picking off all my
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.920]  cutaways of them fumbling with the with the folders and all those nice little
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.440]  close-ups that I did as cutaways I shot the whole piece in one afternoon and
[39:27.440 --> 39:31.040]  four and a half hours from beginning to end did you really know yeah I had a
[39:31.040 --> 39:34.280]  really clear idea of exactly what I was going to do everything from the
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.600]  exterior scenes to the scenes with the National Security Advisor warning the
[39:38.600 --> 39:45.280]  aides not to talk about your arrival etc that was done from 3 p.m. to 7 30 in the
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.800]  evening well this this film looks like it has a bigger budget than the $14,000
[39:50.800 --> 39:55.240]  prize and I know Charlie and I privately spoke hopefully if you'd like put
[39:55.240 --> 40:00.600]  out on YouTube at your site Christo Garcia is the handle put out the extended
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.000]  director's cut I know I would certainly like to see that what about you Charlie
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.280]  absolutely a hundred percent yeah no I would I mean I would even like to see
[40:07.280 --> 40:11.720]  outtakes whatever it's just it's such an impressive piece that anything that
[40:11.720 --> 40:17.200]  that that went into it I'm terribly curious about you know I've got tons
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.080]  man I mean it broke my heart to even trim there was every little trim you
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.760]  know how the business is I mean it's like I just if it's not absolutely the
[40:25.760 --> 40:29.440]  most important thing you're listening to you've got to yank it I just really
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.280]  wanted to boil it down to something very powerful but yeah I've got I've got a
[40:34.280 --> 40:37.920]  lot more material I'd be happy to do something longer but again on YouTube I
[40:37.920 --> 40:43.080]  didn't want to do a two-part thing why do it exist as a one-clip piece that
[40:43.080 --> 40:50.200]  people could digest I think that was smart got you wow well well congratulations
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.760]  man I mean it's um you you you really you really found the spirit of the piece
[40:55.760 --> 41:02.720]  and and and translated that visually and dramatically that it it's just so
[41:02.720 --> 41:06.760]  impressive and I'm just so flattered that that's something that was just an
[41:06.760 --> 41:15.200]  idea you know turns into that it's I guess that's that's that's how we that's
[41:15.200 --> 41:19.840]  how we make change you know that's all it takes is an idea and then you hand it
[41:19.840 --> 41:23.680]  to someone else and now other people who have watched it perhaps they will take
[41:23.680 --> 41:27.440]  it even further along there's something there's something about the truth that
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.240]  it doesn't need to be supported like lies take support and effort and
[41:32.240 --> 41:37.840]  core you know complicated you know conspiracies etc but the truth exists on
[41:37.840 --> 41:42.160]  its own it doesn't need anything so all I was doing was just passing along with
[41:42.160 --> 41:48.080]  you gentlemen had handed to me earlier hmm got it got it well yeah it's like I
[41:48.080 --> 41:54.400]  said to Alex the the truth is unchanging you know the truth is a
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.240]  constant yeah the Greeks they considered it a divinity yes you know and you don't
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.080]  want to go up against the truth or you're fighting a losing battle exactly
[42:03.080 --> 42:08.800]  yeah well gentlemen I'm gonna talk to you guys behind the scenes during this
[42:08.800 --> 42:12.240]  break I know you're both busy but time has run out on us we'll see if I can
[42:12.240 --> 42:16.000]  bring you both back to say bye on the other side in a few final comments from

[47:53.800 --> 47:59.280]  privately you discuss integrity at the end of the day is all that matters and
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.360]  I know there's 20 minutes with the president is really feeling good right
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.800]  now doing the right thing oh absolutely Alex absolutely and and and and the
[48:07.800 --> 48:12.880]  response to it regardless of you know how you know the mainstream media dealt
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.480]  with it if you if you read the blogs and the postings and everything else you
[48:18.480 --> 48:24.160]  can see that that that it really it it really struck something with the people
[48:24.160 --> 48:29.120]  it really struck something it really you know reignited the truth movement on
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.360]  some level it it just you know even you know people on the street would come up
[48:34.360 --> 48:37.680]  to me randomly and say you know I didn't believe any of that crap until I read
[48:37.680 --> 48:41.320]  your piece and I went oh wait a minute that's a lot of that stuff is hard to
[48:41.320 --> 48:46.360]  debate or or disassemble and it's wow man you really you've really opened my
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.240]  eyes and I'm gonna start spreading the word and it's like you know it's like I
[48:50.240 --> 48:54.360]  told you at the beginning of this thing if we can if we can you know change one
[48:54.360 --> 48:58.840]  person's view and then they tell one person and so on that's how any movement
[48:58.840 --> 49:03.200]  begins and so you know I don't look at this as you know 20 minutes with the
[49:03.200 --> 49:06.440]  president is any kind of a failure because we didn't wind up on Larry King
[49:06.440 --> 49:12.560]  live or you know GMA or whatever you know I look at it as a as a real victory
[49:12.560 --> 49:19.920]  and as a as a real hope that that that people are you know ready to embrace the
[49:19.920 --> 49:24.240]  truth well it was a total success but every time we got the emails or you got
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.880]  them and you were sending them to me it was we want to interview you for the news
[49:28.880 --> 49:33.720]  and you knew they could cut all that up when you wanted a 50-50 live debate they
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.120]  would not give it to you because they wanted to be able to manipulate and
[49:38.120 --> 49:43.520]  play with what you were saying of course of course it's it's it's what they do
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.640]  it's how they do it it's what they do all day every day and then you know it's
[49:47.640 --> 49:56.440]  you know as long as they've got them as their as their mouthpiece then you know
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.080]  I don't want to say we're stuck in an uphill struggle but but we've got our
[50:00.080 --> 50:05.520]  work cut out for us people you know there's no question about that at the
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.480]  same time the the mainstream controlled corporate press is not going to tell us
[50:10.480 --> 50:13.920]  how much success we've had Charlie you talk about people on the street coming
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.000]  up to you I've been with you when you know people come up and they bring up
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.720]  9-11 truth and thank you for what you've done but I'm just a little Alex Jones
[50:21.720 --> 50:25.920]  with a radio show and a and and documentary films I make my cousin was
[50:25.920 --> 50:29.680]  visiting from Chicago it was my dad's birthday so we were getting food for the
[50:29.680 --> 50:36.040]  party and you know buying a late gift and literally in Austin every person we
[50:36.040 --> 50:41.040]  walked into every person in a parking lot all the people at the gas station the
[50:41.040 --> 50:47.040]  guy behind the counter everyone I mean he was like a hallucination or something
[50:47.040 --> 50:51.040]  I couldn't believe it everyone was serious and focused and saying
[50:51.040 --> 50:56.400]  revolutions in the air the truth is you know there we're standing up you know
[50:56.400 --> 51:00.080]  one guy mentioned Charlie sheen 20 minutes with the president there is an
[51:00.080 --> 51:04.800]  explosive awakening happening and we're just little ripples on the surface
[51:04.800 --> 51:09.280]  hmm wow that's so exciting to hear and it's it you know if it's if it's
[51:09.280 --> 51:13.440]  happening on on on that level hopefully it's it's it's happening
[51:13.440 --> 51:20.800]  domestically and and and globally you know well it was your courage three
[51:20.800 --> 51:24.840]  and a half years ago going public for 9-11 truth that I clearly have tracked
[51:24.840 --> 51:31.240]  and chronicled as as a trigger point because people really resonated with
[51:31.240 --> 51:35.360]  the courage they knew you're intensely private and and I'm not trying to sit
[51:35.360 --> 51:41.480]  here and you know he platted you you're worshipful support on you but we do need
[51:41.480 --> 51:45.640]  to start respecting and appreciating courage again Charlie why did you go
[51:45.640 --> 51:49.480]  public for 9-11 truth and we know you questioned the official story but why
[51:49.480 --> 51:54.240]  did you take the plunge when so many other A-listers I've talked to know the
[51:54.240 --> 51:59.800]  truth but are scared I couldn't I couldn't sit back and and and pretend like
[51:59.800 --> 52:04.640]  everything was okay and it and it and it didn't matter it was because I was
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.800]  looking at at at how the state of the world was developing and how these evil
[52:09.800 --> 52:16.920]  bastards were ruining the entire planet and and all of humanity with their
[52:16.920 --> 52:22.840]  with their evil agenda and I just I I couldn't sit back and you know I think
[52:22.840 --> 52:28.160]  we spoke about this before I first came out on the one-year anniversary of the
[52:28.160 --> 52:33.600]  war and so it wasn't just a random day you know it was a very specific time to
[52:33.600 --> 52:37.320]  remind people hey wait a minute wait a minute let's let's take a look back
[52:37.320 --> 52:41.880]  let's look at the reason we're there and you know and and and the reason we
[52:41.880 --> 52:48.800]  have plans to to continue through the entire region you know so yeah so it was
[52:48.800 --> 52:54.160]  just one of those things where I just I couldn't not do something I had to I
[52:54.160 --> 53:00.440]  had to come forward you know well we appreciate it and it's another example
[53:00.440 --> 53:05.760]  of standing up doing the right thing in the end having a huge effect
[53:05.760 --> 53:09.440]  Christo you were trying to say something when I interrupted you I was just
[53:09.440 --> 53:14.000]  gonna say that the Patriots is to encourage a YouTube gentleman have
[53:14.000 --> 53:20.560]  shown inspired me to then begin making my own videos and that's how movements
[53:20.560 --> 53:25.920]  grow and it's just crucial that just one person will stand up and say hold on a
[53:25.920 --> 53:29.960]  second that's not the truth and I'm gonna stand up for the truth and then
[53:29.960 --> 53:34.680]  you see that all the dominoes start to fall in the other direction yes of
[53:34.680 --> 53:41.840]  course and also Christo we cannot wait you know we can't wait 50 years like we
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.200]  had to with Pearl Harbor you know we can't wait 30 years like we had to with
[53:46.200 --> 53:50.560]  Gulf of Tonkin we can't wait you know 40 years like we had to with JFK we just
[53:50.560 --> 53:57.200]  can't wait because it's like you know the late great Aaron Russo so eloquently
[53:57.200 --> 54:03.320]  said you know in in in his final interview documentary with Alex you know
[54:03.320 --> 54:09.800]  until we understand 9-11 we cannot move forward and that was such a powerful
[54:09.800 --> 54:15.000]  message that that that he was able to leave behind you know it's so it's so
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.360]  true the time is now for action and one of my favorite Alex Jones quotes is if
[54:20.360 --> 54:24.840]  you want to rush why don't you try fighting tyranny hmm yeah there you go
[54:24.840 --> 54:29.840]  because it gets me up every day now oh yeah yeah and there's always there's
[54:29.840 --> 54:34.800]  always a fight to be had when you're when you're carrying that torch you know
[54:34.800 --> 54:39.520]  well Charlie you are a chip off the old block your dad is such a great guy and
[54:39.520 --> 54:44.680]  so informed and the times I've got to hang out with him just another amazing
[54:44.680 --> 54:48.600]  individual I know your father and mother and brother and other family are very
[54:48.600 --> 54:51.680]  proud of the work you've done with 20 minutes with the president yeah no no
[54:51.680 --> 54:54.800]  they were they were thrilled they were they were concerned for me and my
[54:54.800 --> 55:00.480]  family safety and all of that you know most of that stuff just happened in the
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.000]  movies but yeah no and and they were really proud and they were really
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.520]  supportive I still think Alex we should have videoed the night that my dad and
[55:11.520 --> 55:15.120]  I read it together to make sure that the final draft was was ready to be
[55:15.120 --> 55:19.360]  published I know sitting there watching you and your father him playing the part
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.960]  of the president which he's so good at you playing the part of Charlie she and
[55:22.960 --> 55:27.880]  yourself watching them sitting around that table outside under the Los Angeles
[55:27.880 --> 55:33.760]  stars was just amazing and I do wish who knows down the road maybe we can set up
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.480]  a camera and get your dad to read 20 minutes with the president with you why
[55:37.480 --> 55:44.240]  not why not I mean you know it he's so supportive of the entire movement he's
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.800]  not as public as I am about it but he has you know he has gone on the record
[55:48.800 --> 55:54.440]  and I I saw a video of him with building seven yes absolutely he said he didn't
[55:54.440 --> 55:57.360]  want to believe any of it until he looked at that and he went wait a minute
[55:57.360 --> 56:02.760]  that just doesn't add up you know and I said well dad here's about 500 other
[56:02.760 --> 56:09.440]  examples but don't add up you know well gentlemen gentlemen closing comments as
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.640]  we end this hour crystal well first of all I'd like to thank you gentlemen for

[56:20.880 --> 56:25.800]  honor and Alex if you want me to make a docudrama about your life I think that
[56:25.800 --> 56:31.840]  all American Patriots need to be brought into the mainstream as stars I think we
[56:31.840 --> 56:36.800]  need more visibility for you for Ron Paul and for other characters that are
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.960]  willing to step up and tell the truth well I'm flattered because we haven't
[56:40.960 --> 56:46.240]  really mentioned that Christos made TV shows with P Diddy and Victoria Gotti
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.920]  and others so you're I mean you're a big guy in TV yourself obviously why you
[56:51.920 --> 56:55.520]  won but everybody was open for the contest but thank you Charlie 30 seconds

[1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:30.040]  aware of it was a revelation that the White House had no intention of making
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:34.760]  public president bush was told in august that Osama bin Laden might be planning
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:38.280]  an attack involving the hijack could have predicted nobody our government
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:47.560]  we are august 6 PDT the title was bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States 70% of family members
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:52.280]  questions were never answered during the 9-11 commissioner
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:55.560]  said they were set up to fail I mean I remember the commission it's a scam it's
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:02.720]  absolutely disgusting the questions mr. president the questions
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:08.520]  building seven a blaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:13.320]  building seven three phone collapse well no there's number seven coming down the
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:18.400]  excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.600]  and they wired very carefully for days and it's a very careful operation third
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:26.880]  time today it's reminiscent of those pictures revolting too much on television
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:31.160]  before a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:37.480]  market now this must do is pull it and they made that decision to pull that we
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:42.200]  watch the building collapse Jane what more can you tell us about the Salomon
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:46.240]  brothers building and its collapse well only really what you already know details
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:49.640]  of very very sketchy you're getting information now that one of the other
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:54.840]  buildings building seven in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:02:05.440]  either collapsed or is collapsing my close-up inspection there's no evidence
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:10.720]  of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon the only site is the actual
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:15.240]  side of the building that's crashed in and as I said the only pieces left that
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:19.440]  you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand there are no
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:24.160]  large tail sections wing sections a fuselage nothing like that anywhere
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:28.320]  around which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:36.120]  the Pentagon fire fighters and police describing explosions a lot of them
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:40.320]  secondary explosion we've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.060]  all my thoughts that I'm popping out it was like was it from if they had
[1:02:44.060 --> 1:02:47.920]  detonated yeah they were planned to take down a building boom boom boom boom boom
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:51.200]  looks sort of like the building just demolished even if there was no
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:55.160]  secondary explosives in the building like gunfire you know bang bang bang bang bang
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:59.440]  and then and then all of a sudden three big explosions do you know if it was an
[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.280]  explosion if it was a building collapse to me it sounded like it to me it sounded
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:10.520]  like an explosion chief Albert Turry told me that he tried to get his men out
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:14.240]  as quickly as he could but he said that there was another explosion which took
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:19.880]  place and then an hour after there was a another explosion in one of the towers
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:22.200]  here
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:28.040]  Sebel Edmonds FBI translator breaking her gag order
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:34.360]  all our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban we did carry very
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:39.280]  intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:44.000]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawa Pendi for kidney
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.680]  dialysis treatment the military had him surrounded they were saying that Osama
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:51.920]  Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:57.880]  nor had standing down where were the planes
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:03.240]  on now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11 a mysterious
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:06.960]  plane was seen flying right over the president's residence the e4b is over
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:11.560]  New York and Washington otherwise known as the Tuesday planes has never been

[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:27.600]  made what happened during that call this is the only information we have on
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:34.360]  these terrorists she was able to call him twice how she could pull that off we
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:39.720]  don't know what she did these are the questions mr. president these are the

[1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:30.200]  establishment but one of the biggest and most important magazines in the country
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:35.440]  is coming here Thursday to interview me for a cover story and I'm not going to

[1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:26.840]  responsibility I am completely humbled by it I never expected this to happen my
[1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.080]  cousin Buckley Hammond who actually worked on a couple of my early films
[1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:35.600]  masters of terror and road to tyranny I hadn't seen him in five years comes back
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:42.440]  and it was my dad's birthday dad for Thanksgiving and I said I got to get my
[1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:45.440]  dad a present we got to pick dinner up at my house we're having a party for him

[1:07:52.600 --> 1:07:56.720]  watch and I went to a gas station to get gas and I went to Rudy's to get
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:08:02.440]  barbecue and everywhere I went the people behind the counter the people in
[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:09.240]  line the people in the Valero gas station parking lot the people in the

[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:18.560]  not what it's about it actually has a lot of minuses the issue is if I'm a gauge
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:26.720]  of how awake people are and info wars.com is the number one alternative
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:32.360]  news site in the world what's number two present planet.com if we're number one
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:39.400]  in radio listeners and we're on AM and FM and growing if mainline stations are
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:43.920]  now beginning to pick us up big stations in big cities not just mom and pops who
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:50.200]  we love this is quite a responsibility but I just want to give you the message
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:57.480]  here that we're changing the world by we you the listeners of this radio
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:02.840]  transmission you are the reason we're having such a big effect I mean I had
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:11.280]  Lord Moncton Viscount of Moncton and Brentially on who you a big British
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:15.160]  royal saying world governments here tyrannical world government we must
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:19.640]  defeat them off air I'm talking to him he says we need to work together against
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.040]  the global government against the bankers and against the Maurice Strong and
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:28.520]  against the eugenicists on air he's saying it you know I've got a TV show
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:34.400]  that I've consulted on a part of coming out on true TV which is actually slanted
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:42.320]  towards us not just fair I mean it is crazy but it's common sense people
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.360]  within the establishment who aren't elitist aren't globalist but are part of
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:53.880]  the system they're upset with what's happening because for 14 years I have
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:58.040]  fought the New World Order I have read their own documents on air I have
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:02.960]  exposed them I have told the truth because I wanted justice I never expected
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:10.880]  this to happen and now as everything we talked about came true because I was
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:15.120]  reading the TV guide I was reading the New World Order's own documents it's
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:18.080]  like I tell my wife what's coming on at nine o'clock at night on TV she doesn't
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.040]  think I'm a genius when it comes on you know I tell her Monday night football is
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:26.480]  coming on at seven honey she doesn't flip out when it comes on at seven I was
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:31.200]  only going off their own documents I was doing what anybody else could do I'm
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:35.760]  not special the truth is special you are special and I just want to give you a
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:40.600]  pep talk here I told you last Sunday when it was almost nowhere in the mainstream
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:47.040]  media that climategate these government documents admitting the earth is cooling
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:50.960]  and that the globalists are in deep trouble and that people are finding out
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:57.920]  about their fraud I knew that was going to be big and it is it's huge and the
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:03.680]  last illusion that the establishment has is that patriots and libertarians and
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:09.920]  freedom lovers and truth seekers and justice seekers are the minority we are
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:16.040]  the majority so the illusion has fallen that there's not a world government now
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:22.640]  it's admitted there's a world government the illusion has fallen that the UN is
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:26.640]  in a criminal organization it is the illusion has fallen that governments
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:30.680]  stage terror attacks it's now declassified in many fronts over 200
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:36.880]  declassified cases both of Tonkin one of the most well-known we are now the
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.480]  mainstream we have caused a revolution you the listeners of this show more than
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:45.080]  anybody else we are the big kahuna here but it's not Alex Jones it's all of us
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:50.560]  together that's why last week I never popped champagne on air the audit the
[1:12:50.560 --> 1:12:55.440]  Fed bill went out a committee they got 311 votes to audit the Fed Bernanke's
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:13:01.320]  admitted you audit it you will abolish it and we got the climategate emails and
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:04.920]  internal documents admitting global warming is all a fraud it's all a scam
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:11.880]  that's why I said get me champagne we need to signify that this is a massive
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:16.280]  victory and if they blow my head off we're still winning listen there's
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:19.840]  nothing they can do that's the only reason they haven't killed good old Alex
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:24.280]  Jones is because they would only underline and highlight everything I've
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:31.680]  said and done so I want to salute Charlie Sheen that guy what you hear about
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:35.280]  him in the media is a complete distortion he works out every day he
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:39.200]  drinks coffee he's true to his wife and his children and is a hard-working great
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:43.480]  intelligent guy who does nothing but study government documents I wish I
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:46.520]  could get him to go public about the hundreds of other subjects he's an
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:52.720]  expert on I wish and who knows he may do that the future but he decides what
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:56.880]  he's going to do I never pushed him to do any of this and that's what's pure
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.880]  about it is I don't push you to stand up or speak out or warn your neighbors and
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:05.880]  friends and family you go with your gut you do what's right that is all that
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:10.440]  matters but to be able to interface with people like Chris Garcia who made 20
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:14.600]  months with the president the film to be able to work with all these people to
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:19.800]  be able to talk to all these people of courage and honor and true quality is
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:25.240]  one of the greatest distinct pleasures of my life it eclipses everything but
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:29.960]  the birth of my children my children come first but the truth comes second but
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:34.320]  my children get their future assured because of the truth and what their
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:39.520]  daddy does so it all goes together the truth is my child it is your child we
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:43.560]  must protect it we must love it we must promote it we must stand for it no
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:46.840]  matter what our neighbors and friends and family say I'll say this before we go
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:52.920]  to break come back with climategate and some other news my radio show on AM and
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:58.320]  FM it's much bigger now on internet and web and you know total it's probably five
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:02.920]  six seven times bigger than it was eight and a half years ago but my radio show
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:08.440]  when it was anti Bill Clinton it got syndicated in 1998 it was on over 90
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:13.400]  radio stations I was going to be the next big thing syndicated across the
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:19.960]  country my total victory personally was assured and when 9-11 happened I
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:25.160]  predicted it was going to happen I went on air I exposed it and more than 50
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:29.800]  percent more like two-thirds right at two-thirds of the radio stations I was
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:36.680]  on in Chicago and New York and Los Angeles turned me off they called they
[1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:40.960]  said shut up about 9-11 been inside job you're off the air but I didn't shut up
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:45.440]  because the truth came first and there are very few people who in the face of
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:52.760]  monetary and career suicide would say no to fraud or the truth I told the truth
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:57.840]  and this radio show is many times more successful now than ever would have been
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:02.240]  that's a message to you tell the truth the illusion created by the power elite
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:06.800]  is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will you continue to be

[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:13.200]  that I can randomly say hey sounds like muse this rock band our listeners let's

[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:37.160]  reached so many people now that it's just unbelievable I mean we're kicking
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:42.680]  the hind end of the global criminals you need to discover how much power you've
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:51.360]  got and how ready people are to wake up now ready to wake up today ready to hear
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:58.360]  the truth now is the time Copenhagen Treaty Obama's always a liar just like
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:02.760]  Schwarzenegger said he wouldn't sign that bill making you register to buy ammo and
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:06.040]  he signed it a week later I told you he would Obama said a month ago he wouldn't
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:10.160]  go into Copenhagen so he wouldn't get a big protest for him then he lied and
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:14.600]  said oh now I'm going I told you Obama was going just like I told you they
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.440]  they lied and said they wouldn't pass the government takeover of health care
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:20.440]  in the house they passed it they said they wouldn't pass oh don't worry we're
[1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:24.520]  not going to pass the global carbon tax bill out of the house they passed it now
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:28.920]  it's probably going to pass the Senate they do that as a military tactic to
[1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:34.000]  tell you that you're winning so you'll stand down I'm telling you we're winning
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.520]  but we've got to get involved 10 times more and redouble our efforts to ensure
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:43.320]  we defeat these people you know I thought this week about playing von
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:46.880]  Rompey the new head of the EU and all these other global leaders ban Kai
[1:22:46.880 --> 1:22:50.320]  moon of the UN calling for global government but what's the point you've
[1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:53.480]  seen the front page of your paper called for world government new world order
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:57.920]  every paper I know of has been repeating it every week the last six months
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:02.840]  again they denied all this existed so they could build it now they're admitting
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:06.040]  they've built it but saying it's for your own good it's blowing up in their
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:12.080]  face because of all their previous lies very exciting things are happening
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:18.800]  right now now on the subject of climate gated you don't know what it is Webster
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:22.240]  Tarbley is going to break it down for you in the next 30 minutes after this
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:28.880]  quick break but climate gate is again covered my film fall a republic even
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:32.240]  though this film came out three weeks before climate gate I exposed their
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:36.080]  fake science how it's a carbon tax the private banks how the banks want to
[1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:41.000]  destroy industrial societies morey Strong's own quotes and now here is the
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:45.400]  London Telegraph climate change this is the worst scientific scandal of our
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:51.400]  generation and it says our hopelessly compromised scientific establishment
[1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:56.720]  cannot be allowed to get away with the climate whitewash Lord Moncton shut down
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:06.000]  the UN arrest Al Gore Lord Moncton former science adviser to Mrs. Thatcher
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:11.400]  anti-climate cult crusader calls for world to rise up against communistic
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:16.680]  killers behind global warming fraud he said on air he quoted eco science
[1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:19.800]  Friday that he's read I said what do you know about eco science oh they're
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:24.120]  planned to exterminate the population I mean he's not the weirdo reporting that
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:28.680]  the weirdos is the White House science are that wrote it you I mean folks we're
[1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:34.400]  living in the middle of a science fiction movie this is so crazy what's going on
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:40.640]  climate gate surpasses global warming on Google as the top search term of the
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:47.960]  last week number one search term climate gate the truth is getting out the
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:57.760]  BBC refused to report on this refused to report on this until yesterday and they
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:03.400]  decided to report on the investigation into who leaked the emails from the UN
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:11.440]  climate research facility in Cambria in England for your request and suits have
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:15.320]  been filed for more than a decade to get this info these people are heroes
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:19.600]  taxpayer money paid for this but I wanted to cover another subject now before
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:23.000]  we go to break on the climate gate situation you have that clip about
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:30.200]  Dutch roll shell calls for global carbon tax I keep getting emails and calls
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:36.120]  and I see these disinformation articles written saying Alex Jones must work for
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:41.400]  the oil companies ladies and gentlemen I work for the truth I tell the truth no
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:45.640]  matter what is going on we know the earth has a warming and cooling cycle we
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:49.040]  know the sun drives almost all of it we know the sun was heating now it's
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:55.680]  cooling we know that Mars had shrinking ice caps now it has growing ice caps
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:00.280]  your SUV isn't making Mars get hotter moons of Saturn and Jupiter same thing
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:04.600]  but I keep getting calls saying you work for Exxon mobile and Shell really have
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:08.800]  you seen the magazines half the ads in them if they're not drug ads are by Exxon
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:14.320]  mobile Shell and others calling for global carbon taxes here's Guardian Exxon
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:22.400]  chief backs carbon tax Saturday January 10th 2009 give me a close shot for
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:28.160]  prisonplanet.tv viewers here's Bloomberg Shell calls for global expansion of
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:35.320]  cap and trade co2 programs and I've got others New York Times Shell cap and
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:41.320]  trade is a good thing the oil companies wrote this let's play a TV ad by Dutch
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:46.000]  Royal Shell for it the oil companies wrote this to shut down the coal
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:53.600]  companies here it is working for a new energy future climate change energy and
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:58.400]  economic recovery are a hugely complex issue and it will take more than
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:02.720]  governments alone to solve the problem industry needs to provide expertise
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:08.240]  and government needs to step up with solid regulatory frameworks that signal
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:14.960]  where we need to invest to provide good solutions Shell encouraging dialogue on
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:20.200]  the energy challenge you know these morons call me and email me and spam the
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:26.000]  web saying Alex Jones is working for the insurance companies he's against the
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.280]  government takeover of health care I can watch C-span and watch the head lobby as
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:35.760]  the spokesman for the insurance companies for health care saying they wrote
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.880]  the bill and saying if it doesn't have big enough penalties for people that
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:44.200]  don't get insurance that they're going to be against the bill that's why there's
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:51.320]  a $5,000 penalty and five years in jail they take 5,000 out of your own average
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:56.840]  five years in jail quarter million dollar fine read the bill they wrote it
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:01.800]  the oil companies are owned by the big banks and insurance companies they
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:07.840]  create the money they want to shut down coal that's not a monopoly 51% of our
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.880]  power in the West more than that in Europe comes from coal if they shut
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:19.000]  coal down then they've got to run it off normal oil folks again everything you've
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:23.920]  been told is backwards up is down down is up black as white white as black we

[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.880]  original weather stations gotten their data and it didn't match what the UN
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:29.000]  main climate branch at East Cambria was saying out of England that's the main
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:32.960]  science group that puts out all the propaganda and about a week and a half
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:37.120]  ago the emails got leaked on wiki leak with the documents and the computer
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:40.920]  code with computer programmer notes about this thing's a fraud it's getting
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:44.600]  colder here's how you manipulate the data to make it say it's getting hotter
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:48.920]  we have the internal emails by professor Jones the head of the UN program
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:53.120]  saying how do we hide the decline in temperatures how do we hide that carbon
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:59.280]  dioxide comes after warming we have the head of the UN ban Kaimoon Von Rompe
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:04.400]  the head of the EU saying global governance by this private group of
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.320]  banks this new carbon scheme will be a new derivatives to fund world
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:12.480]  government so I wanted to get Webster on to talk about this then before he
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.920]  leaves us the dollar plunging what happened in Dubai the global dollar

[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:26.920]  ounce cresting right now where all this is going I can't think of a better
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:33.520]  political mind who's been more spot-on this guy is a literal brainiac a
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:37.760]  Leonardo da Vinci type and we're always honored to have Webster Griffin
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.480]  Tarpleon with us Webster good to have you thank you Alex happy Thanksgiving I hope
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:47.920]  you had a good Thanksgiving there in DC now yeah again in Obama deception to
[1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:51.840]  follow the Republic you explain this is the greatest scientific fraud after the
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:56.880]  Nazis and the two tied together for those that don't know give us in five
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:03.400]  minutes of boil down of this global cult this carbon credit carbon tax cult and
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:10.240]  this latest climate-gate situation and how big this victory is well I think it's
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:15.200]  it's a turning point in the intellectual and political history of the world in
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:21.680]  this sense back in the 1920s and 1930s there was a consensus among large
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:26.120]  numbers of pseudo scientists quack academics and charlatans but many of
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:32.440]  them had university professorships that there was inferiority of the races that
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:36.840]  some races were inferior others were superior they tried to talk about you
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:40.720]  know phrenology measuring that the size of the brain and all sorts of other
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:45.800]  nonsense and they came up with this pseudo science which was widely
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:51.560]  considered to be legitimate at the time and remember I think this is the moment
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:56.840]  we've just had is it's like the 1936 Olympics in Berlin when Jesse Owens won
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:01.320]  all those gold medals and Hitler was sitting in the stands filming because it
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:06.440]  meant that his crazy theory had been completely defeated and the other the
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:11.560]  other black boxer also knocked out the German boxer yes it was the mach
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:16.200]  Schmeling was defeated by Joe Lewis I guess it was right so these this was bad
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:20.480]  for the for these racists and their in their crackpot race science theory so
[1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:25.920]  now what we have is absolutely conclusive evidence of a international
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:30.160]  conspiracy my god it's a conspiracy there's no doubt we have the proofs of a
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:35.240]  conspiracy these people are again their quack academics their charlatans their
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:39.240]  pseudo scientists a lot of them belong to this hooked up specialty called
[1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:45.000]  climatology which really did not exist until the 1990s and the coming of Al
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:49.880]  Gore you you got to remember Al Gore systematically purged the United States
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:53.920]  government of anybody who was not a quack anybody who stood up and said well
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:59.040]  your ozone story is is not holding water it's ridiculous and your your other
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:04.440]  acid rain and and then indeed this this ozone layer business and let's not
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:08.440]  forget you're going to get into this this whole eugenics movement that ran
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:14.160]  Hitler out of the Britain and US this is their progeny this whole global warming
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:19.840]  movement is a eugenical system so it's the same crew indeed and the goal of
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:24.760]  this stuff is is indeed genocide I've just seen a couple of interesting
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:29.600]  dispatches from the Chinese news agency Shinhua new China where they say
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:33.520]  there's a there's a hidden agenda in the attempts of rich western countries to
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.480]  impose carbon limits on the developing world and that is of course to strangle
[1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:41.440]  their development and that debate it basically comes down to this if you look
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:48.760]  at the US export price of wheat corn and a couple of other things but mainly wheat
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:54.240]  and corn that is what basically determines the level of the world market
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:58.360]  and the US of course has been able to produce these things very efficiently
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:03.920]  in past years if you ever got this monstrous cap and trade cap and tax bill
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:10.960]  that that congress the senator boxer has been pushing and and also a waxman
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:15.880]  over in his committee if that ever went through the minimum effect would be to
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:23.000]  double the export price of US wheat and corn into sub-saharan Africa on the wheat
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.160]  of South Asia and then all sorts of poor places in Latin America where they
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:32.960]  depend on US corn for the tortillas we know from the FAO food and agricultural
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:39.360]  organization in Rome that there are about a billion people in these places
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:43.200]  that I've just mentioned who are on the verge of starvation if you put through
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:48.440]  the cap and tax and you double the US export price at least as minimum you
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:53.920]  will kill several hundred million of that billion who are right now on the edge
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:00.560]  of starvation so this is ultra Hitlerian genocide dressed up as green
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:05.800]  ideology concerned for the polar bears concerned about ice caps and glaciers
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.560]  and by the way that's not your opinion morey strong of the UN states they want
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:14.960]  a neo-futilistic system to destroy industrial capacity and your historical
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:21.280]  doctorate is in the Venetians is this feudalistic model not basically a
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:25.600]  replay of your own studies well it's it's the men it's the mentality of the
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:29.080]  Venetians I mean it's ultimately it's the mentality of the Venetians in this
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:34.840]  sense back in the late 1200s and early 1300s the Venetians and the the
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:38.600]  Genoese and certain other banking centers were lending money to the crowned
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:43.320]  heads of Europe and they were imposing levels of interest usually that that
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:49.560]  forced the kings and the and the rulers to increase the tax burden the the take
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.600]  so to speak on the peasantry of Europe so that the peasants got less and less
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.840]  to eat and that meant that they were visited by malnutrition and all kinds
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:02.160]  of diseases that the company with that so that by the time the
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:06.840]  contagion arrived presumably from the far east of the black death they were
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:11.520]  no natural defenses left and the epidemic had free reign now that
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:15.640]  killed about a third of the population of Europe so we can see that these these
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:21.200]  ghouls these these monsters that are gathering in Copenhagen hope that they
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.560]  can do the same thing now just take a couple of things I think it's time to
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:30.320]  start demanding a special prosecutor if we ever needed a special prosecutor it's
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:35.000]  now and you can see of the people that participate in these emails we have
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:40.600]  people at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center so NASA Goddard is one place
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:45.240]  that's got to be investigated and again this is all the chief the three groups
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:49.400]  used by the UN for the core data that everyone else signs on to and agrees in
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.520]  their own emails admitting this is premeditated fraud and they know the
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.720]  earth is cooling that's in there they're talking about they want to fake the
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:02.800]  dates on emails they want to they use tactics of Joe McCarthy they want to
[1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:06.760]  destroy the reputations of scientists there's indeed one email where they
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:10.400]  threatened violence they say the next time I see him I'm gonna punch him in
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:13.360]  the nose and who knows what that means that might be serious and they talk
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:18.440]  about hiding the decline and blocking for your request for the raw data right
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:22.560]  and then they talk about also learned journals right the so-called peer
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:25.880]  reviewed journals if there's a peer-reviewed learned journal that
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:30.200]  publishes material that doesn't go along with this insane party line of these
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.880]  of these lunatics then they say we want to demote them so they'll no longer be
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:39.120]  considered a learned journal and we can go ahead so NASA Goddard has got to be
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:42.880]  there we'll go through the other criminals caught with their own emails
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:48.520]  and the computer code written into it fraud computer programmer notes this is
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.840]  fraudulent here's how you hide the decline we have them red-handed senator
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:56.280]  Inhofe's calling for criminal charges Lord mocked and many others we'll get

[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:17.520]  Broadcasting Network yet these problems can be overcome by a joint effort in
[1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:23.840]  our and between our countries 2009 is also the first year of global governance
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:28.640]  with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:33.880]  climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:42.280]  management of our planet well there is Herman von Rompe the new head of the
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:46.080]  dictatorial EU saying global government global governance the global
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:50.660]  management of the world built around the carbon tax a new Ponzi scheme for the
[1:47:50.660 --> 1:47:56.080]  bankers that control this whole system Webster Griffin Tarpley your comments on
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.400]  that and going through climategate emails I have to start by saying what a
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:07.240]  contemptible impotent little twerp this Herman van Rompuy really is that the
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:10.880]  idea that they make such a person president of Europe right which is
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:15.560]  brought forward some rather significant examples of humanity that they give it to
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:20.080]  this little mouse it's just it shows how pathetic they are they can be defeated
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:25.400]  right any any opposition led by Herman van Rompe can be can be defeated so I
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:29.560]  think again the urgent thing now is to get criminal investigations going at
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:33.840]  NASA national oceanic and atmospheric administration and all of the other
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.600]  that's where the emails come from explain to people these are the the the
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:42.160]  paramount group running at all yeah well this is your university of East
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:47.440]  Anglia CRU the Hadley CRU the climate research unit and this is the main
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:52.920]  input into that intergovernmental panel on climate change with their pompous and
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:59.240]  bombastic stupid report from early 2007 which was then used by Al Gore to
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:04.360]  launch that big campaign of his in the first half of 2007 and it turns out it's
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:10.120]  a fraud and and it's an international conspiracy and you can't just proceed
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:14.080]  as if nothing has happened which is what these wrong and for those that don't
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:17.640]  know the BBC finally broke their week-long blockade and said oh we're
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:22.480]  investigating who stole the data they admit it's real and now times of London
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:28.200]  climate change data dumped the universities destroyed it all yes well
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:31.560]  unfortunately the world is not controlled by the British official
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:35.720]  secrets act which they're probably going to try to use but now here's the
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:39.880]  thing the Copenhagen conference starts on December 7th boy what a day Pearl
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:44.280]  Harbor day they start they start the conference the absolute imperative is
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:50.480]  this conference must fail it must be a stalemate a deadlock a gridlock nothing
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.200]  should get through now there was already the secret diplomacy by Obama one of
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:50:00.240]  the top oligarchs at the United Nations is this evoked the bore watch this guy
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:05.520]  he's the manager he's the top poncho of the Copenhagen client climate conference
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:10.080]  and about 10 days ago evoked the bore be all we are look them up on the internet
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:14.560]  he had a secret meeting with Obama where they were discussing these fallback
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:18.920]  positions what can Obama wasn't gonna go but now he's going now he's gonna go
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:24.320]  and that's another important thing Obama has to fall flat on his face he has to
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:30.160]  be defeated humiliated rejected scorned the ingredients are there the Chinese
[1:50:30.160 --> 1:50:35.080]  have come up with a kind of a they saving cover but they will not accept
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:41.200]  binding carbon limits India will not accept binding carbon limits only the
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:46.560]  West must make the cuts well yes in effect the Africans are concerned about
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:49.520]  getting development aid and there's no development aid on the table these
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:54.200]  governments are all bankrupt you've even got the island states the smaller
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:58.240]  countries that happen to be islands are also in a strongly critical position we
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:03.240]  saw all of this at the last pre-meeting in Barcelona so there's every reason to
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:08.000]  think that this can this can fail now when Obama goes he's going to promise a
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:13.480]  17 percent cut in US carbon emissions we have to say loud and clear all of us
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:19.120]  Obama cannot bind the United States Obama is a lame duck president his
[1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:23.720]  popularity is through the through the floor he's collapsing faster than Jimmy
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:27.840]  Carter he's got a bigger left opposition coming at him the Lyndon B Johnson
[1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:32.720]  once he announces announces his war escalation on on Monday
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:37.400]  on the day December 1st he's going to escalate the war in Afghanistan beyond
[1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:42.440]  belief so Obama does not speak for us and it's really illegal right because
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:45.920]  this has got to be a treaty he can't do it with executive agreements I would
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:51.120]  warn above all backroom protocols watch out for secret protocols that he will
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:55.680]  sign with these euro garks and let me back you up we now learn there's a
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:00.200]  secret internet censorship treaty that he won't release we got copies total
[1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:06.480]  censorship they're doing all this by stealth they're doing this covertly
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:11.040]  more and more and the other thing I would say is the fact that Dubai has now
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:15.800]  blown up is is another people some background times of London Dubai and
[1:52:15.800 --> 1:52:20.480]  deep water as ripples from debt crisis spread a 28 million or 14 billion
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:24.880]  pound default by the Dubai State Corporation again for those that don't
[1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:28.680]  know that's in the Middle East the supposed apple of globalization oh you
[1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:33.840]  said a year ago here when we had the last crisis that when Dubai started to go
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:38.720]  that was the signal the next big slide Webster well obviously these are oil
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:41.920]  sheets right I mean the oil is not really in Dubai but it's close enough
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:46.640]  these are your Emirates of the Gulf right the Persian Gulf so it'd be this is
[1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:51.560]  these people rub elbows with Kuwait and Qatar and Oman but this is
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:56.520]  specifically the United Arab Emirates the old crucial states and there they
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:01.560]  are with with Dubai where they have all these gigantic building projects right
[1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:05.960]  the tallest building the sale they have the palm they have the world these
[1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:10.200]  island systems where they build houses and so forth and try to get people to
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:13.600]  invest in this this has been collapsing now for about a year right the
[1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:17.720]  foreigners have been fleeing so now between Wednesday and Thursday
[1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:23.520]  eighty billion dollars owned by Dubai world Dubai ports authority that Bush
[1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:28.880]  wanted to take over the port of New York and this not feel that is now in
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:33.680]  default and this money is owed to Barclays Bank Royal Bank of Scotland
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:39.080]  Lloyds Hong Kong Shanghai banking corporation Mitsubishi Mitsui Bank of
[1:53:39.080 --> 1:53:44.480]  Japan and Citibank one of the things that may happen is that Dubai will sell
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:49.200]  the Queen Elizabeth II which they own to try to get money to pay off these
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:54.520]  banks another two things if you look at the the futures for tomorrow it looks
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:54:00.120]  like New York will open down about 200 points yeah notice that Dubai announced
[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:05.040]  the default when the US markets were closed on Thanksgiving and we have the
[1:54:05.040 --> 1:54:10.440]  big French bank announcing prepare for total collapse yes indeed well that's
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:13.840]  I think these these are these are connected what is that social now how
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:18.600]  they pronounce it if you take a general I think huh yes if they remember they've
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:21.920]  been bailed out by you through AIG right 50 billion
[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:26.040]  Tim Geithner made that possible so now there are basically two things one is
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:31.520]  that the the US bubble which has been created by Obama with the zero percent
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:36.000]  Federal Reserve lending and the bailout money and and all this that this
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.120]  will now experience a panic crash so panic in New York is one side of it but
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.040]  perhaps even more damaging you have all of these emerging markets which are
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:49.200]  similar to Dubai in other words these hot money paradises and you can look at
[1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:56.720]  Greece Hungary Qatar Turkey Ireland India Russia Malaysia down down the list
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:02.440]  right all kinds of Estonia Latvia these places are all now on the verge of
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:06.960]  panic they were already on the verge of panic and now they may go into panic
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:11.000]  then you have these other places Ukraine Latvia and Iceland which are
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  basically already in bankruptcy where this may be enough to push them into
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.800]  debt moratorium in other words into a formal default because and that's what
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:23.600]  Dubai is calling for we've only got a minute and a half left Webster what
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:27.240]  about this Russia today announcement that you that Russian advisers and
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:31.360]  equipment are joining the US and coalition in Afghanistan I've clearly
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:34.640]  got to have you back up in the next few days on the weekday show I wouldn't give
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:39.480]  that too much too much significance I would urge everybody look at that
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:44.840]  incident on the Moscow to St. Petersburg Express but in terrorism there
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:48.840]  the two possibilities there all the media mention are it's Chechen terrorism
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:52.120]  well that's run by the US and the British or take that back to London in
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:58.160]  New York and it could be these neo-Bolsheviks right these are in neo-Nazis
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:02.560]  which are supported by the US this is Li Marov and his crew who are together
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:06.760]  with Kasparov and Kasparov is the main darling of the United States in the
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:11.920]  anti-Putin opposition so there's a grave suspicion that some kind of a warning
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:15.880]  was delivered right Putin has just been on a tour of Western Europe where he's
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:20.480]  been getting calling for arresting bankers yes he made these remarks about
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:25.640]  made-off which didn't please the financial types and significantly he's
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:29.280]  gotten me the British to come in on the North Stream pipeline and the French
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:32.000]  have come in on the South Stream pipeline so that's right that Georgian
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:36.320]  pipeline just got approved well but the one that's making progress is the
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:40.960]  Russian one yeah because the Georgians it's just north of Georgia into the
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:44.600]  Black Sea it's the South Stream this is the Russian one this is
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:49.280]  Turkey Italy and now France so here's the idea the big argument against
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:52.280]  this happened trade nonsense is unemployment now if you go into a
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:56.120]  second round of the depression people are likely to say look we can't afford
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:59.800]  any of this now because we're not clearly cutting our carbon will kill us
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:04.120]  even if it was real when it's not right it simply undermines political support
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:08.160]  for this even more so there's a great chance to block this Copenhagen
[1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:12.160]  monstrosity and I urge everybody to do everything they can to do that above
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:15.840]  you know a webster hold on hold on hold on webster the show is over in 30
[1:57:15.840 --> 1:57:20.520]  seconds but three-hour show with Jason Burma's he's got guests coming up but I
