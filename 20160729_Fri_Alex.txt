[00:00.000 --> 00:22.120]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:22.120 --> 00:36.960]  Show. We're only three months and change. Out from the 2016 election, the Republican
[00:36.960 --> 00:46.360]  and Democratic National Conventions have come and gone. And as I sit here, all the different
[00:46.360 --> 00:53.840]  news feeds, intel, tips, connections that we have, the image is absolutely crystal clear
[00:53.840 --> 01:01.440]  and we can see for miles and miles and miles what's coming. Hillary Clinton is seven to
[01:01.440 --> 01:08.160]  ten points behind nationally. If you translate it into battleground states, Donald Trump
[01:08.160 --> 01:16.280]  is going to be the winner of the 2016 presidential election. The mounting scandals, the mounting
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.400]  corruption, the mounting evidence that Hillary thinks she's above the law, the hacked emails
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.240]  where they were sending people to protest, Donald Trump and blame Bernie Sanders, where
[01:27.240 --> 01:31.940]  they were lining up the superdelegates to block Sanders and bragging that it doesn't
[01:31.940 --> 01:41.040]  matter how they vote, we're putting a woman in and that's it. Talk about criminal activity.
[01:41.040 --> 01:53.400]  But they're betting that they are too big to fail. The system thinks that if they commit
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.000]  massive crimes that are interconnected to the entire bureaucracy, that the bureaucracy,
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.160]  that's the matter with the mainstream media, big corporate institutions, the major universities,
[02:07.160 --> 02:15.080]  the governing parasitic class themselves and others, that they can put up a wall of fraud,
[02:15.080 --> 02:22.080]  a wall of disinformation and make all of us feel like we're alone and powerless. I tell
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.840]  you, that facade has never had bigger holes than it does right now. And I can tell you
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.480]  that even if they cheat and install Hillary Clinton, it will accelerate the end of the
[02:33.480 --> 02:41.720]  new world order. Now, by the way, reading back the last 60 years and studying the world
[02:41.720 --> 02:48.920]  government project that was launched by the Anglo-American establishment in the last 40
[02:48.920 --> 02:56.120]  years, allied with the Communist Chinese, they have never had articles like the ones
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.600]  I'm seeing on a daily basis. A couple days ago with globalization in danger, G20 doubled
[03:01.600 --> 03:12.800]  down on the defense. Here is the economist today. Globalization and politics, the new
[03:12.800 --> 03:20.000]  political divide. And the Rothschild publication says, farewell left versus right, the contest
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.560]  that matters now is open against closed. When they mean open, they mean the globalists
[03:24.560 --> 03:29.360]  can do one-sided trade deals and let government shut down their competition to consolidate
[03:29.360 --> 03:37.720]  control. So you have to translate that. And in this article, they say, quote, the future
[03:37.720 --> 03:47.840]  of the liberal world order depends on whether she, Hillary Clinton succeeds. They're not
[03:47.840 --> 03:58.680]  exaggerating. They are wounded. They are on fire. They are collapsing. They are bleeding
[03:58.680 --> 04:08.840]  out. They are whistling past the graveyard. That doesn't mean there'll be some wonderful
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.160]  utopia on the other side of this, but this organized global corporate crime syndicate
[04:14.160 --> 04:19.240]  that's taken over much of the planet through fiat, currency, and fraudulent counterfeit
[04:19.240 --> 04:29.960]  financial instruments like credit default swaps and other derivatives is in deep trouble. And
[04:29.960 --> 04:34.800]  they sell it like an open, wonderful world of rainbows and happiness when your border
[04:34.800 --> 04:40.920]  is open, like the jihadis in Europe and the collapsing standard of living. But then there's
[04:40.920 --> 04:45.680]  the evil world of the wall. So see, if you don't let us conquer you and run you and let
[04:45.680 --> 04:51.680]  MPP and offshore systems control you, then you're a racist. That's all they've got. They're
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.200]  going to play the third world off against what's left of the first world and bring us
[04:55.200 --> 05:00.840]  all down at the same time. Stay with us.
[05:00.840 --> 05:08.520]  Trump slams Hillary's DNC speech and denounces her globalist agenda. Donald Trump immediately
[05:08.520 --> 05:13.960]  reacted to Hillary Clinton's keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention last
[05:13.960 --> 05:20.480]  night, sending out a series of tweets hitting her on her economic and foreign policies.
[05:20.480 --> 05:26.160]  Trump says Hillary will never reform Wall Street because she is owned by Wall Street.
[05:26.160 --> 05:32.840]  And he says that Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power,
[05:32.840 --> 05:40.120]  no jobs and no safety. Trump also slammed Hillary for being soft on the threat of terrorism,
[05:40.120 --> 05:46.560]  noting that Americans way of life is under threat by radical Islam. And Hillary Clinton
[05:46.560 --> 05:52.320]  can't even bring herself to say the words. And in a final tweet, Trump urged that no
[05:52.320 --> 05:58.800]  one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[05:58.800 --> 06:03.200]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[06:03.200 --> 06:04.920]  is this so good?
[06:04.920 --> 06:09.600]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[06:09.600 --> 06:14.240]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[06:14.240 --> 06:19.920]  my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[06:19.920 --> 06:25.600]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[06:25.600 --> 06:30.040]  spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[06:30.040 --> 06:31.040]  parasites.
[06:31.040 --> 06:33.320]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[06:33.320 --> 06:38.320]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[06:38.320 --> 06:40.960]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[06:40.960 --> 06:44.160]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It
[06:44.160 --> 06:48.080]  just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose

[08:07.400 --> 08:16.080]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance,
[08:16.080 --> 08:29.960]  rallying Patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We humbly come to
[08:29.960 --> 08:36.560]  you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide. I'm Alex Jones, your
[08:36.560 --> 08:45.360]  host. This is the Friday edition, the 29th day of July, 2016. We are three months and
[08:45.360 --> 08:59.520]  just about a week out from the 2016 presidential election, August, September, October, November.
[08:59.520 --> 09:07.240]  Boom. This is a huge time to be alive. I have scores of articles out of the Economist magazine,
[09:07.240 --> 09:12.720]  out of the Washington Post, out of Time Magazine, out of the Financial Times of London, out
[09:12.720 --> 09:19.600]  of Der Spiegel, out of the People's Daily in Communist China, every day I see articles
[09:19.600 --> 09:26.440]  where the globalists, the G20, the major megacorporations that control the planet and that are destroying
[09:26.440 --> 09:32.480]  nation states and putting them into debt and transferring our wealth and establishing authoritarian
[09:32.480 --> 09:38.880]  systems of government, they call technocracy, but are really just fascism on the top, command
[09:38.880 --> 09:50.320]  and control using socialist or communist systems on the grass roots. A scientific tyranny.
[09:50.320 --> 09:58.520]  And they're all panicking. Economist magazine, globalists must rally behind Hillary Clinton.
[09:58.520 --> 10:05.080]  The future of the liberal world order depends on whether she succeeds. They've rallied behind
[10:05.080 --> 10:11.480]  Merkel as well. She's arresting Germans. She's declared martial law. She is arresting anyone
[10:11.480 --> 10:16.920]  that criticizes Islam or the open borders. She has now announced a five-fold increase
[10:16.920 --> 10:23.240]  in migrants. She's going to hammer them to hell. But it's okay. She's a woman. They're
[10:23.240 --> 10:26.920]  now saying in the news it's okay if Hillary stole the election from Bernie Sanders. It's
[10:26.920 --> 10:30.960]  okay if he really won California, New Hampshire and at least eight other states. It doesn't
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.440]  matter if they order the delegates to lie and then go along with the superdelegates.
[10:35.440 --> 10:45.800]  And when they don't, they just replace them because she's a woman. Truly sick. But here's
[10:45.800 --> 10:55.280]  the good news. The Republicans tried to tell Republican voters that your vote never counted.
[10:55.280 --> 11:01.400]  Who ever said that? That's a conspiracy theory, silly goose. And the media was like, Drudge
[11:01.400 --> 11:07.200]  is really getting crazy. He's pointing out that Ted Cruz kept having all these different
[11:07.200 --> 11:13.080]  voterless victories. And then he would announce that the voters had spoken. And there were
[11:13.080 --> 11:21.640]  talk of federal election commission investigations. How dare Matt Drudge, remember just three
[11:21.640 --> 11:28.280]  or four months ago, how dare he point out that no one voted in Colorado or all these
[11:28.280 --> 11:36.480]  other states. How dare Alex Jones, that evil person. There were articles as well, but 50
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.320]  to one against Drudge. But I was mentioned as an arch criminal and the kooky Republican
[11:42.320 --> 11:46.800]  voters. How dare them, George Will. Can you guys print me the George Will article on the
[11:46.800 --> 11:54.080]  Washington Post front page? He said, we are the sovereigns, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
[11:54.080 --> 12:03.120]  dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, royal, royal, royal Democrat and Republican party. If Trump has
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.520]  nominated the GOP, he must keep him out of the White House. And then you read the George
[12:07.520 --> 12:14.680]  Will article. And he just says, we're going to take it from you. We don't listen to a
[12:14.680 --> 12:26.360]  mere plurality of voters. That was in April, just a few months ago. So here we are. The
[12:26.360 --> 12:33.520]  Democrats are completely angry. The vast majority we talked to across the country on video,
[12:33.520 --> 12:38.400]  including California. We're going to make him his case the next few months, compiling
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.520]  the graphs, the numbers, the polls, the videos, the interviews to say to the American people,
[12:44.520 --> 12:49.680]  are you going to let them openly steal the Democratic nomination from tens of millions
[12:49.680 --> 12:57.120]  of voters and have all these incredible scandals and have their 20,000 emails come out that
[12:57.120 --> 13:02.640]  specifically show them saying, I don't care if he won this state. A woman's going to be
[13:02.640 --> 13:11.160]  the next president. You announce she won. We have the smoking guns. We have the giant
[13:11.160 --> 13:20.720]  red flags. We have the corpse. We have the evidence. We have the dead bodies. And so
[13:20.720 --> 13:26.400]  now we have three months, three months, and I'm going to brainstorm a day on air. I mean,
[13:26.400 --> 13:33.440]  and my whole crew, my writers, my researchers, we're talking to demographers, statisticians.
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.800]  We are on it right now. I mean, the case is there. They admit it happened. Even the New
[13:37.800 --> 13:44.040]  York Post had to admit it. Even the New York Daily News had to admit that with Bernie
[13:44.040 --> 13:47.240]  was set to win New York, they just said, it doesn't matter. We have a super delegate.
[13:47.240 --> 13:51.680]  Same thing in California. They met the night before at a rich donor's house with the associated
[13:51.680 --> 13:57.640]  press and seeing in and the super delegates had a discussion around drinks and decided
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.360]  what the results would be the next day. They even announced the number to themselves. The
[14:02.360 --> 14:12.760]  vote was totally ceremonial. Like your child pretending they're Captain Hook or Peter Pan
[14:12.760 --> 14:20.600]  in a fourth grade school play. You're not Peter Pan. You're not Captain Hook. It's
[14:20.600 --> 14:28.480]  a fantasy. So you've got the economists. You've got the Washington Post. You've got them all.
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.400]  All these foreign powers, the Pope, the communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians, the current Mexican
[14:33.400 --> 14:38.920]  president, the former Mexican president, every socialist, every crook, every kingpin, every
[14:38.920 --> 14:44.280]  narco connected leader, every piece of filth you could imagine with more blood on their
[14:44.280 --> 14:50.120]  hands than you could ever imagine with the communist Chinese coming out from under their
[14:50.120 --> 14:58.880]  bloody vampiric catacombs, crawling out to tell us you can't have Donald Trump and throwing
[14:58.880 --> 15:04.240]  everything they've got at Trump. And it's only making him rise because this is a symbol
[15:04.240 --> 15:11.200]  of a populist awakening worldwide, just like the Brexit. And just like Catalan, they had
[15:11.200 --> 15:19.280]  almost 90% voted to leave Spain. It's the only now overall productive area of Spain.
[15:19.280 --> 15:26.880]  It's a third of their population. When I was there last year, almost every house and apartment
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.480]  had the Catalonian flag hanging out of it. Everywhere I went, people were listeners.
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.640]  I mean, it's a little cafe and the woman come out the back and throw a whole another big
[15:36.640 --> 15:42.880]  old piece of meat on my plate and say, it's free. We love your work. Help us leave Spain.
[15:42.880 --> 15:50.600]  I mean, this is happening all over the world. People are sick of it. They're tired of it.
[15:50.600 --> 15:56.280]  The productive are tired of being enslaved by far off ruling leadership, like the King
[15:56.280 --> 16:03.080]  of England, King George III in 1775. And so they pushed this whole plan of world government
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.840]  and openly say on the economist, you're racist. If you don't accept open borders and if you
[16:07.840 --> 16:19.680]  don't accept globalism and if you don't accept foreign shadowy groups running your countries,
[16:19.680 --> 16:23.040]  they always tried to deny they were setting up unelected corporate world government. But
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.240]  now that it's here, they're pushing it as a great thing and everyone remembers and everyone
[16:27.240 --> 16:31.880]  knows. So as long as we force a debate on all these issues, there's nothing they can
[16:31.880 --> 16:39.680]  do. I know I hammer that over and over and over again. But Catalonia voted overwhelmingly
[16:39.680 --> 16:48.520]  to leave. They voted. And then you look, the British press spends it like 47% wanted to
[16:48.520 --> 16:54.360]  leave. No, they actually voted to leave. And then Spain's trying to keep them from leaving.
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.640]  But long term, every analyst out there admits there's no way they're gonna be able to keep
[16:59.640 --> 17:04.760]  that area in Spain because it was never part of Spain. Spain was three different kingdoms
[17:04.760 --> 17:13.960]  to begin with. And then forcefully unified. What was it 700 years ago? Portugal will be
[17:13.960 --> 17:19.720]  the fifth part or the fourth part, depending on how you cut it. Now continuing here, they
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.560]  say the future of the liberal world order, it's okay that it's world order because it's
[17:24.560 --> 17:29.120]  liberal. That means you have martial law and you can't criticize Islam and you have 90%
[17:29.120 --> 17:35.040]  tax rates in France. Some taxes are 101%. The future of the liberal world order depends
[17:35.040 --> 17:40.320]  on whether she succeeds. So that's the battle lines with globalization in danger. G20 doubles
[17:40.320 --> 17:46.320]  down on defense. So we know what's going on. We know the stakes. So here's the question.
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.960]  What does Donald Trump do because he's the man who has the most power now globally to
[17:51.960 --> 17:58.520]  speak out against the new world order? Does he come out and say Hillary stole the nomination
[17:58.520 --> 18:04.200]  from Bernie Sanders and then put on the evidence of it and show the states he really won and
[18:04.200 --> 18:09.360]  brings former delegates up who were told, we're gonna remove you and put somebody in
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.760]  who will pledge to Hillary. And we can play Hillary superdelegates bragging. It doesn't
[18:13.760 --> 18:17.680]  matter how many votes. In fact, we have that. Let's cue that up. Back in New Hampshire months
[18:17.680 --> 18:27.440]  ago, California superdelegates saying it doesn't matter how you vote. Hillary will win. With
[18:27.440 --> 18:33.200]  total confidence. And then we have someone I guess later who was at that California meeting.
[18:33.200 --> 18:39.240]  We have all the evidence. Now we've got to put it on for everybody just because you're
[18:39.240 --> 18:42.520]  informed or I'm informed doesn't mean they're informed. We have to remind everybody about
[18:42.520 --> 18:49.040]  the voterless wins. The voterless wins of Ted Cruz didn't succeed because we didn't drink
[18:49.040 --> 18:53.680]  the Kool-Aid. The Democrats didn't even really drink it, but they were able to ram it through
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.480]  and were willing to do it. So Trump's got to come out and say if Crook and Hillary would
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.280]  lie about emails and in her own emails, talk about sabotaging my campaign and derailing
[19:04.280 --> 19:10.440]  Sanders, if she'd steal the nomination, will she try to steal the general election? You
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.400]  bet your bottom dollar. And I think he should make the whole campaign how she's a crook,
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.880]  which he's already done to the next level and start predicting that now that I'm in
[19:19.880 --> 19:23.640]  the lead. See, if he was behind, he couldn't say this because then you spin polls and say
[19:23.640 --> 19:31.480]  it was sour grapes. While Trump's ahead, he has absolutely got to come out and talk
[19:31.480 --> 19:35.320]  about the fact that they believe she will try to steal the general election because
[19:35.320 --> 19:39.680]  he's ahead. And everyone will connect with that because it's common sense that she's
[19:39.680 --> 19:45.720]  already done it. She's already robbed one bank stealing the nomination. Why wouldn't
[19:45.720 --> 19:49.840]  she steal another? She's already engaged in all this corruption, all this crooked behavior,
[19:49.840 --> 19:57.720]  absolutely. I'm telling you, we can destroy her right now if Trump drops the hammer and
[19:57.720 --> 20:04.120]  if you drop the hammer, is the recession really over? Is a bigger one on the way? Will our
[20:04.120 --> 20:09.760]  next president lead us to prosperity and peace or will it all fall apart? Our modern world

[24:22.680 --> 24:27.640]  bragging that he was a California superdelegate, that he'd been one for decades and it didn't
[24:27.640 --> 24:33.040]  matter how you voted, they were going to give it to Hillary Clinton because it's her turn.
[24:33.040 --> 24:36.760]  And then we're back there digging up, while I was just looking for that one, we found a
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.360]  bunch of other clips on national news superdelegates saying it two, three months ago. Just, you
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.840]  know what? Your vote doesn't count. We're taking it. Just like the Republicans did.
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.960]  Remember, all those Republicans superdelegates going, we changed the rules in 1976, the Democrats
[24:52.960 --> 24:57.600]  in 72. We're just allowed to do whatever we want. We're going to do it. We're just going
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.000]  to compile all that for the general public because when I show this to the average person,
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.520]  they go, yeah, everybody I know likes Bernie. Nobody liked Hillary. How'd she win? I heard
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.960]  they were kicking people out and stealing votes. Everybody's calling an election fraud
[25:09.960 --> 25:17.760]  because the general voter is so ignorant. It's beyond that. They stole it publicly. Do
[25:17.760 --> 25:27.960]  you understand? It's open and shut. They admit it. Fire torpedoes. Fire it will people. Look,
[25:27.960 --> 25:32.000]  you watch, I'm going to be a machine. I'm getting all these videos together. I'm getting
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.120]  all the articles together, all the, all the exit polls, and we're going to sit here and
[25:36.120 --> 25:41.720]  point out how she stole the election, the primary. And we're going to show how the Republicans
[25:41.720 --> 25:48.160]  tried to do it. We like a 10 minute mini documentary that lays this all out and then says, what
[25:48.160 --> 25:55.560]  do you think's coming up at the general election in T minus three months and change? That's
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.560]  why I'm hyperventilating. The whole global government says their entire project is falling
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.160]  apart in Europe, falling apart in the UK, falling apart in the Middle East, falling
[26:06.160 --> 26:12.120]  apart in Africa, falling apart in Latin America, falling apart in the Caribbean, falling apart
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.160]  in the South Pacific. No one wants to go along with it. People are now knowing it's totally
[26:16.160 --> 26:24.920]  authoritarian. They're getting incredibly awake. Let me tell you, the voters might understand
[26:24.920 --> 26:28.480]  how the scam went down. They just know there was a scam. That's awake compared to a few
[26:28.480 --> 26:35.000]  years ago. And we're not going to sit here and watch the Associated Press that tabulates
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.400]  nationally the state's numbers coming in, and then they announced to us who wins. This
[26:42.400 --> 26:47.160]  is how they steal elections. And if you've got somebody in the other party who isn't
[26:47.160 --> 26:54.000]  contesting it, like these other rigged elections, they can get away with it. But, but here's
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.760]  the difference. I want to get the article that goes with it and go over his name and
[26:57.760 --> 27:00.240]  everything else, guys. So let me have the article that goes with it. I want to, I want
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.400]  to repost it first and make a big deal out of it because if I don't off all this, just
[27:04.400 --> 27:07.320]  no one even cares. Oh, here's a super delegate months ago said that we're going to steal
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.280]  a from Hillary, a super delegate saying we're going to meet in California and it doesn't
[27:11.280 --> 27:18.800]  matter. We need horns blowing and drum beats and smoke shooting up. I mean, folks have
[27:18.800 --> 27:24.600]  just gotten so calm with all of this. Well, I'm not calm. I'm not taking it like it's
[27:24.600 --> 27:33.120]  not. And we need Donald Trump to come out and put the case on and say, crooked Hillary,
[27:33.120 --> 27:37.600]  you've stolen everything. You're a cheat your whole life. You stole it from your own voters.
[27:37.600 --> 27:44.040]  You're a total disgrace. And we are not going to sit here and let you steal these states
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.920]  and Trump needs teams showing the illegals voting in California and everywhere else just
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.920]  to illustrate it that day. He's got some conventional thinkers who are good people, but they're
[27:54.920 --> 28:01.720]  thinking about just general demographics and trying to get more people to vote. You need
[28:01.720 --> 28:09.960]  to then as a propaganda victory show on election day, illegals voting. If I had five teams
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.320]  in California, I could show you illegals voting hundreds of times in one day. I would go in
[28:15.320 --> 28:22.200]  hidden cameras, show it all devastate, devastate, devastate. I'm ready to devastate. I am not
[28:22.200 --> 28:25.560]  going to sit here and put up with this globalism anymore. And by the way, if anything happens
[28:25.560 --> 28:32.480]  to me, everything you heard here is how to defeat Hillary. This is the 100% super harpoon
[28:32.480 --> 28:36.440]  that'll bring Moby Dick down. And quite frankly, I don't care if I get taken to the bottom
[28:36.440 --> 28:49.600]  of the ocean. I got the harpoon in my hand and I'm pledged to it and pledge with me hunting
[28:49.600 --> 28:57.600]  the globalists. We're not going to defeat us. We're never stopping. You can see the
[28:57.600 --> 29:07.440]  electricity and feel it all around us. Hillary superdelegate. Why your vote doesn't count.
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.440]  There it is. February 12th. Hillary already has over half the superdelegates and is expected
[29:12.440 --> 29:17.600]  to gain more. And that article by Kit Daniels breaks it down. We need to republish it. How
[29:17.600 --> 29:23.240]  Hillary bragged that she would block the popular vote and sell the nomination. And then we
[29:23.240 --> 29:30.520]  have them. We have them. We have them. We have them. We have them. We have them. We have
[29:30.520 --> 29:36.080]  them. We have them. We have them. We have them. We have them. They stole the nomination.
[29:36.080 --> 29:41.720]  They are criminals. They're paid off by Communist Chinese. They're enemies of America. We must
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.640]  defeat them. But we have to have the will to get in the long boats and get out there
[29:46.640 --> 29:49.720]  and get up on top of these people politically and start throwing.
[29:49.720 --> 30:00.960]  In the March. The Empires on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.960 --> 30:08.680]  Trump slams Hillary's DNC speech and denounces her globalist agenda. Donald Trump immediately
[30:08.680 --> 30:14.120]  reacted to Hillary Clinton's keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention last
[30:14.120 --> 30:20.600]  night, sending out a series of tweets hitting her on her economic and foreign policies.
[30:20.600 --> 30:26.320]  Trump says Hillary will never reform Wall Street because she is owned by Wall Street.
[30:26.320 --> 30:32.960]  And he says that Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power,
[30:32.960 --> 30:40.240]  no jobs and no safety. Trump also slammed Hillary for being soft on the threat of terrorism,
[30:40.240 --> 30:46.680]  noting that Americans' way of life is under threat by radical Islam. And Hillary Clinton
[30:46.680 --> 30:52.440]  can't even bring herself to say the words. And in a final tweet, Trump urged that no
[30:52.440 --> 31:00.440]  one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[33:23.680 --> 33:30.680]  Another day older and deeper in debt. Saint Peter, don't you call me cause I can go. I
[33:30.680 --> 33:40.640]  owe my soul to the company store. And that's the Democratic Party Model of Control. I was
[33:40.640 --> 33:46.240]  born one morning when the sun didn't shine. I picked up my shovel and I walked to the
[33:46.240 --> 33:53.640]  mine. I loaded 60. What I'm gonna do is open the phones up the entire broadcast now. Specifically
[33:53.640 --> 33:59.480]  brainstorming with you about, do you think I'm wrong that Hillary will try to steal the
[33:59.480 --> 34:04.560]  election? I mean, they're openly giving illegals driver's license in 15 states to vote. That's
[34:04.560 --> 34:09.520]  on record. And in California, Illinois, and a bunch of other states, they're trying to
[34:09.520 --> 34:18.240]  pass laws to legalize illegals voting, but then denying they're trying to do that. While
[34:18.240 --> 34:26.520]  they do everything they can to throw conservative voters off the voter rolls. So yes, we know
[34:26.520 --> 34:30.480]  she's going to try to steal it, but how do we illustrate that? And how do we get Donald
[34:30.480 --> 34:36.440]  Trump? Who I know is fully aware of it. And then I know is very concerned about election
[34:36.440 --> 34:41.680]  fraud. And I know who's put a team together to do it. How do we get him to come out and
[34:41.680 --> 34:49.160]  start illustrating democratic party election fraud that we know has happened in the past?
[34:49.160 --> 34:52.880]  And how do we get him to illustrate the fact that she just did it to her own party? And
[34:52.880 --> 34:58.520]  so that he's in the lead now in every major poll, Hillary, don't you dare try to steal
[34:58.520 --> 35:03.880]  it on election day. I think that's the smart move. I think Trump needs to preemptively
[35:03.880 --> 35:07.760]  put the case together in the next few weeks and needs to make that one of his central
[35:07.760 --> 35:14.720]  issues because you can't not expect this White House allied with crooked Hillary and this
[35:14.720 --> 35:21.280]  crime syndicate to leave office. They are going to try to continue on with the fifth
[35:21.280 --> 35:25.480]  Clinton administration. And for all intents and purposes, that's what this will be. You've
[35:25.480 --> 35:30.240]  got to a William Jefferson Clinton where she was co-president pretty much ran things. You've
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.720]  now had two administrations of Obama that they heavily infested. And now you'll have
[35:34.720 --> 35:43.960]  her back as the royal witch squatting right dead set in the middle of a fight between
[35:43.960 --> 35:48.080]  populism and globalism worldwide with the Economist magazine and the Communist People's
[35:48.080 --> 35:54.080]  Daily and the Washington Post and the Financial Times of London and everybody else saying
[35:54.080 --> 36:01.720]  we have got to get her in for the New World Order. So is it right here? If the New World
[36:01.720 --> 36:08.440]  Order is going to survive, we need Hillary. All hands on deck. Use a Star Trek analogy.
[36:08.440 --> 36:15.720]  They've got the alert noise, the alert siren going on in the background. And they are
[36:15.720 --> 36:24.800]  running around like an ant hill that's been turned over. And believe me, 110% they are
[36:24.800 --> 36:38.920]  going to try to steal this election. That is unequivocal fact. Unequivocal fact. So
[36:38.920 --> 36:43.280]  if Trump's advisors, some of them are telling him, well, that'll look like you're a sword
[36:43.280 --> 36:49.280]  loser or that'll look like you're a conspiracy theorist. Look, if you tell somebody you don't
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.640]  like the taste of their lemonade, they'll tell you you're a conspiracy theorist. That
[36:53.640 --> 36:59.000]  just means you're not supposed to have your own opinions or your own views. She just stole
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.520]  the party's nomination. I know most of the people in the Trump campaign understand this
[37:04.520 --> 37:08.920]  and they're sitting around, I can tell you, trying to figure out how they deal with this
[37:08.920 --> 37:13.120]  because they don't have the machinery or the muscle or any of the apparatus to deal with
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.240]  something like this. They do have the lawyers. They can block states. They can do recounts.
[37:18.240 --> 37:24.920]  But just haven't helped us, ladies and gentlemen. And listen, everybody's got to vote. We've
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.400]  got to have maximum votes. Even if your state is already going to go for Trump, you've got
[37:29.400 --> 37:34.960]  to go vote. So then the popular vote, he's way ahead of Hillary, a million or more votes,
[37:34.960 --> 37:42.800]  so that we have the argument just morally above everything to Trump their claims of
[37:42.800 --> 37:48.600]  something in the Electoral College. And I'm not saying nor the Electoral College, you're
[37:48.600 --> 37:55.600]  going to have fraud in the Electoral College, just like you did with the delegates. And
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.720]  so the sabotage is on. The Republican establishment has decided to stand by and watch Trump be
[38:00.720 --> 38:07.080]  torpedoed to the bottom of the ocean at our greatest moment of victory. So here's the
[38:07.080 --> 38:16.480]  toll-free number to join us. 800-259-9231. 800-2599-231. Long-time callers, first-time
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.000]  callers, agree, disagree. Hey, do you think I'm right? They're going to steal it? I mean,
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.400]  they're already stealing the election process. They're in the middle of a steal. There's
[38:24.400 --> 38:33.040]  no debate. But if you disagree, fine. 800-2599-231. But then obviously for the people out there
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.360]  that understand this clear and present ongoing process of theft that's going on, how do
[38:37.360 --> 38:42.560]  we expose it? How do we educate people about it? How does Trump go about responding to
[38:42.560 --> 38:57.600]  it? Because I am specifically going to ask you to lobby Trump and the Trump Organization.
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.400]  Obviously folks listen to me, and I'm going to just stop right there, and I have put my
[39:01.400 --> 39:09.400]  two cents in. And I have said you need to develop a plan now to start countering this
[39:09.400 --> 39:12.920]  now. And I know for two days after that they were meeting on this subject and were already
[39:12.920 --> 39:16.800]  planning to be. They get it. They didn't get that from me. They just absolutely click
[39:16.800 --> 39:22.080]  and know that's what's going on. And this has to be dealt with. And I want to tell
[39:22.080 --> 39:30.240]  something to all the folks out there like Stephen Colbert and Mr. Stewart and all the
[39:30.240 --> 39:33.480]  other people like Mr. Fallon and everybody that think this is all cute and that think
[39:33.480 --> 39:38.480]  PPP is funny and think that, you know, foreign megabags running our country is really, you
[39:38.480 --> 39:42.400]  know, something to make jokes about. And it's fun to make fun of info wars. We got clips
[39:42.400 --> 39:47.000]  of that coming up. And to sit there and, you know, talk about how I don't want any info.
[39:47.000 --> 39:55.120]  I'm waging war on information. I'm waging war on the truth because I don't want any data.
[39:55.120 --> 40:06.120]  No information war can be neutral. It can be black or it can be white. We put out white
[40:06.120 --> 40:12.200]  propaganda. Propaganda doesn't mean a lie. It just means a statement, a political or religious
[40:12.200 --> 40:19.840]  system, an idea, something promoting your system, what you believe in. If you're a Christian,
[40:19.840 --> 40:25.320]  your propaganda is promoting the Bible and Christ, but has a dirty connotation. There
[40:25.320 --> 40:31.360]  is white propaganda, neutral propaganda and black propaganda. And they are putting out
[40:31.360 --> 40:38.800]  absolutely the most deceptive, weaponized disinformation against us. And it is Pentagon
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.200]  and CIA directed. That was legalized three years ago. Now understand the average Pentagon
[40:44.200 --> 40:49.760]  person, even in psyops is beside themselves. And that's why a lot of stuff's leaking. So
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.320]  there's blowback from it. But nevertheless, you were seeing scientific systems of control
[40:54.320 --> 41:01.600]  being used. And it's not funny to overthrow elections. It's not funny to make jokes about
[41:01.600 --> 41:06.240]  it. It's not funny to go along with it. So everybody better have a serious gut check
[41:06.240 --> 41:12.000]  and look in the mirror and say, do you want to really preside over the installation of
[41:12.000 --> 41:17.040]  Hillary Rodham Clinton? And I want to tell Bernie Sanders vote or something to do not
[41:17.040 --> 41:24.360]  go vote for a green party or for the Gary Johnson spoiler libertarian. I've always been for
[41:24.360 --> 41:29.640]  building third parties when you have a McCain Obama ticket or something like that. We have
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.560]  a clear choice here. Trump is a nationalist. He was against the Iraq war. He does want
[41:34.560 --> 41:40.080]  to actually turn our industry back on. He wants prosperity. That's why the new world
[41:40.080 --> 41:52.520]  or hate scene and he's part of a populist movement worldwide. Absolutely imperative
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.480]  that anyone that cares about the continuity of voting that hundreds of generations have
[41:57.480 --> 42:03.280]  fought for in history, that you must as a referendum on the first amendment and the
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.400]  right of the vote and the right of the people to be heard, you must vote for Donald Trump.
[42:08.400 --> 42:14.920]  There is no question, no debate. If you don't do that and if you don't get people to vote
[42:14.920 --> 42:22.680]  for Donald Trump, you are absolutely asking for everything you get. And this country is
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.880]  going to go under judgment. And if you don't believe in God, that's your issue. Historically,
[42:27.880 --> 42:34.080]  this will green light the establishment to go 10 times more crazy. They can't even help
[42:34.080 --> 42:37.520]  themselves. They're going to start big wars. They're going to grab more bank accounts.
[42:37.520 --> 42:46.400]  They're already doing more bail ins in Europe. They're already good. It's bad. Please, please,
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.880]  please, please. If you're a bureaucrat or a minion of the system and you've played along
[42:51.880 --> 42:54.440]  with this for years, because you feel like you're part of the winning team and you're
[42:54.440 --> 42:58.040]  scared right now and you think if you cozy up to this, you're going to be okay. You're
[42:58.040 --> 43:05.160]  not going to be. We're going into the final phases of this takeover, the end game. And
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.120]  they're setting up an authoritarian system because almost everyone's going to be made
[43:08.120 --> 43:16.880]  very, very poor. So if you were a sociopath, you should join Team Liberty because it creates
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.880]  more prosperity and a better future at this point. Yeah, 30, 40 years ago, 10 years ago,
[43:22.880 --> 43:28.600]  you could be a sociopath, work with evil, become powerful, get money. Not now, man.
[43:28.600 --> 43:34.440]  The slots are going to get smaller. The payoffs are going to get smaller. When elites consolidate
[43:34.440 --> 43:40.360]  control, they kill the golden goose. I'm telling you right now, you need to do whatever it
[43:40.360 --> 43:46.120]  is you think you need to do to get information out, to leak information, to say no, to not
[43:46.120 --> 43:52.720]  play along with this. I mean, history's happening right now. Don't let this opportunity to reprieve
[43:52.720 --> 44:02.320]  yourself. Go by. Don't let this opportunity to do the right thing. Go by. This is maximum
[44:02.320 --> 44:09.960]  history flux point we've reached. We are in such an electric, incredible time. I just
[44:09.960 --> 44:17.760]  can hardly even contain myself. I am just on fire with chills right now at how mega epic
[44:17.760 --> 44:24.280]  this is. And don't think the global is starting to strike back with Brig Zitt and with the
[44:24.280 --> 44:30.560]  Trump presidency, but at least humanity's fighting back. We roll over to these guys.
[44:30.560 --> 44:38.480]  They want to break us for good. All right, I'm going to stop right there. I've got these
[44:38.480 --> 44:42.880]  clips. I want to get to a bunch of the news, your phone calls. We are running the biggest
[44:42.880 --> 44:47.400]  special we've ever run that we started running Wednesday. Most of the specials will continue
[44:47.400 --> 44:54.720]  through the weekend. A lot of things are about to sell out. We are going to have to stop
[44:54.720 --> 45:03.520]  the 40% off on super high quality, storeable food tomorrow, but everything else. Well,
[45:03.520 --> 45:10.360]  a lot of the other items is going to run right through until Sunday evening. The purchases,
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.680]  whether it's the supplements or whether it's Hillary for prison shirt or whether it is
[45:14.680 --> 45:22.000]  a film or a book on any subject of geopolitical import you could imagine from the occult to
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.120]  9 11. Your purchase of these high quality products is what makes this operation possible.
[45:28.120 --> 45:33.160]  We have the amazing new tropic. One of the ingredients is at least one of them. The second
[45:33.160 --> 45:37.720]  one's quasi prescription is controlled in Europe. One of them's prescription, a serious
[45:37.720 --> 45:48.120]  new tropic for 1776. Normally 2995 similar formulas are 60 to $70. And people get them
[45:48.120 --> 45:51.840]  from doctors, even though they're not prescription in the US. This has ingredients that are the
[45:51.840 --> 45:58.240]  highest quality new tropic. That's building blocks that your brain needs 1776 and we will
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.480]  sell out of that by next week. So I have to end that special 40% off brain force, 40%
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.200]  off silver bullet colloidal silver. This was sold out until a day ago because it came back
[46:07.200 --> 46:14.080]  in. I'm still doing it 30% off our flagship product DNA force with the bio PQQ and more
[46:14.080 --> 46:20.360]  20% off all pro pure water filters, 20% off all Alexa pure air filters. We already have
[46:20.360 --> 46:26.280]  the lowest price on all this 30% off all survival shield X to 30% off all supermail
[46:26.280 --> 46:32.520]  vitality, 30% off vitamin mineral fusion, 30% off secret 12 vitamin B 12, 30% off DNA
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.160]  force, 20% off all survival seeds, the biggest selection out there, lowest prices, 20% off
[46:37.160 --> 46:43.240]  all T shirts and other apparel, 30% off all liver shield, 30% off deep cleanse, parasite
[46:43.240 --> 46:49.080]  cleanse, 30% off and throw Plex similar to supermail vitality, a little less expensive.
[46:49.080 --> 46:54.640]  This is the dry formula 30% off knock out the amazing sleep aid and I want to salute
[46:54.640 --> 46:59.320]  and thank everyone who has been taking advantage of this sale who have been wearing the Hillary
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.240]  for prison shirts. You're making the news around the country. You're showing the power
[47:03.240 --> 47:07.600]  of grassroots activism. You're lighting the way to the future even if they flip on the
[47:07.600 --> 47:12.080]  internet kill switch of how we're going to resist at the grassroots level with information
[47:12.080 --> 47:17.200]  warfare and we're breaking through globally. I used to get attacked every few weeks on
[47:17.200 --> 47:27.440]  national TV. I'm attacked every day CNN, MSNBC, all the big nightly shows, the comedy programs,
[47:27.440 --> 47:34.280]  comedy central, the late show. We got a clip of that coming up. We're having a giant effect.
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.600]  We're changing the narrative from the fantasy land race war globalist disinfo to how the
[47:39.600 --> 47:44.200]  new world order is manipulating countries and populations against each other and creating
[47:44.200 --> 47:50.800]  dependency and creating poverty as a tool of control. They call agenda 21 and the Cloward
[47:50.800 --> 47:58.000]  and Pivens strategy. They admit their world governments in trouble in the people's daily
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.160]  and communist China in the Economist magazine today in the Washington Post in the financial
[48:03.160 --> 48:09.320]  times of London. They say made a red alert. Our whole program is disintegrating. I've
[48:09.320 --> 48:14.000]  been on air 21 years. I've been politically active for 25 years. I've been reading globalist
[48:14.000 --> 48:20.600]  white papers and books since I was 12 years old, 30 years. And I've never seen these
[48:20.600 --> 48:24.760]  arrogant people say they're in red level crisis. I've never seen them running around
[48:24.760 --> 48:31.520]  Mayday. If they were an old galleon shit, they're hold me on fire. Their magazine's
[48:31.520 --> 48:37.560]  about to explode. There's 500 foot flames shooting up as their master engulfed in flame. Just
[48:37.560 --> 48:46.080]  keep firing into them. Blast them to hell. Send them to the bottom. So say people cowering
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.680]  to the government cowering to the criminal elements. It's not the government. It's criminals
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.560]  that hijacked it. They're so desperate. They're trying to start a race war and have the president
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.200]  and others actually promoting blowing police heads off and shooting people in the back.
[49:00.200 --> 49:06.080]  They're red level criminals and we're coming for them. What you just think we could beat
[49:06.080 --> 49:14.360]  tyranny in the past. We can't do it now. All you got to do is have the spirit of indomitable
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.520]  strength that God's given us that our forebearers had like George Washington had and like Donald
[49:19.520 --> 49:22.720]  Trump's got when he's out there in front of those crowds. Somebody rushes the stage to
[49:22.720 --> 49:30.480]  attack him. He rushes at them. All that is is how a man acts and the return of men is
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.240]  coming right when they try to launch their computer takeovers right when they try to
[49:34.240 --> 49:38.520]  bring in all their robots and tell us we're ugly and worthless and increase the poison
[49:38.520 --> 49:43.160]  in the food and water because they're desperate. They're running around like chickens with
[49:43.160 --> 49:48.180]  their heads cut off. They're going down. They're going. They just went down with the
[49:48.180 --> 49:53.520]  Brexit. They're going down all over the world. All these fake countries and fake unions the
[49:53.520 --> 49:59.360]  colonialists built are falling apart. World government is neocolonialism. It's the final
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.120]  step. Mega corporations above the law with diplomatic immunity wrecking our economies
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.360]  exempting themselves from their economic warfare and telling us how liberal they are
[50:09.360 --> 50:17.520]  all day and playing us off against each other in a great game. Balkanization program. Well,
[50:17.520 --> 50:23.320]  guess what? That's over. This is the beginning of the long march against tyranny. So listen
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.240]  to me. I want to thank you for your support. I want to salute you and I want you to know
[50:28.240 --> 50:34.520]  when you fund us, you see the action. You see more reporters, more stories, more, more
[50:34.520 --> 50:41.000]  devastating payloads in the info war fired at the enemy with spectacular results. If
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  info wars was a submarine, we've sunk thousands of globalist cargo ships, battleships, weapons
[50:47.000 --> 50:53.120]  carriers, missile cruisers. And now we want more submarines, more weapons to go out and
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.880]  devastate the enemy. No one's ever stood up to him. All we're doing standing up. You stood
[50:57.880 --> 51:01.400]  up with us. Your funding is essential. Thank you. Who's among the worst at keeping your

[54:37.520 --> 54:42.560]  to be drinking beer and playing fantasy football. I'm going to engage the new world order. We're
[54:42.560 --> 54:50.640]  going to make history together. We're going to ride. Ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds.
[54:50.640 --> 54:56.400]  Ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind. We're going to make
[54:56.400 --> 55:04.840]  history. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot lose even if Trump loses because he was involved
[55:04.840 --> 55:10.780]  in the fight against tyranny. Donald Trump has already won. Donald Trump has already
[55:10.780 --> 55:15.720]  defeated the corrupt Republican Party system and changed it forever and led the way as
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.760]  a true trailblazer. That's the secret about the man in the arena. He wins whether he loses
[55:21.760 --> 55:34.240]  or not. The only way you fail is by not engaging. Now, we have the light show CBS with Stephen
[55:34.240 --> 55:39.280]  Colbert, and I guess his name is Eric Anders, who wanted to come up on stage, so I had him
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.720]  on stage. He said some pretty silly stuff. At one of the speeches I gave at the RNC,
[55:45.720 --> 55:48.440]  but I'd make a big deal about it when he came and disrupted us. I didn't call the police
[55:48.440 --> 55:54.760]  on him like the young Turks did. But you notice Colbert here tries to act like I'm waging
[55:54.760 --> 56:00.360]  war on information. He thinks his audience is stupid and doesn't know what info wars
[56:00.360 --> 56:08.240]  is. Information warfare or IW is a concept involving the use and management of information
[56:08.240 --> 56:13.520]  and communication technology in pursuit of competitive advantage over an opponent. Information
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.960]  warfare may involve collection of tactical information, assurances that one's own information
[56:18.960 --> 56:24.160]  is valid, spreading a propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate. That's black
[56:24.160 --> 56:28.340]  propaganda. We don't use that. The enemy and the public undermining the quality of opposing
[56:28.340 --> 56:33.680]  force information and denial of information collected opportunities to the opposing forces.
[56:33.680 --> 56:39.640]  Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare. The United States military focus
[56:39.640 --> 56:44.800]  tends to favor technology and hence tends to extend into the realms of electronic warfare,
[56:44.800 --> 56:51.520]  cyber warfare, information assurance, computer network operations, attack and defense. But
[56:51.520 --> 56:59.120]  in our term it is mostly used in information operations and more human related aspects
[56:59.120 --> 57:05.760]  of information use. Social network analytics, decision analysis and human aspects of command
[57:05.760 --> 57:11.320]  and control. We expose how things really work. We get into the nuts and bolts. We read from
[57:11.320 --> 57:17.920]  bills. We go through the gatekeepers and go right to the data. Now that's what information
[57:17.920 --> 57:25.120]  warfare is in a quick snapshot. Vic Vreeland who came from the name Info Wars had been
[57:25.120 --> 57:29.480]  in Air Force Intelligence and he said, what you do is information warfare. And I knew
[57:29.480 --> 57:32.480]  what Info War was. He goes here, let's go see if it's available. And I registered that
[57:32.480 --> 57:39.120]  little baby in 1996 sitting at his house. He was the deputy fire chief at that time.
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.320]  And that's why it's called Info Wars and no one else thought to go get it. Well, that's
[57:42.320 --> 57:47.280]  what we do. And it was, I think meant to happen that that took place. But here they are making
[57:47.280 --> 57:53.320]  jokes on their audience, a form of information war against them hoping they think that I'm
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.800]  at war with enlightenment when it's the opposite. Here it is.
[57:56.800 --> 58:01.440]  I love awkwardness. Me too. I like feeling awkwardness myself and putting myself in embarrassing
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.760]  situations. Do you enjoy that? Yeah, I love it. I get very red hot when I do it. You did
[58:06.760 --> 58:12.720]  that recently. You went to the RNC. I went to the RNC. I did too. It was fun, wasn't
[58:12.720 --> 58:18.760]  it? Yeah, it was exciting. I jammed out with Alex Jones from Info Wars. Info Wars. He's
[58:18.760 --> 58:26.000]  on a war against info. He's so against a war. He's so on a war against info. He doesn't
[58:26.000 --> 58:31.320]  want to know about the nation. He don't care about the nation. He doesn't want any nation.
[58:31.320 --> 58:36.120]  Just the info. And that's why I'm not entirely sure the crowd enjoyed your appearance as
[58:36.120 --> 58:40.800]  long as I did. There's more. We'll be right back. Stay with us for the second hour. Thank
[58:40.800 --> 58:51.840]  you for listening to GCN. Visit gcnlive.com today. If you ever wanted a great deal on
[58:51.840 --> 58:56.000]  a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.600]  going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends, we already see major
[59:00.600 --> 59:05.160]  power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar generators really
[59:05.160 --> 59:10.160]  do provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators run
[59:10.160 --> 59:15.000]  silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.840]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[59:19.840 --> 59:23.200]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[59:23.200 --> 59:28.640]  this week. Solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[59:28.640 --> 59:33.120]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition
[59:33.120 --> 59:37.400]  to the low price for info wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to
[59:37.400 --> 59:43.440]  grid wars.com. That's grid wars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[59:43.440 --> 59:52.200]  with minimum money. Go to grid wars.com. That's grid wars.com.
[59:52.200 --> 01:00:06.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:16.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. 800-25-99231 is the toll free number to join us. I'm going
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:23.040]  to take calls this hour and the next. Bill Federer has been on before many years ago.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.080]  The American Minute ran into him at the RNC. He's going to be joining us in the third hour.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.800]  Rob Duel hosts the fourth hour on this Friday edition. I'm brainstorming here and I'm brainstorming
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.760]  with some of the Trump people, not Roger Stone. I know someone even closer to Trump than Roger
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.540]  Stone. I'm making the joke you can't get any closer. But I've been brainstorming with Roger
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:51.080]  Stone as well that it's known that Hillary is ongoing stealing the nomination process,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.760]  has now done that, and will try to steal the election. She's seven to ten points behind
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:03.200]  every major poll. She is in deep caca. So what do you expect them to do? What do you
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.380]  expect them to do? Well, we know what they're ongoing doing. They are stealing the election.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:12.480]  It is happening. We're going to block it. We're not going to put up with it. And when
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.040]  you fight an election theft, you can beat it. And I think you should start fighting
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.640]  it before the final phase because if Trump comes out and points out she already stole
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.480]  it from Sanders and shows the evidence that we're collating and others have already collated
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.760]  and it's been collated but we're putting together, then it's the end of crooked Hillary. Everybody
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:41.560]  knows about her emails, all the lies. The time has come. The time is now. And we shall
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.760]  go on to the end, whatever the cost may be. We shall defend our republic. We shall never
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:51.800]  surrender. Let's go ahead and go to Greg in Wisconsin. Greg, what do you think? I mean,
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.320]  am I right? She stole it? They admit that. I mean, she's going to try to steal the general
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:01.520]  election, isn't she? Yeah, I definitely think so. I'm a truck
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.520]  driver and I was at a restaurant 20 miles outside of St. Paul and I was looking at the
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.960]  pioneer press there and they had pictures of Hillary with big smiles, color that was
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:20.040]  huge. It took up like 50% of the paper and they were talking about this sob story, pushing
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.000]  these people. One woman who lost her husband, which is tragic, but she was basically using
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.040]  her and the truck pictures were him facing away from the camera. People were dropping
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.920]  their glasses, dropping their signs. They were talking about how he was committing treason
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:44.000]  for daring Russia to get those other emails. Well, I played the Trump clip a few days ago
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.520]  where he said, Russia, if you're listening, please release the other emails. The FBI admits
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.920]  at least four foreign governments were inside her server. That's their job. That's our
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.120]  job is to get into their stuff. And so he's saying, please release it, which is what he
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.040]  should do. He doubled down instead of them saying, oh, look, you're a Russian agent.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.200]  He's like, nothing to do with Russia. The point is, is that she's a crooked Hillary.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.920]  So thank God that, you know, they're doing this. So we're going to play that clip coming
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:19.960]  up since you mentioned it because I was just thinking about how amazing that was this morning.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.960]  What else do you think, Greg? What do we do to counter this?
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:29.920]  Well, I definitely think that everyone needs to go out in the boat. And I think that she's
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.800]  definitely trying to steal it. I mean, you know, I was watching the DNC too. And I noticed
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.920]  that before Hillary spoke a few days before, everyone was up in arms. Everyone was shot
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.240]  at the stage. And then all of a sudden she gets on stage and there was a line. She said,
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:49.840]  she said, if I'm playing the woman card, then deal me in. And before she said, deal me in,
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.200]  there was a whole bunch of people who said, deal me in. And she was like a second behind.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.760]  So there were plans in the audience.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.560]  Oh, sir, it's admitted that, that, that all the real delegates, whatever they would
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.040]  leave to go to the bathroom were not let back in. And then they put all their own people
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.240]  in. It's totally completely synthetic like a Hollywood movie, like a third world nation.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.920]  And this is the cult we're dealing with. Here's the good news, though. They have forever absolutely
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.440]  alienated much of their base that actually means well, that's against TPP and stuff.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.240]  They're going to be joining the Patriot movement if we reach out to them. We can now deprogram
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.760]  all these socialists and liberals. I'm telling you, they're finally ready to understand what
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.880]  we're talking about. They weren't out protesting really. Trump, they were out protesting crooked
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.240]  Hillary because they know, and a lot of them are going to vote for Trump now, which tells
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.120]  you he should win in a landslide or it's a fraud. Great points, Greg. I'm going to come
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.800]  back and talk to Steven, Carl, Ethan, Justin and others, 800-25-99-231. First, I'm going
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.800]  to play three clips, though. The late show with Colbert putting out this info against
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.840]  info wars. We're going to get to the super delegate admitting they're going to steal
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.720]  it for Hillary. And we've got Hillary saying something very interesting.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:08.440]  Trump slams Hillary's DNC speech and denounces her globalist agenda. Donald Trump immediately
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.880]  reacted to Hillary Clinton's keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention last
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:20.360]  night, sending out a series of tweets hitting her on her economic and foreign policies.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:26.120]  Trump says Hillary will never reform Wall Street because she is owned by Wall Street.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:32.760]  And he says that Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power,
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:40.000]  no jobs and no safety. Trump also slammed Hillary for being soft on the threat of terrorism,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.440]  noting that Americans' way of life is under threat by radical Islam. And Hillary Clinton
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:52.200]  can't even bring herself to say the words. And in a final tweet, Trump urged that no
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:06:19.040]  one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.320]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone

[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:29.080]  Information Warfare, from my perspective, uses the ultimate weapon, the truth, justice,
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.080]  common sense, honor.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:40.080]  It's white hot, and we deal it out every day.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.080]  Information Warfare in defense of the Republic.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:50.080]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lines, and disinformation.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.080]  The light show of Stephen Corbair, though, has come out with a new definition of info wars,
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]  and attacked us.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080]  We're going to be playing that clip in full coming up.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.080]  Your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.080]  But first, I want to play a clip from her speech last night.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.080]  The DNC's now over.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  We're three months in a week and a half out, or less, from the general election.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.080]  And she said, democracy is broken in America.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.080]  Our voting system is in trouble.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:29.080]  She's the one that just stole at least 10 primary states, 80-20 on the street, nationwide,
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.080]  Bernie supporters.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.080]  Hillary had crowds of 1,000, 2,000.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080]  He'd have crowds of 20, 30,000.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.080]  She stole this.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080]  She lost the first primaries openly.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.080]  They say it doesn't matter.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080]  In New Hampshire, we talked to a California super delegate.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080]  He said, doesn't matter.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.080]  Doesn't matter what Sanders does.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080]  She will be the nominee.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.080]  And the Republicans came out and said the same thing, but we didn't buy into it,
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080]  so they didn't get away with it.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.080]  They've really miscalculated by openly stealing the election at the primary level and admitting it.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.080]  Trump can now come right out and say, you are ongoing stealing the election.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.080]  You are a fraudulent nominee.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:19.080]  You have had your emails hacked that you sent protesters to disrupt our First Amendment and to blame Bernie.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.080]  You should resign.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.080]  And then the globalists might blow up Trump's airplane, but then everyone will know they did it.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.080]  I mean, as long as we engage them, they lose.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:33.080]  Even if they destroy Trump or destroy myself or go after Matt Drudge, I mean, I'm telling you,
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.080]  you already saw the Supreme Court Justice drop dead.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.080]  And then it came out in the Washington Post.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.080]  Oh, they covered it up because it was a secret society.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080]  Oh, that he got invited to.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.080]  Oh, we were there and said, this place is like Bohemian Grove.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.080]  And then a month later, they said it was a spinoff of Bohemian Grove.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.080]  That's how tuned in we are.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:00.080]  And I'm not bragging, but let me tell you, it's like a police detective that's been tracking a serial killer in an area for 20 years.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:07.080]  After 20 years tracking a serial killer and you found 40-something dead bodies, you know this guy.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.080]  You know him and so many times when they actually catch him, it's exactly who the profilers thought.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080]  I have been doing this 20-plus years.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.080]  I know these people.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080]  I know them.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.080]  Let me tell you, it isn't hard to know they're going to steal this election.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.080]  And Trump better fight it.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:30.080]  And he is planning to.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.080]  And I have an incredible responsibility.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:39.080]  And so does info wars to get all these people that have admitted they're doing this to get the Delos together to show how they did it state by state to put the evidence on.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080]  It's been in the New York Daily News.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:46.080]  It's been everywhere admitted that they met in secret in California today before and he was going to win by landslide and early voting.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.080]  They already knew and they just said, these will be the numbers.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.080]  This is how the super delegates vote and the super delegates even voted to like have a percentage for Bernie, the made up percentage they wanted.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.080]  I mean, it's like tea parties with three year old girls or something.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.080]  They just had a fantasy land deal.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:07.080]  And it was okay because AP was there and CNN was there.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080]  Oh, the media was there.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:15.080]  Don't worry when we stole the primary that put Hillary over the top.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.080]  So we're taking calls about how do we fight this?
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.080]  What do we do?
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.080]  What does Trump do?
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.080]  But we're going to write articles in the next few weeks, videos, you name it.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.080]  We're going to hit Trump with them so he can retweet them, get them out.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:37.080]  And the media will attack him if he just puts out the research and then he can respond.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.080]  That might be the best way.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.080]  And I know the White House is watching right now.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080]  Look at you unhappy people.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080]  You look like you're living in hell or something.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:51.080]  You're unhappy because your dirt bags out to get humanity.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.080]  I know you're blackmailed and scared, Obama.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:57.080]  I don't think you're as evil as Hillary, but you're pretty darn evil.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.080]  And I know you think this is all funny, but deep down, you know, it's not funny.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.080]  The globalists are in all these publications admitting world governments in trouble.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080]  You're never going to get that world government slot.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.080]  You're never, look at your UN event down there with the Olympics.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.080]  It's a giant cesspool.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.080]  Everything you do turns to absolute garbage.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.080]  Let's go ahead and go to Hillary with the double speak, the 180 from reality about our democracy,
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.080]  our voting is in trouble and she's the one that's going to save us from her.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.080]  Here it is.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:36.080]  I believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.080]  And she's bought by special interest.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.080]  Let's play that again.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.080]  She's also bought by special interest.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:51.080]  I believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.080]  All right, here's the article from February 12th this year.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080]  Great article by Kit Daniels.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080]  It should be more hardcore.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080]  We're going to put it back out.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.080]  I mean, I'm not blaming Kit.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.080]  It's just hard to believe when this was first starting and we were telling people in February,
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.080]  they're stealing superdelegates.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:08.080]  They would have national stories saying I was crazy even though it was happening.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.080]  So Kit said, Hillary superdelegate, why your vote doesn't count?
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.080]  Hillary already has over half the superdelegates and is expected to gain more.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:23.080]  And this guy is a democratic California out of California, but a national superdelegate.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:33.080]  And we've got him in the bar, you know, where they were having press conferences admitting the entire thing.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080]  Mr. Valhalla.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080]  That's a cool name.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.080]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.080]  Isn't that just special?
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.080]  Bob Mulholland.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080]  And he is a superdelegate.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.080]  You know, look, he was a Hillary superdelegate for California.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.080]  So was the governor.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.080]  This is a high-level democratic operative, just arrogantly, just like the Republicans went on TV and said your vote doesn't count.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.080]  But he does a little bit smoother.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080]  He goes, Bernie, you'll get some.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.080]  You'll get a little piece of stuff off the table.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.080]  Let's play the clip.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.080]  It sounds like Hillary is going to have a huge edge when it comes to superdelegates.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.080]  Is that correct?
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.080]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.080]  Former DNC chairs like Howard Dean, who's from Vermont, he's known Bernie for decades.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.080]  He's for Hillary.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.080]  Yeah.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.080]  The people who have worked with Hillary for decades are big supporters of her.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.080]  If they haven't said so yet, they will over the next several weeks.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:34.080]  So roughly, when it comes to the Democratic National Convention, what is the rough total of delegates that are going to be available for the DNC?
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.080]  Right now, about 4,800.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.080]  So you need about almost 2,400 to get the nomination.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:46.080]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in election gets delegates.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.080]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:53.080]  Sanders will end up with well over 1,000 delegates, and Hillary will get the nomination.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.080]  Okay.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.080]  Now, the superdelegates are basically what Hillary pretty much already has in her pocket.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.080]  How many delegates is that amount?
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.080]  750 delegates.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.080]  My guess is she probably has half of them committed to her.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:10.080]  But she's out there working the precincts and working the states every day for every vote.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080]  And March 1st is super Tuesday.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:29.080]  At the end of the day, you will see that Hillary has the most delegates of regular people from caucuses like Iowa, from New Hampshire, Primer, Nevada, South Carolina, and then all those states on March 1st.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.080]  Now, he did it slicker than the Republicans. The Republicans just went on TV and said, look, your vote doesn't count, never has.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.080]  If I can have that George Will article, guys, you know, we are the sovereigns we decide.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.080]  But that backfired.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080]  But here he is.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.080]  Oh, yeah, she's already got him committed.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.080]  So it doesn't matter if Sanders really wins, just like New Hampshire.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:54.080]  Right after this happened, New Hampshire, he got 20% more than Hillary, and she got way more delegates.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.080]  That's how this works.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.080]  And I know you, the audience knows this, we've got to get this out to everybody.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.080]  All right, I'm going to go to this last clip dealing with information warfare.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:11.080]  I'm going to go to break and come right back with Stephen and Justin and Carl and Ethan and everybody else that's holding.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.080]  I'm going right to you after this break for the balance of the hour.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:19.080]  But here is Stephen Colbert on CBS with a comedian.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:22.080]  His name is Eric Andre, one of the guys that climbed from the stage.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080]  I mean, I invited him up.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080]  I wonder what he had to say.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:34.080]  And here he is making a joke about info wars when information warfare means fighting with information, whether it's true or not true.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.080]  We fight with the truth.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.080]  But the point is there's an info war going on.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]  There's a war on for your mind.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]  It's all about information.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080]  It's all about more information.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.080]  It's all about how stuff actually works.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.080]  They hope you just don't pay attention and they can lie to you about what information warfare is.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]  Here it is.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.080]  Yeah, I love awkwardness.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080]  Me too.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.080]  I love awkwardness myself and putting myself in embarrassing situations.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.080]  Do you enjoy that too?
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.080]  I get very red hot when I do it.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080]  You did that recently.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.080]  You went to the RNC.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.080]  I went to the RNC.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.080]  I did too.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.080]  It was fun, wasn't it?
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.080]  Yeah, it was exciting.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.080]  I jammed out with Alex Jones.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.080]  From info wars.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]  From info wars.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:17.080]  He's on a war against info.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080]  He's still on a war against info.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.080]  He doesn't want to know about the nation.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.080]  He doesn't care about the nation.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.080]  He doesn't want any nation.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.080]  Just the info.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  So they're targeting low information butters.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.080]  I'm not entirely sure.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.080]  The crowd enjoyed your appearance as much as I did.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.080]  They didn't.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.080]  But I enjoyed it very much.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.080]  And they're telling him I'm low information.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.080]  Oh, the opposite.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.080]  It's very exciting.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.080]  Alex, this is what I'm going to do with Alex.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080]  Hey, why bring the Daily Show guy up here?
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.080]  I mean, you seem like you're upset.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.080]  I want you to have sex with my wife.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.080]  Oh, so the crowd is talking.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.080]  Can I just say hi?
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.080]  I'm on my side.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080]  I'm trying to get on stage.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080]  I'm trying to get on stage.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080]  Hey, let's get this guy back on.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.080]  He won't use profanity.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.080]  He's really talking about.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.080]  You're not.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.080]  Coachella sucks this year.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.080]  And then they went on from there.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]  That's just crazy.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.080]  They're saying that we don't want information,
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.080]  that we're in a war against information when we're here
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.080]  showing you how they're stealing the election,
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.080]  showing you by the numbers,
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080]  going over the facts,
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080]  showing you that the globalists are admitting
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]  they're bringing in a world government,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.080]  that we're going under a TPP that is unelected
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.080]  and will control our lives to a great extent
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.080]  by multinationals that are tax exempt and above the law.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:36.080]  And their answer is to make a joke out of it.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.080]  Just like on other programs, Jimmy Fallon,
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080]  they're up there going,
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.080]  you down with TPP to Obama goes, yeah, you know me.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.080]  So it's cute TPP targeting people in a happy state,
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.080]  drinking beer at home at 11 at night.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.080]  They just laugh about TPP, foreign group taking over,
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080]  and Congress not even allowed to tell the public what's in it,
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]  and all the rest of it,
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.080]  because you know we're low information.

[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.080]  The security industry uses hordes of salesmen to scare you

[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.080]  This is when he has to come out and say she's stealing.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.080]  Not when they put out fake polls later saying he's behind,
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.080]  and then he says she's stealing.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:37.080]  Folks aren't going to fully understand that.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080]  Trump has to pre-strike.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.080]  She's already stealing the nomination.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.080]  He must target her with the truth
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.080]  and expose the rest of her crimes.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.080]  America is ready, ready to embrace the truth.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.080]  All right, Stephen, then Kyle,
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.080]  then Justin, Ethan, Carl, and others.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.080]  Stephen in Florida, thanks for calling.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.080]  You're on the air worldwide on this Friday edition, sir.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.080]  First of all, I wanted to, I've been named to bring this up
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.080]  every time I call and I forget.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.080]  Your top-of-the-line water purification system,
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.080]  of which I've got one, it's great.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.080]  I'm just wondering if it's coincidence or destiny
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.080]  that the first four letters in the name of it is A-L-E-X.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.080]  Well, that is the folks that have my Patriot supply
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.080]  now undoubtedly the biggest storeable foods company
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.080]  in the nation, only after eight years
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.080]  because they have really good quality and very, very low prices.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.080]  They can solidate like five big companies up in Utah
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.080]  who are already experts.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080]  And so we are the main distributor of it.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080]  It's a great gravity-fed filter.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.080]  There's several other great brands as well,
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.080]  but depending on the specs, some are better than in one area,
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.080]  some are better than another, but I love the Alexa Pure.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.080]  I think it's as good as it gets.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.080]  So their survival type straw system they have is excellent as well.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.080]  And we do sell all that.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.080]  And again, we fund our operation with a gravity-fed filter
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.080]  that sits on your counter that you still get the good minerals,
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080]  but not all the other bad garbage.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080]  It either totally removes it or removes it like 99%
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.080]  depending on which compound.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.080]  And this is what I use at my home in the other areas.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.080]  I just found it interesting that it starts with the word Alex.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.080]  Yeah, I think they did probably do that.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  I mean, they know whatever reason that's where their biggest market.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.080]  And so I guess it's Alexa Pure.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.080]  Folks who pointed that out around here,
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.080]  but that name is not copyrighted.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.080]  So it's fine for them to use it.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.080]  So anyway, the reason I called about this whole situation
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.080]  with what's going on in the political scheme of things,
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.080]  and I remember some years ago you had given an analogy
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:43.080]  and I fully agreed with this and I still do that.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.080]  America, you saw it like a passenger plane
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.080]  where it was in descent with the engines burned up.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.080]  And then you said, now we're at the point, if you remember,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.080]  where you said, we're now heading with the nose straight down
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.080]  and we're heading for a crash.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080]  Now, the thing I want to say is this, Alex,
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.080]  you look at what's going on, all the, you know,
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.080]  progress so-called, it's regress,
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.080]  the progress the globalists have made with the food, the water,
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.080]  the propaganda, black propaganda to the media,
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.080]  dumbing down of our whole culture,
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.080]  the corruption in the political scheme,
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.080]  how we're trying to provoke our enemies into World War III,
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.080]  you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.080]  and it's, you know, Huxley's Brave New World,
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.080]  you know, Orwell's 1984 on steroids.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.080]  And here's what I want to say.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.080]  I have a greater concern as much as I hate the fact
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.080]  that we have a prospect of an evil person like Hillary
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.080]  becoming our next president.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.080]  It's going to be far worse than Obama, that's for sure.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080]  I hear you, and if we get, you know, Hillary,
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.080]  and she's going to try to totally collapse the country further,
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.080]  get us into wars, but it will wake people up faster.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.080]  My whole point is, is that if she openly steals the election,
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:04.080]  she will go in as a wounded, floundering platypus.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.080]  Well, here's my main concern, though,
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.080]  with that analogy again about the passenger plane.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.080]  This is what people don't understand.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.080]  The main thing is not what the global is for doing.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.080]  What I see is an invisible hand that has its hand at the back,
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.080]  the tail of that plane.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.080]  Sure, the big mega banks are trying to scuttle the country
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.080]  so they can consolidate not just our nation but others.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]  It's the same program.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.080]  And Trump just doesn't want to destroy America.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.080]  He's not perfect, but he doesn't want to destroy the country.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.080]  Yeah, no, that's not what I mean, Alex.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.080]  Here's the thing you mentioned yesterday and today
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.080]  about the judgment of God.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.080]  We have made God our enemy.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.080]  And just like ancient Israel, when you read the Bible,
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.080]  he is now unleashing, he is allowing our enemies to take us over.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.080]  And it is because we have made ourselves his enemy
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  by what we are doing.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.080]  And the main problem in America,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.080]  I said this to Zachariah the other day,
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.080]  is the fake Christianity in here that's supposed to be the kind of...
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.080]  Listen, I totally agree with you.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.080]  God bless you.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.080]  I've got to jump to the break and come back with more calls.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080]  But you're dead on.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.080]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.080]  It is the fake Christianity.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.080]  I'm not on some Pharisee high horse and I'm Mr. Perfect.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.080]  But they just don't fight tyranny.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.080]  They don't fight abortion.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080]  They don't fight...
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.080]  Talk about literally being brought under God's judgment.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.080]  Drug-resistant TV is killing record numbers of people.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.080]  It's exploding all over the country,
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.080]  mainly in primary and secondary schools.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.080]  Or they just put illegals in with it to spread it
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.080]  instead of giving them treatment.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:42.080]  I mean, talk about consciously bringing plagues upon America.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:47.080]  We have people in office who literally want us to collapse.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.080]  So they're bringing in poor, helpless, disease people.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.080]  And they're not even treating them.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.080]  The Empires on the Run.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:30:00.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:07.080]  Trump slams Hillary's DNC speech and denounces her globalist agenda.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.080]  Donald Trump immediately reacted to Hillary Clinton's keynote speech
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:14.080]  at the Democratic National Convention last night,
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:20.080]  sending out a series of tweets hitting her on her economic and foreign policies.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:26.080]  Trump says Hillary will never reform Wall Street because she is owned by Wall Street.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:30.080]  And he says that Hillary's vision is a borderless world
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:35.080]  where working people have no power, no jobs, and no safety.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.080]  Trump also slammed Hillary for being soft on the threat of terrorism,
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.080]  noting that Americans' way of life is under threat by radical Islam.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:49.080]  And Hillary Clinton can't even bring herself to say the words.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:56.080]  And in a final tweet, Trump urged that no one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:25.080]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:32.080]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:37.080]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.080]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:43.080]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.080]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.080]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.080]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:59.080]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.080]  We have the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.080]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.080]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.080]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:38.080]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.080]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.080]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.080]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:51.080]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:54.080]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.080]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.080]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:06.080]  I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:10.080]  and just, you know, sit back because here they come again.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:14.080]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080]  I'm running for president.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:35.080]  Everyday Americans need a champion and I want to be that champion.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.080]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.080]  I come too far.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.080]  I ain't no ways tired.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.080]  Me, oh, man.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.080]  How is that? Is that a dog?
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.080]  It has been reported you've made five million making speeches.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.080]  The president has made more than a hundred million dollars.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.080]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.080]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.080]  My sister-in-law.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.080]  I don't know why that's funny.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.080]  Another conspiracy theory.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.080]  Have you always told the truth?
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.080]  I've always tried to. Always. Always.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.080]  I will fight to reign in Wall Street.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.080]  And you know what? I know how to do it.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.080]  He came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in-depth.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.080]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.080]  It was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport,
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:41.080]  but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.080]  A little sip. Open up.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:35:05.080]  Come on, take it. Take it.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.080]  Mary and Joseph.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.080]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.080]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.080]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.080]  Thank you, Hillary.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.080]  I'm going to get back to what George Will said.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.080]  I'm going to take about seven or eight calls in April
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.080]  about how there's no way he'd ever pull ahead
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.080]  if he was the nominee of Hillary.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.080]  And he's now seven to ten points in dozens of juicy polls.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.080]  Oh, I'm afraid Donald Trump's going to be elected the next president.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.080]  Number 45, what a perfect number.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.080]  I'm afraid the republic's going to actually fight for its life.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.080]  I'm afraid Russia is as well.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080]  And the UK.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.080]  Oh, there's so many problems.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:36:02.080]  And now all 25-plus members of the EU have started referendums to leave.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.080]  Oh, things aren't going too well.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.080]  They've hit the emergency button.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.080]  They're running around in their smoke-filled cabin.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.080]  Their ship is on fire.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.080]  It's a red alert, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.080]  And we've got Donald Trump saying,
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.080]  is that a dog when she does the dog barking?
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.080]  What about the hyenas?
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.080]  Now, I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.080]  I just want to point out that we are running the biggest special.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.080]  People might say, well, a couple months ago,
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.080]  he said it was the biggest special ever.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.080]  Yeah, because we're just expanding the specials more and more.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.080]  We're running the overall biggest special completely across the board.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.080]  40% off brain force, the neutropic.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.080]  40% off silver bullet.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.080]  Usually it's like 20% off some things,
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.080]  then maybe 50% off one thing or 30% off a few things.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.080]  This is like 40, 40, 40, 40, 40.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.080]  40% off swarable foods.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.080]  40% off silver bullet, colloidal silver.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.080]  40% off brain force.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.080]  30% off superfemal vitality.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.080]  Vitamin mineral fusion, 30% off.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.080]  Great way to get all the vitamins and minerals
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.080]  and cofactors and amino acids into your kids.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.080]  Great fruit punch.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.080]  30% off bioavailable vitamin B12 sublingual.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.080]  30% off DNA force.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.080]  That is big.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.080]  30% off DNA force.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.080]  20% off all survival seeds.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.080]  20% off all shirts.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.080]  30% off liver shield.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080]  30% off deep cleanse.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]  30% off anthroplex.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.080]  30% off knockout the sleep aid.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.080]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.080]  But take advantage because there's a few things
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.080]  that are going away tomorrow that we're either selling out of.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.080]  It's more than a few things.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.080]  I got to go meet after the show.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.080]  I know at least four or five things
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.080]  that are about to sell out.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.080]  So on top of all these specials, you can get free shipping
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.080]  on orders for the dollars or more
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.080]  and additionally 10% off on any items you sign up
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.080]  for auto ship infowarstore.com
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.080]  or toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.080]  And I want to thank you all for your prayers,
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.080]  spreading the word and buying the products
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.080]  we're self-funded. We're like 30% sponsor funded,
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.080]  70% funded off prisonplanet.tv subscriptions
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.080]  and water filtration systems and nutraceuticals
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.080]  and things like that.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.080]  And Hillary, for prison shirts, you know,
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.080]  usually shirts are just a statement to fight
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.080]  from the Second Amendment or to meet like-minded people.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.080]  They're not a big chunk of our funding now they are.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.080]  You know, before it was nutraceuticals,
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.080]  right now what's floating the boat is the t-shirts.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.080]  So we're going to be moving into more and more of that.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.080]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.080]  God bless you and I salute you.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.080]  You are the infowar.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.080]  Okay, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.080]  We've got Justin in New York,
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.080]  and I'm going to go to Kyle, Ethan, Carl and Andy.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.080]  Everybody in this segment.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:48.080]  Let's go to Justin in New York.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.080]  You're on the air. Thank you for joining us.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.080]  Hey, Alex. Thank you.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.080]  I've been listening to your show for about four years.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.080]  I really appreciate what you do.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.080]  Appreciate you, man.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.080]  I've been just doing some research on, you know,
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.080]  how election fraud may or may not have taken place
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.080]  in the history of our country.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.080]  And I think really a big game changer,
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.080]  especially in the 21st century, is these voting machines.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  You know, I've seen the video there that David Knight did
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:24.080]  while at the DNC about the Microsoft voting machines.
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.080]  Now, I know that there's several ways
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.080]  that Hillary Clinton can steal the election.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080]  I would like to... I know you had mentioned...
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.080]  I'm not worried about Harris and others on it.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.080]  I used to have to call your brothers
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080]  when they were still alive on others.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080]  There are thousands of admitted cases of election fraud.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  We've had DiBold, chief engineers go public,
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.080]  and explain how they were ordered to do it.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.080]  We've had both parties do it, but historically,
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.080]  the Democrats are the kings of retail fraud,
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.080]  dead people voting, illegals voting,
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.080]  and the kings of electronic fraud over the Republicans.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.080]  It's just a historic fact that they are the kingpins.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.080]  It doesn't mean they don't do it.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.080]  And there was some evidence
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.080]  that they were cheating Al Gore in Florida.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.080]  Gosh, I don't know who's worse, Al Gore or George Bush.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.080]  The point is, I am for the integrity of the voting system.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080]  I just tell it like it is.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:18.080]  And if we see any evidence of overzealous Trump people
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.080]  engaged in election fraud, I will stand against that,
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.080]  because we can't turn into who they are.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.080]  But we need to really be exposing what's happening,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.080]  because this could be one of our last,
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.080]  I think probably the last so-called election if she steals it.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.080]  I mean, we'll still have elections,
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.080]  but it'll be like the old Soviet Union.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.080]  I just wanted to get out there, though,
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.080]  that I think like I'm picking a look at these polls
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.080]  where Trump is seven to 10 points ahead,
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.080]  and that's fantastic.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.080]  What I'm afraid is that they will take these voting machines
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.080]  and tweak their quote-unquote algorithms
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.080]  to rig the election to where,
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:01.080]  even if Trump is 7% or 10% ahead in the nation,
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:05.080]  that they will rig it to compensate for that
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.080]  where no matter how much he's ahead,
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.080]  they're still going to steal it.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:13.080]  Let me tell you, historically,
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:14.080]  it's very hard to steal a landslide
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.080]  unless it's a stolen election.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.080]  And if they do that,
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.080]  we're having very serious talks personally,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.080]  and I know I've had those with Stone.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.080]  Like, let's try to get Stone on.
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.080]  It's a quickening.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.080]  I'll try to get Stone on.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.080]  Maybe even to pop in the last 10, 15 minutes or this Sunday,
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.080]  I'll be here live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.080]  because I want to have a whole hour-long discussion
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.080]  about what do we do if they steal the election?
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.080]  Because for me, and I think Stone agrees,
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.080]  and I think the Donald knows this,
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.080]  I don't think I know the Donald knows this,
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.080]  that this is a real issue and front and center.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.080]  Absolutely.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.080]  You know, another thing is,
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:54.080]  and this might be an even easier option for Hillary,
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.080]  is to rig the polls so that when the election comes about,
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:03.080]  they can rig the election as they had planned
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.080]  and say, oh, well, you know,
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.080]  Hillary's been winning this entire time anyway.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080]  There's no way the election will happen.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.080]  Sure, and they'll have George Will and an entire group of rhinos
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.080]  come out and say, we told you he'd always lose.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.080]  See, we're right. See, we're right. See, we're right.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.080]  Absolutely great point.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:22.080]  Yeah, look, it's important he have a big margin
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.080]  in the popular vote because that's a moral authority.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.080]  They are going to try to steal California.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080]  I think he's going to win in California.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:34.080]  I know a lot of Hispanics who are citizens who love Trump.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.080]  In fact, some polls show upwards of half.
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.080]  In fact, remember, he got the vast majority
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  and we're still like six, seven candidates
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:48.080]  in major states of Hispanic voters who are Republican.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:51.080]  But I know a lot of people who aren't even citizens that like Trump.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:59.080]  Again, it's a bullying lie that, say, Hispanic Americans
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.080]  don't want border control.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080]  They're not idiots. In fact, they know better than other people.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:09.080]  In fact, even ABC News, remember, and even Scarborough, NBC,
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.080]  had his liberal reporters on going,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.080]  look, I went down to the border and Hispanics want more border control
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:19.080]  than the Anglos or blacks.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.080]  Do you have any idea what it's like down there?
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.080]  I mean, it's really scary in many areas.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:32.080]  And it's people from China and Guatemala and Syria.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.080]  I mean, it's scary, folks.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.080]  At one border patrol sector in South Texas,
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.080]  you can look the numbers up.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.080]  Last time I looked, it was tens of thousands of other than Mexicans
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.080]  in one month.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.080]  And I don't mean Nicaraguans, El Salvador,
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.080]  and that was a big part.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.080]  It was all over the world and some scary hombres.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.080]  I mean, it's like leaving your back door open at night.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:59.080]  They try to take common sense and act like it's insane.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:01.080]  You see, Trump owns a bunch of hotels
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:04.080]  and you can't get local help from the college students
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.080]  and all those folks because it's seasonal.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.080]  You've got to have people that are trained, know what they're doing,
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.080]  and he brings them in from Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.080]  And that's what Trump's going to do.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.080]  They're going to go in there with computer systems.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.080]  And if somebody in the felon and wants to work and gets into the system,
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.080]  you're going to be, boom, just, I mean, we're talking a week.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.080]  Boom, you're here.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:25.080]  You're a felon. You're a criminal. You're an aggravated.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.080]  You are gone. You are. You are rounded up.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.080]  You are put on an airplane and your butt is thrown out of the country.
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.080]  Period.
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.080]  In fact, a lot of folks actually know Trump say,
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.080]  get ready for a lot of immigrants.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.080]  They're going to be good ones, though.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.080]  Let's go ahead.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.080]  But again, they want a bunch of diseased people
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.080]  and a bunch of homeless women with kids to bankrupt everything
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.080]  and to be swords of the state.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.080]  You know, people sit around and make fun.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.080]  One of the underlying racisms I do here is,
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:01.080]  even gentrified Hispanics do it.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:04.080]  Look at the, you know, look at the Mexicans cutting the yards
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.080]  and fixing the houses and doing all this stuff.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:09.080]  That's what everybody 20, 30 years ago still knew how to do.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.080]  But daddy was doing it.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.080]  And we were an agrarian farmer civilization.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.080]  So just like my grandfather knew how to roof the house
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:21.080]  and do carpentry and fix machines and work outside and all that.
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.080]  And we go, oh, look at this Mexican worth ethic.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.080]  That's just a farmer work ethic.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.080]  That's a rural work ethic.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.080]  Those are rural people that were kicked off their land all over Mexico
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.080]  and don't have anything they can do but come up here.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.080]  There's been a program to make them go up to the Mequilodoras.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.080]  So I don't blame them not wanting to be in those Mequilodoras,
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.080]  those horrible factories, so they come over here.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.080]  I don't blame them.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.080]  The point is people look at, oh my God, this work ethic.
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.080]  Oh my God, it's true.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.080]  That's what people were like 30, 40 years ago, 50 years ago in this country.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.080]  But our rural communities have fallen apart.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.080]  Everybody's in there drinking Jack Daniels
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.080]  and watching satellite TV all day and NASCAR.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.080]  And there's a moral ethic in the country that's collapsed.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:06.080]  I mean, it's still better than the city, but I'll tell you.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.080]  Third, fourth, fifth generation Mexicans in East Texas
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:14.080]  that hang around with my family are rednecks with shade darker.
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.080]  They are watching satellite TV drunk and gambling
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:24.080]  and running around and acting exactly like the white people.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.080]  It's frightening.
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:27.080]  You want to see what it looks like?
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.080]  Watch the movie shot right outside Austin.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.080]  I'm going to your calls called Joe.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:40.080]  My uncle, my dad's brother, literally owned the same blue Chevy truck for 30 years.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.080]  Even, it's just crazy.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:49.080]  The way the houses look, the way the people are, absolute pure research.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.080]  That is exactly what it's like.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.080]  Redneck Mexicans, you name it, it's the whole nine yards.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.080]  So I'm telling you, it's the culture in America, all the decadence
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.080]  that has turned us into these slobs.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.080]  I don't care if you're black, Hispanic, white.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.080]  If you don't keep the words ethic on your kids and all the rest of it,
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.080]  they will turn into ruined slobs.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.080]  It's television.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.080]  That's just some sociology for you folks.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.080]  Andy, you've been on the longest, you've been on the longest.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.080]  Ethan in Pennsylvania, no, no, no.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.080]  Kyle, Kyle, I'm sorry.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.080]  Kyle in Texas, third time's the charm.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.080]  Kyle in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.080]  Go ahead.
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.080]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:29.080]  Basically, I agree with you on this, that we need to hit this on many different fronts,
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.080]  you know, and expose Hillary for who she is, because this is the time.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.080]  I mean, you've got the Bernie supporters there.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.080]  They know that she's crooked.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.080]  You've got even Black Lives Matter.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.080]  They know that she's crooked.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.080]  I mean, everybody's waking up to the fact that Hillary Clinton is a crook.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:50.080]  And, you know, now is the time, I believe, to hit this and hit it on the information front.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:58.080]  I mean, we need to be everywhere that Hillary goes in big groups and definitely expose her
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.080]  for who she is.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.080]  I agree.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:05.080]  I mean, again, I don't have the words to describe how important historically this time is.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:09.080]  I mean, how would you describe it to Kyle?
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:15.080]  I believe that our democracy is being stolen from us as we, I mean, as we think, as we
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:21.080]  just sit back and go about our daily lives, you know, just watching TV and...
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.080]  What do we do to counter Hillary?
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.080]  What do we do to counter Hillary?
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:27.080]  I think the main thing that we have to do to counter Hillary is to post on our Facebooks.
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:32.080]  I mean, you can't be scared to just put this information out there and to expose who she really is.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.080]  I agree.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:37.080]  Folks should go to infowars.com and get the flashback of the super delegate from California
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.080]  saying in February, we're going to ignore the popular vote and get all the clips of the
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:45.080]  Republicans saying it and just keep hammering it.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.080]  We're going to have more articles, more videos exposing this.
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.080]  And I think we push Trump.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.080]  Do you agree with me?
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.080]  Trump needs to come out and say she's been stealing the whole time.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.080]  She's going to continue.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:54.080]  I'm ahead.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.080]  She better not try to steal it.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.080]  Absolutely.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.080]  Trump, I believe Trump should say something.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.080]  You know, if he gets, if he gets, if he points the seed out there and we all get together
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.080]  and put it on our Facebooks, we put it out there through the info war, you know, because
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.080]  I mean, there's too much evidence out there.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.080]  There's Comey saying that she, that she lied.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:16.080]  You've got, you've got, I mean, everything shows that they're trying to get the, the
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.080]  felons to be able to vote now.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:23.080]  They're trying to get the, the illegals to be able to vote.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.080]  I mean, it's just so blatant.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:27.080]  While they deny it, they go, oh, you're racist.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.080]  You're someone shouldn't have an idea or a license or, you know, even a bill that it's
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.080]  their name.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.080]  No.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:34.080]  And then they're legally trying to get it done.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.080]  I mean, imagine you went to Mexico or China.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.080]  I didn't let it really vote in China and said, I want to vote.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.080]  They'd laugh at you.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.080]  God bless you.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.080]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.080]  I'm going to skip this network breaks up.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.080]  More time to take calls.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.080]  I'm going to go to Andy and others here in just a moment.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:54.080]  Carl's up first though, before we go to Carl, this is an information war.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:00.080]  And I wouldn't get on the level of, of, of, of the minority of people that still support
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.080]  Hillary, because it's not really many of them.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]  Like, oh, please listen to me.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.080]  And then they get this arrogant look like you're weak and my lady's going to win.
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:11.080]  I'd say, listen, I know Trump's not perfect, but you know, they stole it from burning.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:14.080]  And we need to support the integrity of our election system.
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.080]  Don't you know she's going to try to steal it from Trump.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.080]  We need a landslide for Trump.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.080]  So it's very hard for them to steal.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.080]  That's what every expert tells us.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.080]  History shows that landslides are hard to be.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.080]  We need a landslide and it's looking that way with all these emails and corruption
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.080]  just proving she's so crooked.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:34.080]  I mean, let me tell you.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.080]  Six months ago, nine out of 10 people in Austin, I know are first handers.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:42.080]  I mean, and I don't like that as a socialist, but at least he wanted to reform the big banks
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.080]  and make them pay some taxes and stuff.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.080]  I agree with that.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.080]  I just don't agree with socialism.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.080]  I mean, they robbed it.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:50.080]  I mean, I know they stole it.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.080]  That's admitted.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:59.080]  But I can't find anyone that supports him.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.080]  I mean, I'll see.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:05.080]  I was driving, I played the game driving home and then doing some errands.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.080]  I took the kids to a movie.
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:13.080]  After that, I played the game of trying to find a Hillary sticker.
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:15.080]  And I just, I didn't see one.
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:19.080]  I didn't see one in a Democrat city, one of the only ones in Texas.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.080]  I didn't see one.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.080]  The other day I drove around for two and a half hours to take care of business
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:27.080]  and go and get my dental work done and stuff.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:31.080]  And I, I ran into one Hillary sticker.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.080]  But let me tell you, you go to the rich part of town, almost every yard's got one.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.080]  Man, it's the rulers.
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.080]  The whole power structure hates Donald Trump.
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:42.080]  Both parties.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:45.080]  George Will got up in the Washington Post and said, like, let me read that.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:47.080]  Then I'm going to your calls.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:52.080]  If Trump is the nominee, the GOP must keep him out of the winehouse.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.080]  Boy, imagine if Hillary steals it.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.080]  They'll support that.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:57.080]  They're evil.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.080]  Republican voters, particularly in Indiana and California,
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:03.080]  can, by supporting crews, make Republican convention a deliberative body
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:07.080]  rather than one that merely ratifies decisions made elsewhere.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:11.080]  Some of the six months earlier, a convention sovereign duty,
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.080]  sovereign duty, the royalty of the Republican leadership,
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:19.080]  is to choose a plausible, oh, they decide whose plausible nominee,
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:23.080]  who has a reasonable chance to win, not to passively affirm the will
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:30.080]  of a mere plurality of voters recorded episodically in a protracted process.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:37.080]  In Texas, we call that Bravo Sierra.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:40.080]  He goes on to say, Trump would be the most unpopular nominee ever.
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.080]  He's already got higher points than Mitt Romney.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.080]  Mitt Romney was behind this time last year, three points.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:51.080]  Trump's seven to 10 points ahead in every major big fat poll, buddy.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.080]  So you're proven wrong, George Will.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:59.080]  George Will is a anti-American piece of filth.
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.080]  Anti-voting.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:03.080]  I'm going to finish this in a minute and go to the calls,
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:08.080]  but notice the early callers that are democracy and a lot of patriots,
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.080]  a lot of constitutionals get mad by that term.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:13.080]  But listen, we are a limited democracy.
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.080]  We have a constitutional republic.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:21.080]  But yes, in a pure democracy, a 51% vote to say kill all the redheads in the country, it happens.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:26.080]  Or a 51% vote to kill all people would say brown eyes, it happens.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:30.080]  Or a killer by that, you know, that has got freckles or killer by that's black.
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:35.080]  In a republic, you have a codified system show that basic systems are protected,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.080]  like voting, like free speech, like the Second Amendment,
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:41.080]  like the right to not be searched without due process or probable cost.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:45.080]  These are all of our shared values and we have to defend them to the end.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:52.080]  And I'm seeing them run over by the establishment at a level never imaginable before in America.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.080]  He continues, this is George Will in The Washington Post.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:57.080]  Trump would be the most unpopular nominee ever.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.080]  Oh, no, he's actually one of the most popular since Ronald Reagan.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:05.080]  Quote, unable to even come close to Mitt Romney's insufficient support among women, minorities and young people.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:14.080]  In losing disastrously, Trump would probably would create down ballot carnage sufficient to even the Republican control of the House ticket.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:18.080]  Splitting is becoming rare in polarized America in 2012.
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:23.080]  Only 5.7% of voters supported presidential candidate and congressional candidate of opposite parties.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:28.080]  So they all sold this talking point. It was all fraud.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:34.080]  It was all lies. Again, just very briefly, we're running the biggest special in our history right through this weekend.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.080]  Some items will stop being on sale tomorrow.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.080]  Storeable foods, 40% off, highest quality, are the lowest prices.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:42.080]  And 40% off, it is a joke.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.080]  Lost leader.
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:45.080]  40% off colloidal, silver, silver bullet.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.080]  40% off the incredible nitropic brain force.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.080]  30% off a bunch of the other products of supermilial vicality.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  Lung cleanse, you name it.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:53.080]  20% off apparel.
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:58.080]  20% off Alexa pure breeze home air purifier that costs 200 bucks, 180 right now.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:05.080]  And leading competitors are 400 to 800 to 1000 and aren't even as good.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:09.080]  A lot of folks just lazily sell the same filters. Filters have gotten less expensive.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:17.080]  So there you go. It's all available at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-2533139.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.080]  And your purchase of the products makes everything we do possible.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.080]  Support local affiliates as well.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.080]  And I salute you and thank you.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:28.080]  It's about Carl in Oregon. You're on the air.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:31.080]  Then Andy, Ethan, Brian, Todd, Carl, go ahead.
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:33.080]  Hey, buddy. It's your buddy.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:39.080]  Well, Jones, Alex Jones blow up the best are a 52 week Patriot contest.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:42.080]  It can be done. We could do this. We could take back America.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:49.080]  The contest is structured where everyone that can hear this and you can fund this.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  It's easy to do 52 weeks. You create flyers for the people that participate in it every week all across America.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:09.080]  And the people that have the most flyers put out, it could be on any topic, anywhere between Asper team to Zionism.
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:12.080]  Anything about the truth movement. They could do this.
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:18.080]  And each and every week somebody puts out a certain amount, more than 10,000, wins $1,000 that week.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.080]  Carl, Carl, I'm going to jump. I appreciate your call.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:28.080]  But since you mentioned that we did a contest, I think it was for $5,000 to expose the dangers of flu shots.
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:33.080]  Just put the fact that you should read the insert, flu shots have killed people.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:37.080]  And it was in hundreds of newspapers and hundreds of TV stations picked it up.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.080]  Tried to imply it was illegal to put up flyers in legal and lawful areas.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:45.080]  They tried to threaten me that it was my fault. Of course, that all failed, but I agree.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  I'm going to launch a flyer and video contest next week.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:56.080]  It'll be a month long and we'll have faith to that successful for like, I think $10,000.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:02.080]  Here's the problem. I don't have the crew to watch all the videos, see all the flyers, even report on it, but I'm going to try.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:07.080]  I think we have a contest I announced yesterday that we need to tell folks where to send the meme of Hillary as a shark.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.080]  Send it to us on Twitter. Tweet at real Alex Jones.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.080]  In the next hour, we're going to post some of those on infowars.com so you can spread them.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.080]  That photo of her like cresting like a great white shark.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:24.080]  Hillary Devour's Constitution, Bill of Rights, Info Wars, Flash Contest.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.080]  I've only got like seven or eight riders that are actually, you know, here in house.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:30.080]  A lot of them are resting right now because they went up for the last two days.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.080]  So we've got to go through those contests. I'm going to announce a $1,000 winner on that.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:38.080]  But it doesn't even about the money. It's the fun of exposing tyranny.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:41.080]  So send those to showtipsandinfowars.com as well.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.080]  Post them on your own Facebook.
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:46.080]  Tweet them at real Alex Jones.
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.080]  And will this save the world? No.
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:54.080]  But all of us together doing things like this will encourage the First Amendment that they hate and bring this globalist down.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.080]  So we should come up with kind of our own flyers, our own promo video, explain what's got to be in it,
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:03.080]  and just expose election fraud, expose how Hillary stole the nomination,
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.080]  expose how she's planning to do it to Trump.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.080]  You should be doing those videos anyway.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.080]  You should be doing stunts anyway. You should be doing whatever it takes,
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:19.080]  especially in battleground states like Florida and New York and Pennsylvania and Ohio.
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.080]  And yes, I think we can win California.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:26.080]  But regardless, maybe you're a businessman, pay to have banners fly.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:29.080]  Put your money in and we're going to lose everything.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:34.080]  Do stuff like do big projections up on buildings, you know, that say Hillary wants to steal the election.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:37.080]  Do stunts in front of media that's legal and lawful.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.080]  Fight for the Republic, the animating contest of liberty.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:42.080]  We're on the march. The empire is in deep trouble.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.080]  We'll be back. Stay with us. 70 seconds.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.080]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:56.080]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.080]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:05.080]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:11.080]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:14.080]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:16.080]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:20.080]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:23.080]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:28.080]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:32.080]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:37.080]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:42.080]  InfoWarsLife.com and the profit we make. We fight the globalists. We fight the new world order.
[01:59:42.080 --> 02:00:01.080]  Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:24.080]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:31.080]  The future is now. The future doesn't like it. Self-driving dystopic. Tax you while you drive. Surveillance cars rolling out.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:36.080]  They cost more. And they're rip-offs.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.080]  That's what 250-square-foot coffin apartments are about.
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:43.080]  You pay more than you would for a 2,000-square-foot apartment under their plan.
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:47.080]  It's all about raping you, but calling it trendy.
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:50.080]  And then all the good trendies get the little car, the little coffin apartment.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.080]  And they're all proud of themselves.
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:58.080]  It's fun to be a chump.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:03.080]  Andy in Maine, thank you for calling on this Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:07.080]  Hey, Alex. Listen, I had a couple of ideas I wanted to put out there.
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  First of all, I know in my voting district here in Maine, all of the volunteers are elderly people.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:25.080]  And I really think that it would be good if we put out there that if you have the time, volunteer at your voting station so that you can be on hand.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:32.080]  Also, I think it would be a good idea maybe to organize exit polls in at your district.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.080]  Yes.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:38.080]  So that you're there to actually do an exit poll yourself to account for these votes.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:45.080]  I'm posting a group on Facebook that's going to be called, and I'm posting it in the next half hour, called Vote Protectors.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.080]  And I'd like to invite everybody to go there so that we can at least have a discussion about it.
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:50.080]  Absolutely.
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:59.080]  I mean, I wish I had the money to have reporters in like all seven or eight battleground states at the key counties that are always contested to have Leanne McAdoo, Joe Biggs, David Knight.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:03.080]  I mean, I'm going to send reporters 50 feet away from the polling place.
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:08.080]  Wherever it's legal and lawful and then talk to folks, who'd you vote for? That's what you're supposed to do to check the integrity.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:14.080]  I remember with Pat Buchanan was it 1996, but I was working in there.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.080]  I was even paid like I think $2 an hour as part of it.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.080]  And I didn't want the money, but that's part of it.
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.080]  And I remember Pat Buchanan had like 70% of the vote.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.080]  But at the end of the night, they said he had like 5% or something.
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:27.080]  And everyone knew they'd stolen it from Pat Buchanan.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:34.080]  We could see on the Scantron bubbled in Pat Buchanan for the Republican nominee, but they stole it.
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.080]  There were Pat Buchanan signs everywhere.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.080]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.080]  Trump's got the money and the system to fight it.
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:41.080]  What are you expecting to happen?
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.080]  What's your gut tell you?
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  Well, my gut tells me that Hillary will do anything that she can.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  And I mean, she has so many operatives out there and we have to add a grassroots level locally in your own district where you live.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:59.080]  Whoever is listening right now, take an action.
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:02.080]  You talked about getting a radio show of your own and all that, but you know what?
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:04.080]  This is something that is simple.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.080]  It's easy.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.080]  You just have to commit to it in your district.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:13.080]  All you do is call the county clerk or the head of elections and they tell you where to come sign up and you'll get put in there.
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  And listen, when they're stealing it, they'll say, no cameras.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.080]  Everyone turn cameras off.
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.080]  That's when you videotape and you get that out.
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.080]  And I'm telling you, we get enough of these when they're stealing them.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:27.080]  There'll be an investigation, a Supreme Court situation, which is why they killed Scalia.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.080]  So it could go for Hillary.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:32.080]  I'm telling you, they got it set up, but I'm telling you, we'll show them stealing it.
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.080]  If we've got enough people inside the central systems, not just at the precinct levels, we need to be precinct.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:44.080]  But more importantly, the central hub of your county is where the dirty deeds going to go down.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:45.080]  Absolutely.
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:48.080]  I also wanted to mention how encouraged I am.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:57.080]  Because I have a 14-year-old, I know you have a son about the same age and how encouraged I am by the number of awake kids in that age group in the high school level.
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.080]  Hey, you heard, I mean, I'm sorry to keep you around.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.080]  If you're just making all these bombshell points, you're such a great caller.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.080]  I'll hold you over so you can have more points if you want to.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:09.080]  But listen, my son is 13, about to be 14, and my older daughter's 12.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:13.080]  They say everybody at the school basically listens to me and I talk to other folks around the country.
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:17.080]  They say info wars is super hot with young people.
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:18.080]  Absolutely.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:27.080]  I mean, I'll tell you, my son, he has an Instagram page called northeast.conservatives at Instagram, and they shut him down.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:35.080]  They said that and suspended his account for things just for simple Hillary commentary and means.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  But that's going to teach him to fight back even harder, isn't it?
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:46.080]  I mean, he's a huge fan of Milo, and when he heard he got banned from Twitter, he thought it was the greatest thing ever.
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:50.080]  Let me ask you this question, and we'll go to our guests.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:05:19.080]  I'm going to come back, but I want you to finish up talking about what is your son done to get other platforms his own platform so they can't censor him, because that's the answer.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:24.080]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:31.080]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:36.080]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:40.080]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:43.080]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:48.080]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:52.080]  Spread the information, educate yourself and others.
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:54.080]  The truth shall set you free.
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:06:23.080]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:31.080]  In this life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Superman Vitality and so many others.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:40.080]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.080]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:52.080]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:54.080]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:57.080]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:59.080]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:06.080]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:11.080]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:19.080]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:23.080]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:30.080]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:37.080]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:43.080]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.080]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:51.080]  The real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:59.080]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:04.080]  The British are coming! The British are coming!
[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:14.080]  Now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation on its ear and the shock that Lexington heard round the world.
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:19.080]  When the British fired in the early dawn, the war of independence had begun.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:27.080]  The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled and on to Concord, march the foe to seize the arsenal.
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:32.080]  There you know, waking folks, searching all around.
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:44.080]  Until a militia stopped them in their tracks, set the old North Bridge, we turned them back and chased those Red Coast back to Boston Town.
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:51.080]  And the shock around the world was a start of the revolution. The men and women were brave on the move.
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:59.080]  Take your powder, take your gun, report to General Washington, hurry when there's not an hour to lose.
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:07.080]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they had put a light up in this high church steeple.
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:14.080]  And Paul went down there to look and shone up. There was the light burning brighter than day.
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:20.080]  Well Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out. He didn't know where he was going but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it. That old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:37.080]  Paul are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs. He says, the British is coming, the British is coming.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:45.080]  Get your gun, we gonna have us a revolution. And them farmers come up piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:51.080]  Minute men there's called. What's minute mean? Minute men, there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:59.080]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grabbed their guns and hid out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:11.080]  And when the British come pranks and long haul dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it. It was a sight to see. And then it happened.
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:20.080]  They fired the gun. They fired the gun. And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:26.080]  Oh, get out. That's the way this country started.
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:42.080]  We're now into the third hour of this worldwide broadcast, the fourth hour is coming up that Rob do will be hosting again if you're new to the show.
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:47.080]  I do three hours every day than other great reporters, researchers or guest host does the fourth hour. Many times I co host with them.
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:57.080]  And we have the nightly news seven o'clock central in full wars dot com forward slash show. And now many TV stations and cable systems are picking it up, even though I haven't gotten the phase of really promoting that yet.
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:06.080]  And what's also happened is a lot of radio affiliates are picking up the nightly news. That's an hour long and carrying it. I never expected that.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:14.080]  But we have innovated a lot of stuff in media. I didn't go out and get a cable channel like Glenn Beck did. That's one reason he's going bankrupt.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:21.080]  Like I've been offered his channel. That's how I knew he was in financial trouble. Three years ago, I was offered it behind the scenes for much less than he got it.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:29.080]  And I said, no, I don't want to be channel 2000 and something inside of the Alex Jones channel because the audiences are so small, maybe 50,000 100,000 an hour.
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:35.080]  I can shoot YouTube videos, you know, get a million views in an hour. I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:45.080]  So again, we are free to air, though, on a satellite system that costs us $300,000 a year that UHF VHF and cable systems say they like the best.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:51.080]  We also are on a file sharing system that they can also get us on. And that's our next phase is pushing that.
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:12:01.080]  I've been so focused on just fighting the globalist and fighting for open free elections in this country that we are about six months behind on that project.
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:12.080]  But we're ahead on other projects, but that's very, very exciting. So I'll also be back doing the Sunday radio slash TV show four to six p.m. Central live in studio as we do every Sunday.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:30.080]  We have a man who I ran into when I was out on the street in Cleveland at the RNC who I've had on several times many years ago, who really has one of the most informative news vignettes.
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:36.080]  I've ever seen that's the American minute American minute dot com. We'll talk to Bill Federer here about three minutes.
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:53.080]  Briefly, there's a lot of news I didn't cover today. I've dropped the ball because I've been so focused on the financial times of London, the BBC, the economists, the Washington Post saying world governments in trouble, the new world orders in trouble.
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:13:03.080]  They actually say that and that Hillary must be elected. Clearly, she stole the nomination that's admitted. We have super delegates on the website admitting it. They're very proud of it.
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:12.080]  Before it happened. And now they've done it. So she's going to try to steal it and Trump knows that. So what do we do to fight back against this?
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:29.080]  I think that's a main focus. I'm going to be hammering this. But separately, it's happening. We're getting conditioned. Even though we know about all this corruption, we just get used to them lying to us used to Hillary stealing elections and accustomed every two or three days to a cop getting executed.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:39.080]  Several got shot in San Diego. One's dead. One's fighting for their lives. And there's the customary people online. We have stories on them fours dot com celebrating the dead cop.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.080]  And this is the White House. Every time somebody gets killed, you know, they say, well, the cops need to reform.
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:53.080]  San Diego police shooting one officer killed one rush to surgery in another ambush. And this is what's going on.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:14:00.080]  And whether it's Islamic or whether it's another Black Lives Matter, if they agree, they always try to cover it up why they did it as long as possible.
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:09.080]  If your name is Ali, they change it to David. If you're a Black national, they call it a right wing attack. I mean, this is the 1984 level we've reached.
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:17.080]  And we're going to be talking to Bill here in a minute about all of this and about the history of this country and how we rediscover it.
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:24.080]  We'll know why the globalists want to demonize it so much because it's the antidote to their world system.
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:31.080]  There's two world systems in competition, centralized conquest and open free market. We never fully realized the open free market.
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:41.080]  But the little bit we did revolutionize the world. So we're talking to him in two minutes. But Andy and Maine, your son, you said, had a popular Instagram and that it got banned.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:50.080]  This has happened to family of mine that even put up mild things critical of Hillary because they really don't want young people having their free speech.
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:59.080]  They want to teach you that they're going to censor you like Facebook's been doing. The answer to that is getting a YouTube channel, starting a bunch of Facebook channels, fighting back.
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:06.080]  YouTube tried to censor us last week. I threatened to sue them. They backed off. I'm not looking for trouble, but we have to keep the Internet open and free.
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.080]  I'll go ahead and finish your story.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:14.080]  Absolutely. Again, northeast.conservatives at Instagram. And I'm going to put Cameron on the phone with you, Alex. Hold on.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.080]  Sure. But is it back up or I mean, how long do they censor it?
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:34.080]  Hi, this is Cameron. I run the account and it's been up for about June 16th now. But before that, we had two other accounts. This is our third one.
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:41.080]  I understand. So as you get popular, they take it down and teach you how open and tolerant they are.
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:50.080]  Yeah. Once we start saying, once we start saying stuff about Hillary in particular, it gets shut down.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:16:04.080]  Well, the answer is the answer is to screenshot your old site, put YouTube videos up about what they did, doppelgang it with Facebook, but also your own website as Drudge says, you must have your own platform to make it easy for you to go to them so they can control you.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:11.080]  Have your own platform, your own base that you then launch information warfare attacks with the truth into their systems.
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:17.080]  But when you go into the matrix, you've got to jack in. You've got to have your own ship. So I'm telling you, I want you to go to the next level.
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:23.080]  I want you to start your own website. Go take a class if you need to, but they're really easy and start pointing out that you're being censored.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:30.080]  You're being controlled and then listen, make it a whole career. This is the answer what you're doing right now.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:31.080]  Thank you.
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:33.080]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:38.080]  No, thank you. That's pretty much it.
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:45.080]  Tell folks your site now while it's still up. They want to intimidate young people. This is how authoritarian they are.
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:53.080]  Yeah, exactly. My dad also says to go onto his Facebook page to vote protectors.
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:54.080]  Alright, God bless you.
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.080]  He's going to start it too. Alright, thank you, YouTube.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:04.080]  Thank you. We need to see young people just out there reporting with their own video camera. Everybody just go, have your own YouTube, say, I'm out here doing exit polls.
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.080]  Just do it. Just do it and we'll have eyes everywhere and it's game over. I'm skipping this network break.
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:18.080]  Okay, he joins us. Bill Federer, William J. Federer is a nationally known speaker, bestselling author and president of AmeriResearch Inc.,
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:21.080]  a publishing company dedicated to researching America's noble heritage.
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:27.080]  They've got films, documentaries, books. This is amazing. Some of this is used in my children's schooling.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:35.080]  Bill's America's Minute radio feature is broadcast daily across America and on the Internet, his faith in history television airs on the TCT network,
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:42.080]  on stations across America and via Direct TV, americanminute.com. Bill, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:44.080]  Alex, great to be with you.
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:51.080]  Well, Hillary's just openly stolen the nomination. They admit Sanders was the winner. You hear about all the censorship going on against patriots,
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:59.080]  just Americana folks that are classical liberals. They call us conservatives. Where would you say our republic is right now?
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:07.080]  Well, you hit upon it when you talked about the concentrated power and then the free market, the separated power.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:14.080]  And this is a theme that goes back to the beginning of recorded human history. So writing was invented around 3,000 or 4,000 B.C.
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:21.080]  Sumerian cuneiform on clay tablets in the Mesopotamian Valley. That's 3,000 or 4,000 B.C. We're around 2,080.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:28.080]  So that's around 6,000 years of recorded human history, which is not that long. It's only 60 people living 100 years each back to back.
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:33.080]  So we're basically talking 60 grandmas and you're all the way back to the beginning of recorded human history.
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:43.080]  What do we see in these records? 2,000 years, 33 major Egyptian dynasties ruled by Pharaohs, 5,000 years, 18 major Chinese dynasties ruled by emperors,
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:51.080]  Cyrus of Persia, Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, Alexander the Great, Indian Maharajas, Julius Caesar, the Byzantine emperors, Muslim sultans,
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:55.080]  African chieftains, King Kamehameha, and then of course these global empires, right?
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  Genghis Khan killed 30 million people from Korea to Hungary and then the king of Spain, France and Austria. But the most powerful king in recorded history was the king of England
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:11.080]  and he controlled 13 million square miles and a half a billion people. Now I do point out that communism is nothing more than monarchy.
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:17.080]  Every communist country has a dictator, Stalin, Pol Pot Ho Chi Minh, Castro, Mao Tse Tung, the communist party member...
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:20.080]  More Korea is a hereditary dictatorship.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:28.080]  Yeah, and the communist party members are the new royalty and then the people are the peasants. So basically socialism, communism is a monarchy makeover.
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:35.080]  But there's this undeniable trend for power to want to concentrate. Now our founders, when they had a chance to set up a government,
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:41.080]  they wanted to run as far away from a king as possible. They took the power of a king, broke it into three branches, separated it federal to state level,
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:46.080]  tied up this federal Frankenstein with ten handcuffs. It was Eisenhower that used that Frankenstein term.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:52.080]  And he said the states created the federal government, but Frankenstein-like, the creature wants to destroy the creators.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:20:00.080]  And so there's this trend of gravity, wanting to pull the satellite back down. And so it was good that Lincoln ended slavery,
[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:04.080]  but in the process a lot of rights went from the states to the federal government.
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:10.080]  It was good that Franklin Roosevelt wanted to end the depression, but he concentrated power with his New Deal programs.
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:16.080]  It was good that Lyndon Johnson wanted to end poverty, but he concentrated power with his welfare state. And Nixon's war on drugs.
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:22.080]  And Bush, it was good. He stopped more terrorist attacks, but he concentrated power with the NSA and the Patriot Act.
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:28.080]  And now the new president, no matter what the crisis is, the answer is the same. He doesn't have time to be limited by Congress.
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:36.080]  He has his pen in his phone and he wants to concentrate power. And so this is a natural trend, but you have philosophers that actually want to speed it along.
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:43.080]  Machiavelli, Hagel, Karl Marx, Saul Linsky, and just in a nutshell, Machiavelli lived 500 years ago in Italy.
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:49.080]  Italy was a bunch of city-states. Venice, Genoa, Naples, Florence, Siena, they all had armies and navies and fought.
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:55.080]  And Machiavelli thought if one prince could control all of Italy, it would stop this infighting.
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:21:00.080]  So he writes a book called The Prince, where he advocates the ends justifies the means.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:08.080]  The end of one prince controlling all of Italy. It's such a good end, because it'll stop this infighting, that any means necessary to get theirs justified.
[02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:12.080]  Lightsheets deal. So if a prince conquers a city, the city would hate him.
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:19.080]  But if the prince paid criminals to kill cows and burn barns and create crisis and terror, the people would cry out for help.
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:27.080]  The prince would come in and get rid of the very people he bribed. Nobody would know the better for it, and everyone would praise the prince as a hero.
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:34.080]  And it's actually good marketing. You create the need and fill it. You go around the back of the house and set it on fire.
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:37.080]  And then you go around the front of the house and sell them a fire extinguisher.
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:42.080]  And that's clowered in Piven, which has been adopted by the Democrats to bankrupt the country, so they can then take it over.
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:46.080]  Right. And they get to be the heroes in the process of taking it over.
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:51.080]  And this Machiavellian strategy influenced someone named...
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:57.080]  So they brought in 5 million radical Islamics into Europe, 80% military aged men, now that they attack...
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:05.080]  I said this two years ago, now they attack, they declare civil emergency, and arrest Germans and Swedes and Frenchmen that criticize the Islamic invasion.
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:10.080]  So the very government that brings it in is now the hero taking your rights, but still won't fight it.
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:18.080]  Another term that you described is called psychological projection, blame shifting, where the attacker blames the victim.
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:24.080]  So the person that is accusing the other of being racist, the accuser is actually the racist one.
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:29.080]  Somebody is saying, well, you're a rich people, class worker, well, it's the accuser.
[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:34.080]  There's a David Axelrod. I actually saw him at the Republican National Convention and said hi to him.
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:44.080]  Anyway, he was on NPR radio 2010, and he said, in Chicago politics, we have a tradition where you throw a brick through your own campaign office window
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:48.080]  and then call a press conference to accuse your opponent.
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:53.080]  Sure, that later got put into House of Guards.
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:23:02.080]  Well, I wanted to throw in Hegel really quick. Napoleon conquers Prussia, a German province, so easily that the king said, we can't let that happen again.
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:07.080]  We need to strengthen the state. And so Hegel was the philosophical basis.
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:14.080]  He says, the state is God walking on earth. And he came up with Hegelian dialectics, a way to concentrate power.
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:22.080]  And it's a triangle. One corner is a thesis. The opposite is an antithesis or antithesis. And the top corner is a synthesis.
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:26.080]  And didn't he just codify the whole false flag of Machiavelli?
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:34.080]  You've got it. And it sounds complicated, but it's actually simple. You start off, you create a problem that's real bad,
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:38.080]  and everybody is happy to settle for your answer. That's half as bad.
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  Then that becomes the new thesis starting point, and you create another problem that's real bad, and everybody's happy to settle for your answer.
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:50.080]  That's half as bad. You do this over and over until you move from the people ruling themselves to a king.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:58.080]  And so Karl Marx applied Hegelian dialectics to politics. How do you create a problem that's real bad?
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:04.080]  You send in organizers, agent provocateurs, provoking agents, agitators.
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:14.080]  Their goal is to find those who have grievances and tension right under the surface, and you stir them up to riot and have random killing and bloodshed,
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:20.080]  and then everybody is willing and begging some strong leader to come in and restore order.
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:28.080]  And I don't think I've ever seen in U.S. politics since I've been alive or just in history period a time when the Democratic Party particularly
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:34.080]  is literally invoking classic Hegelian dialectic destabilization program.
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:42.080]  Let me ask you, if you agree with that statement and then be, Mr. Federer, americanminute.com, is it going well for them?
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:48.080]  You're hitting it right on the head, and I applaud you for speaking and explaining this to the public.
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:57.080]  I find so many people, you know, Lenin called, he used the term useful idiots, people that are actually caught up in thinking that the issue is what they're talking about.
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:05.080]  Saul Linsky, you know, David Horowitz quoted, he says, the issue is never the issue. The issue is revolution.
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:17.080]  And so what Karl Marx did, he would send in these agitators and they would organize the proletariat against the bourgeois, working class against the business owners.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:25.080]  They'd organize the blacks against the whites, the Muslims against the Christians, the Catholics against the Protestants, the Hutus against the Tutsis and the Congo and Rwanda.
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:33.080]  They really don't care who the two sides are and they don't care what the issues are, they just want a destabilizing crisis that's so bad that everybody begs a strong leader.
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:43.080]  Now, it actually works best if the people are not Christian. Why? Napoleon said, religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.080]  So if you have poor Christians, they'll just forgive, they'll just, you know, suffer.
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:53.080]  That's why globalist target Christians worldwide, real Christians, because they don't conform to this dialectic.
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:26:01.080]  Right. And so you get these people that have raw human passion and you say, you've been wronged, you want what they have, follow me, you'll get it.
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:07.080]  And once there's a destabilization of social order is when this strong leader usurps power and...
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.080]  Is that why Muslims seem to be the perfect patsies?
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:17.080]  Well, yes, Muhammad used this tactic. He would come into a town with their symetre swords and they would do random violence.
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:24.080]  And the town would say, what do we have to do to stop you? He would say, submit. And they go, okay, well, we submit. What does that mean?
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:30.080]  Okay, men, get your sword and your horse, follow me to the next town. And so the larger group would go to the next town and they do random violence.
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:33.080]  And the people say, what do we got to do to stop you? And they say, submit. And then he's okay.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.080]  So it's called terrorism. He's been employing terrorism for 1400 years.
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:44.080]  Yeah. And now there's lots of Muslims who have backslidden, but every now and then you get those wanting to follow Muhammad's example.
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:52.080]  We call that getting radicalized. And so Muhammad wrote a book, How He Transitioned from Being a Religious Leader for 12 Years in the Pagan City of Mecca.
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:57.080]  And he is not very successful. He only makes 70 converts in 12 years.
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:03.080]  And so the people of Mecca decide that Muhammad is a disturber of the peace because he's getting confrontational.
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:08.080]  And when they face him out of town, Muhammad is nowhere to go. He is a Muslim refugee.
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:13.080]  He goes 210 miles north to a Jewish city called Medina. The Jews are nice and tolerant.
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:23.080]  They let Muhammad in as a Muslim immigrant. He goes into the minority neighborhoods and he organizes a following amongst those who have grievances against this Jewish controlled city.
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:32.080]  And he gets a following, right? Organizing in the community. And when the following is big enough, he goes to the Jews and pressures them to accommodate him and his followers politically.
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:37.080]  The Jews do. Now, Muhammad is a political leader in addition to being a religious leader.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:46.080]  Then, Muhammad's followers in Mecca get confrontational argument threatening. They get chased out of town for disturbing the peace. They're Muslim refugees.
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:51.080]  They go to Medina, the Jewish city. They're nice. They let Muhammad's followers in as Muslim immigrants.
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:28:00.080]  And Muhammad allows his followers to rob the caravans headed to Mecca in retaliation for the Meccans chasing them out of town.
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:08.080]  So, where Jesus said, if they take your coat, give them your shirt, Muhammad's attitude was, if they take your house, you retaliate, take their caravan.
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:18.080]  So, Muhammad had 300 warriors and they would rob caravans. He got a whole chapter of the Quran. It's Surah 8, Chapter 8, on how to distribute booty from.
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:24.080]  And then we wonder why all this is happening. And then as soon as the Muslim mayor gets elected in London, he starts restricting free speech.
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:34.080]  So, he's going to ignore the law. They're following a program of conquest. Why does the left merge so seamlessly with the totalitarian Orthodox Islam?
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:41.080]  Because they claim they're all liberal, but there is a love-fest between the technotronic folks and Islam.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:50.080]  David Harowitz said that the union between the radical left and radical Islam is the most dangerous thing that's happening in our era.
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:58.080]  And so, the radical left hates Judeo-Christian values. They hate the concept of the individual. They want everybody to conform to the state.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:07.080]  And Islam hates Judeo-Christian values and they want everybody to conform. So, they sort of see themselves as partners against traditional Judeo-Christian values.
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:13.080]  They hate the West because it's open. They can't compete with it. So, they got to blow it up and bring in their system of tyranny.
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:16.080]  They cannot compete with the free market. They cannot compete with classical liberalism.
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:24.080]  And now, there's no honor among thieves. They don't like each other. Sort of like you see those movies where, you know, a couple bank robbers will rob the bank and they're dividing up the money.
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:31.080]  And the one pulls out a gun and shoots the other and he gets to keep all the money, right? So, they don't trust each other, but they'll use each other against the West.
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:39.080]  But it is, we've always thought of communism on one side, Islam on the other side. Well, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cross-pollination.
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:44.080]  Wow, Bill Federer, you were on many years ago. I don't know how it fell through the cracks. You're just a superstar of history.
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:49.080]  I hope you'll start coming on routinely. Come back and let's talk more about this and we'll take calls. Thank you, sir.
[02:29:49.080 --> 02:30:15.080]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:30.080]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm. Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:39.080]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants. And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:49.080]  The screen light causes insomnia and slows the metabolism. Hello, weight gain. Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:58.080]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can. Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body. Use headphones. And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:11.080]  This is a simple wars tip of the week.
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:27.080]  Coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of clears up.
[02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:39.080]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:49.080]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:59.080]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:27.080]  You want answers? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:39.080]  Alright, Bill Fetter probably on the show four or five times over a decade ago and then I saw him at the RNC. It was like seeing an old cousin or somebody that you hadn't seen him forever. You forgot what good friends you were with him.
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:49.080]  Well, in this case, I've read his books to my children. I've shown his lectures to him. I've seen him here and there on cable. I heard him here and there on the radio for, gosh, that's got to be 25 years.
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:34:02.080]  I mean, before I was even on air, unless I'm wrong, I remember Bill Fetter and stuff was just like, wow, this guy deserves to be heard because I know history. And this guy knows what he's talking about, like, squared, you know, to the next level to what I know.
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:13.080]  And I know way more than most people. And then I feel ignorant. This is really so big. You meet this guy and read his stuff. I mean, it is dead on. And so we just talked during the break.
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:22.080]  We're going to start carrying his American Minute here on the radio and TV and also clips of his larger lectures. He's got a new book, The Rise of a Tyrant. We're going to talk about that.
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:32.080]  We're about 10 minutes to go to your phone calls and let him go. But just important work, Americanminute.com. Now, before we go back to him, we're running the biggest sale in our history.
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:44.080]  Once a year, we do a super sale fundraiser. And we do it with 40% off. Great vitamins, minerals, intracellicules, Hillary for present shirts, great air filters. Technology's gotten so good.
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:53.080]  It's grown about 250 bucks for $180. Comparable units are $400 or more. I'm going to tell you, because three years ago, I bought units that were almost $1,000 that are basically the same.
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:35:04.080]  So stuff's getting less expensive, but still, most people gouge you for similar units for $400. It's $180. Alexa Pure Breeze, 20% off regular retail. That is still a steal.
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:12.080]  Water filtration systems that are gravity-fed. Alexa Pure Pro. No association with me. This is just the best unit out there. Those are 20% off.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:27.080]  Pro Pure Water filters that are excellent. 20% off. InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com for the supplements. And again, all of those purchases make what we do here possible with the news teams, the reporters, the crew.
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:36.080]  And we are doing everything we can to just really, really bust our butts. I mean, I'll be honest, our crew lately, last few weeks, has been working 18 hours a day.
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:42.080]  And I haven't even had to tell them to do this, because they understand what's happening. It's so historical. And I've never had a better crew.
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:50.080]  I've had great crews over the years, 20-something years. And some crew have been here like 15 years, like Paul Watson. But they are God's sins, and I am so blessed to have them.
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:36:01.080]  So thank you for your prayers. Thank you for your support. Thank you for spreading the word. And thank you for supporting our local AM and FM affiliates and also UHF, VHF and cable stations.
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:09.080]  Support those sponsors. Let them know why you're supporting them. Support those stations. Send them 100 bucks. They're doing everything they can to bankrupt and shut down talk radio.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:16.080]  They're doing everything that I've been kicked off. So many stations, even though we have high ratings and make stations money. The stations go, we're sorry, Alex.
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:25.080]  They came with federal money for these federally produced programs, and we needed its $300,000 just to take you off the two hours you're on on the weekend.
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:35.080]  And they apologize to me, and I say, please don't, you know, say the station, but as soon as the money's gone, we'll put you back on. I mean, they're making a move against free speech.
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:45.080]  You see the censorship everywhere, but it's not stopping us. But we're one of the biggest groups, though. Little people are getting shut down, because all of you together are much bigger than InfoWars or Matt Drudge.
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:52.080]  But believe me, if they can take down Fox News, there's a coup there right now, and they're doing it. Matt Drudge is next. Alex Jones is next.
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:37:01.080]  So I'm not complaining. I'm just telling you, we are two minutes to midnight here. But it's because we're having such inroads against tyranny that the enemy's moving.
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:11.080]  So we're forcing them out in the open. All right, Bill Federer, let's get into any other key points you want to make. Get into your new book, and then I want to have you back for a full hour in the next few weeks, and we really appreciate your time.
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:19.080]  Well, human behavior is predictable. There's a saying, past behavior is the best indicator of future performance. And so that's the advantage of learning history.
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:28.080]  Now, if you take a map of Eurasia right before America was discovered, you got China on one side. And for 5,000 years, they had 18 major Chinese dynasties.
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:35.080]  And if you wanted to have a republic or a democracy, the emperor would show up with 100,000 man army and rip the walls down around your city.
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:44.080]  So China has really never had any experiments in self-government. The other side of the map is the Mediterranean. And you've got islands and rocks and storms.
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:53.080]  And it's very hard to have a dictatorship with all these variables. And so it's in the islands of the Mediterranean, we see the next step of people experimenting.
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:55.080]  Because there's places to hide. There's places to hide.
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:04.080]  Right. And so if we focus on Athens, around 622 BC, Athens had a king named Draco, and he had Athens' first written laws.
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:10.080]  Now, this was a step up because prior, kings could rule on their whims and caprices, and they'd kill you and take your farm.
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:17.080]  And so the people of Athens just looked king, Draco, at least write these laws down. He did, but it was the death penalty for every other thing.
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:21.080]  So they got nicknamed draconian laws. That's where that term came from.
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:28.080]  Well, in 594 BC, they get a new king in Athens named Solon. Solon invented democracy.
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:33.080]  And in democracy, everybody every day had to go to the market and talk politics.
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:38.080]  And if you didn't keep up with politics every day in Athens, you were called an idiotus.
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:43.080]  And now if there's a king, an emperor, and you have an agenda, you got to get in to see the guy.
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:48.080]  Like China, the emperor had 2,000 concubines and Mandarin eunuchs that kept them.
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:51.080]  And you'd bribe these mandarins with money just to get in to pitch your agenda.
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:55.080]  Well, in Athens, there was no emperor. The people made the decisions.
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:58.080]  Well, if you have an agenda, how do you pitch it to the whole city?
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:03.080]  They would get the whole city together in an amphitheater and put on plays, comedies and tragedies,
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:07.080]  where they'd ridicule and buffoon certain points of view and honor and extol other points of view.
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:09.080]  And that's brought in high culture.
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:15.080]  And from that time till now, theater and entertainment is always political in a country where it's the people making the decisions.
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.080]  And I could get into more of that, but someone I wanted to mention is Plato.
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:24.080]  Now, he lived in the Athenian democracy and he said the government would go through five stages.
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:28.080]  The first stage, he said, was rule of the capable.
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:32.080]  These are people that know how to run farms and businesses. They know how to run city government.
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:34.080]  They're just responsible. They do a good job. The city grows.
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:39.080]  The second group wants to get involved in politics. Plato called them lovers of fame.
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:43.080]  And these are people that may be a Greek actor and are a Greek Olympic athlete.
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:48.080]  Everybody knew their name and they get involved in politics, not because they have a responsible experience running a business,
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:53.080]  but because they were famous, maybe like a Hollywood action figure that gets elected governor of California.
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:57.080]  I think, what did the Arnold Ron before he became governor? Nothing. He was just famous.
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:01.080]  Now, these famous people like fame and they hate being defamed.
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:04.080]  So these, you can manipulate with public opinion.
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:07.080]  So the first ones, they're going to do what's right because they're responsible.
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:13.080]  The second ones, they'll bend. And so the second group begins to yield to the human tendency of avarice, selfishness.
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:16.080]  And they vote a little money out of the city treasury to pad their retirement.
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:20.080]  They're working hard after all. They put a little money to their brother-in-law's construction company,
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:23.080]  a little money to some supporter that can funnel it back into their campaign.
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:27.080]  And it turns into a third category, which Plato called lovers of money.
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:30.080]  It's an oligarchy. It's a rule of few. It's an insider clique.
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:35.080]  And if you're friends with the people that are inside, you get the pork projects and all the extra, you know...
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:40.080]  And so productivity starts going down. So now things aren't going as well. Now the fourth stage.
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:46.080]  And so it turns into this division in society and the people finally throw the bumps out and set up a democracy.
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:50.080]  This is the fourth stage. And in a democracy, everybody learns how to tolerate each other.
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:55.080]  It's great. They tolerate, you know, all kinds of behavior. Then they tolerate people that are a little bit off.
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:57.080]  Then they tolerate people that are a lot off.
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:01.080]  So finally, they're tolerate open crime and convicts and all kinds of immorality.
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.080]  And Plato even says this, the manner of life is that of Democrats.
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:07.080]  That's his word because he's describing a democracy.
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.080]  Every man does what is right in their own eyes.
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:15.080]  The young man gives into libertinism and useless and unnecessary pleasures, even incest and unnatural union.
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:17.080]  Yeah, that's what he's talking about.
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:20.080]  And they throw off restraint and it's just anything goes.
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.080]  And then they raid the city treasury and now there's a shortage.
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:25.080]  And they say, where can we get more money? The rich people.
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:27.080]  They tax it from the rich people.
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:29.080]  So then comes the tyrant.
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:31.080]  And then it turns into this chaos. They don't have a shortage.
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:33.080]  And well, don't cut back on what I'm used to getting.
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:36.080]  And it turns into this tug of war and anarchy.
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:40.080]  And then they begin to say, can't someone come along and fix this mess?
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.080]  And that's the fifth stage. Someone comes along, Plato called him.
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:45.080]  First, he appears above ground as the protector.
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:50.080]  And he's very eloquent and persuasive and gives these great speeches and people fall in love with him.
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:56.080]  And then they notice he's beginning to concentrate power too much and he loses in the public opinion polls.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.080]  And they cast it in his teeth that he's getting too powerful and he has a choice.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:05.080]  Give up the power, which he's not inclined to do because Plato called him a lover of power,
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.080]  or get rid of the people confronting him.
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:12.080]  So he purchases military and his administration of anybody that has virtue.
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:15.080]  He doesn't want people with virtue. He wants yes men.
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:19.080]  And then who does he get to be his new friends now that he got rid of the old ones?
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:23.080]  He frees the slaves, the convicts, the criminals, the illegal aliens.
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:30.080]  And he arms them and they become his mob that he sends around to punish anybody that disagrees with him politically.
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.080]  And so here's what Plato wrote.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:36.080]  And the protector of the people having a mob entirely at his disposal.
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:41.080]  He is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favorite method of false accusations.
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.080]  He brings them into court and murders them.
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:49.080]  And so he uses this power of the state to go after his political enemies.
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:55.080]  And finally he stands in the chariot of state holding the reins of power and he's revealed as the tyrant.
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:58.080]  And then over time the society declines.
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:01.080]  But the weird thing about Plato is, and I've read his republic and other writings,
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:08.080]  and of course he's the model of everything today, is it's very dual because he'll admit all this bad stuff,
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:13.080]  but then talk about eugenics and getting rid of masses of people because we're crushing the breast of the earth.
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:18.080]  And then he also pushed some really tyrannical stuff because he understands all of this.
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:21.080]  He talks about Plato's cave and how we're controlled.
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:28.080]  I mean, it's all genius, obviously, but I don't know if duality is the word or the paradox of Plato.
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:30.080]  Can you speak to that, Bill Federer?
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:35.080]  Right. He said that democracy is a temporary form of government because people really don't have virtue.
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:38.080]  If they're given the choice of giving up their virtue or giving up their life.
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:44.080]  They have a republic to guard certain codes so the mob can't vote the other half be their slaves.
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:49.080]  Right. And so he says, the best you can hope for is a nice tyrant and he called him a philosopher king.
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:56.080]  But then he says this. He says, so the tyrant then comes the famous request for a bodyguard with his,
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:02.080]  in other words, there's threats on this tyrant's life and the people are all concerned about him and they let him,
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:06.080]  this is a false coup. This is like what happened in Turkey, right?
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:13.080]  So there's this threat on the guy's life and, you know, Sergey Kirov is a famous Russian that was praising Stalin.
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:16.080]  And Stalin was a little threatened by him because he was getting too popular.
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:19.080]  But Stalin also had another problem of these anti-Stalinists.
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:24.080]  And so Stalin had an idea. He would murder his friend, Sergey Kirov.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:30.080]  Nobody would blame him because they're such close friends and everybody would blame these anti-Stalinists.
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:38.080]  And so he murders them, blames it on the anti-Stalinists, uses that as an excuse to purge the Soviet Union of over a million people.
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:41.080]  And so this is this staged coup type of thing.
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:45.080]  Bill Federer, absolutely. That's exactly what we're talking about now. That's happened in Turkey.
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:51.080]  Expanding on that then, looking at this, what phase would you say we're in right now?
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:56.080]  Because obviously these phases are in flux. Things are so complex now. There's pieces of every phase.
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:01.080]  Thomas Jefferson first, you know, he talked about the Yeoman farmer.
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:05.080]  He said we've got to say decentralized. We've got to stay local.
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:08.080]  And we've got to stay near the earth or we'll become decadent slobs.
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:15.080]  He believed as a classical liberal that that was the way to basically short circuit this slouch towards Gomorrah.
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:17.080]  Can you speak to that as a historian?
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:24.080]  Well, when the public opinion of the quote unquote protector begins to go down,
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:32.080]  then he throws off the charade. Why try to give this fake front that he's in favor of the people?
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:34.080]  He just throws it off and he becomes a dictator.
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:38.080]  And so it's like a cornered animal. And when they really get in the corner, the things come out.
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:41.080]  And if they, we think, oh, Republicans get a turn, Democrats get a turn.
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:45.080]  We're talking global power. We're talking the 6,000 year quest.
[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:49.080]  Hillary may openly steal the election. I mean, she is already stole the nomination.
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:51.080]  She's already committing crimes. She's already by the law.
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:58.080]  She is a tyrant ready delivered. I believe if she's put in office, she will become tyrannous maximus.
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:05.080]  Yeah, she would extract retribution on all those that disagree with her.
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:08.080]  It's sort of like electrons. What we're seeing is it's a struggle.
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.080]  Is it power from the bottom up or power from the top down?
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:18.080]  You know, King Louis XIV was called the Sun King and his subjects were the planets that revolved around him.
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:23.080]  Louis XIV said, I am the state. And even said, it is the law because I wish it.
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:26.080]  Oh, and behold, the law was just a king's will.
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:28.080]  So let it be written, so let it be done.
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:31.080]  At America, we said, we don't like that. We want law from the bottom up.
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:35.080]  And so what we're experiencing right now is this electronic polarity struggle.
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:42.080]  So you agree we're in a galactic crossroads of flux point? Which way do you see the tea leaves going?
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:48.080]  Well, I have to look at it from a somewhat of a spiritual perspective to get any hope.
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:51.080]  And it's what stories do we like in the Bible?
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:55.080]  Well, it's David against Goliath. It's Moses against Pharaoh.
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:57.080]  It's, you know, getting in against 100,000 minutes.
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:46:59.080]  In other words, it looks hopeless.
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:03.080]  And then little nobodies with faith and courage stand up and things turn around.
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.080]  And that's what I'm hoping for and praying for.
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:12.080]  If I looked at it strictly from the natural, you think, gee, from Nimrod and the Tower of Babel,
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:17.080]  to the Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, these empires keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger,
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:21.080]  clearly with a global perspective as an ultimate goal.
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:24.080]  You know, the George Soros wanting to, and so this is the right.
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:28.080]  And by the way, you know George Soros is proud of his Nazi collaborating, 60 minutes.
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.080]  And I've read his writings where he says he believes he's a Messiah and a Christ.
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:35.080]  He's clearly a megalomaniac mental patient.
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:37.080]  I mean, why is he locked up?
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:41.080]  Well, I mentioned before that I lived in Missouri.
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:43.080]  I was half an hour from Ferguson.
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:46.080]  99% of the people writing in Ferguson were not from Ferguson.
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:49.080]  They were all brought in part of the old Occupy Wall Street people,
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:53.080]  but it was more Missourians organizing for reform and empowerment.
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:56.080]  And you can go to Snopes and it even says it's a George Soros funded group.
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:00.080]  He put 30 million into it and they organized the rioters.
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:04.080]  They actually advertised in Chicago papers, you know, go to Missouri and organize it.
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:11.080]  And not to empower black people, but make them be the detonator switch to bring in tyranny and then they'll get the blame.
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:15.080]  Yeah. I mean, the mayor of Ferguson worked on my campaign when I ran for Congress back in the year 2000.
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:17.080]  I ran against Dick Kevhart.
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:23.080]  And so the scenario is you have a Democrat governor that tells the National Guard to stand down
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:26.080]  and let him riot for three days till it makes national news.
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.080]  Then you say our local police departments are inadequate.
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:31.080]  We need to federalize them.
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:34.080]  We have long cities, initiatives, shared data with the federal government.
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:36.080]  And then the same people were moved to Baltimore.
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.080]  It's a rent a mob and the Democrat mayor lets them do a billion dollars worth of damage.
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:43.080]  And afterwards they say our local police departments inadequate.
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:44.080]  We need to federalize it.
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.080]  And so they're going 53 cities now, Denver, Colorado, and they're coming in, setting oversight.
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:52.080]  And basically it's giving the federal government department of justice,
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:55.080]  homeland security control over the local police departments.
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:58.080]  In other words, it's giving the president a standing army.
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:02.080]  Bill, I tell you, I really want to get you back for a full hour in the near future.
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:05.080]  I'm going to go to break and take a few calls here for folks that have been holding.
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:07.080]  Really amazing, americanminute.com.
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:13.080]  I'm really excited to hear you're going to join us once a month on the radio, once a month on the nightly news
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:20.080]  and talk about all the books you've written and the e-books, the DVDs and the fiction.
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:25.080]  This is something everybody, in fact, I've given this to my children years ago.
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:28.080]  I'm like, wow, Bill Federer, I've got to go get all, I'm not just pitching this.
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:29.080]  It's true, folks.
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.080]  I mean, he's not a sponsor.
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:31.080]  I'm really doing this.
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:35.080]  I've got to go get some more of your audio CDs and MP3 files from my children.
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:36.080]  They love this type of information.
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:40.080]  My daughters and my son, they're so informed because of your work and others.
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:43.080]  And so there's just so many great jewels like yourself out there.
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:49.080]  And I hope that people will go get these materials and really discover that humans live 75 years on average,
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:52.080]  as the Bible says, and we all think we're really different.
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:55.080]  But at the end of the day, we all kind of do the same stuff over and over again.
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.080]  And there are manipulators who know this knowledge, but use it against people.
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:03.080]  And just knowing real psychology, real history, history is real psychology.
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:04.080]  That's an all in shown quote.
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:08.080]  History is real psychology, not pop disinformation.
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:10.080]  And if you know it, you know how we act.
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:13.080]  Just in business, knowing history, knowing human nature.
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:15.080]  I'm so much more successful in the fight for liberty.
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:23.080]  And I just wish the general public knew that knowing history gets you ahead, not behind 30 seconds.
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:24.080]  Bill Federer.
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:29.080]  Well, I just want to thank you for having the courage to bring all this to light.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:35.080]  And, you know, I think you're one of the ones that's being raised up to educate our country.
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:39.080]  And there's always hope, but there's something for every single person to do.
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:44.080]  You know, our founders flipped it and they made the people, the king and the politicians, the servants.
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:47.080]  And so those that are listening to this program, you're the king.
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:48.080]  The politicians are your servants here.
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:49.080]  That's right.
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:50.080]  And we throw that away.
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:51.080]  We deserve to be slaves.
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:52.080]  Bill, have a great weekend.
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:53.080]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:54.080]  Thank you.
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:55.080]  We're talking to Bill Federer very soon.
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:51:23.080]  We're talking to Bill Federer very soon.
[02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:25.080]  We're talking to Bill Federer.
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:52:13.080]  We're talking to Bill Federer very soon.
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:20.080]  We're taking this out for free sample now, 800 803 5505, 800 803 5505.
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:24.200]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's
[02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:28.480]  dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:31.520]  going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:35.120]  best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:39.280]  sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:43.040]  couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:47.040]  price for M4 Wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:52.260]  gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum
[02:52:52.260 --> 02:52:59.280]  electricity with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:03.880]  Dr. Waddle Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe. He
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:07.440]  also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells. He discovered the one
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:11.520]  prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency. Dr. Joanna Budwig
[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:15.120]  built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells to
[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:18.960]  overcome this oxygen deficiency. She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:22.480]  cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:25.920]  become emulsified and more readily absorbed. Flax oil delivered in this
[02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:30.240]  manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body. Now
[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:33.400]  there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:37.960]  zero oxidation undamaged seed oils. The results on these seed oils alone are
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:42.320]  amazing. Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:45.800]  much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is and you have a
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:52.640]  winning combination to confer health and energy like never before. Call 888-988-3325
[02:53:52.640 --> 02:54:19.800]  or visit sacredseedoils.com. That's sacredseedoils.com. I have sworn. I have sworn on the
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:24.960]  altar of God eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of
[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:32.360]  man. I have personally pledged that and I tell you when you actually pledge
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:37.160]  something and then you do it there's something spiritual interdimensional that
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:44.000]  happens. The universe opens up and providence begins to rear its head and
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:51.920]  then the real magic starts. Unfortunately most people turn themselves into
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:57.960]  pawns. I don't want to be a pawn. I don't want you to be a pawn. I want you to be
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:04.000]  successful. I want you to be free and then I want you to treat me with respect as
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.160]  well.
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.760]  You look at the slaves of the Democrats and the Republicans are horrible as well
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:16.240]  but you notice the Republicans didn't go along with stealing the nomination.
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:20.080]  There's more virtue there just because of the type of people that support it not
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:28.560]  the leadership. And you look at the minions of the Democrats even when they
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:35.160]  mean well these people are broken they're fallen and it's because that's how
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:39.800]  the system wants them. We can't look at those people and get in power trips and
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:46.280]  go boy look how smart we are compared to them and no because they're falling brings
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:55.160]  us down with them. Hillary Clinton is so manifestly disingenuous so openly
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:05.640]  corrupt so sickeningly narcissistic so explosively evil. She's filled with
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:12.360]  demonic criminal energy and let me tell you something folks forget worshiping
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:15.440]  police everybody knows that's not where I come from I want to reform them there's
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:22.240]  big problems the whole government's got problems but the police are the whipping
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:27.960]  child of all the corrupt nastiness that makes them look like choir boys and the
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:32.200]  fact that we've all been conditioned now every oh some more cops got executed
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:37.280]  well whatever nobody knows their names nobody cares I mean I know the names of
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:40.520]  the black guys getting shot I don't know the names the cops and that's because
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:43.960]  the media doesn't you know I read it once or twice it's just an example of I
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:51.520]  like I am falling to their conditioning that's just an example of Hillary
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:55.360]  openly stealing the nomination and I'm pretty calm about it people think I'm a
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.360]  freak forgetting upset about it they openly steal elections now for the
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:04.080]  first time ever and it's no big deal
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:25.360]  it's really sick to show his brags about killing people and how good she is at
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:29.040]  killing people and then she's like a wimp it can hardly walk it's like even
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:33.320]  more ridiculous like the more accomplished the killer is the more humble
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.920]  they are in my experience you get around though these little waddling like
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:44.600]  Kim Jong-un people I mean she's a Kim Jong-un man just an insulated entitled
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:50.240]  demonic pus filled just freak a zoid with all of her little freak a zoid
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:54.880]  sycophantic wimp around her and we're here's the thing though that's worse we're

[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:56.680]  like fell over there's just these little chicken-neck pieces of crap I'm so sick
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:00.800]  of it I'm sick of these cowards
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:09.280]  we're being overrun we're being overrun by every form of scum I mean I just we
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:12.480]  have all these crazy weirdo feminists who've never been in the military trying
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:22.400]  to start war with Russia and shine and put jihadis in everywhere and he won't
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:26.000]  even let Christian refugees in so they get killed I mean it's just like wow
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:33.480]  really out to get us I just want a leader that isn't out to get the country I
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:36.640]  just want somebody that doesn't hate me because I'm a gun owner or a Christian I
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:42.600]  am a bitter clinger all right I said I go to your phone calls this is the
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:46.680]  homeless here and be a California caller Brian Brian you're on the air thanks
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:51.080]  for holding hey Alex God bless and you know God speed to you in the whole
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:56.120]  info worst team man thank you hey you know I want to plug the products also I
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:59.440]  didn't call into that reason but I can't say enough great things about them thank
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:04.340]  you you know really across the board top of line we do set out to bring you the
[03:03:04.340 --> 03:03:07.880]  lowest price nutraceutical that are either missing links or game changers
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:12.360]  or staples for major brands private labeled at a lower price absolutely
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:15.680]  they're amazing so continue the good work thank you hey look man this is what
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:18.520]  concerns me right now and this is why I think it's a time when everybody sort of
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:22.000]  has to stand up and voice their sort of their belief in what's right and wrong
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:26.320]  right now the reason I call is you know we're looking at the first debate on
[03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:31.320]  September 26 so we're not even two months out right and you know I've worked
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.480]  in the high technology game for about the last ten years and I understand that
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:38.680]  there's the algorithms that they can sort of look at to check the pulse of what
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:42.400]  the nation is thinking you're right in my concern is right now the mainstream
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:45.880]  media is having to admit that that Donald Trump is up at least seven and a
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:51.080]  half points in reality that's probably 15 or 20 percent right so well let's be
[03:03:51.080 --> 03:03:56.200]  conservative with closeted folks my analysis is 10 to 11 points and I can
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:59.440]  tell you that the insiders were shocked by that you'll top pollsters saying
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:02.600]  that's our number well I don't have a dead record I mean I'm a man of the of the
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:07.880]  street and I can tell you here's the deal I think it would be higher if a lot of
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:11.000]  the folks are on the fence like Trump they're not gonna vote they need to go
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:15.240]  vote they need to register right now they need to vote everybody just to
[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:20.120]  support free speech and the right of elections you must vote Donald Trump Alex
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:24.360]  you know I've been to the think tanks I've sat in the strategy sessions people
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:28.000]  don't understand what is at stake you do a great job you'll sort of you'll bring
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:31.160]  in the alarm and bring people to the table and expose an information but
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:34.320]  people don't really understand Brian tell us what's at stake as I interrupt you
[03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:36.760]  for the two minutes you're on to come back shut up for two minutes give you
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:39.360]  the floor and everybody else and then Anthony because you already might come

[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:47.360]  I'm gonna broadcast for 28 hours more I mean it's just I've never had more
[03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:50.200]  energy this is so historic I'm not up here trying to hype this like it's
[03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:54.560]  exciting it's so exciting I don't know how to like describe how exciting it is
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:00.760]  I mean it's just whoa I mean this is incredible it was Thomas Jefferson who
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:03.960]  once said that our country is now taking so steady of course as to show by what
[03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:08.040]  rodeo will pass the destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then
[03:05:08.040 --> 03:05:11.600]  corruption it's necessary consequence Jefferson was warning us about the
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:15.360]  global elite the 1% of the 1% consolidating the world's wealth and
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:18.560]  subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't
[03:05:18.560 --> 03:05:22.000]  heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:28.280]  establishment political office no longer represents the voice of the people
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:31.480]  but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain
[03:05:31.480 --> 03:05:35.200]  acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for
[03:05:35.200 --> 03:05:38.120]  civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have
[03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:41.280]  organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world we
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:44.680]  also you believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme
[03:05:44.680 --> 03:05:48.000]  against the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:51.600]  more of us realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in light of the
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:54.680]  people generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will
[03:05:54.680 --> 03:05:58.480]  vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is Kit Daniels with info wars

[03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:19.040]  will decide from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:08:19.040 --> 03:08:28.600]  we got the truth it's the hydrogen bomb of weapons we are using it you see the
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:38.080]  effects thinking people are listening I was out there watching Fox News here in
[03:08:38.080 --> 03:08:41.920]  regular like Trump hasn't responded to the speeches last night his tweets said
[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:45.560]  Hillary Kerry's destruction and corruption and lies behind her it's all
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:49.560]  a fraud he put up countless tweets about how she's a sellout I mean they're up on
[03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:57.640]  info wars.com but I have to tell you Trump is playing this very very fair while
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:09:01.920]  Hillary stole the nomination if I was Trump he's already really been
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:05.800]  aggressive but I would do stuff like during the DNC I'd have just been live
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:09.280]  during the speeches every night with the press conference I'd say their crooked
[03:09:09.280 --> 03:09:12.520]  they stole the nomination it's all a legitimate so I'm just up here talking
[03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:17.480]  about how their crooked and how they stole the election and here's some
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:21.120]  clips of the super delegate submitting they were gonna steal it I mean every
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:24.880]  time he does that he goes up in the polls I know his general advisors telling
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:31.440]  back off but now I hear his general advisors sounding like yours truly and
[03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:35.880]  sounding like Roger Stone because that's the truth when you're faced with
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:42.080]  outrageous corruption outrageous over-the-top redonkulous garbage the
[03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:46.520]  only response back is to say it's ridiculous I mean when she steals the
[03:09:46.520 --> 03:09:50.080]  nomination she stole it we're not the radicals here I want to explain that
[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:56.040]  every time a cop gets their head blown off or shot in the back just randomly
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:01.000]  black cops white cops you name it just by crazy people the president goes the
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:07.240]  police better reform themselves and Hillary says they better listen up that
[03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:13.680]  takes all this to a whole nother level now folks this government is an active
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:17.920]  terrorism against our local governments and the American people and make no
[03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:21.760]  mistake you can get mad at cops revenue generating or arrogant cops and Lord
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:24.520]  knows they're there and I'm the guy that opposes that but not because I hate
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:28.480]  them or want to kill people just because there's a bad cop and I'm against them
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:34.400]  doesn't mean I'm some maniac wants to kill innocent people they wouldn't be
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:38.080]  doing stuff like this unless they're thinking about overthrowing everything
[03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:44.880]  and I mean cities burning and just the end folks of this country or at least
[03:10:44.880 --> 03:10:47.000]  for a while it's gonna be hellish because here's the deal
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:51.680]  patriots aren't going away and we're not looking for trouble and we don't shoot
[03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:55.440]  our mouths off but let me just say everybody pushing this mass murder crap
[03:10:55.440 --> 03:11:01.840]  and all this other crazy sedition you better believe you shouldn't be worried
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:05.280]  about Alex Jones but the veterans and the police officers they are going to
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:11.040]  clean your clock when the veneer comes back and they don't want to do that but
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:17.560]  believe me believe me you think you're doing all this in a vacuum and that you
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:24.720]  are immune you better think twice and everybody knows I don't make threats and
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:28.640]  I'm not intended myself to do anything except stand here and carry out the truth
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:33.400]  and warn people I'm doing the main job of exposing these people and you are
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:37.760]  doing the main job but man let me tell you they have gone super weaponized they
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:41.120]  the globalists have escalated levels I didn't think they'd be doing right now
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:44.880]  I thought it was later which means they've moved their timetable up just got
[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:49.720]  chills oh my god whoa I mean Rob do I'm gonna go back to calls here and then go
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:52.920]  to you doing the fourth hour you've been working 17 days straight we just talked
[03:11:52.920 --> 03:11:55.520]  in the break I haven't told you to do that you want to do it for your family
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:59.880]  you've been here you know eight years or whatever some folks 15 years like Paul
[03:11:59.880 --> 03:12:04.280]  Watson I mean do you disagree with me that the energy level both on good and
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:09.160]  bad has now reached just epic crescendo level yeah we it's the quickening like
[03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:12.840]  you said it starts off going real slow like that and all sudden it ramps up and
[03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:17.360]  I think we're in that ramp up phase where it's about to go supernova and it's on
[03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:20.960]  both sides the awakenings happening on both sides I mean Bernie people are
[03:12:20.960 --> 03:12:24.280]  waking up to the corruption you know Trump people are waking up to the
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:27.600]  corruption and then you've still got these diehard groups on both sides that
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:31.280]  are just trying to keep the system going along and pretending like nothing's
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:34.520]  really happening and that anybody who steps out and says anything is a crazy
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:38.040]  conspiracy theories but you're talking about cops this morning San Diego police
[03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:41.000]  shooting SWAT teams arounds home after one officer killed another one shot in
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:45.280]  surgery right now so the war on police is still intensifying and then you got
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:51.520]  Breitbart again it is a war it's a war on stability for destabilization exactly
[03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:56.960]  and now black lives matter is going back to resume protests in Dallas after the
[03:12:56.960 --> 03:13:02.080]  massacre of police so and they were jeering during a moment of silence
[03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:04.600]  during the Democratic National Convention we got that clip we'll have
[03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:08.760]  played that can we cue that up yeah the jeering when they put a woman cop up
[03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:12.200]  there police chief and say you know because it backfired having no American
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:15.640]  flags having black lives matter up there with no cops so then they try it and
[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:19.280]  there's such it to me these are government lovers but then they hate the
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:24.120]  cops exactly except they call the cops right and what's gonna happen is the
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:27.160]  cops aren't gonna show up to your community when something goes down or
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:31.080]  they're gonna wait and let it happen and then the good cops are sick of it
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:32.920]  they're gonna get out and then they're gonna get their little globalist
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:35.560]  bureaucrats in let's go ahead and play exactly that clip from last night here
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:49.240]  this please help me in honor of all of American fallen officers with a moment of
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:14:06.800]  silence I am privileged to introduce to you so they stop the moment of silence
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:10.560]  people we all black and that's loopy valdez the Dallas County Sheriff the
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:13.720]  Dallas police let us when they when the judge said no free speech we said we're
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:17.760]  going over the 40th Dallas police did their job protecting us then after the
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:21.960]  thing was all over just here come 50 Dallas Sheriff's Department
[03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:27.400]  basically all Democrats to attack us including children Dallas police were
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:31.080]  blown away but stood there and it was loopy valdez and the Democrats so I
[03:14:31.080 --> 03:14:35.920]  mean that woman is a monster and those people were deputized Alex they were
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:39.080]  dead it seemed like that day they just deputized some people got some local
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:42.880]  thug bouncers from the area definitely like big everybody was like six foot
[03:14:42.880 --> 03:14:48.200]  big and fat other it was disgusting I think even even David Knight said look
[03:14:48.200 --> 03:14:51.560]  at that fat pig one of those guys it was just like rolly-polying over there
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:55.640]  pushing people well my point is here she is either the one cop they have up
[03:14:55.640 --> 03:15:01.320]  there is this is this little recon Keith's the communists well that's the
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:04.320]  way they play that's the way they play it's incredible I'm gonna go some calls
[03:15:04.320 --> 03:15:07.680]  and let you take over finishing up with Brian in California you were trying to
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:10.280]  get into the products interrupted you trying to make another point about
[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:15.240]  election time go ahead look you know Alex when you take into consideration that
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:18.840]  there is an end to this financial disaster that we're facing not only in
[03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:22.640]  this country but around the world and then you take into the events of the
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:27.000]  job numbers reports the precious metal manipulation the Deutsche Bank numbers
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:30.400]  that just came out but it's the Italian banks need another belly up bail out
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:34.640]  there were the world is teetering on the edge of collapse there has to be an
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:38.080]  end to this and they know but the thing that the American people don't know is
[03:15:38.080 --> 03:15:42.440]  there's a system that's already in place to clamp down on you harder than you
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:47.200]  have ever thought in your life and it's already in place so that anything can
[03:15:47.200 --> 03:15:50.360]  start in you know it could be a false flag you know us obviously trying to
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:54.680]  start a war over in Russia over a bunch of obviously allegations that probably
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:15:59.360]  are founded obviously we have the problems at home so again there's there's
[03:15:59.360 --> 03:16:03.480]  I last because people were saying how dark Trump's speech was how dark Trump's
[03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:07.120]  speech was I thought it was fantastic and the thing that people don't
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:11.840]  understand is as dark as things are like you always say there's the level of
[03:16:11.840 --> 03:16:15.600]  Newtonian physics that we have to acknowledge there is a force behind
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:20.040]  this right now that they cannot stop and that is scaring them it's making them
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:24.360]  desperate so that's why I'm saying Trump cannot be on a debate stage with
[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:28.760]  Hillary Clinton because he exposes her too much but on top of that he exposes
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:35.120]  her handlers too much well said my friend I appreciate your call Brian I'm
[03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:40.200]  gonna jump to others now Todd Michigan thanks for holding her on the air may
[03:16:40.200 --> 03:16:47.240]  God bless all you say and do Alex Jones thank you I would like to change the
[03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:51.520]  playbook up a little from what you've been talking about today and let Alex
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:59.760]  Jones do what Alex Jones does and let Donald Trump kind of sink back a while
[03:16:59.760 --> 03:17:04.800]  and figure out who all the real players are you know it's time to get biblical I
[03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:11.520]  mean somebody's not reading the playbook here and no Trump grew up listening
[03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:16.160]  Norman Vincent Peel so he's got it in him so I think we need to change up the
[03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:20.360]  playbook a little there and just go biblical and I'm not gonna quote scripture
[03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:23.760]  but I did send an email well I'm out of your question I mean look my issue is
[03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:27.880]  obviously I I have a huge large audience of patriots come to the core of their
[03:17:27.880 --> 03:17:32.120]  populace resistance here in America you're it it's not me I'm just one one of
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:36.640]  you I mean I obviously Trump here's from us we talked to Trump I'm gonna stop
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:42.360]  right there as the media makes a big thing out of it and you know here's the
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:46.280]  I could get Trump back on right now but then it's my kind of my decision really
[03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:48.920]  and I'm kind of thinking is that good or is that bad I'm not sure so I'm kind of
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:54.080]  leaving alone it's not about my show it's about defeating Hillary so I don't
[03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:58.040]  really know overall what Trump should do he's a pretty smart guy I think he
[03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:01.080]  should come out and just expose that Hillary already stole the nomination
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:04.440]  social still anything but he talked about biblical he should come out just
[03:18:04.440 --> 03:18:10.480]  like just like you know Ben Carson did and say this is satanic I mean Hillary
[03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:14.920]  pledged allegiance to Lucifer basically well like a left-collar said you know
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:19.560]  he's shown his hand too much he needs you know there's a lot of people out
[03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:23.960]  there that don't like the way he says things even though he's telling a bunch
[03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:28.160]  of whining dumbasses because the entire establishment is after Trump so if you
[03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:31.560]  claim you're against the establishment and you want our industry back and you
[03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:35.280]  don't want to be a poor dumbass you should vote for Donald Trump I mean it's
[03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:40.960]  so obvious the whole system hates him they're probably gonna kill him I just
[03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:43.840]  hope all the jackasses out there when they blow his plane up or shooting
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:49.240]  remember they were dumbasses well you know that we need to educate the ones
[03:18:49.240 --> 03:18:54.960]  that aren't awake and we need to put the ones that are awake to work I hear you
[03:18:54.960 --> 03:18:58.400]  and I appreciate your call Todd yeah people need to go vote any other people
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:01.200]  to vote they need to be talking about the corruption they get the articles and
[03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:05.160]  infowars.com about election fraud and Hillary being a scammer and Twitter
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:08.560]  censoring him and Google I mean they're just blocking him on Twitter Google
[03:19:08.560 --> 03:19:13.520]  everywhere where you he doesn't even exist and he's ahead of Hillary I mean
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:20.040]  this is in America in our election open meddling Congress the Republican should
[03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:24.200]  be hauling the head of Twitter and Facebook in right now I'm gonna go back
[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:28.040]  to calls that Rob do I mean this is crazy level censorship people go well
[03:19:28.040 --> 03:19:31.400]  out so what that's just Trump if they can do it to Trump you know drudge is
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:36.240]  next well and I have an interview that one of our newer production members
[03:19:36.240 --> 03:19:40.120]  Gabe Goldheim and got out and at the DNC and it's a makeup artist he's somebody
[03:19:40.120 --> 03:19:43.560]  who works with these people all the time and he said you know what do you think
[03:19:43.560 --> 03:19:46.640]  what what if you tried to search Hillary Clinton's name as a presidential
[03:19:46.640 --> 03:19:49.920]  candidate it didn't come up you think that's a big deal he's like I don't know
[03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:53.600]  he goes well you know actually what's going on right now is when you search
[03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:56.560]  the name Donald Trump presidential candidate just happened in two days ago
[03:19:56.560 --> 03:20:02.160]  and nothing comes up and she goes so like it's no big deal like and she goes
[03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:05.520]  they're a private company they can do what they want oh yeah they hold out
[03:20:05.520 --> 03:20:08.720]  they're giving you a real search but they're not telling you there's a
[03:20:08.720 --> 03:20:11.240]  presidential candidate I mean I mean that's like the Soviet Union you have a
[03:20:11.240 --> 03:20:15.520]  newspaper they won't tell you who the candidates are exactly but you know she's
[03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:20.400]  just a symptom of modern America's just like so because they think they're with
[03:20:20.400 --> 03:20:25.680]  the power structure they've got power they're chomps yeah and when people have
[03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:30.160]  this attitude the system has no respect we've had wealth because the system was
[03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:34.560]  afraid of the people and because we had freedom comparatively yeah it doesn't you
[03:20:34.560 --> 03:20:38.400]  know here's the good news smart hard-working people always do okay
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:41.760]  this is a nuclear war all these jackasses that have been wanting to go
[03:20:41.760 --> 03:20:45.600]  along with us oh yeah they're the ones that are screwed exactly I mean they
[03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:51.920]  have no idea how screwed they are I mean it is just it is just I mean wow wow this
[03:20:51.920 --> 03:20:57.360]  is beyond Provda you know 1960 I mean this is just classic we never have any
[03:20:57.360 --> 03:21:01.960]  excuse to talk about you know communist countries or Nazis or whatever with
[03:21:01.960 --> 03:21:06.680]  their censorship when we now are beyond it but there's a paradox there's
[03:21:06.680 --> 03:21:10.160]  censorship going on but then there's still freedom outside of it next phases
[03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:14.440]  are coming after us do yeah there there that is and what I think is amazing is
[03:21:14.440 --> 03:21:16.760]  that all these leftists complain and bitch about the government and the
[03:21:16.760 --> 03:21:20.360]  stealing and all this and the corruption yet their their solution is more
[03:21:20.360 --> 03:21:23.440]  government it's like what will give the government more power and but it'll be a
[03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:26.560]  nice benevolent government no it doesn't work like that it never works like
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:30.680]  that ever ever ever just your your last guest was talking about how there were
[03:21:30.680 --> 03:21:34.880]  thousands of years of Chinese dictators and Mongolian dictators and Egyptian
[03:21:34.880 --> 03:21:39.200]  dictators it doesn't change they weren't benevolent to their people they never
[03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:43.600]  are they give the people enough just to get by and when the United States is the
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:46.480]  only country where you had true freedom and that's why you have people building
[03:21:46.480 --> 03:21:49.720]  boats out of trash to get here that's right James in Texas James you're on the
[03:21:49.720 --> 03:21:51.680]  air go ahead
[03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:58.240]  I just wanted to mention the fact that everybody keeps saying that Hillary stole Bernie Sanders'
[03:21:58.240 --> 03:22:02.080]  you know stole the convention she didn't steal anything Bernie Sanders gave it to her
[03:22:02.080 --> 03:22:06.200]  no no no I agree but she stole the popular vote look that's why I don't say
[03:22:06.200 --> 03:22:10.160]  she stole it from Sanders Sanders was a show the whole time stood down we knew he
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:16.160]  do it dirtbag that he is but the people that voted in election law they were
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:19.760]  robbed and the delegates were robbed they wouldn't go along the super
[03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:23.960]  delegates took it and so you're absolutely right that Sanders is a party to
[03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:29.600]  it but she did steal the votes right he was controlled opposition from the
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:34.280]  beginning and so I think it's imperative right now that the Republicans and
[03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:37.680]  Donald Trump and you and I and everybody reach out to the Bernie Sanders
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:42.200]  reporters as soon as possible because they got out of control you know this
[03:22:42.200 --> 03:22:47.120]  plan from beginning for to energize their base with somebody who is
[03:22:47.120 --> 03:22:53.000]  promising stuff that you know was not even close to being possible was just a
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:57.400]  yeah they wanted a bunch of communists and socialists and people and well
[03:22:57.400 --> 03:23:01.760]  meaning leftist populace to go vote to get them into the database into the
[03:23:01.760 --> 03:23:05.440]  game knowing Hillary couldn't even do that yes it was all planned behind closed
[03:23:05.440 --> 03:23:10.760]  doors with Sanders he is a total Benedict Arnold he is Judas Iscariot but
[03:23:10.760 --> 03:23:14.800]  we need to educate the his voters and his people that that's what happened
[03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:18.280]  because they don't understand that they just think that it was fraud they think
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:22.680]  that Bernie was for them they don't realize that he was for Hillary from day
[03:23:22.680 --> 03:23:25.640]  one and that's why I tell him to sit there and act mad when Hillary talks
[03:23:25.640 --> 03:23:29.600]  about him it's all that guy is such a dirtbag he thinks he's smarter than you
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:34.640]  he's praying on you and your family he's the smart guy Bernie Sanders is a
[03:23:34.640 --> 03:23:40.200]  demon I agree with you James thank you Rob do your take on that I don't think
[03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:47.760]  he's qualified either Alex yeah he was the voice of the the principle
[03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:54.160]  maybe some other yeah in California you're on the air welcome hi I'm an

[03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:17.680]  think Hillary's been trying to steal the election sure he stole the nomination
[03:24:17.680 --> 03:24:29.760]  yes the movie Hillary's America sets the facts and educate about this whole theft
[03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:38.240]  of our country and we need entrance cards documenting the groups of illegal
[03:24:38.240 --> 03:24:43.880]  aliens that are paid and bust I agree it's totally criminal I appreciate your
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:47.520]  call let's go ahead and go to Daniel Daniel in Wisconsin you're on the year
[03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:52.880]  worldwide this Friday edition go ahead hello Alex yes sir can you hear me yes
[03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:56.640]  sir special thanks special thanks to all the info warriors out there and
[03:24:56.640 --> 03:25:01.560]  everybody I won't be too long so I just want to touch on what's going on locally
[03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:07.280]  I'm a student an adult student at Union University of Wisconsin Madison and we're
[03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:12.440]  seeing programs come out relating to cultural proficiency and I want to say
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:16.240]  you know I'm working on getting this done locally and I'm getting this issue
[03:25:16.240 --> 03:25:20.080]  fixed and resolved sure but you're not taught about from the science and math
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:23.840]  or business or networking you're taught about obsessing over culture and then
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:31.000]  many it's about terminology and language specifically they want to
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:36.680]  frame it like this what are the the terminology that people need to know
[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:43.360]  about in order to talk about race the racism that in itself can be a secondary
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:49.000]  message by choosing what terms they want to include and exclude so I've been
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:52.480]  working with the organization called the flyer.org and if you have a
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:57.800]  listeners out there who are a college student and info warriors and they have
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:04.720]  similar issues check out that organization they're very very successful at
[03:26:04.720 --> 03:26:09.640]  putting pressure on universities that are rolling out these kind of absolutely
[03:26:09.640 --> 03:26:12.360]  we should really put pressure because like some college degrees or worse
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:15.760]  something engineering things like that but 80 plus percent of them are totally
[03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:19.920]  worthless and the real answers just let them collapse don't go to them or if
[03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:24.000]  you're there do it as just a political thing to try to document inside these
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:27.320]  brainwashing centers what's going on I appreciate your call look I'm out of time

[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:49.720]  the guy from Madison was talking about all the terminology they have to use I
[03:28:49.720 --> 03:28:53.640]  have two videos that I shot going on interviewing people out at these in
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:57.640]  these young college towns one I am a binary female male of the seven nine
[03:28:57.640 --> 03:29:02.320]  quarter of the 14th galaxy of the 19th kumbar they have a dictionary of terms
[03:29:02.320 --> 03:29:06.640]  one of his drunk Bernie supporters run amok but the one here Bernie socialist
[03:29:06.640 --> 03:29:09.640]  worship capitalist products this young lady right here if y'all can pull it up
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:14.240]  on screen she had the terminology down and she sat there and talked in circles
[03:29:14.240 --> 03:29:21.920]  for literally five minutes it's all just I forgot my own question it is it is
[03:29:21.920 --> 03:29:25.760]  let's play some of these I mean these these videos are gold the new age
[03:29:25.760 --> 03:29:30.600]  screen links the new Carl the cock it's all there for you a meme goldmine it is
[03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:35.080]  maybe sat down to ridicule all this we're gonna rewrite back with Rob do I'm

[03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:44.520]  day I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to get some rest it's gonna be a good weekend
[03:29:44.520 --> 03:29:55.320]  we're on the March the Empire's on the really back Alex Joe the GCN radio
[03:29:55.320 --> 03:30:02.080]  is now now now now now now despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works
[03:30:02.080 --> 03:30:05.560]  here's five reasons why it won't number one California has many of the most
[03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:09.560]  restrictive gun laws in the country yet those laws did absolutely nothing to
[03:30:09.560 --> 03:30:13.160]  stop the San Bernardino shooting number two Paris France also has some of the
[03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:16.520]  most restrictive gun laws in the world but those laws also did nothing to stop
[03:30:16.520 --> 03:30:20.520]  the November 13th ISIS attacks number three it's estimated that someone in
[03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:25.640]  Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws number four
[03:30:25.640 --> 03:30:29.880]  Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago yet over a hundred and
[03:30:29.880 --> 03:30:33.920]  sixty thousand people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007 the
[03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:37.440]  only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels or private citizens
[03:30:37.440 --> 03:30:41.920]  who are openly defined Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense malicious number
[03:30:41.920 --> 03:30:46.120]  five president Obama has been arming and funding ISIS link Syrian rebels for quite
[03:30:46.120 --> 03:30:49.960]  some time in fact Obama reproved the re-arming of the so-called moderate
[03:30:49.960 --> 03:30:54.000]  rebels on October 1st the same day he called for gun control in response to
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:57.280]  the community college shooting up in Oregon you can find out more info
[03:30:57.280 --> 03:31:01.480]  worst comms get Daniels reporting not a group you develop living defense for us
[03:31:01.480 --> 03:31:05.560]  it took you over a year to do it why is this so good because people are actually
[03:31:05.560 --> 03:31:10.080]  waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to
[03:31:10.080 --> 03:31:14.120]  make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my
[03:31:14.120 --> 03:31:19.160]  system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything
[03:31:19.160 --> 03:31:23.480]  that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all
[03:31:23.480 --> 03:31:28.600]  the refugees spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on
[03:31:28.600 --> 03:31:31.800]  everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff I said there's
[03:31:31.800 --> 03:31:35.040]  so many things that are in it you have the name in there you have the organic
[03:31:35.040 --> 03:31:39.680]  clove bud the organic wormwood I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at
[03:31:39.680 --> 03:31:42.800]  least twice a year all right well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm
[03:31:42.800 --> 03:31:45.920]  going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense info

[03:32:07.720 --> 03:32:11.040]  brain force it I've been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching
[03:32:11.040 --> 03:32:16.000]  basketball I get in here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't
[03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:18.560]  feel like I was gonna make it and I really want to do a good job on the
[03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:22.320]  interview I got my bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about
[03:32:22.320 --> 03:32:26.400]  20 minutes later it's like being everything just kind of clears up got
[03:32:26.400 --> 03:32:30.680]  four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third
[03:32:30.680 --> 03:32:34.680]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have

[03:32:39.320 --> 03:32:42.080]  all night or like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without

[03:32:46.840 --> 03:32:50.880]  took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain force and other

[03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:32.720]  So during the break Alex and I were just looking at the myriad of YouTube videos
[03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:36.040]  that have been put up over the weekend by our hard-working crew out at the DNC
[03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:41.920]  it was Joe Biggs, Kit Daniels, David Knight, Michael Zimmerman, Gabe Goldheim
[03:33:41.920 --> 03:33:47.720]  and and others were out there Richard Reeves was out there helping provide
[03:33:47.720 --> 03:33:53.160]  technical support and just the sheer amount of stuff in there it's hard to
[03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:58.080]  go like we're good at really putting it out there and it's really great when
[03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:02.760]  people other people grab this stuff and and reuse it and take the best parts out
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:06.560]  of them like if you look this our Democrats really this stupid that was
[03:34:06.560 --> 03:34:11.760]  Josh Owen's taking a couple different videos from the DNC that that we put
[03:34:11.760 --> 03:34:14.720]  out and then fusing them together getting these people when they put their
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:20.040]  foot in their mouth and just showing how they do it so it's really effective way
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:24.960]  now this first video I want to go to this is with Gabe Goldheim and talking
[03:34:24.960 --> 03:34:28.640]  to a makeup artist it's called Coward makeup artist says just accept
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:33.640]  globalism and it's just amazing this way it doesn't care about anything she's
[03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:36.840]  here working you know and in the Democratic National Convention it
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:40.680]  doesn't have a political care or thought in the world and thinks that you know
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:44.800]  open theft is okay so let's roll that video would you mind telling us what
[03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:48.120]  your role is and what your yeah what your role is and what you're here for
[03:34:48.120 --> 03:34:54.560]  today here to do makeup okay that's cool now what if I told you that Trump's
[03:34:54.560 --> 03:34:59.600]  campaign was attacking Hillary's campaign through Google and if you try to
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:03.880]  search presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that nothing comes up what do
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:07.040]  you think should be done about that
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:17.160]  who cares okay well that's good because because that's that's actually not true
[03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:20.920]  what's actually happening is that if you search presidential candidate Donald
[03:35:20.920 --> 03:35:25.240]  Trump that's the set specific term nothing comes up if you search
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:29.800]  presidential candidate Jill Stein her picture comes up paraphernalia Hillary
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:35.160]  Clinton same thing Bernie Sanders same thing so what do you believe what do you
[03:35:35.160 --> 03:35:42.040]  believe should be done about that I mean that's that's like free speech there I
[03:35:42.040 --> 03:35:45.680]  don't like these interviews it doesn't have to be anything heavily
[03:35:45.680 --> 03:35:54.000]  philosophical just you know real simple Google is privately owned right well
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:58.480]  that doesn't give them the right to infringe on free speech and access to
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:36:07.520]  information freely welcome to the media thank you so what we have here with the
[03:36:07.520 --> 03:36:14.360]  the you have a spineless jellyfish what you have is just accepted this is the
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:19.560]  theme here it's it's a growing reality just accept it just accept it the
[03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:25.160]  hypnosis the sire the four miles offense repetition just accept it the
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:30.440]  open theft the line is the nominee just accept that Google is censoring
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:35.160]  information just accept that Facebook is censoring information just accept that
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:38.880]  there will be terrorist attacks every single day in Europe and the United
[03:36:38.880 --> 03:36:45.080]  States just accept it this is absolutely unacceptable by my standards and this is
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:49.840]  why the globalists will take over because everybody's just land and that is a
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:54.080]  perfect microcosm of what we run into all across the country people just
[03:36:54.080 --> 03:36:59.480]  accepting their fate their reality and just giving in to the tyranny say well
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:03.400]  what can I do I'm just one person well when people stand up things start to
[03:37:03.400 --> 03:37:08.960]  change obviously we saw the bear the formal barrier get bigger because so many
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:12.600]  protesters and these were these weren't Republican protesters these weren't
[03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:16.720]  conservatives going there beating on gates and lighting fires these were
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:21.200]  leftists who were pissed off about the theft from Bernie Sanders but speaking
[03:37:21.200 --> 03:37:26.840]  of this except of more terror attacks FBI boss says defeat of Islamic State
[03:37:26.840 --> 03:37:31.080]  means more terror in Europe and America and that's James Comey that's the guy
[03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:35.280]  who just let off Billery Clinton and Billery at some point there's going to
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:39.280]  be a terrorist just diaspora out of Syria like we never seen before not all
[03:37:39.280 --> 03:37:44.040]  Islamic State killers are going to die on the battlefield which is why we
[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:47.520]  shouldn't get marred in these regions and begin with and that's you know one of
[03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:53.040]  the probably the only positive that George the original grandpa grandpa Bush
[03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:59.960]  old HW did was not invade Iraq he stopped after pushing him out of Kuwait
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:04.160]  which they kind of baited Saddam into coming into and now out of the UK
[03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:08.760]  Merkel must go Germans playing huge demonstration over leaders open door
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:13.920]  asylum policy people are starting to get pissed even in Germany they are sick of
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:18.760]  the attacks they're sick of of of the media covering it up they're sick of
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:23.400]  the politicians pretending like it's not a big deal and then here's a little
[03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:28.080]  meme I made last night you guys and get a shot of this and it's that embrace of
[03:38:28.080 --> 03:38:32.520]  Hillary and Barack on the stage I believe this is the night they actually
[03:38:32.520 --> 03:38:37.560]  declared her the nominee rest easy girl we've almost destroyed the country and
[03:38:37.560 --> 03:38:41.360]  that's what's going to happen people that's what will happen if we let Hillary
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:44.200]  Clinton get in charge so I hope you get off your duff I hope you're doing
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:49.520]  something hope you're not standing by and letting these people take over now
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:52.560]  before we go any further I got another couple videos I want to play at least
[03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:57.800]  parts of but we have a bit where it's the leftovers of operation sleeping giant

[03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:37.360]  thousands of stones out of her body and had pain on the right side of her body
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:41.760]  and could barely move and and she basically said I want to thank Dr. Group
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:46.000]  for I think saving my life that's that's how she felt so try the products
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:51.960]  of course consult your doctor and I'm not a doctor so do your own research now
[03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:58.360]  let's look what happens in the future if Hillary does get into office and takes
[03:40:58.360 --> 03:41:01.840]  her tax rates gives us her tax I she wants to do another trillion in taxes
[03:41:01.840 --> 03:41:05.880]  already the income taxes that they've collected are the highest in history and
[03:41:05.880 --> 03:41:08.960]  yet they still keep spending more money because you keep giving them more money
[03:41:08.960 --> 03:41:11.800]  they think they could spend more money because they don't understand how debt
[03:41:11.800 --> 03:41:15.360]  works or I think they do they just want to try to run this country into the
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:22.680]  ground yeah the the American tax it's ATR I forget what that stands for
[03:41:22.680 --> 03:41:26.720]  Americans for tax reform they look at Hillary Clinton's one trillion in tax
[03:41:26.720 --> 03:41:32.440]  increases 350 billion is going to come from itemized reductions 275 billions
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:38.680]  or more business taxes to get rid of our increase the capital gains tax put a
[03:41:38.680 --> 03:41:42.320]  tax on stock trading which is going to affect you if you hold 401ks or IRAs or
[03:41:42.320 --> 03:41:48.760]  any other savings accounts and keep the they have this exit tax where they want
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:53.960]  to go after companies that are that are that are operating all over the world
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:41:58.800]  which makes sense but what the reason these companies are not operating in
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:02.920]  the United States is because there's a 39% corporate tax rate when most of the
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:08.640]  developed world it's at 25% okay and 31 of the 34 developed countries have cut
[03:42:08.640 --> 03:42:13.840]  their corporate taxes since 2000 okay but no not here we need more money now
[03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:19.560]  10 months ago they ATR Americans for tax reform did a analyst of Donald
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:23.000]  Trump's tax plan and they said it looks like people are gonna be making more
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:28.640]  money he's gonna simplify the individual tax brackets he is gonna take
[03:42:28.640 --> 03:42:32.240]  down some of the deductions but that's where you see a lot of businesses and
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:36.640]  people taking advantage of the system so simplifying that make it happen
[03:42:36.640 --> 03:42:41.600]  quicker drop the business tax rate to 15% that's gonna bring businesses back
[03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:44.800]  from all over the world into this country which is gonna be more jobs and
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:48.460]  with more people working it's gonna be more taxes because people are saying
[03:42:48.460 --> 03:42:51.560]  well it's gonna drop our income tax levels no it won't if you have more
[03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:54.840]  people working it's gonna raise the tax levels and we're gonna have more people
[03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:59.800]  working which is gonna stimulate the economy and so you can read both of
[03:42:59.800 --> 03:43:04.600]  those tax plans you just go to ATR and just look up Hillary's tax plan or
[03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:08.080]  Hillary's tax plan and then Donald Trump's tax reform incidentally Donald
[03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:13.360]  Trump put his out 10 months ago we just got Hillary's because she wants to
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:17.320]  release it during all this other turmoil that's going on so nobody really looks
[03:43:17.320 --> 03:43:20.600]  at what her policies are but they're gonna cost you a lot more money so
[03:43:20.600 --> 03:43:25.080]  going back to what our country will look like in a few years if Hillary gains
[03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:30.480]  control how would you like to have armed soldiers at your supermarket telling
[03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:35.120]  you what to sell your beef at well if you're the citizens and you're getting a
[03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:38.160]  good discount you might like that especially if you're hungry but if
[03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:41.640]  you're the guy who's invested his time and money into starting a business you
[03:43:41.640 --> 03:43:46.280]  might not like that here's the story of Daniel he said the army demanded that
[03:43:46.280 --> 03:43:53.240]  Daniel sell his beef at 250 boulevards roughly 25 cents at the black market
[03:43:53.240 --> 03:43:57.120]  rates a kilo even though he explained it costs 3,000 boulevards to buy from his
[03:43:57.120 --> 03:44:01.080]  suppliers and the military said that beef belongs to the people there he's
[03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:04.360]  right there in the financial truck times when two trucks loaded with soldiers
[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:08.640]  pulled up outside his butcher shop Daniel fell to deep unease yeah that's
[03:44:08.640 --> 03:44:12.960]  right because that's what they're gonna do right now they're having 700%
[03:44:12.960 --> 03:44:16.960]  inflation they're having all kinds of controls the government has seized the
[03:44:16.960 --> 03:44:20.960]  ports several government ministries now report directly to the minister of
[03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:25.240]  defense and that is not the world you want to be living in murders off the
[03:44:25.240 --> 03:44:28.800]  charts they can't do anything with the police but what do we have here going on
[03:44:28.800 --> 03:44:35.200]  here still Virginia police trained for civil unrest and race riots that's
[03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:39.880]  right they're training because they know that the economy is going to implode
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:45.040]  eventually and there will be too many there'll be too much debt to sustain
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:48.600]  ourselves and something's gonna something's gonna break it the system
[03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:53.600]  and then there's gonna be riots will it be an ebt scam where we see nobody get
[03:44:53.600 --> 03:44:59.400]  their ebt food stamps the electronic food stamp the electronic soup line if
[03:44:59.400 --> 03:45:03.400]  those stop maybe for two weeks what's gonna happen was gonna be rioting then
[03:45:03.400 --> 03:45:06.440]  you get a demand that the police take the streets and impose martial law and
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:12.360]  it's all done on purpose it's all done to you know the command and control to
[03:45:12.360 --> 03:45:16.640]  ramp it up so let's go and then and then we have these people who don't believe in
[03:45:16.640 --> 03:45:22.040]  reality and David Knight found a another Democrat who doesn't believe in
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:26.120]  reality and just likes to schlep it off we'll play part of this video I'll
[03:45:26.120 --> 03:45:28.680]  probably cut it out halfway through but it's called Democrat conspiracy
[03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:33.080]  theories and it's all the Russians fault that Hillary is a total monster and a
[03:45:33.080 --> 03:45:36.640]  thief in the DNC you know but the fact that they got caught is Russia's fault
[03:45:36.640 --> 03:45:40.520]  and Donald Trump's fault because Paul Manafort you know worked with Russia at
[03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:45.760]  one time so let's go to that video now my name is Marja Fedorio and I'm with the
[03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:50.080]  Ukrainian-American community and I work for the Ukrainian-American ethnic
[03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:55.960]  council of the Democratic National Committee and we are out here trying to
[03:45:55.960 --> 03:46:00.640]  get the word out to the American people that Trump is going to not is just a
[03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:06.920]  disaster for America and he's going to be a disaster for Europe because he is
[03:46:06.920 --> 03:46:14.280]  teamed up with Manafort who is now his campaign chair who is a Putin ally he
[03:46:14.280 --> 03:46:18.720]  does business with him Trump has started doing some things through his sons
[03:46:18.720 --> 03:46:24.360]  already we know that and we need information out there through the
[03:46:24.360 --> 03:46:30.360]  media that Putin is controlling our media even by these leaks well let me
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:33.600]  ask you about the leaks because you mentioned that you believe that Russia
[03:46:33.600 --> 03:46:37.440]  was involved in in these leaks but when we look at this they're talking about
[03:46:37.440 --> 03:46:42.240]  media collusion you know we've seen in the content of the emails we've seen
[03:46:42.240 --> 03:46:45.440]  collusion between Politico between Washington Post and others with the
[03:46:45.440 --> 03:46:51.320]  DNC do you think that the emails are not not true that they've been doctored are
[03:46:51.320 --> 03:46:54.260]  you talking about the release of them in other words you have a problem with the
[03:46:54.260 --> 03:46:58.120]  content of the emails or the fact that they're released the fact that they're
[03:46:58.120 --> 03:47:03.400]  released proves that Putin is behind it because he is definitely it's in his
[03:47:03.400 --> 03:47:10.520]  favor to have Trump win so that's a fact now the content the content we don't
[03:47:10.520 --> 03:47:15.360]  know the real facts the FBI is investigating they could have been
[03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:20.200]  doctored slightly edited we don't know but we know that the fact that they
[03:47:20.200 --> 03:47:27.240]  were released to favor Trump means Putin is behind it let me ask you about
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:32.320]  the the other email issue okay the one that Hillary Clinton had there hasn't
[03:47:32.320 --> 03:47:35.640]  been a lot of concern apparently within the Democrat Party about the fact that
[03:47:35.640 --> 03:47:39.520]  national security was compromised if you believe that the Russians were able to
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:44.760]  get the emails of the DNC and release those do you are you concerned about the
[03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:49.720]  fact that she put top-secret emails on her server that that would be available
[03:47:49.720 --> 03:47:54.720]  to the Russians or to individual hackers or to any friend or enemy of the
[03:47:54.720 --> 03:47:59.200]  United States I am concerned about that but I think that there has been a lot
[03:47:59.200 --> 03:48:05.640]  said about it that you can take it either way she was not she said herself if
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:09.720]  she had a choice to do it again she wouldn't do it that way I think she did
[03:48:09.720 --> 03:48:16.240]  that for expediency it was easier it was faster and I don't think that according
[03:48:16.240 --> 03:48:21.440]  to what I have read I don't think that there were emails there that were
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:26.240]  considered classified at the time that she was the FBI director said there was
[03:48:26.240 --> 03:48:29.960]  they were sent and received as classified emails he was very emphatic
[03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:35.640]  about that yes so you think he's lying possibly because he is a Bush appointee
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:43.560]  he is and he did not recommend that she be indicted for that in in fraction so
[03:48:43.560 --> 03:48:49.040]  it could be a little bit of gray in between well you know I followed the
[03:48:49.040 --> 03:48:56.160]  NSA whistleblowers and one of them in particular Thomas Drake they came after
[03:48:56.160 --> 03:49:00.480]  him after he had been a whistleblower and they came after him for four emails
[03:49:00.480 --> 03:49:04.040]  none of which were classified as a matter of fact they were things like a
[03:49:04.040 --> 03:49:07.520]  schedule of a project that had long since finished they said well you this
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:10.640]  should have been classified and you should have known it was classified and
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:14.440]  they came after him for possession of a classified document they had another
[03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:19.600]  document that was similar to that and they had him up for 35 years for four
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:22.960]  documents one of them was you know encryption is your friend it was a very
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:27.280]  generalized thing it was not it was not classified they classified it that day
[03:49:27.280 --> 03:49:31.080]  and then declassified it three months later I mean how do you feel about this
[03:49:31.080 --> 03:49:35.320]  double standard where you have NSA whistleblowers looking at 35 years in
[03:49:35.320 --> 03:49:40.080]  jail the the case blew up in their face as the day the day they were going to
[03:49:40.080 --> 03:49:43.880]  trial because that Monday is when they dropped it the Sunday before they had
[03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:48.120]  60 minutes to reveal that how do you feel about that versus the way Hillary
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:52.560]  Clinton was treated I really can't speak to that because I don't know the facts
[03:49:52.560 --> 03:49:57.320]  you basically just open my eyes to that case the whistleblower case that was
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:50:00.840]  alright so you see the hypocrisy the double standard the hypocritical
[03:50:00.840 --> 03:50:03.600]  attitude going on it's okay if Hillary Clinton does it because I wanted to be
[03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:10.560]  president and meanwhile an NSA whistleblower has emails retroactively
[03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:15.440]  made classified just so they can go arrest him I found this on on reddit it's
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:18.680]  pretty interesting H and it's called too big to jail you can get a shot of it
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:23.200]  over my hand HSBC funneled 80 million to the Clinton Foundation from Swiss bank
[03:50:23.200 --> 03:50:26.440]  accounts and they settled with the Justice Department for facilitating the
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:30.560]  money laundering and terrorist financing the Senate said that they serve drug
[03:50:30.560 --> 03:50:34.920]  kingpins and rogue nations well who served on their board of directors James
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:40.240]  Comey right before he became the FBI director who brokered the HSBC settlement
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:45.440]  Loretta Lynch and she also let him off the hook for evading 100 million in
[03:50:45.440 --> 03:50:51.760]  taxes there it is right there okay these people are above the law and they go
[03:50:51.760 --> 03:50:55.160]  after anybody else who has a crooked toenail stay tuned we'll be back with
[03:50:55.160 --> 03:51:00.160]  more this is Rob do with the fourth hour the info wars comm Alice Jones show if

[03:54:00.160 --> 03:54:26.480]  so a little over a month ago we had this video that I have on my screen here shows
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:31.280]  a 16-year-old black Trump supporter schooling a black lives matter moron who
[03:54:31.280 --> 03:54:37.520]  basically said that Donald Trump was gonna deport people back to Africa and if
[03:54:37.520 --> 03:54:41.760]  you guys could show people on screen that video right there there it is 16-year-old
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:46.640]  black Trump supporter schools black lives matter and moronic debate now we got a
[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:51.040]  video from David Knight at the DNC and this is a black lives matter supporter
[03:54:51.040 --> 03:54:55.960]  and Bernie Sanders delegate he thinks Trump's gonna bring back segregation so
[03:54:55.960 --> 03:54:59.360]  Trump's gonna do something to the blacks he's gonna do something bad he's gonna
[03:54:59.360 --> 03:55:04.000]  round them up he's gonna do something so let's play that video right now if
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:08.800]  Donald Trump becomes president I might have to go back to the black only
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:12.760]  water fountain that I might get more that I might make you think that I mean
[03:55:12.760 --> 03:55:16.040]  he's talked about keeping the borders I mean he's talked about putting up a wall
[03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:19.400]  from Mexico making them build it which will never get built because you can't
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:23.600]  just force a whole country to build another wall against us talk about shut
[03:55:23.600 --> 03:55:27.960]  down a ban on all Muslims making fun of people are handicapped well he's talking
[03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:30.920]  about getting control of immigration because we have so many people coming
[03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:35.400]  so quickly that we can't tell whether there's there's criminals or terrorists
[03:55:35.400 --> 03:55:38.400]  coming in we don't know who's coming in there's legal immigration and there's
[03:55:38.400 --> 03:55:42.600]  illegal immigration he's against the illegal immigration but I don't see him
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:46.080]  saying anything about making black people drink out of a water separate
[03:55:46.080 --> 03:55:50.160]  water fountain it's not necessarily I don't I'm not saying as if he said that
[03:55:50.160 --> 03:55:57.920]  verbatim as an example as an example ridiculous you can watch the whole
[03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:03.360]  video BLM supporter thinks Trump will bring back segregation actually the
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:07.360]  people want to bring back segregation are the blacks themselves exclusive new
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:10.400]  black Panther leader blacks need to migrate to five southern states form
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:16.040]  country within a country so they're saying it Donald Trump's not saying it
[03:56:16.040 --> 03:56:21.080]  they're saying it right there and this was let's see July 10th so about 18 days
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:29.280]  ago right there and you know blacks before you know the generation before
[03:56:29.280 --> 03:56:35.720]  these youngsters running around fought to not have separate water fountains to be
[03:56:35.720 --> 03:56:40.760]  able to eat in the same restaurant to integrate into American society fully and
[03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:46.280]  we have that now and they want to turn back the clock and say well we don't
[03:56:46.280 --> 03:56:52.440]  want to deal with white people anymore we don't like them well that's just good
[03:56:52.440 --> 03:56:56.720]  that you know I guess that's their own problem so I don't even know what to say
[03:56:56.720 --> 03:57:03.280]  there they're fed disinformation through these leftist media outlets because
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:06.680]  they want you to be afraid and they don't want you to talk to people I think
[03:57:06.680 --> 03:57:10.400]  we've had some of the best discourses at the DNC and I thought that was going to
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:16.280]  be the most violent towards our reporters and I was wrong it wasn't they were
[03:57:16.280 --> 03:57:21.040]  the Bernie people were opening open to talk they wanted to talk they
[03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:25.440]  wanted to exchange ideas you know I don't agree with their economic policies
[03:57:25.440 --> 03:57:30.280]  but I think you know there are places for us where we can't find common ground
[03:57:30.280 --> 03:57:33.720]  and then help take this country back from the globalist because those are the
[03:57:33.720 --> 03:57:37.200]  people who are in control Donald Trump hasn't been in office yet he didn't
[03:57:37.200 --> 03:57:41.920]  cause all this Hillary Clinton's 30 plus years in office what has she done
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:47.000]  what has she done she called black people super predators that's what she's done
[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:54.080]  she put more people in prison under her her husband under their crime bill so
[03:57:54.080 --> 03:57:58.720]  and there's this little thing called NAFTA the giant second sound once again
