[00:00.000 --> 00:17.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:17.400 --> 00:24.360]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones and now
[00:24.360 --> 00:31.920]  your host Owen Troyer there is a massive story developing in Brazil that the
[00:31.920 --> 00:40.120]  corrupt inept pathetic dinosaur legacy American media is ignoring but there's a
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.960]  story behind that story but first here's the Gregory's report breaking down
[00:45.960 --> 01:00.360]  what's happening in Brazil the people of Brazil are united together in protest
[01:00.360 --> 01:17.640]  against the globalist great reset in 2017 Louise Lula was convicted on charges
[01:17.640 --> 01:23.040]  of corruption and money laundering and sentenced to nine years in prison in
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.560]  April of last year he was released by the Brazilian Supreme Court to run
[01:28.560 --> 01:36.400]  against Bolsonaro he is supported by the world economic forum translating Lula
[01:36.400 --> 01:44.440]  was not elected Lula stole my vote stole from my people we will not create
[01:44.440 --> 01:52.760]  war we will not spill blood we will fight with peace this son of a
[01:52.760 --> 02:00.280]  alexandre demoras because he stole our votes and gave them to another criminal
[02:00.280 --> 02:05.840]  Lula they reversed his sentence in order to win
[02:05.840 --> 02:14.360]  criminally by stealing and diverting our votes this was dishonesty
[02:14.360 --> 02:22.880]  shameless criminal in my country there is no place for them and translation
[02:22.880 --> 02:29.120]  alexandre demoras is the minister of the supreme court of Brazil who just
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.480]  ordered the banks to block the accounts of anyone supporting the historic
[02:34.480 --> 02:48.120]  protest
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.400]  people all over the world took to the streets like the people of Brazil then
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.560]  the imminent global tyranny would be eradicated and this is why the media
[02:59.560 --> 03:05.560]  ignores it they're hoping you just stay home and watch it like a movie until it
[03:05.560 --> 03:11.440]  arrives at your front door and it's too late say let's pretend this brain is a
[03:11.440 --> 03:18.480]  puny little ant did that hurt nope how about this one
[03:18.480 --> 03:39.400]  are you kidding how about this you let one ant stand up to us then they all
[03:39.400 --> 03:47.280]  might stand up those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if
[03:47.280 --> 03:54.000]  they ever figure that out there goes our way of life it's not about food it's
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.440]  about keeping those ants in line
[03:59.280 --> 04:05.440]  reporting for info wars this is Greg Reese wow powerful stuff from Greg Reese
[04:05.440 --> 04:11.720]  and we stand with the great Brazilian people we're standing against their
[04:11.720 --> 04:16.000]  stolen election peacefully in the streets right now and I think well that's
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.600]  the story what is the story behind the story well it's that the American media
[04:20.600 --> 04:26.120]  won't even cover it it's that the American media won't even talk about it
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.920]  and we all know why because they were in the tank for the corrupt communist
[04:31.920 --> 04:38.080]  criminal lula and because they know that we already had our moment that they
[04:38.080 --> 04:41.760]  completely scuttled and turned into their Reichstag moment and that was
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.280]  January 6th where there's new footage coming out that show the people that
[04:47.280 --> 04:50.800]  were in the building that orchestrated leading people into the building and then
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.760]  opening up the doors are the only ones that haven't been arrested which means
[04:55.760 --> 05:02.520]  they're clearly being protected by somebody for some reason until about 150
[05:02.520 --> 05:08.480]  years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died
[05:08.480 --> 05:13.640]  in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors they associated
[05:13.640 --> 05:19.160]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or
[05:19.160 --> 05:23.600]  catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of
[05:23.600 --> 05:31.160]  vitamin D3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.760]  but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.240]  it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.200]  your body over so now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.400]  take high quality vitamin D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies

[06:20.520 --> 06:29.320]  now your host Owen Troyer ladies and gentlemen here we are on this Sunday
[06:29.320 --> 06:36.840]  November 20th 2022 an incredible time historic time in American history and
[06:36.840 --> 06:46.320]  in world history as the future of humanity is on the precipice and will
[06:46.320 --> 06:56.880]  either fall into a corporate global tyranny with endless digital bureaucracy
[06:56.880 --> 07:07.200]  soulless faceless spiritless that you're trapped in forever a government
[07:07.200 --> 07:14.760]  intervening in every breath you take and every step you make this is what we
[07:14.760 --> 07:21.680]  must stand against because we are not slaves we are not animals we are human
[07:21.680 --> 07:27.000]  beings made in the image of the creator destined to be free and that's why
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.800]  you're in the audience and that's why you're joining us here this evening now
[07:31.800 --> 07:40.120]  let me tell you what's coming up tonight we've got Alex Stein joining us in about
[07:40.120 --> 07:46.760]  30 minutes and I mean this guy just doesn't stop with the hits and he's
[07:46.760 --> 07:52.520]  outside of a library where they're doing a little drag queen story child abuse
[07:52.520 --> 08:00.080]  for kids and it's just so classic how these children behave and then we're
[08:00.080 --> 08:06.280]  supposed to treat them like adults as they're out here under no thought of
[08:06.280 --> 08:10.480]  their own this is not an act of their own volition to stand for trans kids
[08:10.480 --> 08:18.040]  surgeries and gay kids and all the other bullcrap that they claim to stand for but
[08:18.040 --> 08:22.040]  there they are out there with their flags there they are out there by the way
[08:22.040 --> 08:28.280]  they got their nice their nice rifles that Joe Biden wants to ban yeah yeah
[08:28.280 --> 08:33.080]  they've got that going to form now so we'll be discussing that playing that
[08:33.080 --> 08:39.240]  video with Alex and getting a little more into that story where more and more
[08:39.240 --> 08:45.760]  every day gay Americans are saying hey wait a second you're not gonna use you're
[08:45.760 --> 08:53.160]  not gonna use us as a means to get access to children you're not gonna say
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.840]  LGBTQ pride and wave a pride flag and then say now let me get naked and dance
[08:58.840 --> 09:03.280]  in front of your child it's LGBT and so they're showing up at city council
[09:03.280 --> 09:06.760]  meetings school board meetings the gays against groomers is becoming a larger
[09:06.760 --> 09:12.040]  group so there is the pushback so we're gonna do at least two segments if we're
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.480]  having a good time maybe we'll extend that with Alex nine maybe he wants to
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.320]  stay around all night we'll take calls with them because I'm gonna be taking
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.680]  calls then in the second hour of the Alex Jones transmission and then in the
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.760]  first hour of Sunday night live transmission following this show and
[09:28.760 --> 09:35.000]  then we're gonna have Sean Stone and Vivian Kubrick in studio so I've got
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  some news here I've got the news with the shooting but before I get into that
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.800]  and explain what's really going on here which is just crazy at this point how
[09:44.800 --> 09:50.440]  people can't see what's going on but that's just typical we're about to be
[09:50.440 --> 09:58.360]  severely distracted with this 2024 presidential race where we don't even
[09:58.360 --> 10:04.880]  have a day off let's say in between election cycles I mean they're still
[10:04.880 --> 10:08.760]  counting some of the votes from the midterm elections what are we like two
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.320]  weeks removed from them they're still counting votes in some areas seemingly
[10:14.320 --> 10:19.920]  all for Democrats magically but with Trump already announcing we're already
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.600]  into the 2024 season and you've already seen the media move against him you've
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.680]  already seen the establishment GOP move against him and so this is this is going
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.240]  to be a big distraction item not to say that it's not important because it is I
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.640]  don't have to explain the importance of it you know why it's important you're
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.560]  thinking about it you're talking about it you're following it but it's a
[10:40.560 --> 10:46.640]  distraction from the larger issue that Trump himself is not going to properly
[10:46.640 --> 10:54.200]  bring to the table and he has laid it out before but not near to the to the
[10:54.200 --> 10:59.840]  extent not near to the priority which is the giant corporate world government
[10:59.840 --> 11:06.320]  that is being built right now where we're going into everything digital and
[11:06.320 --> 11:15.840]  then everything is run on some sort of digital database tracker system that
[11:15.840 --> 11:22.840]  you're not going to get access to unless you are fully compliant and you got a
[11:22.840 --> 11:29.280]  taste of it with COVID but really you're just getting a taste of it with
[11:29.280 --> 11:39.920]  everyday life now you may have noticed and I was at an event last night and all
[11:39.920 --> 11:46.520]  the venues here in Austin are now cash free and I'm sitting there and I'm
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.640]  trying to pay cash and it's all it's all robotic and I don't necessarily mind I
[11:51.640 --> 11:55.840]  mean it's okay it's convenient you walk right up you you grab a beverage you
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.000]  grab a box of popcorn whatever and you slide your card and it's just a nice
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.880]  smooth transition I'm all for using technology to make our lives more
[12:02.880 --> 12:08.000]  convenient sure but I'm trying to pay cash he's like oh no there's one
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.120]  attendant with with all the the robot checker checker devices he's like oh no
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.800]  no we don't we don't take cash anymore I'm like oh wow that's so great isn't it
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.400]  oh I'm so glad we're moving to a cashless society it'll be so great when
[12:23.400 --> 12:26.760]  the government can track everything we do boy oh boy sir do I need to show you
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.880]  my vaccine passport just making a joke of it the guy actually agreed with me
[12:30.880 --> 12:34.760]  he was like yeah ridiculous he thought it was funny but see that's where it goes
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.960]  so okay yeah you like the convenience of the technology sure I like the
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.560]  convenience instead of waiting in line I just walk right up grab a beverage out
[12:44.560 --> 12:50.600]  of the cooler slide my card it boom I'm checked out oh so okay I like that
[12:50.600 --> 12:57.760]  convenience but then it's oh sorry oh your your card didn't work it says you're
[12:57.760 --> 13:03.320]  not updated on your vaccine oh oh your card has been declined it looks like you
[13:03.320 --> 13:09.120]  made a post on the internet that was it was bad and so sorry you can't use your
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.160]  card it's been shut off I don't know I don't know what to do sorry nothing we
[13:13.160 --> 13:18.080]  can do and then that's it it's nothing you can do oh you want to go get dinner
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.360]  oh you want to go get groceries oh you want to fill your car with gas oh sorry
[13:22.360 --> 13:30.400]  sorry card doesn't work sorry you made a bad post on the internet sorry sorry you
[13:30.400 --> 13:39.360]  didn't get your latest vaccine body da and yes it is like the black mirror
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.920]  episode where the whole woman's life falls apart because her social credit
[13:44.920 --> 13:51.840]  score falls apart and then she's in a living nightmare in a living hell so
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.400]  that's where it all goes so that's the bigger issue that's what we see building
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.880]  around us that's what we see building around the world that's what you're
[14:00.880 --> 14:04.200]  starting to see not just the taste of it with COVID but you're just starting to
[14:04.200 --> 14:11.160]  see it in everyday life now and that's the bigger issue than the 2024 presidential
[14:11.160 --> 14:17.400]  election because it'll be nice to have prosperity with Trump and it'll be nice
[14:17.400 --> 14:21.520]  to have a president that actually cares about America and isn't a total trader
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.400]  like Joe Biden and it'll be nice to have a man who's actually running the
[14:25.400 --> 14:28.400]  country not whatever shadow government's running it now that'll all be
[14:28.400 --> 14:32.000]  great we'll love it we'll love the prosperity hell he might actually do
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.800]  something about the borders and other issues but if we aren't allowed a stop
[14:37.800 --> 14:43.880]  gap if we aren't allowed a buffer if we aren't allowed at least a crack to say
[14:43.880 --> 14:50.440]  hey we're not gonna go under any form of digital corporate world government which
[14:50.440 --> 14:55.680]  by the way Rhonda Santis came out the other day and said anything world
[14:55.680 --> 15:01.120]  economic forum is not gonna be allowed in Florida anything world economic
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.440]  forum is gonna be dead on arrival in Florida Rhonda Santis so as somebody
[15:07.440 --> 15:10.440]  here that's already said I'm behind Trump and to stand us obviously hasn't
[15:10.440 --> 15:15.400]  announced he's running nobody has but that's the kind of stuff you want to be
[15:15.400 --> 15:20.760]  hearing and need be hearing from whoever the presidential candidate nominee
[15:20.760 --> 15:25.920]  ends up being that that you get behind because that's the larger issue we can
[15:25.920 --> 15:30.480]  have prosperity all day and it'll be great but if you're forced into a slave
[15:30.480 --> 15:38.000]  system with no control no human behind it no soul then the prosperity is not
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.640]  going to be so great and we'll be better off than most countries but you'll be
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.440]  forced to take that injection and oh you got a bad one that for you that for
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.880]  your lineage sorry all right ladies and gentlemen we're gonna get into this
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.280]  shooting news on the other side and I'm gonna tell you what's really going on
[15:57.280 --> 16:06.080]  here until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.360]  got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[16:10.360 --> 16:16.560]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.720]  wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was
[16:20.720 --> 16:27.880]  killing people was a lack of vitamin D3 you see the sun via your skin helps your
[16:27.880 --> 16:32.760]  body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.840]  produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to
[16:36.840 --> 16:40.560]  start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever

[19:19.840 --> 19:24.920]  possible made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to

[19:29.720 --> 19:34.480]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.040]  ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.720]  healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that
[19:43.720 --> 19:49.200]  does is keep the populist message alive in an era in an age of totalitarian
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.560]  oppression so continue to do it go to places like info wars store.com go to
[19:53.560 --> 19:58.000]  the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the
[19:58.000 --> 20:03.320]  process you're keeping American liberty alive leading a frontal assault on the
[20:03.320 --> 20:09.240]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:23.520 --> 20:31.920]  the response from the democrat party in the mainstream media to the club the
[20:31.920 --> 20:39.840]  nightclub the supposed gay club which is of course called club Q I'm not saying
[20:39.840 --> 20:43.880]  that that has anything to do with the Q moon it's just like are you kidding me
[20:43.880 --> 20:51.200]  with this really it's club Q really five dead 18 wounded in shooting at LGBTQ
[20:51.200 --> 20:55.400]  nightclub in Colorado and so again the response from the democrat party the
[20:55.400 --> 20:59.200]  response from the liberal mainstream media should not surprise us but it does
[20:59.200 --> 21:06.000]  remind us just how sick and twisted they really are doesn't it now we all know
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.680]  why they're making the big deal of this shooting because they can politicize it
[21:10.680 --> 21:15.200]  blame it on their opposition and then once again in an emotional outcry say we
[21:15.200 --> 21:22.160]  have to ban guns we have to end the second amendment but look I can play
[21:22.160 --> 21:27.480]  this game every day you understand I could I could play this game every Monday
[21:27.480 --> 21:33.080]  and I've been doing it more often now just as a exhibition on how you could
[21:33.080 --> 21:38.160]  play this game but I mean you know just just look at these stories two injured
[21:38.160 --> 21:42.040]  from two overnight shootings in Baltimore that's left last night
[21:42.040 --> 21:45.960]  Philadelphia Delaware County police investigating deadly double shooting in
[21:45.960 --> 21:51.960]  Yedon last night Chicago shootings two teens among nine shot and weakened gun
[21:51.960 --> 21:59.400]  violence across city and that's yesterday two teenagers shot on Staten Island so I
[21:59.400 --> 22:02.560]  can play this game all day I can play this game every Monday specifically
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.840]  weekends are really violent the worst in Chicago and this is just a handful of
[22:07.840 --> 22:13.040]  cities I chose to look at I didn't even really go into San Francisco or Los
[22:13.040 --> 22:20.800]  Angeles or St. Louis probably Dallas had a little loving violence too so we
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.440]  could play this game all day long now why do they never cover these shootings
[22:26.440 --> 22:30.720]  why do they never cover the violence in the inner cities why do they never cover
[22:30.720 --> 22:35.880]  the shootings in the inner cities do I really have to say why have we really
[22:35.880 --> 22:42.160]  not figured it out yet but fine let's not even answer that question instead
[22:42.160 --> 22:48.280]  let's answer this question why are why are they choosing to make the big fuss
[22:48.280 --> 22:57.520]  about the shooting in Colorado at the nightclub now let's be clear here I I
[22:57.520 --> 23:03.160]  think it's bad that we're so normalized to cities having violence and shootings
[23:03.160 --> 23:07.840]  all the time that we've just normalized it and so it's not even news so it only
[23:07.840 --> 23:13.480]  becomes news if it's if it's outside of the normal realm of activity oh mass
[23:13.480 --> 23:18.640]  shootings and inner cities all black-on-black violence ah we don't care
[23:18.640 --> 23:23.040]  we don't cover that we went off we're just used to that that's just normal we
[23:23.040 --> 23:27.880]  can't tug at the emotional heartstrings over that we can't use that to blame our
[23:27.880 --> 23:32.480]  political opposition and we can't politicize that in the nature that we'd
[23:32.480 --> 23:36.360]  like to so that we can eventually end the Second Amendment because that's
[23:36.360 --> 23:42.520]  really what it's all about and see you would hope you would hope that we'd have
[23:42.520 --> 23:48.640]  enough common sense enough instincts at this point to say and realize anybody
[23:48.640 --> 23:54.520]  who wants to disarm you wants to enslave you anybody who comes to disarm you is
[23:54.520 --> 24:00.680]  the bad guy so immediately after this what are the Democrats saying Joe Biden
[24:00.680 --> 24:04.200]  calls for assault weapons ban that we don't even have a classification of an
[24:04.200 --> 24:08.520]  assault weapon I mean an assault weapon could be anything I could use a bowling
[24:08.520 --> 24:12.680]  pin for an assault weapon I mean bowling pins are probably even used for murder
[24:12.680 --> 24:15.720]  somebody probably whacked the guy overhead with a bowling pin that's an
[24:15.720 --> 24:20.880]  assault weapon Joe Biden calls for assault weapons ban following deadly gay
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.000]  nightclub mass shooting it's all about it's gay that's how they tug at the
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.480]  emotional heartstrings it's gay it's gay it's gay and then they politicize it so
[24:31.480 --> 24:38.680]  they can use that momentum that emotion to trick you and deceive you into
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.480]  turning over your firearms and disarming yourself thinking oh oh it's such a
[24:43.480 --> 24:48.520]  tragedy I feel bad here take my gun that'll make things better which of
[24:48.520 --> 24:54.760]  course it won't but see it's even more disgusting actually what's been on
[24:54.760 --> 25:02.920]  display with Joe Biden and really AOC has really just shown how disgusting she
[25:02.920 --> 25:08.040]  really is under the surface with this responding blaming it on Lauren Bobert
[25:08.040 --> 25:15.120]  because it's in her district blaming it on Donald Trump just just total wickedness
[25:15.120 --> 25:21.200]  just total filth and disgust just just a trash human what a shame nice looking
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.040]  girl has to be such a trash human maybe we'll get comments from her ex-boyfriend
[25:26.040 --> 25:32.520]  Alex Stein coming up next to blame Donald Trump to blame Lauren Bobert they
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.640]  haven't even released any images thus far of the shooter and the police have
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.080]  not said if they are if they know of any motives so they haven't even said that
[25:41.080 --> 25:44.440]  now I get it you want to rush to a conclusion you want to rush to a
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.400]  judgment you don't care if you're wrong because when you are wrong the media
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.320]  comes around to protect you so you can say things that are wildly inaccurate
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.520]  without any punishment as long as you're a good liberal Democrat this is the
[25:57.520 --> 26:05.000]  display of liberal Democrat supremacy on full display they believe they are
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  better than you it's not about white supremacy the whole concept of white
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.040]  supremacy is a distraction for their liberal supremacy that's what it really
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.960]  is their liberal Democrat supremacy they think they're better than you and
[26:16.960 --> 26:23.920]  they should run your life it's the modern-day KKK and for them to blame
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.760]  Donald Trump and blame Lauren Bobert when they haven't even released any any
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.200]  motives and and two people that have nothing to do with it it's just sick
[26:32.200 --> 26:41.000]  it's just sick and to have these people in power is dangerous dangerous and I
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.400]  think we know that but I don't think we're getting fair representation when
[26:44.400 --> 26:51.080]  we go to vote and we might be finding that out the hard way then again we might
[26:51.080 --> 26:56.640]  also find it out the easy way with some developments that are going to be coming
[26:56.640 --> 27:05.160]  out of Arizona which I'll discuss later on RNC had roving attorneys quietly
[27:05.160 --> 27:10.800]  monitoring Maricopa voting centers one has finally released his damning evidence
[27:10.800 --> 27:16.400]  and it's just out of control we've got more footage of the ballot mules we've
[27:16.400 --> 27:20.160]  got the anomalies that the machine shutting down it's just so in your face
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.960]  it's so obvious but that's what they do is they do it blatantly in your face so
[27:24.960 --> 27:29.120]  that you can't even believe it and then if you stand up and you say something and
[27:29.120 --> 27:32.640]  question it they demonize you and make you feel like an idiot or criminalize
[27:32.640 --> 27:40.200]  you so that you don't stand up and speak the truth very dangerous place to be
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.440]  but that's why we salute the people in Brazil by the millions still standing
[27:44.440 --> 27:47.640]  against their fraudulent election results now when we come back Alex Dine is

[30:27.920 --> 30:31.920]  chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health
[30:31.920 --> 30:35.920]  conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain
[30:35.920 --> 30:40.440]  after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you

[30:44.360 --> 30:48.160]  defense and the maintenance of your everyday health it has been reported

[31:16.600 --> 31:19.760]  they're gonna go from Mike Lindell next or they're gonna go for Steve Bannon or
[31:19.760 --> 31:23.640]  gonna go for Tucker Carlson I studied the globalist 30 years ago but on air 28
[31:23.640 --> 31:27.240]  years and I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a
[31:27.240 --> 31:30.840]  modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without your support and now
[31:30.840 --> 31:33.960]  because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet not just
[31:33.960 --> 31:38.280]  America we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda that's

[31:58.440 --> 32:05.400]  support in Arizona I think we watched the election be stolen slowly stolen day
[32:05.400 --> 32:11.280]  by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to
[32:11.280 --> 32:17.000]  take our election seriously when we we just it's election month Alex it's not
[32:17.000 --> 32:22.800]  election day and that's the problem and everything changed after COVID-19 they
[32:22.800 --> 32:28.680]  illegally change state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and
[32:28.680 --> 32:33.200]  sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run
[32:33.200 --> 32:36.760]  an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that can be
[32:36.760 --> 32:41.240]  stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.160]  in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the
[32:46.160 --> 32:50.400]  media and the Democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity
[32:50.400 --> 32:56.280]  and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're
[32:56.280 --> 33:02.800]  not election deniers we're election realists leading a frontal assault on
[33:02.800 --> 33:11.960]  the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[33:11.960 --> 33:19.000]  these guys keep trying to bite me every time I walk by dude I'm walking down

[36:16.560 --> 36:19.440]  favorite part of my favorite part is the guy right after he's like alright Alex
[36:19.440 --> 36:24.000]  it's time to go and it really did the kind of symbolism behind that just the
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.600]  way he said it and I hate to admit this because this is the harsh reality in
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.800]  which we live in that there are literally people armed Antifa outside of these
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.280]  you know drag your kids to pride events or drag Queen Story Time events but at
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.040]  the same time that guy's literally live-action role-playing you know I
[36:41.040 --> 36:44.680]  mean he's like alright Alex you know get out of here he knows who I am I don't
[36:44.680 --> 36:48.120]  know that guy's name but I mean I've seen that guy in multiple things it's almost
[36:48.120 --> 36:52.000]  at this point it's just like Antifa political theater and they're trying
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.320]  to intimidate us you know just normal citizens by having the guns and what I
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.120]  hope and what I hope this content proves is that we should not be scared of them
[37:01.120 --> 37:06.120]  of course I got a gun of course having a big you know AR-15 it can be scary you
[37:06.120 --> 37:10.200]  know arguably but we have no reason to be scared of these cowards they're all
[37:10.200 --> 37:13.680]  wimps none of them actually stand by what they believe in and they all hide
[37:13.680 --> 37:17.760]  behind masks so for me just the exposing of that but at the same time I
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.000]  didn't ever feel afraid on because they're all just a bunch of wimps so
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.080]  we've got Alex down here he's fireside and he's probably got nine or ten cats
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.940]  within within a five-foot radius of himself he's probably got the Dallas
[37:29.940 --> 37:34.480]  Cowboys game on the big screen too look at him cuddling a cat now he's cuddling a
[37:34.480 --> 37:39.120]  little cat he's a little cat cuddler this was not little this one's a fat cat
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.720]  he's that he's talks about as most as he's about 15 pounds and he eats only the
[37:43.720 --> 37:48.000]  finest fancy feasts look at the cat cuddler that he goes from cuddling
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.240]  cats to cuddling antifa yeah and then this one and then this one the
[37:55.240 --> 37:58.680]  conservative they've been giving a lot of hate to the pit bulls lately now this
[37:58.680 --> 38:03.560]  is a real dog right here this is my personal defense mechanism if you come
[38:03.560 --> 38:07.760]  up in my house you better you better either have some steak to give the ginger
[38:07.760 --> 38:11.580]  dick is that's honestly that that is the way they can get past her though if they
[38:11.580 --> 38:14.680]  just brought in some lunch meat they could easily just toss that and she
[38:14.680 --> 38:18.680]  would chase that so she's actually not that good at protecting me if that's the
[38:18.680 --> 38:25.160]  only way to distract her so basically as effective as effective of antifa role
[38:25.160 --> 38:30.720]  playing outside of a drag kid's story time event exactly right and that's what
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.520]  it is oh and literally it's these guys are they're literally live action role
[38:34.520 --> 38:37.960]  playing explain that people dig into that and explain that's cuz a lot of
[38:37.960 --> 38:40.640]  people don't know what LARP being live action role playing is it's you know
[38:40.640 --> 38:43.720]  dungeons and dragons in the woods but but these guys do it at drag your kids
[38:43.720 --> 38:48.320]  to pride well you know it's funny though is these guys probably like you know and
[38:48.320 --> 38:51.920]  I can I know you consider yourself a populous I'm a populous like these guys
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.920]  with the guns obviously they might ideologically lean with people that are
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.000]  more in favor of repealing the Second Amendment but I'd imagine that they are
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  pro-second amendment so important is we probably get along on a lot more stuff
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.960]  then we would actually think if we actually sat down and talked how to drink
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.480]  hung out so these people what they're doing is that they're LARPing they
[39:11.480 --> 39:14.680]  probably like guns they probably like Call of Duty they probably like a lot of
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.360]  the masculine you know normal guy stuff but because their ideology is like this
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.560]  weird liberal leftist they can find any if they can find any excuse to be able
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.120]  to whip out their gun and go out there and play you know army they're gonna go
[39:28.120 --> 39:31.120]  do that but that's what they're doing it's just live action role playing okay
[39:31.120 --> 39:33.960]  so do you think that's what it is though do you think it's oh they're just
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.800]  looking for any event where they can go out and you know dress up and do this
[39:37.800 --> 39:41.200]  you don't think they're being paid or told to be there by any group you think
[39:41.200 --> 39:45.320]  they organically do it to they think it's fun well it's a little bit of both
[39:45.320 --> 39:48.240]  because oh and this is what I hate and then like all these liberal leftists are
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.640]  the ones that call us out because they call us the alt right once when we go to
[39:51.640 --> 39:54.480]  these events but I hate it because sometimes there's people on our side
[39:54.480 --> 39:57.320]  that are embarrassing right there's people that are on the conservative side
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.120]  they're going there and saying bad stuff and slurs and embarrassing stuff so I
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.000]  guess my point is on both sides there's mentally ill people there's a lot more
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.720]  mentally ill people on the left side so you have to be mentally ill to be on the
[40:09.720 --> 40:15.520]  left on the right it's just a matter of it's just a matter of odds and
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.400]  percentages I mean yeah no they had to be it isn't you know that you do not get
[40:20.400 --> 40:23.400]  into the club unless you're diagnosed insane and on ten different
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.000]  anti-depressants but no and that's what's scary is because they're on the
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.400]  psychotropic drugs so like one of them might go crazy and actually shoot
[40:29.400 --> 40:32.720]  somebody that's that's what I'm afraid of but but I don't know what their
[40:32.720 --> 40:36.960]  individual motivations are but I really and truly I hope I don't think they go
[40:36.960 --> 40:39.520]  there because actually want to shoot somebody I think they want to scare
[40:39.520 --> 40:42.320]  people I think they want to intimidate people because when you really get in
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.280]  their face I'm telling you and I need to clip this part out but there's people in
[40:46.280 --> 40:49.560]  the crowd that says that said I've never seen somebody so scared when I had a
[40:49.560 --> 40:54.160]  camera in their face while holding a gun like they were scared of me while I was
[40:54.160 --> 40:58.200]  holding a camera and they were holding rifles so they're they're cowards well
[40:58.200 --> 41:02.680]  and I will say too the the tactics that you're using here are are actually proven
[41:02.680 --> 41:09.040]  it's actually proven to work because we used to have antifa like this in Austin
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.280]  and it was the same thing and they would go out there and they do the same thing
[41:12.280 --> 41:17.360]  and hold their guns and everything and and for for two years 2016 and 2017 I
[41:17.360 --> 41:20.880]  just mocked them into submission and they don't come around anymore you never
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.240]  see him you never see him in Austin anymore I mocked him into submission the
[41:24.240 --> 41:27.640]  next thing you can do so the first thing is proper to step up right there and
[41:27.640 --> 41:30.840]  laugh in their face when they have their guns to show that you're not
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.800]  intimidated by it but then the next thing if you are you ready for the you
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.000]  want the finisher Alex you have to start the antifa chant right there with them
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.080]  and try to get them to join in ah auntie auntie she stuck and just sit there
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.080]  and chant it right in their face and they'll be so humiliated and embarrassed
[41:47.080 --> 41:50.720]  that they probably will quit showing their faces but they do hide behind their
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.520]  masks though no you're exactly right that the only way I think we can make
[41:55.520 --> 41:58.280]  fun of them or the only way we can actually get through to their numb
[41:58.280 --> 42:01.960]  skull head is the mockery and they hate that the most because they do want to be
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.640]  taken ultra seriously but really there's nothing serious about this they're
[42:05.640 --> 42:13.240]  going in there reading a rainbow but oh and what they're defending is that so
[42:13.240 --> 42:16.960]  they can go inside and read photographic literature to children like it just
[42:16.960 --> 42:19.760]  doesn't even make sense if they were doing this and they're actually defending
[42:19.760 --> 42:23.400]  something admirable I'd have respect for them you know what I mean but the fact
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.320]  that they're actually trying to defend you know transgender story time so kids
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.560]  can get you know that's what's amazing because it's I'm sure it's like I'm sure
[42:31.560 --> 42:34.400]  this is like a one-issue group of people that are probably just second
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.360]  amendment people they take guns to every event whatever who knows if they're
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.640]  left or right but yeah like you said it's like hey you realize what they're
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.760]  promoting in there right like you realize what they're promoting so Alex
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.920]  dying with us here well we'll be right back we'll get his take on because
[42:49.920 --> 42:54.120]  here's the thing imagine if people like this we're in the Capitol on January 6

[45:00.200 --> 45:06.560]  close to them in Arizona I think we watched the election be stolen slowly
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.320]  stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.920]  for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.920]  month Alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything
[45:22.920 --> 45:28.840]  changed after COVID-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.280]  ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to
[45:33.280 --> 45:37.120]  people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country
[45:37.120 --> 45:41.720]  when we have elections that can be stolen like this and I believe that just
[45:41.720 --> 45:46.080]  like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.520]  and it's it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.920]  that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections
[45:55.920 --> 46:00.320]  shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election
[46:00.320 --> 46:06.320]  realists so when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.320]  pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.320]  holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.120]  the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.480]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you had you
[46:21.480 --> 46:24.280]  know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I
[46:24.280 --> 46:29.260]  took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[46:29.260 --> 46:33.960]  brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people
[46:33.960 --> 46:38.040]  again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.320]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements there they're all
[46:41.320 --> 46:45.840]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like
[46:45.840 --> 46:49.440]  if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[46:49.440 --> 46:53.680]  is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.680]  the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully
[46:57.680 --> 47:02.660]  said brother I thank you so much for calling Godspeed leading a frontal
[47:02.660 --> 47:09.560]  assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[47:09.560 --> 47:26.480]  all right I'm gonna need a little clarification here from Alex Stein
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.200]  because I'm just I'm just not getting it to be honest and maybe he can help me
[47:32.200 --> 47:37.120]  out I got two questions maybe he can answer first let's start with this what
[47:37.120 --> 47:50.440]  is 2 s lb g t q i plus this is from Justin Trinnell the attack on the 2 s lg
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.800]  b t q i plus community in Colorado Springs is horrifying and then people are
[47:56.800 --> 48:03.920]  posting this other stuff lg g b d t t i q a p p I mean what where are we at here
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.920]  Alex what is a do you know what what is a 2 s lg bt q i a plus I just can you
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.280]  offer me a clarification here yeah well it's easy when you're not a right-wing
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.760]  bigot like yourself yes to spirit is that's a 2 s and stands for two spirits
[48:19.760 --> 48:26.840]  so so is that what you're doing one spirit yes yes he's Satan and Moloch
[48:26.840 --> 48:31.880]  or is that two spirits no but I mean you know this is kind of like this old
[48:31.880 --> 48:36.040]  cliche joker just adding alphabets they're adding letters I mean we're
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.640]  gonna run out of letters of the alphabet to represent people's sexuality but this
[48:39.640 --> 48:43.040]  is the problem is listen listen you want to be good you want to go be gay you're
[48:43.040 --> 48:46.560]  an adult that's fine but why do we need to put pride flags in elementary schools
[48:46.560 --> 48:49.040]  why are we putting trans flags in elementary schools why are we even
[48:49.040 --> 48:52.760]  talking about sexual stuff with elementary schools why are we defining gay
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.560]  people but who they want to have sex with it just doesn't make sense it's all
[48:56.560 --> 49:01.160]  some sort of focus on who people have sex with we need we need to define people
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.200]  by you know the content of their character not what they do when they're
[49:05.200 --> 49:09.200]  in a bedroom with other people so that that's what I'm really sick of oh and
[49:09.200 --> 49:12.080]  it's the indoctrination that's just well it's a two-pronged attack what you
[49:12.080 --> 49:16.480]  have is you you do have the you know the the people that are into getting the
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.120]  access to kids there is that element no doubt we saw that with the pedophile
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.160]  sexual abusers child abusers that got into the drag queen story time it's just
[49:25.160 --> 49:28.320]  men that didn't change their name dresses women and then they get access to
[49:28.320 --> 49:31.800]  your kids then they do a background check you know months later they find out oh
[49:31.800 --> 49:35.720]  that person was a pedophile oops so there's definitely that element of it
[49:35.720 --> 49:39.200]  the people that want to use this to get the access to the kids but you know the
[49:39.200 --> 49:42.160]  other element which is the larger element that we tend to kind of pass by
[49:42.160 --> 49:47.600]  but it's just the truth it's liberals and Democrats using children to advance
[49:47.600 --> 49:51.240]  their political agenda and that's what this is they want to use this and they
[49:51.240 --> 49:54.400]  want to say oh look kids are gay kids are two-spirit oh look the kids are doing
[49:54.400 --> 49:57.600]  it it's great for the kids we love it and so they make it like an issue about
[49:57.600 --> 50:01.520]  the kids and then when you say hey we don't want to chop off kids weenies and
[50:01.520 --> 50:07.880]  call it trans surgery they say oh you're a big it oh you're against children 100
[50:07.880 --> 50:11.560]  percent and they're right when they say that I mean no no no but this is other
[50:11.560 --> 50:15.680]  thing is when they say when you see Boston's Boston's Children's Hospital one
[50:15.680 --> 50:19.640]  of their head of their their director whatever board of directors even said
[50:19.640 --> 50:23.680]  that the one of the best parts about the transition the transitional therapy is
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.720]  that they have a lifelong patient so these people have to go to thousands of
[50:28.720 --> 50:32.480]  of literal visits for the rest of their life they can never stop taking these
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.240]  hormones so they have a financial incentive to basically prescribe
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.040]  gender dysphoria with medication that will only make them go down a path that
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.880]  they cannot turn back on these people that say puberty blockers are reversible
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.480]  they are irreversible you have one window of puberty if you stunt that growth
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.840]  at all you're not going to be able to redo your puberty at age 25 so these
[50:56.840 --> 51:01.400]  people are evil it's absolutely insane when it comes to the motivation that
[51:01.400 --> 51:05.360]  these people have to basically just confuse these young children well and
[51:05.360 --> 51:08.880]  this is kind of a new phenomenon so what we're starting to see sprout up
[51:08.880 --> 51:14.560]  organically is the first wave of victims to this this trans kid agenda the first
[51:14.560 --> 51:18.840]  wave of victims are now getting you know to 18 19 20 years old and they're
[51:18.840 --> 51:23.280]  saying wait a second you've destroyed my body you've destroyed my life you've
[51:23.280 --> 51:27.040]  destroyed my mind and so more and more a lot of them are speaking out a lot of
[51:27.040 --> 51:30.480]  them are going public a lot of them are organizing saying you know what why did
[51:30.480 --> 51:33.880]  you do this to me I was 14 years old I didn't know any better I mean yeah it's
[51:33.880 --> 51:37.240]  like imagine the stuff you thought you were wanted to be at 14 yeah you were
[51:37.240 --> 51:40.480]  you were a goofball kid of course and now they just say yeah go into surgery
[51:40.480 --> 51:44.480]  we'll make we'll make half a million dollars off you in your lifetime so this
[51:44.480 --> 51:49.440]  is going to catch up to them this cannot go on forever it has a finite time line
[51:49.440 --> 51:53.680]  but when you're out there at the event I know that you were out there and a
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.160]  couple other people were out there in the media like I think Sarah Gallaghan's
[51:57.160 --> 52:00.440]  Alice was out there as well from the blaze I mean how much push back handsome
[52:00.440 --> 52:04.400]  okay Taylor's great how much pushback is there I mean it looks like they just
[52:04.400 --> 52:08.600]  love it they love those little kids getting access to him yeah I mean I'm
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.200]  starting to see now ever since we went viral with the Dragger kids the
[52:12.200 --> 52:15.120]  story time event where it said it's not gonna lick itself oh and I remember I
[52:15.120 --> 52:18.320]  came on the show the day after that I came on your program the next day I
[52:18.320 --> 52:21.720]  think that that was a Sunday and it was on a Saturday I believe and and this is
[52:21.720 --> 52:26.120]  the problems I think it's radicalized them to be even more insane when it comes
[52:26.120 --> 52:29.240]  to putting on these events because then they know that oh well now it's gonna be
[52:29.240 --> 52:33.920]  a publicity stunt on their end so now they have people like I forget they
[52:33.920 --> 52:36.520]  author for the Dallas Morning News but her first names Lauren I forget her last
[52:36.520 --> 52:40.880]  name but she when covered the event didn't even mention the armed Antifa so
[52:40.880 --> 52:44.000]  they know that they have the meeting on their side so basically these people are
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.160]  just doing it to antagonize people like myself that are calling it out so in a
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.920]  in a weird way people say oh Alex when you go act insane at a school board
[52:52.920 --> 52:56.320]  meeting or a city council meeting it messes up the meeting that's false
[52:56.320 --> 53:00.120]  because there's multiple occasions where the mayor said it said oh that made the
[53:00.120 --> 53:04.880]  meeting better but in this instance I think the radicalization of us calling
[53:04.880 --> 53:09.880]  them out is almost making them want to do it more to piss us off so I'm a
[53:09.880 --> 53:13.360]  little worried about that I feel like there's just been a coordinated effort
[53:13.360 --> 53:19.560]  to do more and more children friendly drag gay events well there's no doubt
[53:19.560 --> 53:24.280]  that's part of the leftist psychology is doing things just to piss you off doing
[53:24.280 --> 53:27.520]  doing abnormal things and telling you they're normal just to anger you that
[53:27.520 --> 53:30.320]  that's a hundred percent part of the liberal psychology it's part of their
[53:30.320 --> 53:35.280]  mental illness but here's the second question I have for you now because the
[53:35.280 --> 53:38.800]  Democrats are out calling to ban guns right now today they're calling to ban
[53:38.800 --> 53:44.880]  guns and so if you look though guys put the footage back on there so these guys
[53:44.880 --> 53:48.160]  are not just out there with guns which the left is not going to complain oh
[53:48.160 --> 53:51.040]  they love guns to protect them they just don't want you the free citizen to have
[53:51.040 --> 53:54.360]  a gun but when you talk to these armed guys I mean they've got like headsets
[53:54.360 --> 53:57.640]  it's like you said I mean they want to be taken seriously I mean they're out
[53:57.640 --> 54:00.240]  there I don't know what where they get all this equipment I don't know how much
[54:00.240 --> 54:04.000]  training they have but I mean they put the headsets on they've got communications
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.120]  they've got the full body armor I mean can you imagine if you had somebody like
[54:09.120 --> 54:15.760]  that guys pause it right here these guys have headsets eye goggles fully armed
[54:15.760 --> 54:21.560]  body armor face masks all of it can you imagine if somebody like that was on the
[54:21.560 --> 54:26.800]  grounds the Capitol grounds on January 6th and then do you expect there to be
[54:26.800 --> 54:31.600]  any liberals calling for these individuals to be disarmed it'd be like
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.560]  Nick Sandman if they if they had a conservative that guy had a MAGA hat on
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.720]  and was up there I mean they love it they love to just see one proud boy one
[54:39.720 --> 54:44.080]  guy in a you know a black and gold polo they'll put that picture you know they'll
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.280]  give it as much attention as possible so yeah I mean it's a double standard and
[54:48.280 --> 54:52.000]  we know that you know that that's a double standard but at the same time they
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.680]  have all this gear these guys want to intimidate us they want to scare us and
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.800]  I think any parent that would bring their kid to an event where their children
[55:00.800 --> 55:05.240]  could be indirectly scared mommy daddy I'm walking to an event and now you have
[55:05.240 --> 55:09.360]  guys that are waving flags yelling at people while holding huge guns I mean
[55:09.360 --> 55:14.920]  it's not an environment that I would consider children or child friendly but
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.200]  the exact opposite bringing them there yeah but these people people keep going
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.480]  in children's events with their guns it just doesn't make sense it's literally
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.920]  insane it doesn't make any sense well it's gonna get crazier I mean that's the
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.280]  only thing here is it's gonna get crazier this obviously has a finite life
[55:31.280 --> 55:34.600]  it's not gonna go on forever it's it's complete insanity but it's only gonna
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.080]  get crazier and I think because of what you discussed earlier the whole approach
[55:39.080 --> 55:43.600]  of let's be as crazy as possible just to just to take a jab at conservatives I
[55:43.600 --> 55:47.760]  mean what seriously what more can they do I mean they take children to sex
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.280]  dungeons they play dill rainbow dildo ring toss they have rainbow dildo butt
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.280]  monkey for kid events I mean what seriously I mean I maybe I shouldn't
[55:56.280 --> 56:01.200]  even ask you but it's like what are they going to do next no and I get really
[56:01.200 --> 56:04.120]  worried about it like I said this earlier when I talk about the psychotropic
[56:04.120 --> 56:06.960]  drugs but you know that they want to have their version of cow written house
[56:06.960 --> 56:11.200]  they want to have their antifa person that had to shoot somebody in self-defense
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.000]  so I honestly feel like there is gonna be some sort of escalation I don't know
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.600]  if that necessarily happened in Dallas I don't know if it'll necessarily happen
[56:17.600 --> 56:20.720]  in an event that I'm at but I think that would be the next possibility for the
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.640]  people on the left is them showing and actually using some sort of least
[56:23.640 --> 56:28.160]  lethal force and being like we had to do it we killed the fastest now there has
[56:28.160 --> 56:31.280]  been circumstances where that has happened in Colorado actually to a
[56:31.280 --> 56:35.320]  veteran a Trump supporter exactly right yeah and I just have a feeling that
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.560]  that's gonna happen in more frequently or it will be a bigger story and get more
[56:39.560 --> 56:43.440]  attention I think that's sadly the next step when it comes to this there will be
[56:43.440 --> 56:47.520]  some sort of physical I hope not I pray that that doesn't happen I think that's
[56:47.520 --> 56:50.800]  the next step in this culture war that's just naturally gonna happen because
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.760]  these people are insane and nobody wants to get shot nobody really necessarily
[56:54.760 --> 56:58.920]  wants to shoot anybody I guarantee it but at the same time you're dealing with
[56:58.920 --> 57:03.480]  crazy people that have a lot of self-esteem issues that have a lot of
[57:03.480 --> 57:08.920]  mental health issues and now that their identity is being you know shaken or
[57:08.920 --> 57:12.880]  being you know they don't like being rattled these people are not they don't
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.040]  do well in high-pressure situations so you won't when you give these people a
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.640]  gun enough you know antipsychotic drugs in a high-pressure situation Lord knows
[57:21.640 --> 57:25.880]  what can happen Owen they might need a rattle though they might need maybe if
[57:25.880 --> 57:30.160]  we gave them some baby rattles maybe that would distract them and help out
[57:30.160 --> 57:35.360]  and but I want to ask coming up stick around if you can so were they they
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.120]  didn't like Sarah up there as the cat lady were they bigoted as a trans species
[57:40.120 --> 57:44.560]  individual and then there's this woman I haven't even seen this gym maybe we
[57:44.560 --> 57:48.800]  should check in with her and when we come back holy smokes
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.240]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.760]  the wellness company an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and
[58:00.760 --> 58:07.480]  post COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems
[58:07.480 --> 58:14.920]  this new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content
[58:14.920 --> 58:22.160]  virtual appointments laboratory testing diagnostics prescriptions treatment
[58:22.160 --> 58:28.320]  packages specifically for COVID post COVID vaccine injury syndromes and all
[58:28.320 --> 58:34.680]  the usual things that are seen in primary care and then we have an entire
[58:34.680 --> 58:41.800]  array of holistic products an online store media and health advice come see
[58:41.800 --> 58:48.560]  the wellness company and go to online health now com as a conduit to the
[58:48.560 --> 58:53.960]  wellness company the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only
[58:53.960 --> 58:58.320]  thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible the only thing that
[58:58.320 --> 59:03.240]  made any resistance to the war machine possible the only thing that made any
[59:03.240 --> 59:07.760]  opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and
[59:07.760 --> 59:12.480]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any
[59:12.480 --> 59:17.400]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite
[59:17.400 --> 59:21.320]  the massive lawfare being waged against info wars despite the media
[59:21.320 --> 59:26.520]  defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the ordinary people the
[59:26.520 --> 59:30.760]  everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier
[59:30.760 --> 59:35.360]  and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the
[59:35.360 --> 59:40.400]  populist message alive in an era in an age of totalitarian oppression so
[59:40.400 --> 59:44.720]  continue to do it go to places like info wars store.com go to the places like
[59:44.720 --> 59:49.400]  save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're
[59:49.400 --> 59:55.720]  keeping America leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[59:55.720 --> 01:00:08.520]  it's alex jones
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:17.480]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:25.400]  Owen Troyer so this psychotic woman that's screaming these people are so deranged
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.560]  we can't even play the clip folks because it's just nothing but obscenities it's
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.640]  just she's shouting obscenities but put her on the screen here
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.560]  i mean look alex oh and she starts crying yeah it's crying and that's what i'm
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.280]  gonna say because look you and i we're fun loving guys but at the end of the
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.320]  day i mean we really do have a heart i i mean and and i feel bad i mean i look
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.960]  at these people this is this is a woman who is severely traumatized by years of
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.360]  psychological abuse and here she is just at a breaking point with it now when
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.720]  when reality smacks her in the face and that's what's so sad about this is
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.520]  the reason why we have these massive psychotic breaks from from leftist is
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.280]  because they've been taught an entirely false world view
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.600]  they believe an entirely false world and when reality hits them they just they
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.640]  they break down alex no you're exactly right that reality check it's a hard
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.400]  pill to swallow and that's why they call it you know taking the red pill i mean
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.280]  these people are still basically zonked out on their
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.040]  a brave new world soma they're on their blue pill and once you start getting a
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.080]  little bit of that red pill and people start tossing at you it's hard if you're
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.120]  not used to it if you're not expecting it and your cage gets rattled
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.880]  it's not a pleasant experience and you can tell she did not have a pleasant
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.120]  experience and this is another thing you mentioned
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.520]  empathy and being empathetic now i am not better than anybody i would never
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.520]  ever claim to be but i'm saying with these people even though that i
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.280]  morally they're morally repugnant these abortionists they have you know
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.520]  ideologies that i would you know think are absolutely disgusting i think we do
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.720]  need to be empathetic to them even though
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.840]  they are so repugnant compared to us morally
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.800]  because they were probably abused they were probably victims or they're
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.960]  probably under some sort of mass formation hypnosis on and i know you
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.720]  realize that but there was a time when i was like them you know not that i was a
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.880]  loony leftist like that by any means but you know i just i see the good in these
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.360]  people even though they're evil even though they're probably like you know
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.680]  taken over by some sort of satanic being there i feel like there's good in
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.600]  everybody and i wish we could just i know it sounds corny and cliche but i wish
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.280]  we could all just hold hands and sing kumbaya and i'll get along
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.760]  or at least return to those moments that we could share like going to a ball
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.440]  game or going to a movie theater but the left has ruined that stuff too now
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.720]  and you know here's kind of this has been my experience and i don't know if
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.960]  you've had a similar experience but let's say you know when i first took the
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.360]  red pill a lot of people the first the first
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.840]  time a lot of people were ever exposed to me
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.960]  was the age skrillex carl the cock famous video
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.400]  from 2016 when we're outside of trump rally
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.920]  and and genuinely at that time i mean from the period of 2013 when i when i
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.200]  let's say took the red pill to about that time in in 2016
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.200]  i really assumed that people would want the information and and the stuff that
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.080]  i had been denied access to that i now knew
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.720]  and understood i thought i could share it with them i thought i could tell them
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.200]  hey you're being tricked you're being lied to you're being abused
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.920]  and that's what it that was the whole thing out there on the streets that day
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.120]  i was like hey look you know you're being lied to about trump you're being
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.520]  lied to about this you're being lied to about that
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.240]  and you realize they don't care that's what sad is they really don't care it's
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.080]  the old i guess it's the old cliche you can take a
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080]  horse to water but you can't teach him to drink
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.920]  i mean that's that's what these people are they don't want the fountain of
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.960]  knowledge they don't want the fountain of reality they don't want to control
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.120]  their future and that's all the same size of an abuse victim
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.640]  no oh and you know that no amount of evidence can convince an idiot
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.440]  and that's the thing is i thought that same thing when i started talking about
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.000]  truth or i started talking about conspiracies i thought everybody would
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.960]  just eat it up oh this is the truth the government's line they never had weapons
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.000]  of mass destruction you know there's an operation north woods you know it was a
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.960]  plan for 9 11 blah blah blah you're just yelling at people giving them all this
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.680]  information they don't even want to hear it on
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.160]  they don't even want it because they don't want to break that cognitive
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.880]  dissonance even though they know the government lies to us even though they
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.880]  know there's classified levels of information
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.480]  that you and i will never be privy to they still
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.400]  somehow some way have cognitive dissonance and still have faith
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.600]  that the people in charge actually have our best interests in mind so
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.040]  no it's really weird trying to break people out of that spell
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.480]  and i think now the only way to do it for me
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.680]  is trying to make people laugh and then make them question is this real or is
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.040]  this fake yeah maybe a little public humiliation ritual
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.080]  is uh what's gonna do it they feel a little shame maybe they have a little
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.560]  second thought maybe they get brushed aside like a twig
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.800]  you know like that i mean come on man look at that arm strength
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:58.760]  he's living his prime time
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.800]  look at that everybody else is just like yellow or clear that's because it's
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.120]  been denatured it's been worked out we didn't do that
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.960]  you think i would metaphysically tell you something this is the very best i
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.240]  can get i'd rather go to hell and do that i will
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:20.360]  only give you the maximum best info the maximum truth the maximum product
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.240]  because i want that good will what i do to you i do to
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.760]  myself don't you get the big secret you ever seen
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.800]  fish oil look like that no you never seen that have you
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:37.640]  and this little jewel right here is solid
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.080]  liquid consciousness
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:48.680]  look it up find out how even the fda and the government admits
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.520]  fish oil is incredible the number one thing anybody can do with themselves
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.080]  is take good fish oil or krill oil just like our information's dynamite so our
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.360]  products in four store dot com
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.880]  we now take you live to the central texas commenced ever
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.880]  and the heart of the resistance and now your host
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:16.760]  olyn treuer all right we got alex here with us for one more
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.600]  segment just to kind of get into any other news
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.960]  anything else he's noticing but uh you know obviously having to go and
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.800]  face down these psychotics i mean your videos are getting millions of views
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.280]  that one's probably been seen five million times
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.280]  at this point what else is on alex stein's radar what else is alex stein
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.880]  thinking about when he's not trolling the uh the people that
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.920]  take flags out of plastic bags and wave them around like it's a movement like
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.280]  we don't realize they're they just bought him that morning
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.320]  well i appreciate that and that for the people playing at home to break the
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.520]  fourth wall olyn and i will be spinning this Thanksgiving together so i'm
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.960]  excited to be and hang out with you this holiday season with you so but other
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.760]  than that oh and i'd like to get your opinion on this
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.640]  now i see in the conservative side people are freaking out now i definitely
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.480]  want hersel walker to win over warlock i think that's a very important race but
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.880]  when it comes to the dr os in featherman race for me
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.200]  i of course wanted alex to win but now after seeing these pictures
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.080]  of a featherman in a suit on capitol hill you know lurching around
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.080]  washington dc i think we're gonna have an endless amount of content
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:27.320]  for the next few years so i'm very grateful for john featherman what do you
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:32.360]  think about that on i have a feeling if this timeline
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.680]  plays itself out as you envision at some point in the in the future you will be
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:41.000]  called an ableist and they will say you're not allowed to troll or
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.720]  make fun of featherman because of his severe mental disorder
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.760]  yeah i mean i mean seriously that's what they said after his debate after you
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.000]  did so poorly the people that call him out they called them ableist
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.960]  because we want to we want a senator that's able to
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.040]  not have to uh have some sort of interpreter for them to ask a simple
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.640]  question can you imagine him trying to get some sort of legislation done
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.760]  actually having to read a bill actually having to do some sort of actual
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.840]  comprehension if the guy can't even string two words together
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.600]  but no if you call that out you're a racist you're a bigot
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:22.360]  you're an ableist ableist ableist you know what i don't mind that one
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.880]  i don't mind that that they can call me ableist only one that one that's that's
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.480]  no big i kind of like ableist a little bit i yeah i mean you're an ableist like
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.000]  yeah i'm an ableist i want i want uh you know a fast runner to run in the track
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.560]  meet like i guess i'm an ableist so here's the question though as we
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.600]  forget the cat takeover now the cats are taking over the streams
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.880]  sky bear he's going i'm telling you folks there's at least a microphone i don't
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.600]  know how stein doesn't cough up a hairball on air here
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.200]  but here's the question it's so incredible how does featherman really get
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.040]  in i mean you gotta you gotta wonder because the whole situation with the
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.000]  wife i mean she there's some story there with the wife i don't know she looks
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.640]  like it's some sort of succubus like which type of thing
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.960]  uh and then you've got the fact that he can't talk he held a shotgun to a
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.640]  neighbor to some guy a black runners a black jogger's chest i mean it's like
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.320]  so ridiculous everybody knows the amad abri story but featherman was the
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:15.160]  original deal putting the shotgun to a jogger's chest an innocent jogger
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.760]  he can't read i mean it's just like how does this guy what is it a big joke
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.600]  is he is it's like a big joke on society is it was it like a test i mean how
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.120]  and ellen you know exactly what it is it's just like katie hobs who basically
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.560]  campaigned from her freaking basement like joe biden i know she was secretary
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:35.400]  of state in terms of that election but i think with any sort of election if you
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.640]  can freaking hook it up to the wi-fi if the c a a s a if any of these people can
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:44.200]  get access to any sort of these machines then how are we supposed to have faith
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.640]  in it and it's like you're gonna tell me joe biden got 81 million votes
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.120]  right but why featherman okay i get it the democrats own pennsylvania they can
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.480]  do whatever the hell they want everybody knows it it's they own it now
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.920]  why featherman like how what is that because he's such an android he's
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.720]  literally just he's not even a human being at this point
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.080]  he's like levers he's like buttons he's the only person that's dumber than joe
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.720]  biden and that's why they like joe biden you know this
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.320]  there's a video of barack obama talking about how he would like to do his third
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.920]  term as a shadow president in in the basement with an ear piece
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.200]  because they don't want actual politicians that want to go and buck the
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.640]  system they want yes man there is a there's a shadow
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.920]  government that is calling the shots you know that you're not a dummy
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.320]  i'm not a dummy he is perfect when you have a shadow government
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.080]  a guy like john featherman who's going to probably take all the heat off take all
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.000]  you know he's literally going to be like a walking joke but
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.800]  if he's going to vote your way in every single
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.200]  instance it doesn't matter it's great he's even better because then he takes off
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.160]  a lot of the attention off the real politicians that are smart
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.000]  that are actually circumventing our freedom so i think john featherman
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.640]  sadly not qualified for the job but he's going to give us an endless amount of
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.840]  content over lord knows until the until the thing
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.040]  growing from his neck takes over his body and his brain him and some great
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.360]  content him and his wife esmeralda you know that his uh his office is in a
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.360]  bell tower that's not a joke by the way
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.840]  quasi motor i'm not joking it really is no it is no guy put it in put it in just
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.600]  so you can see it put in john featherman office bell tower
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.840]  go ahead i know it's that's they call her they call her jersey gizelle i mean
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.680]  she there's something goofy about her as well she's got some vibes she's got
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.880]  something i she's got like featherman under like a witchcraft spell or
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.640]  something i think well it's 90 day fiance you know she
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.680]  was an illegal immigrant and then she married him and got her green card you
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.960]  know for her and you yeah you didn't know that you didn't know that
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.960]  yes i missed that one but nobody's earned a green
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.560]  card harder than having to sleep with john featherman so she earned that green
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.800]  card i mean that that i see i mean i'm not i'm not
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.080]  i'm not upset that she got she's the new senator of pennsylvania
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:01.560]  no she's the new senator oh for sure she's calling the shot she has michael
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.880]  obama vibes going on she's the real she's a shadow senator right now
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.160]  for sure and that's why she's always seen with him she's the one marching him
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.120]  around there's basically like an individual an invisible lease
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.040]  a leash that she has him on as they climb up the bell tower
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.160]  i mean what are they gonna do like install like an actual bell that he can
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:25.080]  like hang and swing from it
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.160]  it's and listen we got featherman which i know he's you know politics stink but
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:32.200]  he's gonna be in this in the nancy plos she's out of there she's getting
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.880]  fired i mean that was you know i was at marlago and i'm not trying to name drop
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.160]  like i'm so so cool guy but when it when it
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.760]  came to trump i have to say every single and this is me speaking honest every
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.800]  single person there without the who i spoke to personally
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.160]  also had nice things to say about ron de santa so that makes me worry about this
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.120]  is going to be a primary where i hope they don't kill each other
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.640]  but on top of that well when when trump was dunking on the left
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.720]  those are some of his best dunks was dunking on you know featherman or joe
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.000]  biden naming the wrong state uh you know saying that he's in
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.320]  florida so i guess my whole point is i'm just i'm just a little nervous to see
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.920]  what the future holds but i like the donald trump calling out nancy plos
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.240]  she for losing her her spot i like this kind of at
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:20.360]  whatever 2016 vibes but i don't know if we can recapture it exactly the same
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.840]  it definitely is already feeling 2016 uh to me it definitely is already the
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.920]  sequel to 2016 whether hillary ends up throwing her hat in the ring or not
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.560]  uh but this has 2016 written all over it no off season just right into the
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.120]  presidential election cycle now but i think the issue you know look i'm not
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.480]  too worried about a heated primary season trump went through it before
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.960]  and he ended up being a good ally with rubio and cruz that basically took each
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.760]  other through the ringer so i don't necessarily think it's a bad thing
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.400]  but i don't want to get ahead of ourselves either because
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.000]  i i just feel like the santa hasn't even announced he's running
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.840]  he's still taking care of business in florida they just had another hurricane
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.040]  so uh i think this is trump though before the primary season even starts
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.000]  saying all right anybody who wants to get in the ring with me
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.640]  get ready because i'm swinging for the fences so come on in if you want but
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.000]  he really wants to be president again that's how i see it
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.200]  yeah and and definitely trump is the rifle heir to the throne because of
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.960]  what happened in 2020 you know having it stolen from him so that's i mean i'm
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.920]  empathetic to trump he's he's in line for it i just don't want a guy that has
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.200]  every single option in the world he even talked about in his speech he said i

[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:15.720]  the deep state and the globalists mad they are just
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.480]  driven to insanity and what they would really like is for this audience to be
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:23.560]  separated from alex jones and that's why they lie about alex
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.760]  so much to try to deceive you to separate alex from this audience because
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.360]  it's true folks it's true the real thing they hate about alex the
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.880]  real thing that scares them about alex is not necessarily
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.840]  that he tells the truth all the time and and goes on air and tells the truth
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.480]  that has been proven right and vindicated about so much
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:43.000]  really what they're afraid of is the fact that it's an audience of millions
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.120]  of people that also get the truth and the
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.280]  information right here at info wars and so that's what they want to separate
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.480]  that's what they want to shut down is the millions of people being informed
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.840]  and then paying it forward and that's why it's your support at infowarstore.com

[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.080]  the calls lined up here let's look at some of this other news i have on my
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.560]  desk
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:40.200]  now donald trump was reinstated as it's being said by
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:46.600]  elan musk on twitter and it's kind of been a weird process because
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.600]  it's the original donald trump account but
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.080]  he had to get all of the new followers so all of his followers were erased
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.120]  but all of his old tweets were still up and so people are kind of going back
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.800]  and remembering all the classic trump tweets
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.880]  but it's funny two big ones that are getting a lot of attention right now
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.000]  are the two tweets from donald trump on january 6th
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.320]  both tweets where he calls for peace both tweets and they say
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.280]  trump's an insurrectionist trump wanted to overthrow the government really he
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.080]  called for peace and all of his supporters went home when we were
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:24.200]  asked to so they're obviously lying about that it's
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.400]  one of the biggest lies they've ever told
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.600]  but it's amazing isn't it that donald trump was on twitter less than 24 hours
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:39.000]  and already had double the amount of followers of joe bodin yeah
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.760]  keep telling me about 81 million votes for joe though keep telling us about
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:47.480]  that and then apparently whether this was actually
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.600]  what elan musk was thinking or not i don't know
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.120]  some people think he may have been up to something else when he put out a poll
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.400]  should donald trump be reinstated now what happened was
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:03.640]  as i was monitoring this what happened was as soon as the poll went out for the
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.440]  first about half an hour let's say it
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.520]  immediately shot up it was it was consistently between 65 and 70
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.720]  percent of the replies saying yes reinstate
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.440]  donald trump and then something happened amazingly the same thing that
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.480]  happens with every election slowly but surely the tides
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.240]  turned and slowly but surely to not reinstate trump
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.800]  was leading the way and so it went from 70 percent saying to reinstate trump to
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.160]  65 percent saying reinstate trump and then all the way down
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.400]  to 52 percent which ultimately was the final number
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.680]  and elan musk said okay i'll bring him back but see what happens if the count
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:52.680]  would have kept going eventually no would have won instead of yes
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.000]  just like with our elections but the difference is we had a finite time they
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.680]  had a finite window of time to try to rig that poll
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.440]  and when the clock ran out they didn't have the votes
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.400]  but see when they keep the clock running and they keep adding time to the
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.520]  clock they always find the votes now some people
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.240]  think elan musk set a bot trap with this poll
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:19.720]  set a bot trap to find out where a lot of this activity comes from and i'm sure
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.160]  he noticed as well that in the early stages it was heavily
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.800]  supportive of trump and then slowly but surely
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.240]  the bot farms came to change the poll but they couldn't get enough
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.280]  so a lot of people think musk may have laid a bot trap with that poll
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.120]  either way though trump has said he's not going to be
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.680]  going back on twitter because he's got his own thing at true social
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.280]  i get it i think it's kind of an ego thing i think he should come back
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:48.040]  and start tweeting again but for now he says no
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.400]  elan musk also said he would not reinstate alex jones
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:58.200]  even though now we have this story reinstate alex jones
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.960]  sandy hook victim family member tells elan musk to bring back
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.280]  info wars founder so even they like free speech
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:15.720]  on that issue but he says this is jt luis in his tweet elan i lost my
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.640]  brother and sandy hook my family has been harassed by hoaxers for a decade
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.800]  but you should reinstate alex jones coordinated efforts to censor and ban
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.760]  him off social media only deepens his base
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.320]  by in their eyes substantiating their crazy conspiracy theories oh
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.360]  substantiating their crazy conspiracy theories like
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.440]  all the others like jeffrey eppstein pedophile island lolita express bill
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.120]  clinton and all that like that crazy conspiracy theory it's funny it's like
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.160]  so so here's the argument is you're proving them right
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:53.160]  yeah duh that's the point we were right that's why they censor us and so even
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.680]  when it's happening in real time and they realize alex jones is being proven
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:00.680]  right the excuse is somehow you're proving alex
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.600]  jones right stop it it's not proving alex jones right alex
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.480]  jones was right it's not substantiating what alex
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.320]  jones talks about he was always right
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.480]  jeffrey eppstein just one of the many examples dozens of court documents
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.200]  relating to eight of the pedophile jeffrey eppstein associates to be
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.960]  unsealed will we get anything here somehow i doubt it the media will cover
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.720]  it up or maybe maybe it was the whole iver mekton
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.800]  thing oh we were right about that too oh fda backtracks during trial and now
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.480]  claims not taking iver mekton for covet 19 was merely a recommendation
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.480]  no they banned iver mekton they banned you from talking about iver mekton
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.440]  they banned you from purchasing or selling iver mekton
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.920]  and now that the tests have come out and proven iver mekton works they say oh
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.120]  we never said anything about that that never happened
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.960]  what a bunch of scumbag liars and they all want us shut down because we tell
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.680]  the truth and then that proves we're right and then they say see you're
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.600]  proving alex jones right even though he's not right

[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.200]  i studied the globalist 30 years ago but on air 28 years
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:25.640]  and i knew they were planning all of this and i warned the public as a modern paul

[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:08.280]  they're done in a day why can't we do this here the answer is fraud and
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.120]  corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter where the republican
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:15.080]  nominees donald trump or governor de sanctimonious
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.760]  they're going to deny us michigan they're going to deny us pennsylvania

[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:31.800]  an america first majority in every single one of them so
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.400]  we need to keep fighting for reform of the system
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.280]  tucker crawison said this better last night than anything else
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:43.800]  communications are the reason why we did well that's why info wars.com is so damn

[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:10.760]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:32.200]  so the world cup kicked off this weekend and of
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.360]  course not without controversy
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:42.200]  the middle east uh guitar specifically not exactly lgbtq friendly
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.720]  but of course the left that has to take over everything and make it their
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:52.520]  totalitarian authoritarian stamped approval of everything
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.840]  they tried to inject their lgbtq propaganda into the
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:02.600]  katari world cup england and harry kane have been banned from wearing the one
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:06.120]  love armband at world cup and it's the gay flag with one love and it's all
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.800]  about one planetary government you know the people in the middle east don't
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.360]  really want to be controlled by another country
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.520]  so uh yeah yeah and uh they're not really pro gay
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:20.440]  either so that's not going to work for you
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:24.840]  us men's soccer team ditches american colors for gay pride flag
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.680]  take a stand let's see how that one goes so it looks like the u.s was a little
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.800]  smarter with their gay propaganda we do gay a
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.920]  little better than you over there in england you guys just have a silly
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.280]  little arm patch we changed our logo to the gay flag
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:45.000]  ha ha see we're smarter than you let's see them ban the gay flag which is now
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.720]  our logo tell us we can't have a logo but isn't that the story
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.160]  isn't that the real story what the left really wants to do take
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.720]  replace the american flag with the gay flag that's why they're doing it in
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.760]  classrooms isn't that the real story isn't this part of a bigger picture
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.680]  of course it is they're just doing it right in front of your face yeah we're
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.120]  removing the usa flag and we're replacing it with the gay flag and if
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.640]  you don't like that you're a bigot so let's see what happens
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.120]  with that issue when america plays tomorrow
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.440]  and then there's been other issues and they're trying to make it this big
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:23.080]  thing because they're not allowing sales of alcohol at the games
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.320]  and
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.480]  this is obviously upsetting towards most soccer fans so
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.200]  they'll still find a way to get drunk if not drunk are now because of it
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.160]  also the fact that katar that bribed fifa to even have the world cup
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.840]  doesn't even have the infrastructure to support it so i think all these stories
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:47.960]  are kind of distracting from that but of course they've got to make it gay
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.480]  you know it's all about making everything gay and it's all about telling
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.920]  you that we're replacing the american flag with the gay flag and just just get
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.160]  with it because we're taking the stand we're better than you
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.200]  we're liberal supremacists and we can take your flag and replace it with the
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.200]  gay flag because that's what we do f you we're liberals
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:07.720]  that's what it is all right you know we got a
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.200]  interesting situation happening in alaska that it's just another example of
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.800]  republicans just crapping the bed and so let's go to kai
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:19.240]  on this issue and that's the ranked choice voting kai you're on the alex
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:24.760]  joneshow go ahead hi um for i i want to talk about how
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:31.080]  insidious that ftx is our governor last year put in a uh
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:35.960]  what would you say she is uh someone on the board her name is ellie rubenstein
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.640]  and her father is david rubenstein does that name ring a bell
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:49.160]  yes cfr carla group r p f d they invested into that
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:56.760]  ftx and lots of money was lost uh yeah 32 billion dollars
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:03.160]  oh you're okay you're on it and also they were they came in they funded our
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.440]  we are lisa murkowski yes they funded
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.920]  they funded the congresswoman patola who no one even knew who she was
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.680]  she didn't even have a campaign so let me just so because you know this let me
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.920]  just make sure the audience understands what's happening in alaska they have
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:22.280]  this ranked choice voting which is like series of elimination style voting
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.040]  and now you have two republicans on the ticket
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.200]  and so the republicans vote gets split and then the democrat
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.320]  in some of these races ends up getting more votes because there were two
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.120]  republicans on the ticket one democrat and so you're sitting there and you're
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.120]  like what are the republicans doing like what are you what it's like if you saw
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.240]  someone like running into blades like running in a knife you'd say why are
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.040]  you running into that knife what are you doing that's what the republicans did
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.240]  in alaska and then the other thing that happened was
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.520]  murkowski was losing to shebaka shebaka was winning
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:57.240]  they just keep counting votes now murkowski's ahead i mean what is that
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.160]  it's a nightmare and no one knows how what they're like
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.720]  okay i put i ranked a vote i didn't rank the vote i did this i did that why is my
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:09.960]  vote going to the end like no one knows what the hell is going on with this
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:13.800]  ranked choice voting it's a nightmare i think it's pretty clear they're
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.200]  testing a system i i think what's happening is
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.440]  they're they're testing this system in alaska because they're always looking
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.480]  for new ways to rig elections and so that's what they're doing is they're
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.560]  testing this new ranks choice scam in alaska to see if they can pull off the
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.840]  scam there and then they'll try to apply it nationwide now i think it's going to
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.400]  take but that's what i think is happening here
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.520]  they're already gonna they're already starting a petition to get rid of it
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:41.240]  oh it's a disaster it's an absolute disaster if any state
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:45.720]  out there tries doing it voted down because it's a freaking nightmare
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.080]  but yes you tie in the ftx scenario because it was mitch mcconnell that
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.960]  took 2.5 million dollars from ftx and campaign donations and he
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.920]  funneled a lot of that money to lisa murkowski that was his biggest issue
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.000]  was to get murkowski over shebaka in and again folks i'm telling you
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.280]  shebaka was leading the entire time literally she has been leading the
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:09.560]  entire time until the last 48 hours all
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.080]  the sudden lisa murkowski takes the lead the swamp republican
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.600]  that mitch mcconnell wanted so badly there you go
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.600]  i'm i'm i'm really impressed you know you know all the information up here
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:26.200]  well that's my job thank you oh and okay thank you
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:32.600]  let's go to shawn now in nebraska shawn you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.120]  hey good to talk to you again oh and i just got a message for elon musk let's
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.360]  ditch the electric cars let's bring back the water power cars i think all of
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.760]  you know anyone that's tried to do this
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:47.080]  is not around anymore i think it's one day elon just made a speech i said hey i
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:52.040]  turned this the factory from electric to water power and also elon if you're
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.560]  going to bring donald trump back you have to bring alex jones back
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.720]  there would be no donald trump without alex jones let's not get the
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.440]  horse so the carriage in front of the horse here
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.760]  well i would like elon musk i mean he doesn't owe us an explanation but
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.520]  and i don't think he cares either he's he kind of does look at himself as like
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.040]  the king of twitter now i think he kind of he kind of likes it
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.960]  uh and that's fine but i'd like to hear the explanation
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:22.200]  why alex jones he just says no i'd like to hear the explanation and maybe he
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.760]  changed his mind maybe he's just trolling but you know
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.720]  let's hear the explanation okay you're you're in charge of twitter now you're
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.520]  going to be the the free speech uh you know the decision maker here
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.600]  so let's hear the logic let's hear why let's hear why trump comes back and why
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.560]  jones doesn't i mean let's let's at least get an explanation but
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.920]  nothing offered so far no nothing at all and i like i say let's bring back that
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.360]  water engine forget the electric thing we all have water
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:54.920]  but the electric's not environmentally savvy it's just i don't know
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.080]  you are aware of the the guy that was making the water powered engine and
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.560]  buffalo i'm assuming i'm aware of several that are
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:09.720]  not with us anymore yeah yeah and the same thing the same thing
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.720]  happens with people that find cures for cancer i've noticed too
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.480]  yeah i i know and just speaking that i'm in remission of cancer so
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:22.040]  joe biden wait till i care where he promised joe biden promised he did cure
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.600]  cancer he promised me but yeah here i am
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:32.440]  i gotta take the poison not the cure oh well god bless you shon god bless you
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.040]  owen and i love you brother and i love all you guys and

[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.800]  tell you i really do love this audience
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.880]  let's get one more caller in before the break max in kansas max 60 seconds
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:52.360]  far away hey and we love you too owen um so what i
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.200]  want to talk about is trump's speech last week um
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.400]  i gotta be honest with you i really wasn't the biggest fan of
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.280]  of it um and i was a big and i still am an advocate for him in 2024
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.640]  um but he really didn't bring anything new to the table
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:11.320]  um during that speech he was very monotone i found it a little boring to
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.840]  be honest and he wasn't touching on the right issues i don't think i think there
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:18.120]  were two things the two things to take away was
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.400]  in-person same-day voting paper ballots and then um
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.440]  you know he'd be briefly touched on the biden corruption but really it's the
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.520]  it's the voting thing that he needs to be a bigger bigger fuss of
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.640]  yeah absolutely and i think what made him so popular
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.240]  um in 2016 is that he ran against globalism
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:40.200]  you know he was running against foreign wars he was running against china
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.800]  exploiting america um and i just think that we really need to see
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.480]  that same energy again and he needs to do a good job of bringing that back
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:51.960]  where he's not going to be getting the support that he had um then in 2020
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:57.560]  all right max let me respond to that on the other side of this break

[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:10.200]  it's alex jones
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:28.200]  i want to reply to the caller's comments on trump's
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:31.720]  speech the other night and overall i would say i agree i don't want to
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.280]  play into the media's narrative saying oh trump's boring he's lame nobody cares
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.280]  about him anymore really quarter million people actually half a
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.160]  million people tuned in to watch him live on rumble
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.400]  joe biden can't get 10 people to watch any of his videos on youtube even though
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:52.120]  it's totally promoted so trump totally censored and and
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.520]  relegated to the dark corners of the internet like rumble which that's not a
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:00.200]  shot at rumble it's just obviously it's not mainstream
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.880]  and he gets half a million live views on right side broadcasting
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.120]  joe biden can't get five views on any of the videos he does on
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.640]  youtube his big last speech got 1.7 live viewers
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.160]  1.7 thousand so in that regard trump's announcement speech was a
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.120]  smashing success
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:26.200]  but for people concerned that it was boring
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:29.800]  and wonky and nothing new i wouldn't be too concerned
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.920]  because i i say this to people that have that concern i say well what do you
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.880]  remember from trump's announcement speech in
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.960]  2015 can you tell me what you remember from that
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.000]  probably nothing you probably don't remember much from that speech at all so
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.840]  as far as importance of the speech i don't think much is there
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.840]  it was the generation of the headlines the generation of the interest
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:54.600]  uh and just the the the energy brought back to
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.800]  the republican party with the announcement which is the real story to
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.920]  me but here's where i think it needs to go and
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:05.400]  maybe this is them deciding to go differently than 2016 but i think
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.760]  you know it was successful i don't know why you would abandon it
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.400]  i want less wonk and more honk is how i describe it
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:19.480]  i want less wonk and more honk president trump's speech was very wonky
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:22.920]  he doesn't need to be wonky he's not a political wonk he shouldn't be a
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.720]  political wonk he should be donald trump
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.720]  and he should be more honky we're in the clown world
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:34.040]  we're living in the clown world let's honk it up with the clowns
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.160]  and that's part of the problem of the republican party that you're seeing on
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.280]  display right now with people like paul ryan
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.120]  paul ryan trump will probably lose if he is the 2024 g.o.p yeah that's the same
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:48.280]  thing you said in 2016 he won why don't you just shut up already
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.000]  but see that's the whole split is the republicans want to say oh we need to
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.520]  get back to business as usual we need to get back to being cut and
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:58.440]  straighten dc politics but i don't know we don't
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:01.640]  actually that's nothing but that's nothing but death
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.400]  for the country so no that's not what we need to do we need to do the exact
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:11.640]  opposite of that oh we need to get back to business as usual no more of this
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.120]  trumpism wrong oh wrong oh you need more of the
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.720]  trumpism and and and you're gonna sit here and
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:23.080]  act like in good faith that the democrats are ever
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.560]  going to play by the rules that the democrats are ever going to play things
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:30.200]  squarely give me a break they've put us into this clown world
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:33.880]  so let's hawk it up with them and so when i'm talking about this
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.680]  i'm dead serious donald trump i don't know why he's not having a rally in
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:41.880]  georgia it's just a joke it's just an absolute
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:46.280]  joke the republicans abandoning georgia again
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.040]  i don't know why there isn't a trump rally in georgia with a with a voter
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:53.720]  registration booth a mile away from an early voting center and you tell the
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.680]  20 000 people 30 000 people that come into the trump rally
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:00.600]  go vote it's right down the street go vote right now
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:04.440]  you can do this twice three times four times five times you can do it
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.800]  but because the republican party doesn't want to embrace trump
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.000]  and because the republican party doesn't care about that senate seat
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.920]  they're gonna they're just gonna let that opportunity go
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:18.120]  but that's what the republicans want to do you're not gonna get any of these
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:21.560]  law changed before the 2024 presidential election i believe you're
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.600]  still going to do the mail-in ballots the ballot drop boxes all of it
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:29.880]  early voting it's not going anywhere so you better realize
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:34.120]  you better play by those rules or you're gonna lose
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:39.000]  so yes i want less wonk and more hawk i don't want a trump rally to be like
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.840]  that a wonky political speech i want a trump rally to be a
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:46.600]  gigantic party yeah get kid rock to do a concert
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:53.960]  yeah get travis tritt to do a concert yeah get get performers
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.680]  throw it back make it feel retro make it feel fun again
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:06.120]  make msnbc do a stand-up report in front of a ferris wheel with a bunch of kids
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.680]  running around having a good time laughter behind them
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:12.680]  saying this is a white supremacist event this is an extremist event
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:15.720]  and it's a ferris wheel with a ferris wheel with a bunch of kids having a good

[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:42.040]  this is a white supremacist event this is an extremist event and then the people
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:45.240]  are watching seeing children and families running around smiling
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.320]  playing carnival games have a dunking booth with
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:54.680]  somebody in a joe biden costume you throw a ball you dunk them in the booth

[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:12.680]  have vendors want one around selling selling drinks and food
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:19.960]  less walk more honk make it so fun make it so enjoyable
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:25.480]  that that nobody can hate it and then of course the haters are going to hate

[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.960]  and and grandma and grandpa and everything and
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.760]  here you go here you go tell everybody what a bad event it is

[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.320]  we love you and we are praying for you thank you for your protection thank you
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:13.960]  um real quickly i remember seeing it was probably on
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:18.040]  info wars or a prison planet that during um
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:22.280]  the was before the when biden was still vice president
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:26.760]  there was a an interview or he was at a barbecue outside someplace so it's
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:32.040]  quite an informal event and they're all having fun
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.680]  lovely time and they bring up and the issue of
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.600]  gun confiscation that obama was talking about it was in the news because there
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:43.560]  was probably some big false flag that had happened you know how they do this
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.160]  regularly and so he's asked about it
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:52.760]  and he says very clearly you know very fluently they're not going to take my
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:56.840]  guns and joe biden said that joe biden said that
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.280]  clear as day i think he said at least twice in the statement that's great we
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.080]  should try to find that and then like play the new clips where joe biden says
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.880]  yeah we're going to ban assault weapons and then play biden you're not going to
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:09.560]  take my gun delicious ironies because it and i've
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:12.680]  looked for it and it's been been a while but every
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:16.280]  all you get is current stuff you can't get anything old you're telling me that
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.280]  joe biden is a liar and a fraud and a phony
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.560]  i don't need to say it of course though we've got clips of obama obama used to
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:28.200]  be anti-game marriage joe biden used to be anti-game
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.920]  marriage they they don't have any values they
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:34.280]  don't have any principles they don't stand on any ground
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.840]  they just use and abuse politics to gain power that's all it is
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:45.880]  yeah definitely also um i think we need to have
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  impeach some judges if any you know i think there needs to be lawsuits
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.520]  coming up challenging these um rigged elections
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.160]  and if they use the excuse oh well you don't have standing
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.600]  that's a dereliction of duty and the nerberg
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.440]  trials they had trial for judges that did not fulfill their duty
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.000]  that could have stopped a lot of atrocities and i think it's time to
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.160]  hold these people accountable everyone that votes every citizen
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.120]  is certainly for the national elections for any senator
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:25.800]  or representative every single u.s voter legitimate voter has standing
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.040]  because we're all affected by it so i i think that needs to be pushed forward
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:33.640]  and they start feeling that little fire under the feet they might change their
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:37.720]  tune a little bit well it's a nice proposal it's
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:41.480]  probably never gonna happen sadly i think the best the best
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:44.760]  way to try to mitigate all of the election fraud and
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.240]  and all the shenanigans is to just play by their rules
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:51.160]  the minute republicans start ballot harvesting the minute republicans start
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.000]  stuffing mail-in drop boxes with ballots the minute republicans start
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.040]  using and abusing the early voting system is the minute the democrats
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.720]  cancel it all it's that simple so so that's
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.480]  that's the way i i see it you just have to overwhelm the system with their own
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.880]  lunacy until they cry to shut it down kind of like with the police issue
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.000]  they said defund the police they defund the police cities turn to ultimate
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.200]  violence and then what they do they say we need to we need to fund the police
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.720]  darn those republicans defunding them
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:26.040]  all right mike thank you for the call that does it for the alex jones show

[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:52.920]  until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:57.400]  believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.640]  because of something called vapors they associated these
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:05.800]  poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.680]  weather or catching a chill that killed people
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.760]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.760]  you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.520]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:24.440]  you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.400]  and other things to start replicating and taking your body over
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.200]  so now it's more important than ever because the winter is here
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.200]  to take high quality vitamin d3 and we have the best with our vitamin d3
