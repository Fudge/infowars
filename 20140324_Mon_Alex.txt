[17:53.320 --> 17:58.240]  being sold to French cosmetic makers like the Chinese dead babies are so they

[18:48.840 --> 18:52.400]  nurse practitioners and doctors most of them are very hard-working professionals
[18:52.400 --> 18:56.160]  that have hellish jobs that are incredibly hard and have to be around
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.920]  disease all day and and sadness all day it's heroic what many medical workers

[24:10.200 --> 24:16.200]  tuned in coming up in the next segment the strange revival of Republican America
[24:16.200 --> 24:19.520]  and how that ties into trends worldwide that we've already organically
[24:19.520 --> 24:23.520]  seen and I'm not tooting our horn but we were the first to be focusing on this
[24:23.520 --> 24:29.920]  about a year ago and now it's been picked up by Bloomberg banker deaths
[24:29.920 --> 24:37.120]  leave industry concerned as coroner's probe and when I said and it got picked
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.560]  up by the epoch times a bunch of others that 20 plus bankers have already died
[24:40.560 --> 24:46.800]  that was a gestalt low-level number in the last year it's been it's got to be
[24:46.800 --> 24:53.840]  like 15 Goldman Sachs high-level bankers jumping off buildings you know JP
[24:53.840 --> 24:59.440]  Morgan it's every couple days so I don't know what the number is 50 a hundred I
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.240]  don't know somebody's got a look I mean I see it every couple days and we've been
[25:04.240 --> 25:08.880]  hammering this report and finally it's being probed as suspicious no kidding
[25:08.880 --> 25:16.040]  they're being found hung anybody associated with golden sacks JP Morgan
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.520]  major globalist institutions they are covering up folks that know where the
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.880]  bodies are buried rattles people they use mid-level high-level to carry out
[25:23.880 --> 25:27.680]  the criminal activity so higher ups can deny that they know what's going on
[25:27.680 --> 25:33.960]  you're the first people that get killed little news flash you know you think
[25:33.960 --> 25:40.280]  you're so trusted and you're so high up in these institutions you're dead by your
[25:40.280 --> 25:45.520]  own master's hands because it the collapse hasn't happened yet now I said

[25:57.400 --> 26:01.000]  going to cover that more and then under a very important article out of CBS news
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.640]  Vatican Chief Justice Obama's policies have become progressively more hostile
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.320]  towards Christian civilization yeah that's an understatement but you've got
[26:10.320 --> 26:14.560]  to tell it like it is the globalist want to be God they want the state to be God
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.920]  they don't like anti-abortion groups they don't like pro-life groups they
[26:18.920 --> 26:22.080]  don't like pro-gun groups they don't like pro-family groups and so they're
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.560]  trying to make Christian churches promote abortion and promote you know
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.440]  hiring people that aren't Christians which is an absolute violation of the
[26:32.440 --> 26:36.120]  First Amendment now let's move on to the other article at drudge

[27:35.400 --> 27:44.240]  Alba this is part of the overall shift of the FBI Homeland Security Justice
[27:44.240 --> 27:51.720]  Department BATF local police to being commissar political officers targeting
[27:51.720 --> 27:57.360]  domestic dissent and chilling free speech in the press in conservative
[27:57.360 --> 28:05.040]  libertarian veteran pro-life constitutional circles there are
[28:05.040 --> 28:10.240]  hundreds of homeland security memos and documents that you've seen it it's a
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.640]  min Forbes and the Associated Press and West Point you know they train them to
[28:14.640 --> 28:21.800]  quote take on the the the Tea Party in an insurrection army time stars and
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.960]  stripes in the last six years it's all gone public it was going on behind the
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.920]  scenes before that the bureaucracy was training to take on the American people
[28:30.920 --> 28:38.160]  but now it's going main line with TSA on the streets as the domestic security
[28:38.160 --> 28:43.600]  force just as big just as strong as our military close quote Barack Obama that

[29:15.560 --> 29:21.240]  of criminal elements of the bureaucracy ordering the police and military to
[29:21.240 --> 29:29.000]  prepare for war with us they don't want them to know they don't want the public

[35:42.920 --> 35:48.320]  where they quote target three Americans against socialist tyranny is the
[35:48.320 --> 35:54.320]  headline now if you go to the home school drills that they've had at public
[35:54.320 --> 35:57.760]  schools they tell them we're home schoolers against public education and
[35:57.760 --> 36:03.040]  we're here to kill you or we're pro-gun groups and we're here to kill you but
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.560]  don't have Watson add all those examples to his article to show people as part of
[36:07.560 --> 36:13.520]  a larger compendium of where they have these school shooting drills federally
[36:13.520 --> 36:17.280]  funded from Texas to Michigan from California to Florida we've seen it in
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.440]  just every major state Minnesota they've lost lawsuits up there where unannounced
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.640]  at the elementary they come in with guys dressed like militia and marks
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.280]  everybody outside and say we don't like public school and you're all dead and
[36:31.280 --> 36:36.120]  then they blow up a bus with a firebomb I had the lawyer on this was on the news
[36:36.120 --> 36:39.360]  in Minnesota and then they get the went the teachers down on their knees with
[36:39.360 --> 36:42.640]  the kids and the kids are literally urinating defecating all of themselves
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.360]  this is in the lawsuits I mean you talk about Soviet mind control camp right
[36:48.360 --> 36:52.080]  out of red dawn that's what a mind control camp is where you torture and
[36:52.080 --> 36:56.520]  freak everybody out until peer pressure makes families break down and tell dad

[37:41.200 --> 37:46.360]  year in some type of mass shooting almost all of them are gangbangers shooting

[39:03.400 --> 39:07.280]  just everywhere they drill now like the you know the army used to drill to fight
[39:07.280 --> 39:13.320]  the Russians in the 70s and 80s 60 70s 80s the Air Force drill to fight foreign
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.160]  aircraft the FBI drill to fight quote organized crime and foreign infiltrators
[39:18.160 --> 39:24.160]  the CIA supposedly you know did that to stop foreign governments coming in
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.320]  infiltrating and stealing secrets do you know what they do now you know what
[39:28.320 --> 39:33.640]  their main mission announced by Janet Napolitano six years ago is do you know
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.360]  what their mission is announced every month the FBI announced last year we no
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.860]  longer worry about crime that's not our main focus it's domestic extremism how
[39:43.860 --> 39:50.320]  many domestic extremists killed people last year it's less than 10 people on
[39:50.320 --> 39:53.320]  the Southern Providence Law Center's own website and they're really scratching
[39:53.320 --> 39:59.240]  for numbers there 10 people oh but it's like right watch sharks they kill five
[39:59.240 --> 40:05.360]  people every year on average highest number ever's 12 recorded everyone I
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.760]  know is scared to swim in the ocean including the Caribbean because they
[40:08.760 --> 40:14.280]  think sharks are gonna eat them almost everyone I know there is no great white
[40:14.280 --> 40:18.080]  shark in the Caribbean Dumbo some of them occasionally come in in the winter
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.480]  into the Gulf of Mexico out of the Atlantic there are no great white
[40:22.480 --> 40:28.320]  attacks in the Gulf of Mexico there are none in the Caribbean there are sperm
[40:28.320 --> 40:33.320]  whales and pilot whales in the southern Caribbean I mean people just just are
[40:33.320 --> 40:37.160]  scared of everything it's just everything that isn't scary everything that
[40:37.160 --> 40:40.440]  isn't a threat and then I'm scared of a big monolithic government when
[40:40.440 --> 40:46.760]  historically and what our founders said in common sense shows the red level 100
[40:46.760 --> 40:53.360]  percent real boogeyman that keeps me up at night just got chills to I really do
[40:53.360 --> 41:01.680]  like it chills chill bumps to hundred and 62 million non-military deaths in the
[41:01.680 --> 41:07.240]  20th century by government University of Hawaii study University of Chicago has
[41:07.240 --> 41:12.200]  even higher numbers they say 300 something mill two hundred and sixty two
[41:12.200 --> 41:19.840]  ma ma ma ma ma million two hundred and sixty two ma ma ma ma million not a hundred
[41:19.840 --> 41:25.960]  and sixty something killed by mass shooters a year government killed two
[41:25.960 --> 41:34.840]  hundred and sixty two million and who is our loving foreign banker occupied
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.880]  let's not rhetoric we are literally run by the IMF World Bank Federal Reserve is
[41:39.880 --> 41:45.280]  their domestic arm we are literally run by the criminal IRS set up in 1913 to
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.200]  pay money in the private room for private Federal Reserve didn't have an
[41:49.200 --> 41:54.360]  income tax on 1913 our whole system is designed to be cold and socially
[41:54.360 --> 41:57.400]  engineered and controlled by these people nothing else really matters
[41:57.400 --> 42:04.040]  except recognizing the real political system we're on and then meanwhile in
[42:04.040 --> 42:09.720]  every army publication army war college navy war college marine war fighting
[42:09.720 --> 42:18.120]  school west point stars and stripes army times internal manuals homeland
[42:18.120 --> 42:21.040]  security manuals that we've broken almost all of them because people send them
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.440]  to us and then we call the phone numbers involved and check them and read them
[42:24.440 --> 42:26.840]  and look at them we can look at them instantly it's always the same crud
[42:26.840 --> 42:30.480]  written on some private law center the son of a private law center is the
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.400]  base of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff along with the ADL and they
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.680]  trained in their main mission homeland security in north com have said this is
[42:37.680 --> 42:41.680]  I'm gonna say it again returning veterans number one then veterans your
[42:41.680 --> 42:46.920]  number two enemy then libertarians constitutionalist conservatives gun
[42:46.920 --> 42:55.320]  owners Ron Paul supporters they literally train the federal government I mean
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.840]  I've been at the gun show and seen the ATF and they will literally look at me
[42:58.840 --> 43:02.720]  and start hyperventilating like I am an enemy soldier or something because they
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.080]  literally bat and pitch for the other team they are sworn they're in a cult
[43:07.080 --> 43:13.160]  just like the mafia it's their duty I am the enemy you understand that you are
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.600]  the enemy they train 24 7 to take your guns 24 7 to put you in relocation
[43:18.600 --> 43:25.160]  centers 24 7 to slap us in the emergency centers establishment act camps the
[43:25.160 --> 43:31.240]  civilian and make labor camp program everything I'm saying is declassified all
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.000]  those close military bases are manned and ready and all they want to do set off
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.440]  some nukes or bio weapons blaming on us start a civil war that'll wipe out the
[43:39.440 --> 43:42.560]  police and military because we won't have a choice when they're trying to take
[43:42.560 --> 43:49.280]  us I mean it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna be like
[43:52.280 --> 43:59.320]  20 million hardcore donors that have the right on their side and are being
[43:59.320 --> 44:03.560]  hunted and attacked not that are going out attacking people like donor did I
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.840]  mean you saw almost all of Southern California locked down for one guy and
[44:07.840 --> 44:11.720]  police shaking in fear shooting up vehicles that even match the description
[44:11.720 --> 44:17.080]  with white women in them can you imagine when all the retired special forces and
[44:17.080 --> 44:21.280]  all the military and all the former police and all the gun owners have had
[44:21.280 --> 44:24.880]  their families hunted down and their cousin drug off to a camp I mean it is
[44:24.880 --> 44:27.920]  gonna be you're not gonna be safe anywhere and the globalists love that
[44:27.920 --> 44:33.400]  they know you'll attack us we will wipe you out you will be wiped out within a
[44:33.400 --> 44:38.520]  year dead totally wiped out it'll be like moose hunting season where you put
[44:38.520 --> 44:42.320]  into a lottery and only one out of four people get some moose license or a
[44:42.320 --> 44:46.320]  mountain lion hunting where you got to go put in the lottery and a one out of
[44:46.320 --> 44:50.800]  20 gets to hunt the mountain lion yeah I mean you'll be like dodo birds and I'm
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.400]  not here threatening you I don't want that to happen that's the plan to wipe
[44:54.400 --> 44:58.600]  both sides out starting this civil war and let me tell you they're wartime
[44:58.600 --> 45:02.000]  training just like when they're going back into jungle warfare they paint the
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.960]  tanks green two years before they've already got it planned or they're going
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.080]  to the desert they paint the tanks tan two years before they they have been
[45:09.080 --> 45:15.480]  painting the trucks black for domestic war the tanks black for domestic war
[45:15.480 --> 45:21.200]  they have been training publicly to take on gun owners during martial law and
[45:21.200 --> 45:25.000]  they're coming just as sure as the sun's coming up tomorrow unless we run
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.880]  around like chickens with our heads cut off and I'm just getting adrenaline
[45:27.880 --> 45:32.560]  rushes right now folks I mean just like I was you know in a parking lot some guys
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.720]  trying to mug me and I get that feeling I mean this is I just it's all real it's
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.320]  all happening I'm pulsing with adrenaline and electricity right now
[45:40.320 --> 45:46.480]  because this is what they're going to do we've got to stop them because they're
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.640]  going to use the civil war as the false flag to bring the country down just as
[45:51.640 --> 45:57.720]  sure as the sun comes up and geese fly south for the winter they want to take
[45:57.720 --> 46:02.120]  this country down they've got a score to settle with us look at came out in the
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.520]  weatherman trials how they were going to put 50 million conservatives men in
[46:06.520 --> 46:11.800]  forced labor camps and then kill 25 million of us the numbers they'll have
[46:11.800 --> 46:19.160]  to kill now from 1970s numbers are over 75 million they are going to rape your
[46:19.160 --> 46:22.880]  wives people are going all this again watch watch you see everything else
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.640]  happened they've got a score to settle you have Obama's domestic security force
[46:27.640 --> 46:32.800]  please go ahead and play Obama when he was campaigning we cannot continue to
[46:32.800 --> 46:38.040]  rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[46:38.040 --> 46:42.600]  that we've set we've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[46:42.600 --> 46:49.800]  just as powerful just as strong just as well funded folks it happens in every
[46:49.800 --> 46:52.720]  other nation in history it's happening here if we don't wake up to the
[46:52.720 --> 46:56.400]  nightmare and admit it's happening they will win they will stage the events
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.760]  here's the good news the entire military I would say upwards of 85% are
[47:00.760 --> 47:07.400]  somewhat awake now almost the entire military it's incredible conversion to
[47:07.400 --> 47:12.080]  reality because they're being given the treason training because we warn people
[47:12.080 --> 47:15.000]  up front and you warn people and oathkeepers and countless others for
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.360]  decades Ron Paul you name it John Burt society you name it about the creeping
[47:20.360 --> 47:26.480]  buildup Clinton wanted to do this stuff because we did that now we're catching
[47:26.480 --> 47:29.840]  them with their pants down not us we're not sitting here flatfooted we're dug
[47:29.840 --> 47:35.240]  in we've bought 200 million guns the last 20 years everybody's ready and we're
[47:35.240 --> 47:38.760]  politically fighting hard to fix this country we're doing everything we can
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.000]  we're not starting anything offensively we're just sitting here trying to do our
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.400]  best as in our duty as Americans is good people to be honorable and protect our
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.840]  families and it didn't like we're just starting to fight with a bunch of
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.320]  socialists and you know not going along with them which is our right these are
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.400]  horrible nasty communists run by foreign banks that have a vendetta against this
[48:01.400 --> 48:08.040]  republic they want to have their way with us so bad folks we're in so much
[48:08.040 --> 48:13.040]  danger right now Homeland Security is the domestic army to do this and they've
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.720]  got the the throngs of their followers you've heard them in Austin and LA and
[48:17.720 --> 48:22.680]  other places say they want to put all gun gun owners in camps they will man
[48:22.680 --> 48:27.280]  those camps with potbelly jail guard socialists who will literally stomp our
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.160]  guts out we don't have a choice we've got to work as hard as we can to try to
[48:32.160 --> 48:35.240]  fix this before they start pulling triggers and once they pull triggers
[48:35.240 --> 48:43.200]  folks we got to go info war 110% and defend ourselves but remember
[48:43.200 --> 48:49.600]  remember police and military when they shoot up your convoys and blow up day
[48:49.600 --> 48:53.080]  care centers the rest of it up front that is not the Liberty movement doing

[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.000]  and I'm not blaming the British let's get that clear it's the group that use
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.440]  the British blood and factories and warlike intelligence and scientific
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.880]  vigor to build the greatest empire the world had ever seen that we broke away
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.440]  from that simply remerged in 1922 in New York City with Pratt house and the CFR
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.440]  and that since amalgamated and basically the British Empire got absorbed by the
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.160]  American Empire
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:25.800]  but the soul the mind of the Britannic Empire infested and and and
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.040]  possessed the ghost of the machine America and became the giant giant
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:39.160]  satanic war mock that we now are a giant satanic battleship of evil but we
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.920]  still have great good in us so the destiny of the world does lie for good or
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:49.520]  ill in this Republic and that's why the battle for 1776 will it be an
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.520]  Illuminati 1776 they always launch their counterfeit I had a vice up or will it

[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:28.120]  central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance it's Alex Jones
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.560]  British Empire never been beaten they thought they would disarm the colonist
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.160]  over the next seven years we stomped them into the ground by perseverance
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:43.680]  losing almost every battle but winning the overall war because resistance is
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.960]  victory bankrupting the British Empire just like the Afghans don't give up
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.480]  same thing happened when Santa Anna came to confiscate the guns Texans were
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.400]  not going to be slaves and it doesn't matter if 30 40% of the public can't
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.640]  tie their shoelaces and worship Obama and maybe 20 other percent worship main
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.280]  line Republicans and want to go to country clubs and be patted on the head
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.320]  by Rhino neocons we have a large 30 40% of the public that is pretty awake right
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.920]  now and they're accelerating that awakening 80 plus percent of the
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.600]  military is somewhat awake to hyper awake and that conversion that awakening
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.440]  is steaming towards 90% because the the training is so treasonous where they
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:38.760]  literally army Marine Corps you name it train in drills we've shot video of this
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.200]  many times but this is what keeps coming out in the news where the bunch of guys
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.200]  and overalls on tractors wearing John Deere hats going I want my guns and the
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.120]  Marines get out and practice shooting them and literally go what is this that's
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:10:00.080]  my grandpa I mean that's who they train to kill so and they're like we used to
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.160]  hear this from that Alex Jones guy and Oathkeepers and Ron Paul what's going on
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:10.400]  here and they go home on leave to see their wife and kids and they go over to
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.480]  their dad's house is you know a Marine Corps retired colonel and he goes I know
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.720]  son we heard about this a long time ago now it's happening I'm going to go down
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.960]  to the city council this is this is happening I'm mentioning a real case
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:30.560]  and the colonel overall 10 tours and different wars goes down and speaks to
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.160]  the council and says they're preparing for martial law it's trees and war with
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.280]  us and that's happening in towns everywhere generals colonels captains
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.120]  majors are going in and talking to the police chief they're taking the sheriff
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.600]  to dinner and they're showing them all the documents there's a discussion
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.200]  happening across the country you've seen it out in Texas towns major cities
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.400]  were where county commissioners head judges have gone public saying they're
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.440]  training for gun confiscation and we're gonna have to fight them and the
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.280]  national media is like what a crazy county judge calling the police chief in
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:07.040]  on television on Fox local and saying we've got to prepare to fight gun
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.880]  confiscation that person would be a traitor if they didn't say they were
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.760]  going to stand against that that's normal thank god there's normal people left
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:23.000]  on this contract you should be running around like a chicken with your head
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.040]  cut off with what's happening at county commissioners at city council on your
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.480]  local news starting local groups doing local newsletters getting a local access
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.200]  show doing a local YouTube going and buying time on the local AMR FM station
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.280]  getting some sponsors you know call it the warning hour or whatever and that
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.520]  will build in your area you don't have to save the world by yourself you've got
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.880]  to simply engage the enemy with their own battle plan it's treason we have them
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.720]  we caught them opening the drawbridge we caught them letting the enemy in we
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:04.120]  gotta call them out though we just business as usual it's over so I want
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.640]  your take on the article up on info wars comm it's also on drudgerport.com

[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:22.680]  Americans who oppose socialist tyranny that's a close quote free Americans
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:28.120]  against socialist tyranny who are going to speak out during martial law and
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.320]  gun confiscation and so they're going to shut down our web accounts and websites

[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.000]  multi-hundred page document that is quote only for the highest level trusted
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.320]  homeland security agents translated those who come from despicable families
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.120]  are despicable traders and who are bigger enemies than any Chinese or Russian
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:59.520]  infiltrator I mean I mean these are bona fide spies folks bona fide traders this
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.480]  is real they ship guns into Mexico to blame the second amendment false flag

[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:20.000]  nuke if we don't expose them you understand folks this isn't a game this
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.120]  isn't some crazy guy up on air ranting and raving you're meant to rant and
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.440]  rave about things like this to get people moving
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.280]  ever seen a group of hunting dogs for you let them out of the back of a truck
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.080]  they start getting excited and running in circles and nipping at each other
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.200]  get each other's fire every watch film of wolves or wild dogs in Africa how they
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.720]  get up in the morning they're kind of lazy and one starts running in circles
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.640]  and yapping at the other saying hey I'm hungry get it up get up off the ground
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:53.120]  let's go it's the same thing folks I am running around beating my chest at the
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:58.280]  camp the enemy is masked on the hill right above us with their warfires they
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.280]  just overrun ten other villages that we got word of and killed everybody we
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.520]  got to get up and get our weapons together and get ready just like Paul
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.000]  Revere wrote to the night saying to arms to arms the British are coming the red
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.880]  coats are coming I'm not saying to arms to arms 90% of war the Pentagon
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.560]  admits this is in fall war you've got to smash the enemy with the truth we've
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.800]  got weapons so much more deadly than the enemy they got lies propaganda
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.640]  deception stage terror false flags frame-ups we've got the republic free
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.200]  market family guns our ancestors are our history our birthright everything it's
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:41.720]  so good it's prosperity all we got to do is run that flag up and say hey whatever
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.080]  happens hell or high water we're not moving we're gonna speak out we're
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.960]  gonna warn everybody and then if you come and try to stage something to give
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.920]  yourself the moral high ground try to round us up we're gonna do what we have
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:02.520]  to in fact you guys read me Lexington green Lexington greener bunker hill I
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.760]  forget which one's the speech where they got the preacher that's leading the
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.240]  militia and up marks the redcoats to confiscate the guns and he says don't
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.880]  fire unless fired upon but if they mean to have a war they will have one that's
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.720]  less than green I mean this is real folks but the redcoats might have won the
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.960]  war if they were more sophisticated but they were moral people on average naval
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.880]  was the main group that would do stage stuff that was such a more dirty
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.400]  profession much more dangerous on average false flags came out of naval
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.200]  activity going back to the Romans is some of the first dated ones of frame-ups
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.680]  the the British would not burn down a church and blame it on the militia the
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.200]  British would not a stage a terror attack and blame on the militia to give
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.920]  them moral high ground to take the guns they just marched up and said you
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:54.000]  bastard colonialist throw down your arms or you're dead and it screamed out one
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.360]  more time we're gonna fire and then you know the rest is history folks and
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:04.120]  that's what it all comes down to now here's the good news I've told you the
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:10.280]  demographics in Spain in France in Germany in Portugal in Greece in Canada
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.040]  in the US in England you kept the fastest growing party in England
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.680]  fastest growing party in the EU problem is the EU is unelected at the top so
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.480]  you know it's a parliament it's ceremonial that's what a naked tyranny the
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.880]  EU is but but Nigel Farage and others the Ron Paul of Europe are in there
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:34.520]  exposing it but libertarianism demographically is about to become the
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.400]  global majority as people just keep getting the same out of fake
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.240]  conservatives and fake liberals because the globalist have bought off the
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:47.000]  interest at both levels that's why you have Boehner and Obama meeting and it
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.280]  gets leaked with with Biden about the Tea Party and the Republican Party is
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.520]  giving money to beat the Tea Party and the Democrats are giving money to beat
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.040]  the Tea Party because the real Tea Party not the one the neocons try to take
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.600]  over not not the one they tried to bring in not their counterfeit but the real
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:09.320]  libertarian party is decriminalization of drugs that liberals like pro sovereignty
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:14.000]  not for open borders anti big welfare anti corporate welfare anti police
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.480]  state pro second amendment pro low taxes pro prosperity pro americana it's not
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.800]  right wing it's not left-wing it's america it is fusing people together in
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.960]  is sexy in hollywood folks I don't care if the people are black white Jewish or
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.480]  Italian I don't care if they're an Irish filmmaker who they are they listen to
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.520]  this show or other shows like it and are hot for liberty because they're not
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.640]  allowed to have it now I'm gonna cover that in a moment John Singleton who's a
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.000]  great director and actor says studios ain't letting black people tell
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.560]  stories unveils two pock biopic plans says so-called liberals are trying to
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.680]  control black people that's the term I coined it so-called liberals 18 years
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.520]  ago they're not liberals I bet money on the barrel head Mr. Singleton's a
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.520]  listener I want somebody to get a hold of him get him on now continuing ladies
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.920]  and gentlemen that's absolutely right and I know I've been there in meetings
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.400]  with directors and all they want to talk about the New World Order and how
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.840]  they're not allowed to talk about it you think they like having to play games
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.080]  and have to deceive everybody and have to play along with the New World Order you
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.360]  think people like that they want freedom everybody wants freedom who's got red
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.560]  blood and that's what unifies us here's the Financial Times of London on this
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:36.920]  line it says Republicans demographically are taking over and that the
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.280]  polls show they're gonna sweep the House the Senate the Governorships the
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.680]  problem is if it's not a libertarian conversion this will just discredit the
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.880]  Republicans I've looked at the numbers and demographically physically the
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:54.680]  Democrats will win and the Republicans will become a minority for whites
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.960]  because they're branding and it's white only and if that conversion works if we
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.880]  let the Democrats branded as racial which it isn't that's why they're doing it
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.000]  they will then win we have to take over the Republican Party now not let it
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.640]  commit suicide it won't be perfect but we need to support the libertarian
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:14.920]  constitutionalist and then we can force the Democrats to come back more towards
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.280]  constitutionalism not towards the right more towards free market and then we
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.080]  can save the country but the Democrats the Socialists and the foreign banks
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.840]  want to fully wreck the country now forever so they can reorganize it with
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.280]  a Marshall plan clowered and piven just like they do in third-world countries
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.760]  or in Eastern Europe Democratic demographic and other factors are
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.280]  against the Grand Ole Party but it's electoral hopes are high and then it
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:44.360]  goes over the facts this is one of the most important battles right now and
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.880]  Obama has blown up in their face big time same things happening in France I'm
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.920]  gonna tell you about that then play the clip of the director singleton about how
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.000]  the Democrats want to have the culture of black people be some pot-billied guy
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.760]  talking in gangster voices you know beating his girlfriend right now at

[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  accurate and then it's your job folks to do something about it the strange
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:04.160]  revival of republican america demographic and other factors are against the
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.760]  grand old party but it's electoral hopes are high toll-free number to join us
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.960]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.680]  ninety two thirty one first-time callers I should throw in today at least in
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.800]  the summer eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one for years people
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.240]  predict the republican parties demise the decline of whites see they let the
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:29.320]  democrats brand them as a white only party when they've been the white
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:35.840]  party the decline of whites as a share of the u.s. population and the spread of
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.880]  tolerant values yes like give me all your bank account such a support for gay
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.440]  marriage would gradually snuff out its appeal that the grand old party has a
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.640]  stubborn way of bouncing back the coming midterm elections in November are
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.080]  unlikely to be an exception all republican field for the next election
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.160]  looks stronger than any other times in 2000 tomorrow may indeed arrive at some
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.320]  point but for the time being today is going pretty well for the republicans
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:08.240]  that's because you could run a ham sandwich or a dead dog up against the
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:14.000]  democrats and it would win if we had real leadership and libertarian ideas
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.640]  let the states decide all the gay marriage business and football issues
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.720]  and abortion and again those are real issues but they use it to pass it back
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.440]  and forth and divert from everything else as Ron Paul says that's a state
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:31.280]  issue and the states are moving of course the ban abortion because that's
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:35.900]  common sense and you stop letting the democrats a bunch of kleptocratic scum
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:42.400]  have the high ground with their race-based politics now shift gears to
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.840]  people that are about 20 years ahead of us when it comes to socialism the
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:51.280]  Frenchies beautiful country great culture amazing art their suicide rates the
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:55.560]  highest in Europe they're an absolute joke things are falling apart French
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.000]  far-right triumphs in local polls that hammer ruling socialist the socialists
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.320]  are exempt from taxes they have Swiss bank accounts nobody gets in trouble
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.880]  they have a hundred plus percent tax on middle class to get rid of the middle
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:13.400]  class of course you're gonna have the 100% tax if the elite is exempt they
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:20.960]  want all your money they want to get rid of their competition they want it you
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.320]  poor so you got a government handout which will mean they can social
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.560]  engineer you so every time there's local elections the extreme right wing that's
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.880]  about as conservative as somebody like John Boehner I mean it's it's I mean over
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:39.280]  there they call total communism total into the family is reasonable anyone that
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.160]  believes men should even be able to tie their shoelaces or be a father as total
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:48.760]  fascist right wing evil and that's how they control the debate but more and
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.280]  more they're winning in local elections because the country is being destroyed
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.960]  under the kleptocratic socialist they're not even socialist France is far-right
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.680]  national front party dealt a major blow to the ruling socialist Sunday after
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.560]  several of its candidates took prime positions in the first round of local
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.560]  elections the main center right opposition UMP party has hailed a big
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.760]  victory as initial estimate showed it came out and triumphed in the elections
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.800]  as president Hollande suffers record unpopularity against a backdrop of near
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.360]  zero growth and high unemployment it doesn't matter because the French
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.280]  many of them don't even know how to work down the cities and they brought in
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.200]  foreigners who will vote for any amount of socialism for welfare that's the
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.640]  socialist cloward and piven model and it's worked quite nicely because they
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.680]  don't care of it wrecks the society because the Rothschilds that run
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:44.160]  France are tax exempt along with the rest of the globalist very simple very
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.280]  very simple ladies and gentlemen how this equation works you I mean what they
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.160]  need is another de Gaulle there who isn't left-wing or right-wing but as a
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.920]  nationalist to create French pride again cut taxes massively promote French
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.400]  having kids and have some pride in yourselves and bring your country back
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:08.120]  watching the French commit suicide is disgusting and watching America adopt an
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:13.280]  anti-French stance because British intelligence took us over completely in
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:18.800]  1947 to have some ancient anti-French enmity when the French helped get this
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.080]  country started just because the British aristocracy does when they're really
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.880]  French to begin with Norman that's Viking French the Vikings conquered France
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.560]  so the Norman are a Viking French derivative I'm Alsatian part Alsatian
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.240]  I mean you know the whole point is this is ridiculous to be anti-French but
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:43.840]  French find your life force again get up don't commit suicide kick the socialist
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.600]  scum out get rid of the French Revolution bringing a real revolution of
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:54.760]  family we'll be back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:21.720]  they actually have that witch at Walmart speaking on telescreens in America. It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:32.120]  scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap those revisions. Women are still worth
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:38.760]  ten points more than men in all age brackets but teenagers now rack up 40
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:47.240]  points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points the big score anyone any
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:57.560]  sex over 75 years old has been up to 100 points as always how fast you move

[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.080]  to al-Qaeda on Monday to step up a media campaign against the West over the
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:53.040]  Crimea crisis as they pump more troops into Crimea and as NATO continues to

[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:35.400]  and beyond with senior NATO officials saying Moscow might even order its
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:41.840]  troops to cross Ukraine to reach Moldova warnings came as Russia was
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.520]  finalizing its takeover Ukrainian military bases of Crimea the peninsula
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.040]  is occupied the start of March it subsequently annexed and they voted to
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:59.760]  do it so here's another one Afghanistan supports Russia's Crimea takeover

[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.520]  congressman had to endure a statement from Afghan president who they installed
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:26.880]  Hamid Karzai that was that was released while they were in Kabul citing the
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.920]  free will the Crimean people Karzai's office said there with respect to the
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.440]  decision of the people of Crimea took through a recent referendum that
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.240]  considers Crimea as part of the Russian Federation to date only Syria and
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:45.080]  Venezuela have taken a similar position well Karzai's been double-crossed they
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:48.640]  clearly blew up his brother the main heroin dealer a few years ago that
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.800]  made him mad and he said that so he came out he said look the US government
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.240]  really runs al-Qaeda they staged the whole deal for opium supply and there's
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.200]  a world government battle going on and we want them out and it's not that I
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.480]  just believe Mohammed Karzai when remember he said that last year that
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.600]  guy's type in Karzai says West behind bombings and behind al-Qaeda well of
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.320]  course they're behind al-Qaeda they're behind them all over they've always been
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:19.760]  behind al-Qaeda that's how they keep all the Muslims in line and us in line oh
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:24.720]  we gotta take your rides al-Qaeda so that's some of the news on that front
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.400]  let me get one more story on the First Amendment issue then we're gonna go
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.720]  right to your calls well into the next hour and I got a bunch of special
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:36.640]  reports and a mass of other news that's breaking as we speak now one of the big
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:40.560]  stories I wanted to get to here is the fact that I've talked a lot about how
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:45.240]  Hollywood isn't Republican they're not Democrat they don't like either one
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.520]  they're sick of those two choices of ice cream one's kind of a fascist old line
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.800]  tyranny the others a fast-growing cancer of total socialism anti-family who want
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.360]  to ban the word bossy and control everything you do and reduce the world's
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:03.960]  population the Democrats are the cutting edge of the globalist social
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:09.160]  engineering takeover so John Singleton echoing what we've heard from many
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:14.720]  others top director says studios ain't letting black people tell stories
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.720]  unveils to pop biopic plans as part of the Hollywood masters interview series
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.720]  the director criticizes so-called liberals that's a quote you know I'm
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.640]  the guy that coined the term so-called liberals just just telling you been
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:33.080]  hearing that for 18 years in the studio and ads you've got a lot of black
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.840]  executives at the studio who are afraid to give their opinion about what black
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:44.280]  culture is and who's the big actors on that homeless security show that
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:49.560]  Mankel had on the show yeah Lennox who said look look it's all socialism to
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.800]  take over destroy America Obama was you know basically you know I was hired to
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.200]  teach him how to act like a president that's why he sounds just like me so they
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:02.600]  want me to play him I won't do it I mean quite frankly I almost wanted to know
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.920]  black people that I know that love socialism and turning their guns in and
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:11.840]  hate the family and all the stuff it is absolutely a force-fed mind control
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:17.840]  operation now there it is report Obama is an actor trained by Harry Lennox by the
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:21.600]  way he called Mankel he said that Hollywood went crazy and folks I don't
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.440]  just know Charlie Sheen I don't just know the Gibson's I don't just know you
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.680]  name it I mean I back when I used to go out to Hollywood and be on TV shows out
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.640]  there I just say no now there's nothing ever gets done out of it you know I'm
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.640]  the Jesse Ventura's birthday party okay meet a bunch of Hollywood people go to
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:43.360]  this I just I haven't been to LA in a couple years Joe Rogan wants me to come
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.560]  out there be on this podcast he's a good friend of mine since 1998 have been
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.200]  gone out and I probably need to though he's come on my show so many times he's
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.560]  kind of like I'm not coming on your show you come on mine yeah and I think
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.360]  that's kind of fair but the point is is that I just get sick when I'm out there
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.400]  is the smog whatever it is I feel weak it's like kryptonite when I go out there
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:06.680]  like I'm Superman I feel great I feel great New York London it's not a big
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:12.760]  city effect I go to LA I literally feel like my soul's being sucked out it's
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.400]  more than physical as I'm flying in I feel it I think Satan must be there
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.320]  or something I don't know folks but I just cannot even enter the area
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.640]  San Francisco I don't get ill in like I like San Francisco and it's got a
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.680]  weird creepy vibe to it at the bottom it's still a beautiful place and has a
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:33.560]  lot of good vibes to it LA brings me to my knees folks I mean literally torture
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:36.760]  would be being incarcerated there I shouldn't put up my fears the point is
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:44.040]  is that I have been let's not exaggerate probably 20 a-list parties over the
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:50.520]  years I mean places where there's 20 30 people in there okay and then I've been
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:56.000]  at probably 20 30 or more dinners where there's top you know producers directors
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.800]  you know top lawyers there and all they talk about is the tyranny of the studio
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:07.120]  heads and these are people right below the studio heads and you know I've told
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:10.080]  the stories about Mark Cuban and stuff getting threatened by the White House and
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.520]  I couldn't talk about it I mentioned it happened but I couldn't tell the whole
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.560]  story later all came out in the Newark Times they are on a very short leash
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.920]  folks and they tell you you're going to make what's cool a giant fat black guy
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.080]  calling women names and running around waving guns around so that young black
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.320]  people will pick that up and the police have been trained to put them in jail
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:36.480]  means that simple because you look like a criminal thug I mean the cops are
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.800]  coming after you it's the same thing we're gonna teach young kids how to be
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.040]  you know all in black cutting themselves hating life hating humanity so they
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.160]  have no life force and die we're gonna force feed Marilyn Manson I mean these
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.600]  are literally manufactured by Sumner Redstone I've been in multiple meetings
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.720]  with people who've been there when the quote mercurial Sumner Redstone is
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:03.800]  literally you know this is a guy who hung from a building while the fire was
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.400]  shooting out for over an hour I mean he's tough he was 80 something in he's
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:13.200]  90 something now total demon goblin okay and the point is but a will to
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.960]  dominate destroy the soul of America and a bunch of other people up there in
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.120]  Hollywood and I've been there with all these big directors man and they are all
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.840]  under the control of the New World Order and and and and it is so frustrating
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.240]  that the American people have no idea we've already won folks we've already
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:38.920]  won but they're all afraid what Mike judge isn't afraid to come on the show
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.960]  and say there's Karen in Hollywood and you better watch it what he says it'll
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.040]  come after him I mean I mean who is there's willing to speak out Billy
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.680]  Corrigan Dave Mustaine it's not like Mike judge I've had a bunch of other
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:56.920]  actors and people on but I mean we're talking about the biggest actors in this
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:01.640]  country the biggest directors in this country our listeners of this show hate
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:07.880]  the New World Order and are awake but they don't want the system coming after
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:14.360]  them well we're gonna lose everything if you don't start going public now I
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.200]  don't know this guy I know whose movies know who he is John Singleton's made
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:23.200]  some really good movies and you know he says it's a bunch of fake liberals trying
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.640]  to totally control what black people can and can't and he's nice and says you
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.200]  know these are some fun movies they're okay but you know we have to do what
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.960]  we're told only put out one type of culture
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.920]  so let's play a clip of that interview and go to your phone calls yeah cuz they
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.160]  want black people to be what they want to be and nobody is is is man enough to
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.720]  go and say that they want black people to be who they want to be as opposed to
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.760]  what they are you know I mean like the black films now so-called black films
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.760]  now are they're great they're great films but they're just product they're not
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:03.200]  moving the bar forward creatively or anything what it's just not like you
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.800]  know you know it's not that you have to say something you have to make an
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.760]  important movie we're in an entertainment business we're in the
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.080]  business where we got as is many butts in the seats and keep people excited on
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:15.720]  Friday Saturday and even come out Sunday to see the picture and even after
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.240]  that they gotta want buy it they gotta want our life you know order it push a
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.040]  button get it but you don't do that unless you can pull someone's emotions in
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:29.440]  like unless you get really specifically unless you're specific culturally to
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.640]  the point that it becomes universal when you try to make it homogenize when you
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.520]  try to make it try to make it appeal to everybody then you don't have anything
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.960]  that's special you know me yeah wasn't it wasn't made for everybody it was made
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:48.160]  for like a young black audience that that buys hip-hop records but I knew that as
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:55.160]  if I got as universal as possible it would cross over and I still hold to
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:58.120]  that kind of thing you know I'm saying like you know Francis called for a
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.840]  couple of was the right person to do the graph up because he had an Italian
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.360]  American back you know Woody Allen his early pictures that he you know that
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:11.400]  that were basically like you know his his Upper East Side Nevis Jewish guy
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.800]  right unless you from that environment you couldn't really totally appreciate
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:20.120]  there you go right basically what it is is a feedback loop where they take one
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:25.420]  stereotype and then push that and then people pick up on that and it stagnates
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:31.120]  culture well what's the stereotype in the cartoons the movies the dramas gun
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:37.880]  owning white men are terrorists who molest children what about that message
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.760]  but see whites won't boycott whites won't get upset when they're being
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:48.920]  demonized so your fair game we're gonna go to break and come back and talk to
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:54.680]  venom Allen Jeff Joey and many others that are patiently holding first-time

[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:08.240]  the way folks Alex Jones here back live I want to be clear I'm not bragging that
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:13.720]  I've been to some Hollywood parties oh I'm so cool I'm saying I absolutely hate it
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:18.800]  I'm telling you though most people there are awake actually but they're under the
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:24.000]  control of just the studio heads and the media heads so the revolution of
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  liberty is very strong and the systems worried about it that's why homeland
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.760]  security targets the libertarians and the quote conspiracy theorist that just
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.680]  means a heretic who questions the matrix the grand architect of the matrix
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.720]  Lucifer were people that don't just buy what mainstream media vomits out we
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:47.520]  don't just repeat it like mother's milk we don't trust it for good reason and
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:52.200]  so there's a huge awakening happening and that's why they want to bring in
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:55.280]  total tyranny because the system can see it's not going to be able to suppress
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:01.400]  things forever so be yourself liberalism is not even what the Democrats are
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.200]  they're a bunch of tyrants but they intimidate most of so-called liberals
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.400]  really aren't even liberals they've got guns yeah they drink raw milk yeah
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.920]  they're for animal rights but they've got guns and they don't really like
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:20.560]  abortion but the media chooses to only cover what they say when it's a talking
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.880]  point to give them coverage they're told what to go out and say to the media
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.720]  they're used to create the illusion and that's what I'm saying and that illusions
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.440]  coming down and the only thing holding it up is our will to speak out and things
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:36.840]  like the Republican leadership that are a bunch of scum they're there sharing
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:39.320]  power with the Democrats the Democrats aren't going to share power with the
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.360]  leadership of that the people are looking for a way to get freedom back but
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:47.120]  it needs to happen to the two parties because they've got a monopoly right now
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:55.240]  and we need to kick the Republican blue bloods out oh there's no future Venom in
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:01.120]  FEMA region 3 what what former state are you in FEMA region 3 Venom can you
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:08.040]  hear me Alex yes Venom what area are you in Venom I'm in Virginia Alex okay go
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:13.800]  ahead I have a couple questions but first I want to start off I really
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.080]  appreciate your show I've been spreading the word with you guys I've been
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.480]  awake since September 11th which is my birthday I had lost a close family
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.080]  member and the first tower that fell and ever since then you know I've been you
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.720]  know pretty much woke up first of all if I'd like to start about the censorship
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.880]  thing that's going on on the internet I've been sharing some of you guys the
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:44.160]  stuff on my page and here recently about two days ago all the stuff I had
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.040]  shared has been censored out you're talking about dumb effort book that's
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:55.440]  what Zuckerberg calls his users yeah dumb dumb effort book I'm not trying to use
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:58.880]  profanity folks that's what he calls anyone that uses it but I mean we still
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.000]  use the enemy platform oh yeah no they've announced anything libertarian
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.280]  or conservative or gun they're gonna start censoring with pleasure well well
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:10.920]  I have a couple other pages on their citizens freedom warriors for justice
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.560]  and stuff like that but I've been sharing too and they've been kind of
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:20.480]  censoring them guys out also with the thing in the UK about the babies to me I
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.880]  think that might be a divergent to the real picture that's going on now the
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.600]  fact that they kidnap kids and sell them into sex slavery yeah for those that
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:32.760]  don't know London telegraph aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals yes
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:37.560]  and and that makes me think back to because see I have a three-year-old son
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:43.040]  now and there was a possibility because of health issues that he was having that
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:47.120]  we might have to abort him and the doctor at that time was trying to talk
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:51.280]  us into it because they didn't think that he was gonna make it well you know
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.920]  something told me not to do it and I don't know if I had a guardian angel at
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:00.800]  that time but now he's like this three-year-old kid who you know is
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:04.840]  running around you know just as healthy as it can be love life so you know I'm
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.000]  kind of glad that I didn't make that decision can you imagine killing that
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.560]  the child now oh man I tell you I look at my son every day you know he actually
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:19.440]  listens and watch watches y'all podcast with me believe it or not what's his name

[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.520]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment frustrated with
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:06.000]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.880]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for Patriots
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.000]  was born by Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside

[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:47.080]  used to maybe organize a co-tester demonstration I've been trying to work
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.320]  on something like that for a while I put yeah I know what they're saying is
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:56.720]  under martial law under a socialist tyranny they're preparing homeland
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.040]  security to cyber attack and try to block they're already doing this the
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.920]  censorship starting they're just testing to see what we'll do right now on their
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.400]  platforms YouTube Facebook you name it we have to stay on those platforms as
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:12.640]  where the people are we can't just give that up to them but yes the that's the
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.040]  big top report that I was just mentioning homeland security exercise
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  targets free Americans against socialist tyranny leaked document reveals
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:27.120]  planned to counter online dissent during martial law I put a website

[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:14.960]  development idiots who literally can hardly talk I mean I talked to Obama
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:20.240]  supporters and MSNBC is always about how smart they are no one is dumber than

[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.600]  happen to have some contacts inside YouTube that are pretty high level and
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:18.440]  said they might want to review this and then they put his channels back up but
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.240]  most people don't have those contacts or the following to complain and so they're
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:26.960]  shutting people down across the board you want to promote the second amendment
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:31.400]  your Facebook's blocked or gone you want to promote liberty you're blocked on
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.680]  YouTube and YouTube can deny it because it's their supermods government mods
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:41.640]  remember Lieberman a few years ago said you wanted to be able to censor things

[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.080]  speech and he'll get it Bloomberg is on Facebook getting the deal done and we
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:10.720]  told you a week before it happened and then it happened that they're getting
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:14.440]  Facebook to not let you promote second amendment stuff people are getting the
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:17.680]  notices I remember Darren McBreen a few years ago but this Facebook got a notice
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.600]  we showed on air saying you know when you talk about politics it upsets people
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:26.040]  you want to get more likes don't do it we don't have to suspend your account but

[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:00.640]  coroners probe we've been talking about this for a year it's accelerating now
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:06.920]  Bloomberg reported it so now it means it's real this mainstream dinosaur
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:12.560]  reported it. Let's talk to Jeff in Kansas Jeff restart your story you got
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:19.760]  cut off by the break. One of my hired men was in Chicago a while back and there
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:25.080]  was a bomb scare that shut down a bridge there and he ended up making a joke
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:30.000]  about it on Facebook he got held up in traffic or something with it and he made
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:36.200]  a joke about it on Facebook and then he was contacted by the FBI and the
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:44.400]  Department of Homeland Security you know he's a real rule-following kid he's
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:49.320]  very obedient and he's scared scared to death well he should be he's living in
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.120]  a tyranny then they have they have loudspeaker announced let's maybe find it
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:57.960]  where TSA says don't make jokes or you'll be arrested next it'll be
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:02.120]  permanently detained they don't say don't make threats or you can be arrested
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:05.920]  they say don't make jokes because they want you to be scared I mean the mayor
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.120]  of Austin when you go in to speak for three minutes he goes now watch your
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:15.000]  mouth I can have you arrested serious criminal charges he wants you to know

[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:31.000]  your analysis on it well I mean it's all make work because FBI's main mission now
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.120]  is not fighting criminals because criminals run the government it's not
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.200]  white collar crime it's it's political crime it's making us the enemy and
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.840]  creating enough reports to go to Congress and say you know look at these

[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:43.680]  poison they have mercury in them but she still tunes into MSNBC and watches
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.800]  real Reverend Al Sharpton's race baiting politics I mean everything is about
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:52.680]  race it's absolutely sickening it seems like Reverend Al Sharpton himself is
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:56.440]  keeping racism alive how could I convince this person that Reverend
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:01.280]  Al Sharpton is simply a pawn in the new world order scheme to help control and
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:06.600]  manipulate black people well I would just point out that you know Al Sharpton
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.400]  doesn't talk about 50 plus percent of blacks never being born I would show her
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:15.760]  quotes from Margaret Sanger but they would take over the liberals to get
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:19.520]  control of blacks I would show her LBJ quotes online about how the Democrats
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:22.480]  were gonna try to become the Republicans and claim they wanted to help blacks
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:26.560]  because they wanted to control them and I would explain to her basic
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:32.320]  domestication and how the system likes to get us dependent and I would just
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:39.160]  explain to her that people like Al Sharpton bottom line have a goal of
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:43.640]  keeping people divided and conquered does that answer your question yes it
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:50.680]  does thank you but I have one more question sure go ahead like a lot of

[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:46.140]  your question earlier today you were talking with the director John Singleton
[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:50.940]  or you played a interview clip of John Singleton and he was talking about
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:54.900]  the gangster killed third-party just being pushed in the black community and
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:25:00.060]  it really is if you turn on BET MTV that's all you see is this gangster
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:04.460]  culture and it's cool that's what people like and people are on Twitter and
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:08.300]  Facebook all day this younger generation and they have no thoughts of their own
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:13.340]  but they repeat it you they repeat it because they think it's cool it's not
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:18.100]  really them that are repeated well first of me a favor just just talk right in
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:22.900]  your telephone it's muffled why do you think that people just repeat what they
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:26.700]  see on TV why don't young people have an opinion of their own why can't they
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:29.260]  arrive at their own well that's because they were set in front of the
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:33.460]  television children are supposed to repeat what their parents teach them or
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:38.300]  or elephants the baby elephant learns from its mommy parents aren't parents
[02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:42.740]  the television is the average child watches eight hours of TV they go to
[02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:47.540]  government training camps the rest of the time so their mommy their daddy is
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:52.780]  telling them how to survive dressed like a gangster be rude to everyone and all
[02:25:52.780 --> 02:25:58.500]  they end up doing is being in prison but their mommy the television told them
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:02.180]  they would end up being winners I mean you know every sitcom out there the
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:06.260]  man's an idiot the mother's the boss well that doesn't create a happy family
[02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:10.940]  the women think I go divorce my husband I get ahead I get to be the boss no you
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:15.340]  just get even more work to do and the state is now your man so it's all been
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:19.940]  scientifically planned to destroy people and so basically any message you're
[02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:23.600]  seeing for mainstream television you should be asking what is it trying to
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:30.660]  sell me and the answer is her you said your children belong to the state I know
[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:34.740]  it's it's over the top tyranny I appreciate your call that's because they
[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:39.660]  think that we're that dumb folks try to talk right into your telephone this
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:43.340]  there's this phenomenon with telephones as well everybody talks like this and I
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:47.820]  can't just put the receiver right up to your mouth Chris in Austin you're on the
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:54.860]  air go ahead hey Alex how's it as a reception oh I'm sorry they were popping
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:59.500]  in my ear to say they had a video ready I'm sorry go ahead okay I miss what you
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:04.180]  said start over go ahead how's the reception it's good I can hear you
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:09.580]  hi I'm calling with Texas marijuana liberty we're fighting tyranny on the
[02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:16.460]  front lines in Austin fighting for medicinal marijuana in Texas now I know
[02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:22.140]  you know how much pot of you smoke today just limited amount additionally though
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:27.460]  yeah and I know my whole issue is I'm for decriminalization but I've seen
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:31.580]  marijuana really turn a lot of people into jellyfish I know it has
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:36.860]  incredible medical usages and I'm for decriminalization I'd like to see it
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:40.420]  decriminalize the problem is under a lot of state laws they're just making you a
[02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:44.900]  war to the state and you're waiving your rights to get medical marijuana so
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:47.940]  it's worse than buying it illegally because the laws that already been
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:50.420]  reduced you understand that the globalist aren't going to push for
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:53.740]  decriminalization unless it's actually something worse do you see what I'm
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:59.740]  saying how do you become a ward of the state well well I mean they make you
[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:03.660]  sign forms in most states to become a medical marijuana user and then you
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:07.620]  wave a lot of your rights you put yourself in a database you basically sign
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:10.700]  up saying you're a drug addict and they can come in your house whenever they
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:15.300]  want when you do it oh yeah well I'm not for that but I'm obviously there's a
[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:19.880]  lot no no I'm for complete across the board decriminalization don't sell it
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:24.340]  to under 21 years of age make it like alcohol right so this is the only way
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:28.380]  that we see it happening in Texas as far as a public awareness campaign you
[02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:32.180]  know similar to what you're doing except with you know for medicinal marijuana
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:37.820]  through the use of YouTube until they try to shut us down you know so and we're
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:43.660]  going to continue to fight through the the internet and we're doing a talk at
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:50.580]  Brave New Books April 25th at 7 p.m. to inform more people because you're
[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:55.940]  aware they already have the tax stamp in Texas correct yes I mean listen I'm
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:29:00.260]  for decriminalization I appreciate your call my holy grail is not
[02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:05.700]  decriminalizing marijuana my holy grail is pointing out that narcotics
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:11.860]  heroin and cocaine and methamphetamine to a lesser extent are shipped into the
[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:16.940]  country by C-130's another aircraft and offloaded at military bases and private
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:20.740]  corporate reservations and then are laundered through the big banks to the
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:24.100]  tune of 500 billion a year that's mainstream news and that it's all a
[02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:28.100]  facade the joke when the cops take somebody to jail for cocaine or something
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:33.460]  when the government shipping it in so I'm against the big banks getting the
[02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:38.020]  drugs making me legal at the end of alcohol prohibition so they could have
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:41.700]  a new business because then it lets them to control organized crime the money
[02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:46.540]  laundering everything that's why I'm for decriminalization I'm not for using
[02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:50.780]  drugs the same big banks are pushing all these drugs on kids in school we're on
[02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:55.340]  the march the prescription drugs they're pushing the prescription drugs Jones and

[02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:56.620]  but for ripping off all the people and knowing the chickens are coming home to
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:00.380]  risk because undoubtedly some are suicides the inquest into the death of
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:04.940]  William Bokesmith 58 a retired Deutsche Bank
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:08.140]  risk executives yeah those are the guys that certify the deals that's who's
[02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:11.580]  mainly dying and who's you certify it for will
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:16.460]  try falling 50 stories that'll get you quiet in his London home in January

[02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:38.060]  if I'm ever up in a big building and I fall off I want all the local cameras
[02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:41.500]  pulled I want the cameras across pulled the news cameras pulled
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:46.140]  I did not commit suicide I was thrown off let's get that clear
[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:51.500]  the suicides were followed by others around the world including JPMorgan in
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:56.460]  Hong Kong as well as Mike Duker the chief economist at Seattle based
[02:42:56.460 --> 02:42:59.660]  Russell Investments Management the financial world's aggressive

[02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:12.220]  being murdered red rum red rum that's murder backwards if you've seen the
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:16.620]  shining at greatest risk are those who have not cultivated
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:20.780]  friendships networks outside of the company said Stuart Black professor of

[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:29.900]  goes into culture client change yeah so so the coroners are probing no
[02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:36.140]  coroners probe murder coroners probe because there might be foul play
[02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:41.020]  if there's a question of that they don't probe because of mental states
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:45.180]  that's a spin article out of boomberg

[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:33.740]  scared of the dead body because that makes it okay what they just done
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:37.180]  they attack a homeless guy with a flashbang and a dog
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:40.860]  shoot him in the back and then shooting more with being back gun
[02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:47.180]  and looks like real firearms 223 and then they go over and step on his
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:52.380]  body he's clearly you know dying and then handcuffing
[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:54.620]  and they could have just done what they did in san francisco where they shoot
[02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:57.020]  the handcuff guy in the back and the bullet bounces back up through his
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:00.940]  body and hits his heart just claim he attacked him
[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:03.980]  but the sick thing is the police chief totally defended this because they
[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:07.740]  quote felt threatened and that's the new thing where police
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:12.220]  are like god you're not god you're being set up to be death squads
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:15.820]  to kill whoever you want because the criminal groups taking the country over
[02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:20.220]  and everyone's horrified by this and and and it's disgusting especially when
[02:55:20.220 --> 02:55:23.500]  they look so excited while they're doing it and the
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:27.740]  police chief says great job police you know not well as tragic this
[02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:29.980]  happened but they felt threatened no it's just oh great job

[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:37.340]  but just just just you know the news media cuts it
[02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:40.860]  when they pull you pull the trigger you don't seem to shot because they don't
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:44.140]  want you to see the rest of the shooting him and the dog
[02:55:44.140 --> 02:55:47.660]  after they've already shot him more they just let the dogs are inviting
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:52.460]  come on anybody oh he moved his arm again shoot him again
[02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:58.780]  you don't like a dog chewing on you boy send in a dog give you run shoot him
[02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:02.700]  in the back and it was like Yosemite Sam has
[02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:06.940]  become the police or something and it's not like they were chasing a killer
[02:56:06.940 --> 02:56:11.180]  it's not like they were going after some super max guy that escaped
[02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:15.980]  or a child molester or something it's just regular all the time it's autistic
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:18.620]  people or old people clearly i've seen the squad
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:21.580]  for videos where some autistic person doesn't know what planet they're on
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:24.380]  they'll kill them get on the ground they don't get on
[02:56:24.380 --> 02:56:27.420]  the ground start beating them tasing them they try to run shoot them
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:31.340]  and the police go that's right we don't kill more we won't
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:34.220]  and i see all these videos where it'll be somebody in a wheelchair get out of
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:36.860]  wheelchair i'm sorry i'm a quadriplegic it's your

[02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:52.540]  a president having to say yes to send letters now
[02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:56.220]  because he knows he's being monitored despite on that's how pathetic this is
[02:56:56.220 --> 02:56:59.420]  and it just continues and nobody gets in trouble
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:03.420]  and they kill 54 million babies nobody gets in trouble

[03:02:28.460 --> 03:02:31.740]  and once we remove one force of medication on the water and the food
[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:35.420]  we can get them all out and we are winning we've already had them uh start
[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:38.780]  banning it as a pesticide we're doing a good job in this
[03:02:38.780 --> 03:02:42.300]  state so i tried two years ago i started uh working locally with my

[03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:08.300]  so about the censorship on the internet i think obviously it's great
[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:10.460]  how it looked out and i don't want to waste time thanking you but you did a
[03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:13.420]  great job for mark but i think the real solution is
[03:03:13.420 --> 03:03:16.860]  we've got to look at the problem it seems like what's what's starting to
[03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:21.020]  happen is they're kind of creating a mainstream media of the internet
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:23.980]  like some of these sites are becoming sort of institutions and really becoming
[03:03:23.980 --> 03:03:27.580]  entrenched and connected with the establishment youtube google
[03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:31.420]  facebook no other people could sue youtube or
[03:03:31.420 --> 03:03:35.180]  did or threaten suits or injunctions the way i have and you'd get contacts
[03:03:35.180 --> 03:03:39.260]  through lawyers uh you have to resist because if we
[03:03:39.260 --> 03:03:43.100]  keep the bigger sites up it defends the other sites i try to defend all of it
[03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:47.020]  and i'm against it well i agree with you but what i'm
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:50.620]  saying is is these sites are getting so so big and having so much influence
[03:03:50.620 --> 03:03:53.660]  and all it takes is going to be bought off and then we have a real problem just
[03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:57.100]  no no i agree it's bad to just have a youtube or a facebook i agree
[03:03:57.100 --> 03:04:02.140]  we should have alternatives and we do yeah i totally agree and like that's why
[03:04:02.140 --> 03:04:05.420]  and i i'm gonna take a response but i myself and push your listeners but
[03:04:05.420 --> 03:04:08.380]  i think it would be smart for guys like you and mark maybe put you know we
