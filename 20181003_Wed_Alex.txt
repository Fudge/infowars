[00:40.560 --> 00:51.720]  place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know I don't know
[00:51.720 --> 00:57.280]  what neighborhood was it and I don't know where's the house I don't know upstairs downstairs
[00:57.280 --> 01:05.240]  where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember and a man's
[01:05.240 --> 01:11.920]  life is in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife is shattered his daughters who are
[01:11.920 --> 01:19.480]  beautiful incredible young kids they destroy people they want to destroy people these are
[01:19.480 --> 01:46.720]  really evil people you know for 10 years I don't know if I never met him but I've been
[01:46.720 --> 01:58.080]  hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh who is like a perfect person who is destined
[01:58.080 --> 02:04.680]  for the Supreme Court I've heard that for a long time and a lot of smart people and
[02:04.680 --> 02:13.000]  first in his class at Yale top top in his class at Yale Law School he's led like a life that's
[02:13.000 --> 02:27.880]  unbelievable he's had no problems they've never taken it's Wednesday October 3rd 2018
[02:27.880 --> 02:33.720]  just 34 days out from the most historic election in world history the global is not just here
[02:33.720 --> 02:39.960]  but across the world are hanging on to power by their fingernails and in many other areas
[02:39.960 --> 02:46.000]  they are being rep free by the tide of liberty and the tide of human awakening and sucked
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.160]  into the black hole of the past and history the ashes that they came from they will become
[02:53.160 --> 02:59.120]  again thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen as we broadcast worldwide this is
[02:59.120 --> 03:07.960]  the most hated most demonized most lied about broadcast in the world vaunted for our action
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.960]  against the globalist thanks to you the listeners the activists the heart and soul of this transmission
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.080]  thank you so much for joining us I'm gonna have open phones yet again today we have some
[03:17.080 --> 03:27.040]  special guests as well but I gotta tell you Christina Blasey Ford story is the most ridiculous
[03:27.040 --> 03:36.320]  deceptive flimsy fiasco that I have ever seen what a spectacle and all the polls show it
[03:36.320 --> 03:42.360]  will be going over those polls it shows even with skewed polls where they sample 10 15
[03:42.360 --> 03:49.480]  20% more Democrats in these polls and they target Democrat voters we're seeing 5 10 point
[03:49.480 --> 03:57.320]  boost in battleground states just the last two weeks why because people hate witch hunts
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.520]  and they know past behaviors the most indicative of future behavior and the and there would
[04:01.520 --> 04:08.160]  be other reports over 36 years of Kavanaugh doing bad things they don't just suddenly
[04:08.160 --> 04:14.640]  pop up days before he's supposed to get confirmed and you got the Democrats sitting on the eggs
[04:14.640 --> 04:21.000]  sitting on these eggs they've laid and then launching them at the last minute so it's
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.800]  all unraveling and of course one big giant Fox News breaking it world exclusive that
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.720]  soros funded activists are running up and down the halls planning to be victims it's
[04:34.720 --> 04:39.400]  even bigger next week she's today we told you that last week now we have her boyfriend
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.160]  and others coming out saying she flies all over the place she's into polygraphs is an
[04:44.160 --> 04:48.760]  expert psi opera on how to get around them well of course is a mind control scientist
[04:48.760 --> 04:55.120]  what do you think she trains the CIA for she's an expert at cheating polygraphs and who gave
[04:55.120 --> 05:02.640]  her the polygraph was it mr. strock from the FBI words cannot describe how big the stakes
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.680]  are for the future of humanity right now info wards is being openly targeted by the democratic
[05:07.680 --> 05:13.360]  party left to see a operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire soros crime
[05:13.360 --> 05:17.080]  syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them because they were already
[05:17.080 --> 05:22.360]  dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future we didn't do this
[05:22.360 --> 05:28.000]  so we've already had incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.440]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if you
[05:32.440 --> 05:37.080]  financially support us if you spread the word about our articles and videos info wars dot
[05:37.080 --> 05:43.600]  com we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scum bags will win we have huge
[05:43.600 --> 05:48.120]  sales and for store dot com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping cart
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.240]  against us shipped out to you despite the fact to kind of walk our commerce and you're right
[05:52.240 --> 05:56.320]  to the market but if you don't stand up and support us financially soros the global Spain
[05:56.320 --> 06:04.440]  win this is info wars darkest hour we your support I'm counting on you waging war on
[06:04.440 --> 06:20.160]  corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:20.160 --> 06:25.520]  we've got republican senators being death threaded the restaurants for they either being
[06:25.520 --> 06:31.040]  threatened with death we don't have people coming up and asking serious questions like
[06:31.040 --> 06:36.920]  I did of Marco Rubio saying hey fight censorship here in America the media said that I assaulted
[06:36.920 --> 06:41.520]  him when I was pretty polite till he got in my face that's not what you see for the democrats
[06:41.520 --> 06:47.240]  they are running up and down the halls yelling screaming calling Mitch McConnell a rapist
[06:47.240 --> 06:55.160]  in the airport and people see this hysterical witch hunt behavior and major polls we're
[06:55.160 --> 07:02.360]  going to be getting to in the shower in key battleground states like michigan like colorada
[07:02.360 --> 07:11.160]  and other areas show five to ten to twelve to fifteen point swings even in democrat pollster
[07:11.160 --> 07:16.240]  companies where they're already adding a larger sample of democrats on average about fifteen
[07:16.240 --> 07:24.200]  percent that means trump is probably really at a sixty five right now of eligible voters
[07:24.200 --> 07:31.880]  that are pulled that is unprecedented going into a midterm election that's why the democrats
[07:31.880 --> 07:38.400]  are panicked like they were with hillary saying ninety eight percent chance she wins secret
[07:38.400 --> 07:47.240]  new york times algorithm total garbage and so they smell defeat but let me tell you thirty
[07:47.240 --> 07:58.440]  four days out you've got rioting the deadly neurotoxin sent to ted cruises houston offices
[07:58.440 --> 08:06.040]  you've had attempts to send it to the white house and attempts to send it to the pentagon
[08:06.040 --> 08:10.240]  and remember there's a big article on info wars dot com by steve Watson we name the anti
[08:10.240 --> 08:15.480]  for groups and professors that pledged you're not safe we're going to get you we're going
[08:15.480 --> 08:27.520]  to get your family we know where you live so they are the ones creating this atmosphere
[08:27.520 --> 08:33.600]  that's how crazy it is thirty four days in and the major anti for groups are pledging
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.440]  led by university professors and others across the country and law enforcement in blue cities
[08:38.440 --> 08:45.360]  that's come out in the source documents to stage violent uprisings if cabin always confirmed
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.640]  and or particularly the big red line is if the republicans hold on to the house of senate
[08:51.640 --> 08:58.520]  and currently i believe you're they're going to have major games you heard that here unless
[08:58.520 --> 09:05.160]  unless we just let them engage in total election fraud and remember what the states reported
[09:05.160 --> 09:12.200]  hillary stolled at least five states and she tried to steal six others and they reported
[09:12.200 --> 09:16.480]  obama's homeland security had computers as they could see the IP addresses breaking into
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.000]  the state computers but at the state level and the county level people were able to block
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.120]  it so it is critical to not have the machines in your area plugged into the internet and
[09:28.120 --> 09:32.000]  to reboot them and wipe them the day of the election because you know sorrow sounds about
[09:32.000 --> 09:43.480]  half the machines in the country now remember last month when this all first broke we reported
[09:43.480 --> 09:51.760]  that christine blasey ford that the main protesters directly work for george soros paul joseph
[09:51.760 --> 09:58.880]  watson article now weeks later it's mainstream news folks i don't just say george soros is
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.880]  behind this or george soros is behind that he's literally behind everything bad every
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.520]  time i look sexualization of kids he's behind it open borders he's behind it bring in radical
[10:10.520 --> 10:16.600]  islam he's behind it pushing weaponized marijuana so strong it puts you into a brain dead coma
[10:16.600 --> 10:22.960]  he's behind it and i'm not for drug war police state i also want you to know that the weaponized
[10:22.960 --> 10:27.440]  marijuana has ruined a lot of lives to the point is whatever it is evil bankrupting countries
[10:27.440 --> 10:33.200]  overthrowing nations sexualizing children the whole revolution to confuse the sex of children
[10:33.200 --> 10:41.080]  soros is a master villain and now it's all over the news fox exclusive the protesters
[10:41.080 --> 10:49.160]  all work for soros of course they do so that we're going to get into that but here's the
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.520]  big news i'm going to cover this when we start the next segment so i have plenty of time
[10:54.520 --> 11:05.120]  we have witnesses to ford not just her boyfriend but others that have come forward that aren't
[11:05.120 --> 11:12.640]  getting any attention saying she loved to fly she is a globe trotter there isn't a second
[11:12.640 --> 11:24.600]  door on her house insane there's a duplex next door it's a duplex but it gets worse that she
[11:24.600 --> 11:34.160]  trained people how to pass polygraphs what do you think stanford psychologist doctors
[11:34.160 --> 11:42.520]  that work in cia funded DARPA programs in false memories and implanting memories that's
[11:42.520 --> 11:52.080]  what she's an expert on her published papers that science fiction stuff oh but then her
[11:52.080 --> 12:02.300]  grandfather father brother brother-in-law all work high-level cia in international banking
[12:02.300 --> 12:10.800]  and wait for it funding covert operations destabilizing foreign nations using dirty tricks
[12:10.800 --> 12:16.320]  we're looking into all of them and it gets better guess what else their specialty is
[12:16.320 --> 12:31.360]  the russia dossier that's right it's like saying it was al capone in the italian mafia
[12:31.360 --> 12:38.840]  or is the or is the last name capone italian or is alex jones wearing a gray shirt they're
[12:38.840 --> 12:44.800]  watching on tv yes and a dark brown sports jacket or is you know does that say info wars
[12:44.800 --> 12:51.640]  dot com behind me this is two plus two equals four in fact it's beyond that it's holding

[12:56.600 --> 13:03.880]  not even two plus two equals four it's this woman is a thoroughbred deep state hillary

[20:46.480 --> 20:50.840]  and they would run the country into the ground and destroy it so that they could feel like
[20:50.840 --> 20:57.760]  they were better than it so it is a real issue of people that are projecting their hatred
[20:57.760 --> 21:04.480]  of themselves on to us that's why the globalist are such trash now the hunchback demons up

[25:27.120 --> 25:34.720]  fate as a liar that's right she traveled to New Zealand over and over again and thought
[25:34.720 --> 25:42.720]  about relocating there was a globalist are taking that over she went to Hawaii she went
[25:42.720 --> 25:50.760]  to all these places recently but now she has fears of wide open places that's why she
[25:50.760 --> 25:57.600]  kayaks in the middle of big lakes that's why she paddle boards it's why she travels we
[25:57.600 --> 26:05.800]  pull this article up show TV viewers all the way from the United States to New Zealand
[26:05.800 --> 26:12.240]  all of this coming out all of this ex-boyfriend of christine Ford says she wasn't afraid of
[26:12.240 --> 26:20.680]  flying or close spaces and it just goes from there so who are the other witnesses it's
[26:20.680 --> 26:27.200]  her it's her record it's her history they tried to expunge her social media they tried
[26:27.200 --> 26:30.800]  to expunge her Stanford record they tried to expunge the reviews but we were able to
[26:30.800 --> 26:36.120]  save a lot of them and turns out she never once talked about fear of open spaces or fear
[26:36.120 --> 26:42.080]  of travel in fact she traveled the world but it turns out she said it's all these articles
[26:42.080 --> 26:50.320]  that New Zealand wasn't far enough away trying to reinvent herself but I'd say she's reinvented
[26:50.320 --> 26:56.880]  herself now as an RU 486 operative writing papers for it trying to stop Kavanaugh who
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.040]  might be against it and she's done quite a job at Stanford other universities working
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.800]  in programs that deal with implanted memories but let me tell you there's not many places
[27:08.800 --> 27:19.000]  you can fly further than to New Zealand what is that a 18 hour flight I mean I guess Bangkok
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.480]  maybe is a little bit further from California maybe the middle of Russia I don't know the
[27:24.480 --> 27:30.200]  point is it's about as far away maybe Antarctica maybe the bottom of the planet that's that's
[27:30.200 --> 27:38.960]  four or five thousand miles further for cupcake maybe the tip of Chile maybe the Horn of Africa
[27:38.960 --> 27:46.200]  I don't know maybe Easter Island so oh it's only 12 hours 50 minutes so I guess it's close
[27:46.200 --> 27:51.200]  well that shows no fear of flying because she remember she couldn't fly that last week
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.560]  because they had to dig up some more professors and it's all professors oh a professor that
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.600]  Kavanaugh no evidence shows ever knew who went to yell with him some other professor
[28:01.600 --> 28:06.360]  says he saw a guy get in his face and Kavanaugh threw ice on him and the guy got arrested
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.240]  who the hell knows if that's even true oh and then these other women their boyfriends
[28:12.240 --> 28:18.120]  and fiancees and people gone public and said that they had to call the police on one of
[28:18.120 --> 28:24.360]  these other women but I know this I've had them in the media and law firms involved in
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.320]  it from the Democrats make up stories about me and you look at you go why did they say
[28:28.320 --> 28:35.240]  such weird stories that make no sense because they think if it's some really weird thing
[28:35.240 --> 28:38.720]  that oh it must be true because you would make something up like that like I'm hopping
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.920]  around the office and swastika shoes and you know saying any Semitic things and all this

[32:01.800 --> 32:07.360]  more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a
[32:07.360 --> 32:12.280]  lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
[32:12.280 --> 32:18.760]  acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH
[32:18.760 --> 32:24.960]  of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[32:24.960 --> 32:30.360]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[32:30.360 --> 32:35.960]  metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
[32:35.960 --> 32:42.560]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored
[32:42.560 --> 32:48.800]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[32:48.800 --> 32:53.960]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[32:53.960 --> 33:03.840]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to
[33:03.840 --> 33:27.720]  the alex jones show i'm no stranger to the rain i'm a friend of thunder friend is it any
[33:27.720 --> 33:40.480]  wonder a lightning strikes me i fought with the devil got down on his level but i never
[33:40.480 --> 33:50.080]  gave in so he gave it for me i tell you when i started talking about jesus more on air
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.760]  now this is a spiritual fight and when i crossed the river con i know about six seven years
[33:54.760 --> 34:01.800]  ago and really wasn't tempted by evil anymore by real evil that's when the world really
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.400]  started coming after me but that's when the doors of the universe began to open up as
[34:06.400 --> 34:12.520]  well my relationship with god got even stronger it's amazing but that's a good old keith whitley
[34:12.520 --> 34:23.240]  that's one of the few guys that give george straighter run for his money and he died young
[34:23.240 --> 34:30.480]  that's a really good song and i fought with the devil got down on his level but i never
[34:30.480 --> 34:37.520]  gave in so he gave up on me that's what you want folks want the devil to give up on you
[34:37.520 --> 34:42.200]  and then you start trying to destroy it because that's when you get close to god that's when
[34:42.200 --> 34:49.480]  god starts to move in to your life when you really start seeing god now let's get back
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.960]  to the evil we're fighting and believe me it's pure evil as you know and it's going to manifest
[34:53.960 --> 35:04.840]  itself become that much more obvious ladies and gentlemen
[35:04.840 --> 35:13.760]  ford is a disgusting creation of the deep state her entire male family are spooks and
[35:13.760 --> 35:20.560]  they're not like army or marine corps soldiers or officers assigned to real operations they're
[35:20.560 --> 35:26.360]  the ones that run our lives they're the ones that control the schools they're the ones
[35:26.360 --> 35:32.280]  that push hollywood to inject the poison into our culture they're the abortion pushers
[35:32.280 --> 35:40.480]  they're the break up the family peddlers they're the transgender promoters they're the plague
[35:40.480 --> 35:49.200]  they're solid death you know i remember reading the john mers society stuff they wrote fifty
[35:49.200 --> 35:56.680]  years ago about globalist world government operatives inside of the intelligence agencies
[35:56.680 --> 36:01.240]  and how they were putting on ugly art and ugly literature and ugly architecture and
[36:01.240 --> 36:08.960]  how they wanted to destroy the family now they wanted to merge us with china and now our government
[36:08.960 --> 36:19.400]  put mouse a tongue in and all of it turned out to be absolutely dead on spot on people
[36:19.400 --> 36:25.240]  ask how i'm so dead on well i had the right foundation because the john mers society was
[36:25.240 --> 36:31.880]  founded by patriots in our government that were aware of what was going on and we're
[36:31.880 --> 36:37.120]  battling what we know is the globalist today and people like buried goldwater came out
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.680]  of the hole awakening ronald reagan was uh... fully aware of the bert society and informed
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.520]  on that and i'm not a member of the john bert society you know my dad gave anti-communist
[36:46.520 --> 36:51.200]  speeches and even hosted a radio show when he was in high school in dallas he'd drive
[36:51.200 --> 36:59.360]  up friday afternoons and tape it was on the wbap but uh... this is what we're dealing
[36:59.360 --> 37:05.440]  with ladies and gentlemen and and it's the real deal and folks need to just get their
[37:05.440 --> 37:10.000]  head screwed on straight and realize that we're facing a world government corporate
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.280]  system that wants a final revolution even over the biology between men and women and
[37:16.280 --> 37:22.320]  to have a total monopoly over reproduction why do you think cobear of the hundreds of
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.760]  times he's attacked me always makes jokes about jones claims are putting stuff in the
[37:26.760 --> 37:35.360]  water because that's their prime operation now you understand that ninety nine percent
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.280]  of people in government are involved in this you understand the president's trying to stop
[37:40.280 --> 37:47.160]  all this and try to release all the suppressed technologies in energy and in health and in
[37:47.160 --> 37:52.480]  other areas of science and they're blocking he can't even get three levels down to do
[37:52.480 --> 38:06.640]  what he says but they made a mistake they made a big mistake they transferred dictatorial
[38:06.640 --> 38:17.960]  powers to the presidency under clinton bush and obama and trump is annihilating them with
[38:17.960 --> 38:25.440]  it right now so he can kill their deals and have it revert back to what it was and just
[38:25.440 --> 38:28.400]  him sticking his foot in the door this is the best analogy i've come up with a long
[38:28.400 --> 38:36.920]  time the globalists were closing that big old giant vault door to seal us in our tombs
[38:36.920 --> 38:44.080]  and laughing at us the whole time while they did it the art type of supervillains bragging
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.040]  is really true i used to watch movies and cartoons and i was a kid with a supervillain's bragging
[38:49.040 --> 38:54.760]  and then like i wouldn't brag about a supervillain but that's in the criminal psychology the globalist
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.720]  write books and brag and tell you what they're gonna do like you're too stupid to even read
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.120]  it or too stupid to stop them now they're not arrogant like that anymore they got those
[39:04.120 --> 39:14.400]  big fat smiles wiped right off their stinking faces but we have their blueprint we have
[39:14.400 --> 39:22.440]  their operation we can stop them and trump has rammed his foot in the big door and it's
[39:22.440 --> 39:27.840]  bleeding and it's smashed and he knows though everybody's gonna be slaves his family us
[39:27.840 --> 39:33.040]  you the prosperity all gone he doesn't like wrecking a good big powerful country when it
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.240]  comes down to he doesn't need to piss on america to feel big and he's sitting over this foot
[39:37.240 --> 39:42.840]  bleeding and smashed and guess what my foot shoved the door to and your foot shoved the
[39:42.840 --> 39:46.960]  door with what you go through at work and church or life for stand up for what's right
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.960]  but it matter everybody better stick their foot in the door and then do something else
[39:51.960 --> 39:58.400]  take your fingers and stick them in there and start pushing and pulling that door open
[39:58.400 --> 40:04.720]  and that's what's starting to happen is that they want to smash those of us that already
[40:04.720 --> 40:07.880]  have our foot in the door but guess what more people's feet are going in the door right
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.440]  now and the cavalry's coming up over the hill and the globalists are in full panic mode
[40:12.440 --> 40:15.840]  I said I get to all these clips I did in this segment next segment I'll get into all of
[40:15.840 --> 40:22.480]  her lying all of her deception and the rest of their official stories of the wheels coming
[40:22.480 --> 40:28.200]  off and I saw the talking points from Swallowswell and Cory Booker and all the rest of them on
[40:28.200 --> 40:31.520]  the news this morning while I was working out and the new talking point is it doesn't
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.600]  matter find investigate Kavanaugh investigate the Ford investigate all of them just now
[40:37.600 --> 40:44.000]  there's too big a cloud just push it off or remove the nominee well they vote them down
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.840]  on friday because Mitch McConnell says that vote's coming they're talking about re nominating
[40:51.840 --> 40:58.460]  him again that's what Lindsey Graham's talking about and then buying more time to let things
[40:58.460 --> 41:05.080]  unravel even more we'll see what unfolds but Graham seems to be committed to Kavanaugh
[41:05.080 --> 41:10.440]  and really angry about the bullying and stuff he's seen so his stocks gone way up in my
[41:10.440 --> 41:16.760]  mind and a lot of experts have said look McCain road heard on him and kept his thumb on him
[41:16.760 --> 41:20.400]  and that Graham could be like Darth Vader you know at the end he can throw the emperor
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.120]  down the mine shaft or down the reactor shaft and that is certainly something we'd like

[48:47.600 --> 48:52.880]  and her boyfriend former boyfriend said she was never afraid of flights and i sat there
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.960]  and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test here it is may i ask dr ford
[48:57.960 --> 49:05.960]  how did you get to washington in a airplane okay it's i asked that because it's been
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.520]  reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because
[49:11.520 --> 49:17.760]  of your fear of flying is that true i was willing i was hoping that they would come
[49:17.760 --> 49:23.560]  to me but then i realized that was an unrealistic request it would have been a quicker trip for
[49:23.560 --> 49:32.920]  me that was certainly what i was hoping was to avoid having to get on an airplane but i
[49:32.920 --> 49:38.720]  eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the
[49:38.720 --> 49:48.640]  plane when you were here in the mid mid atlantic area back in august end of july august how
[49:48.640 --> 49:53.760]  did you get here also by airplane i come here once a year during the summer to visit my

[52:39.960 --> 52:45.800]  the FBI guy on fox we've got the clip he gave her two questions you give someone 20 plus
[52:45.800 --> 52:50.520]  questions if it's a real one and still it's not conclusive 20 plus just to get their
[52:50.520 --> 52:56.320]  reading before you ask the real questions a real polygraph has over 100 questions that's
[52:56.320 --> 53:05.800]  on average but she got to let's continue where she explains why she decided to take a polygraph
[53:05.800 --> 53:11.440]  and now her boyfriend says that he saw her helping train someone on how to pass one here
[53:11.440 --> 53:18.640]  it is based on the advice of the council it was happy to undergo the polygraph test although
[53:18.640 --> 53:26.920]  i found it extremely stressful much longer than i anticipated i told my whole life story
[53:26.920 --> 53:35.600]  i felt like i endured it it was fine i understand they can be that way have you ever taken
[53:35.600 --> 53:42.680]  any other polygraphs in your life never okay you went to see a gentleman by the name of

[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:44.400]  proof that hillary clinton john pedestrian and the dnc are behind the move to ban info
[1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:51.120]  wars and then every other major conservative or libertarian or nationalist or christian
[1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:55.920]  or pro gun or veteran group off the internet it's in the wiki leaks from three years ago
[1:06:55.920 --> 1:07:00.680]  but it's in her statements going back a year and a half ago right through last month where
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:08.120]  she brags how they defined info wars as fake news and russian propaganda to make america
[1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:14.520]  great again and how she got big tech to then ahead of the midterms only 30-something days
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:22.920]  out to ban us this is an admission of racketeering an admission of antitrust an admission of civil
[1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:31.120]  rights violations an admission of big tech corporate democrat run mafia crushing info
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:37.680]  wars and your ability to comment on our articles in our videos we're going to air this piece
[1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:42.000]  right now this is so incredibly important this is a big deal because if they can shut

[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:54.600]  to abandon us so the next person they attack nobody stands up as well they believe they're
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:08:00.480]  breaking your will right now i believe they're waking you up this is what the witch had to
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:05.780]  say herself you cannot make this stuff up and i tell you all of it i could literally
[1:08:05.780 --> 1:08:12.040]  keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable this is coming to
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:23.720]  a theater near you the epidemic the malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:31.200]  social media over the past year it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real world
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:37.120]  consequences the russians in my opinion and based on the intel and counter intel people
[1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:43.440]  i've talked to could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.920]  had been guided and here's a here's a guide by americans guided by americans and so voters
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:55.600]  who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:09:02.040]  their minds what does it mean it's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly
[1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:07.200]  bipartisan legislation is making its way through congress to boost the government's response
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:12.400]  to foreign propaganda and silicon valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:18.800]  threat of fake news there have been a series of studies academic studies since the election
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:24.200]  trying to figure out why people voted the way they did because it defied all the polls
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:33.080]  nobody was ready for it and people relied on what they saw in the media but even more
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:41.400]  so online it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones who claims
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:47.720]  that nine eleven and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs but trump doesn't challenge
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:54.480]  these lies he actually went on jones's show and said your reputation is amazing i will
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:00.200]  not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope we've got a statement now with regard
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:06.480]  to paypal and reports that has ended its relationship with info wars paypal joining the slew of tech
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:12.360]  companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist alex jones hitting his info wars
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:17.440]  where it hurts by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor paypal is the
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:22.240]  latest company to sever ties with jones after youtube apple spotify twitter facebook and
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:28.800]  pinterest social media giants acting this time before it's too late their goal to prevent
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:33.680]  fake news and propaganda from influencing the upcoming us midterm election i'm glad
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:40.400]  that the congress and others are looking at facebook and twitter and google because they
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:46.720]  are the vehicles of one of the very first vehicles to deliver this kind of information
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:53.440]  to people and then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:11:01.040]  allies within the uh internet world like info wars take out pieces and began to say the
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:08.200]  most outrageous outlandish absurd lies you can imagine if something popped up in a facebook
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:16.120]  feed and looked like a news report people were inclined to believe it and if they were already
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:24.840]  targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided uh they were influence
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:29.800] able info wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers the white house and the president
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:34.520]  are citing info wars the real election meddling is by facebook and google and others that are
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:39.240]  shadow banning people that are outright banning people and their blocking conservatives involved
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:43.560]  in their own first amendment political speech shame on the mainstream corporate media for
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:48.000]  not defending the first amendment but instead a tap dogging calling for federal regulators
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:12:01.800]  to shut down independent free press working with big tech
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:11.760]  now i'm going to air a video of oan benjamin breaking down what he says happened to him
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:17.320]  at the hands of matt damon now i did an intro video last night that's not the one i want
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:23.000]  to air i want to air the one specifically with just what he said so people can see this
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:29.920]  for themselves and we're going to be talking to oan benjamin here so again let's uh go
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:36.040]  ahead and go to that club i've i'm finally ready because of the courage of christine
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:46.240]  blasey ford to come forward in such a terrible time to tell my story and i need to be believed
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:55.160]  i was raped by matt damon i don't remember exactly what year but it was right around
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:13:00.120]  when goodwill hunting came out and there is no goodwill when he hunted me and raped me
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:15.240]  amy do you remember me telling you that yeah totally remember yeah oh look a woman she remembers
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:24.600]  do you remember that i said he raped me yeah totally bad damon it's time for the reckoning
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:34.840]  you rape me and now i'm gonna um i want 750 grand article matt damon accused of rape
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:39.200]  and then it goes on to point out that uh this is him illustrating what's what's going on
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:44.000]  with absurdity it's up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com he does hang out in
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:50.520]  his best buddies with a known uh serial rapist and assaulter harry winstein so it has more
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:56.120]  credibility uh he has these associations in his hollywood uh than it does to say this
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:02.360]  is about cabana but you were going to be here in studio today but i heard that matt damon
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:07.000]  sabotage your flight there's no need for due processor proof uh is there oh and benjamin
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:12.440]  uh just because you are accusing a man of something because matt damon is a man uh we've
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:16.960]  got to go ahead and i guess he should ever work again right yeah i mean i was always
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:22.920]  very skeptical of the me too movement because i thought it was a uh a pound symbol so i thought
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:27.840]  it was pound me too which is very confusing but when i saw matt damon on saturday night
[1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:34.560]  live mocking an innocent man i the voice his voice triggered something in me and i i remember
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:40.920]  him raping me i don't know the time or the place uh i remember uh when he was finished
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:47.720]  he said how do you like them apples and that's when i started to weep and um i guess that's
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:55.320]  all the information you really need these days uh to get you know 750 grand and as you saw
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:01.600]  my wife who's half minority she's half hispanic so that gives her even more credibility she's
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:07.800]  a woman and also half not white so it's i think it's a crime to not believe that she's
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.640]  telling the truth that i did well that's what mazy the uh senator in hawaii said she said
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:18.760]  men just sit down and shut up yeah but it's time for me to stand up and tell my story
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:25.160]  that matt damon academy award-winning matt damon gave me the hard r and uh he never apologized
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:31.720]  and he never looked at and he's a big guy he's a big guy you're a little guy i'm uh yeah
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:40.360]  i'm six seven and uh he's about five nine but in my mind he was about nine foot eight
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:44.920]  and uh and that's credible well i appreciate your courage let's talk about what he did
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:51.960]  to you when he we know how you rape a guy we oh this is terrible he got a lot of courage
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:59.520]  right now matt damon's got a lot of explaining to wow the united states of empire is a book
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:04.840]  that claims the united states is the empire of the world george washington had warned

[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:05.520]  are for the future of humanity right now info wars is being openly targeted by the democratic
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:12.200]  party left to CIA operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:15.520]  people say why would you start a fight with them because they were already dominating
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:20.200]  and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:25.800]  so we've already had incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:30.240]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if you
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:36.160]  financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos m4s.com
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:41.440]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags we'll win we have huge
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:46.080]  sales m4store.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:49.400]  stuff shipped out to you despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce and you're
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:53.880]  right to the market but if you don't stand up and support us financially Soros the global
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:20:02.160]  spain win this is info wars darkest hour with your support I'm counting on you you're listening
[1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:04.160]  to the alex jones show
[1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:34.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  all right I love having Owen Benjamin on the show we're the most censored comedians out
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:59.860]  there he's been popping on a lot of listeners loving and he's been watching this whole
[1:20:59.860 --> 1:21:04.920]  cabin off of us go everything Ford says everything these other women say none of the witnesses
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:12.840]  say it happened and then Ford says well she's sick and it's just otherworldly and then she's
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:18.680]  involved in a weird DARPA program to implant memories in people and then she's a globetrotter
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:23.280]  bragging how she's you know and Tahiti or whatever and everywhere else Costa Rica and
[1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:30.680]  then she says I'm free to fly and I was afraid of the polygraph they only gave her two questions
[1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:35.760]  which is not a polygraph maybe like 20 30 40 questions just to warm you up but but but
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:39.960]  getting serious here because it's obviously satire and you're illustrating absurd about
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:44.760]  being absurd we even said it was a joke in the article you know in one paragraph before
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:50.560]  the video people like oh how dare you say this for clickbait we're not doing that we're
[1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:56.600]  putting it out so let's explain I mean Matt Damon really didn't rape you unless you went
[1:21:56.600 --> 1:22:03.920]  and I guess went to this Christine Blasey Ford's class and then she did a hypnosis on you and
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:09.880]  then I guess maybe if you believe that Matt Damon raped you maybe it's true point we're
[1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:14.720]  obviously trying to make there's more evidence that Matt Damon raped me because there isn't
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:22.480]  five people saying that he didn't like if we go by the leftist standard of rape accusation
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:29.320]  equals destroy an honorable man's life Matt Damon is far more guilty than Judge Kavanaugh
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:34.280]  of raping me because I was going to fly down to the studio today as you know and I sat on
[1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:39.880]  a tarmac today because the plane broke for six hours and allegedly Matt Damon broke the
[1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:43.240]  plane because he didn't want the secret out like there's a couple people being like no
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:48.880]  way it's Matt Damon and I'm like oh that is my rapist see anyone can just make this stuff
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:53.920]  up it's it's just it's ridiculous and and we need due process because you can't prove
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:58.160]  a negative I know you've had this Alex and I know I've had this when you're accused of
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:04.000]  something you can't prove you're not something it's a logic inverse that that makes it so
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:08.040]  someone can just have control over you so that's why instead of just in a constant state of
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:14.680]  backpedal I now am just doing the same thing to them except in a way that's obviously sad
[1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:19.400]  tire because I don't want to bear false actual witness you're not actually trying to destroy
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:24.080]  their lives but you're lucky where does Matt Damon as a gremlin he can take on that form
[1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:27.640]  got into the belly of the plane ripped up some of the avionics and things could have
[1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:32.240]  been worse you could have been on the wing of the plane and Damon wanted me to survive
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:35.840]  though because he doesn't want to kill his victims because he likes to know that I get
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:40.360]  triggered every time I hear how you like them apples or even if I use an apple product I
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:44.280]  think about goodwill hunting and of course the vicious rape so it would have been a
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:51.640]  mercy kill if he did take down the plane he knows that seven how was Matt Damon in this
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:58.200]  this dream this false memory that planted as it stand well he's part elephant and he has
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:03.440]  little and and Ben Affleck was there laughing all I remember is the laughter Alex I don't
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:09.200]  remember where it was I just remember that there were stairs and laughter and for that
[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:15.200]  I want 750 grand and any of my other enemies want to talk smack well guess what you were
[1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:21.120]  there too raping away and I want more money and I want you fired too well right she'd
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:27.440]  raise 750,000 as of the day she testified what is it now I heard it was over a million
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:33.800]  I'm sure and her ex-boyfriend just came out I'm sure you saw this where they used to always
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:40.800]  be on prop planes he witnessed her and he swore this he just swore this with fear of
[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:46.240]  perjury that that he witnessed her coaching another woman how to take a lie detector test
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:52.000]  and she got him for bank fraud this this news just came out like late late last night and
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.480]  the mainstream media won't report it like she's a proven liar and that she's not afraid
[1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:00.480]  to fly and it's not only we just have to believe him we have the witnesses of her own saying
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:06.480]  she's a club trotter loves to fly flies to places 16 hours away well yeah and as you
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:11.200]  know the leftist use our own morality and our own sense of honor against us and and
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:17.040]  I'm I'm I'm on to him at this point and I know you are as well that they will just use
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:22.840]  our deference to actual victims that really do need to be heard like the victims of Harvey
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:28.000]  Weinstein for example and they'll use and they'll use that to put us in a state of fear
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:32.360]  and a state of immobility and that is when they just acquire power and if they get total
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:37.920]  power we're in gulags and that's why my role is to fight it with satire like I'll do these
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:42.280]  it's time videos and sudden and jokes and stuff like that and that's good at waking
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:47.840]  people up to the absurdity of it but you know everyone has the role to play but at this
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:53.760]  point more Americans need to shoulder the burden of fighting the leftist globalist
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:59.720]  nonsense is truth everything is power this Machiavellian nightmare that's happening because
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:04.760]  it's easy to beat if you just say what you believe they're really asking this question
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:06.960]  because we're gonna go to break them back and play Mitch McConnell saying they won't
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.880]  be bullied some other clips polls show and I'm gonna get to when we come back that major
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:16.840]  shifts in battleground stage for Republicans for Trump now this somehow just the witch
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:21.400]  shunt went too far and all the witnesses saying it didn't happen and her remembering not the
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:25.880]  house of the year whatever but she had a beer and what they were wearing in the room and
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:29.000]  but she didn't tell anybody and then none of the friends say it's true and then she's
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:34.280]  a globetrotter but a lot about that and then her whole family CIA left us kook balls I
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:40.760]  mean I really think they have gone too far here yeah they've woken up a lot of people
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:46.280]  like I've had just this week a few people that are more higher up in LA that haven't
[1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:50.840]  talked to me in a while like text me how I'm doing and stuff because I think they finally
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:58.160]  saw that appeasement just means you get eaten last and it's a lot harder to dismiss Kavanaugh
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:04.400]  like this centrist Eagle Scout you know Yale guy like the left was trying to prove that
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:09.800]  they can do it to anybody at any time even Mike Pence who never is alone with a woman
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:14.360]  they could do this they could say well a ghost was touched like they they there's they're
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:19.120]  trying to do a power display where no one's safe and that caused a chill there's gonna
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:25.520]  be a red wave 100% there's no way people that I know that aren't never would vote and think
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:30.360]  I'm crazy are like dude we can't let the Democrats take over the house these people are insane
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:36.800]  they've weaponized rape accusations like that's a sacred thing like rape is horrible and it's
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:41.880]  like you can't do this to men because men are naturally protective so we're gonna believe
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:47.760]  women a lot of times and then when you see the obvious you know Feinstein this archaic
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:53.160]  war leech like when you see someone like that in their real motives it makes you just well
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:57.880]  that's it is they are raping the truth and you have this coach saying our team got raped
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:02.680]  by the revs and he gets suspended or fired we're now with they're even raping language
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.200]  Oh well the rape of the language is how the left does it you know they I'm starting to
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.800]  realize the reason that they actually banned to kill a mockingbird my mom teaches literature
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:19.400]  is it's not actually the n-word which the real n-word is no by the way but it's because
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:25.360]  it shows due process it shows what the story of to kill a mockingbird exactly the left
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:29.040]  stay there when we come back we'll talk about this they're at war with due process yeah
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:32.400]  oh yeah because they need power all right actually the professor said while the left
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:37.500]  one is a fan he's a nice white guy trying to be a good guy which is what abolition and
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:42.580]  all that was well you can't have Gregory Peck who was a liberal by the way a classical
[1:28:42.580 --> 1:28:48.240]  liberal you can't have a white guy in a good role that is the new hyper racist garbage
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:52.720]  of the weird white professor saying that it's not minorities saying that we'll be right

[1:32:54.560 --> 1:33:04.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:30.560]  Coming up, I'm going to play a clip of Sarah Sanders
[1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:32.560]  at her press conference just minutes ago,
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:34.560]  pointing out that the Democrats have undermined
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:37.560]  the entire judicial system.
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:39.560]  It's not that the judicial system's perfect,
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:42.560]  or that America's perfect, but the Democrats
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:43.560]  work for globalists.
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:45.560]  They work for Soros, who undermines
[1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:48.560]  and overthrows nation-states to implode them
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:52.560]  to bring in corporate world government.
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:55.560]  So, yes, they are an outside globalist arm.
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:56.560]  Owen Benjamin's our guest.
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:33:58.560]  We're going to get to some of these clips,
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.560]  and it is taking where he thinks things are going.
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:01.560]  I'm going to then give the number out
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:02.560]  and take some of your calls.
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:04.560]  We've got a special report from the leader
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:07.560]  of the restart movement that is one of the main
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:08.560]  opposition groups.
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:09.560]  The MULOS and Iran.
[1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:13.560]  This is going to be a pretty big interview coming up
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:14.560]  that our own Greg Reese did.
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:16.560]  So we're going to play some excerpts of that.
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:18.560]  The interview is now on infowars.com.
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:21.560]  That said, you know, any product we launch
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:23.560]  is pretty darn powerful.
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:26.560]  And I had it earlier, but I took it in the other studio
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:27.560]  here, stayed to shoot a video with it,
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:30.560]  and also took some of it, so it's down here with me.
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:36.560]  But HAPPIES is our newest product at infowarslife.com.
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:41.560]  And it's just a whole bunch of known, concentrated herbs,
[1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:46.560]  ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passion flower herb,
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:50.560]  green tea leaf, licorice root, and more organic concentrated
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:54.560]  that have been proven in major studies to do amazing things.
[1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.560]  They're not suppressants, though.
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:34:58.560]  They just smooth you out.
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:00.560]  I'll start drinking a lot of this myself.
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:03.560]  I tell you, but I want you to try it.
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:06.560]  And so the introductory cost is $22.47.
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:09.560]  Leading competitors are three times the cost of this.
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:12.560]  So even at $44 in normal retail, it's a great deal.
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:15.560]  HAPPIES, mood and stress is our latest product.

[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:48.560]  We also have the Secret 12.
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:52.560]  Very high-quality or organic concentrated vitamin B12.
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:53.560]  You take under the tongue.
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:55.560]  Look at the 97%.
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:59.560]  It has 3,000-plus reviews on power reviews, 4.9 stars.
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:00.560]  Read those reviews.
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.560]  It has been rated by independent third-party labs
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:07.560]  as the top vitamin B12 in the country.
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:11.560]  Secret 12, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:14.560]  It's 40% off right now.
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:15.560]  That's going to have to end the next day or two
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:16.560]  because we're close to selling out of that
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:17.560]  and the BrainForce.
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:21.560]  But we've got plenty that just came in of HAPPIES,
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:23.560]  which is good for adults, good for children.
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:24.560]  You name it.
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:26.560]  It's all-natural.
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:27.560]  It's just concentrated herbs.
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:29.560]  And it is amazing.
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:30.560]  Declare war on stress.
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:33.560]  Have fatigue with Mother Nature's Ultimate Weapons.
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:34.560]  50% off.
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:36.560]  HAPPIES has what you need to support your mood
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.560]  and take on the day.
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.560]  And I think it's great at night as well.
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:41.560]  Again, it doesn't make you tired.
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:44.560]  It does the opposite, but it's not a stimulant.
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:45.560]  It's not a depressant.
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:46.560]  It's amazing.
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:51.560]  So infowarsstore.com or triple 8253-3139.
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:54.560]  I took a bunch of it yesterday when I went home.
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.560]  I took like twice that doesn't recommend it does.
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:58.560]  I was like, are you drunk?
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:36:59.560]  I was like, no, I haven't been drinking.
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:01.560]  He's just, you're in a really good mood.
[1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:03.560]  You're usually kind of grumpy by 10 o'clock at night.
[1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:05.560]  You're back to really silly.
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:07.560]  And I'm just telling you, it's the HAPPIES.
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:09.560]  So everybody's physiology is different.
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:11.560]  This is all mother nature stuff.
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:13.560]  It's how you fund us, get t-shirts, get books.
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:15.560]  The globalists hate it when you fund us.
[1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:18.560]  Now we're going to go back to a very popular national comedian,
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:21.560]  Owen Benjamin, who's one of the most banned comedians out there,
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:23.560]  because he has a line in the sand.
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.560]  And I want to get his take on where he thinks all this ends.
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:29.560]  With the polls I'm going to get to in a moment showing huge surges
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:32.560]  for Republicans in battleground states.
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:34.560]  But the Democrats just can't help themselves.
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:37.560]  They have to execute the corrupt power they have.
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:39.560]  And they just can't help it.
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:41.560]  They can't think a few moves ahead.
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:44.560]  But here's Mitch McConnell, who's been the establishment's buddy.
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:46.560]  He's getting hounded, called a rapist at airports.
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:48.560]  Everybody else is.
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:50.560]  You know, when I hound somebody at an airport,
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:52.560]  I'm like, hey, why don't you move to Venezuela?
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:54.560]  Communism's so good, Bernie Sanders.
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:56.560]  And everybody goes, oh, he's so mean to him.
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:37:58.560]  I was very polite.
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:00.560]  But they're calling him a rapist.
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:02.560]  Rape, rape, rape, rape.
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:04.560]  Chasing him around the media is like, oh, this is a really good thing.
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:06.560]  So here's Mitch McConnell this morning.
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:12.560]  They've tried to bully and intimidate members of this body.
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:16.560]  Republican United States senators.
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:22.560]  They've tried to bully and intimidate us.
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:26.560]  One of our colleagues and his family were effectively run out of a restaurant
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:29.560]  in recent days by these people.
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:36.560]  Another reported having protesters physically block his car door.
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:45.560]  And some have seen organized, far-left protesters camp out at their homes.
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:48.560]  I'm not suggesting we're the victims here, Mr. President,
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:53.560]  but I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  or harassing them at the airports or going to their homes, will not be intimidated by these people.
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:08.560]  There is no chance in the world they're going to scare us out of doing our duty.
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.560]  I don't care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls.
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:23.560]  I want to make one thing perfectly clear, we will not be intimidated by these people.
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:34.560]  This is all part of the organized effort to delay, obstruct, and intimidate,
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:39.560]  including those of us who will be voting this week.
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:41.560]  And he goes on to say the vote will happen on Friday.
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:44.560]  I've got one more clip and we'll get Owen Benjamin's take on that.
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:49.560]  Here is the ACLU that won't defend the First Amendment of Conservatives, Libertarians, and Christians now,
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:54.560]  but they do a shocking video mixing in Bill Clinton,
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.560]  who's a known, admitted sexual predator who's settled a bunch of rape cases,
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:02.560]  and flies around on pedophile aircraft, with Bill Cosby, who is creepy and weird
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:05.560]  and giving women ludes and getting drunk. They're coming to his house.
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:08.560]  I think there's some lynch mob going on here, and I'm not just defending him.
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:11.560]  He's a conservative black guy. I mean, I'm not defending him.
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:14.560]  I think, you know, the jury found him guilty. Okay.
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:17.560]  But I still have some questions. But Kavanaugh, there's no history of this.
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:20.560]  He's not on pedophile airplanes. He's not settling rape cases,
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:23.560]  and then the Democrats defended him over the years.
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:26.560]  So that's why this is such a disgusting piece from the ACLU. Here it is.
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:30.560]  We've seen this before, denials from powerful men.
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:34.560]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:36.560]  I've never seen anything like this.
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:42.560]  I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:48.560]  America is watching, and as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court,
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:52.560]  integrity matters, and we cannot have any doubt.
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:57.560]  Senator Gardner, oppose the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:06.560]  So the ACLU is now against due process and shows a convicted sex abuser,
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:11.560]  basically a rapist that's what he's convicted of, Bill Cosby,
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:14.560]  and then a guy the Democrats defended who settled rape cases
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:16.560]  and hangs around with no pedophiles on airplanes with little kids.
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:20.560]  And so now that's Kavanaugh. So because these guys did something wrong,
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:22.560]  they're now not just for due process.
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:28.560]  Oh, and Benjamin, they are now actually saying if another man
[1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  never did something, it's like saying if a black man did something wrong,
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  all black men are guilty. Here, if a white man did it, all white men.
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.560]  This is the most bigoted, backwards authoritarian thing I've ever heard of.
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:44.560]  Yeah, I mean, they think in demographics. That's how they think.
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:48.560]  They put you in a category and then you have collective guilt
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:50.560]  that you have nothing to do with.
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:55.560]  The good news is, though, the silver lining is it's going to just iron out.
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:58.560]  It's going to get rid of the middle. I call them the zebras.
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:03.560]  Because zebras are striped because the stripes don't look like the Serengeti.
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:05.560]  They're stripes that they can fit in with other zebras.
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:08.560]  So that's why they stay in a pack.
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:11.560]  If you just mark a zebra, a lion will immediately kill them.
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:14.560]  So that's why there's millions of Americans that I call zebras that are just kind in the middle.
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:18.560]  They're like, they think like my grandfather was a lead miner and a Democrat.
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:20.560]  That Democratic Party is gone.
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:25.560]  And this event will make people, this is the lie in the sand
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:27.560]  where someone now tells me they're on the left.
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:29.560]  I'm like, you know what they did to Kavanaugh.
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:33.560]  You know that they're ruining good men with power acquisition.
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:36.560]  It's like you're not, you can't just tow that line anymore.
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:39.560]  You have to make a stance with truth or a stance against it.
[1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:41.560]  That's right. That's the wheat from the chaff.
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:43.560]  We're making a decision right now.
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:46.560]  We're going to come back and get your prediction for the future and more straight ahead.
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:50.560]  The next hour we'll take some calls and we've got a special guest in studio.
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:43:16.560]  Stay with us.
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:22.560]  I mean, that is so pure.
[1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:24.560]  It just goes right into your body when you take it.
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:26.560]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now,
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:31.560]  but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago.
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:32.560]  So I get the price down.
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:34.560]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:35.560]  I'm breaking the contract.
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:37.560]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:39.560]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:43.560]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2.
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:45.560]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:46.560]  It'll be gone a couple of months.
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:51.560]  X2, if you haven't experienced it in FullWarsHore.com, if you have experienced it,

[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:05.560]  FullWarsHore is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party,
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:08.560]  left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department,
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:11.560]  and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[1:45:11.560 --> 1:45:13.560]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:16.560]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:19.560]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:21.560]  So we've already had incredible success.
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:24.560]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is,
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:28.560]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:30.560]  and if you financially support us,
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:34.560]  and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at FullWarsHore.com,
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:39.560]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:42.560]  We have huge sales at FullWarsHore.com right now.
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:46.560]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you,
[1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:50.560]  despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce, and you're right to the market.
[1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:52.560]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:54.560]  Soros and the Globalists may win.
[1:45:54.560 --> 1:46:23.560]  With FullWars Darkest Hour, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:30.560]  It's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter,

[1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:53.560]  at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:57.560]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:26.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:51.560]  Owen Benjamin is our guest, and we are just watching the insane spectacle
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:56.560]  of just weaponized media, and none of the stories adding up,
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:58.560]  and no witnesses, and people saying,
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  I don't fly on airplanes, I'm scared, and they're all over the world.
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:03.560]  And oh, I don't know anything about polygraphs, and they advise people
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:08.560]  how to pass them, and it's like, where does it go from here?
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:11.560]  Where does it go with the corporate media trying to weaponize
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:13.560]  men and women against each other?
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:15.560]  And it's in the WikiLeaks how they want race war,
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:17.560]  and then I've got a clip we'll plan a moment.
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:21.560]  Kanye West is talking to some nobody TMZ reporter,
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:24.560]  and they tell him, take that off your head.
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:26.560]  Like, he's a slave.
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:27.560]  I don't say that because he's black.
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:30.560]  I mean, it's like, I'm saying make America great again.
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:37.560]  The cult-like control over corporate media has just become insane.
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:41.560]  So, Owen Benjamin, where do you think all this ends?
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:44.560]  Well, I think we're seeing the sleeping giant of American patriotism
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:48.560]  waking up finally, and I think the future's bright for people
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:53.560]  that go indie and just do it family style and just keep it going.
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:55.560]  I just self-produced a special.
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:00.560]  You can get it at hugepianist.com, because if Netflix won't have me anymore
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:03.560]  or Comedy Central that I've done two specials with,
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:07.560]  because Susan Rice is on the board of Netflix, it's like, that's cool.
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:11.560]  We still have America, so I shot my own and just put it up,
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  and people can enjoy it, just like you doing independent news.
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:19.560]  And that's what gets me going every day is the puzzle of it.
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:22.560]  Like, how do we get through these monsters?
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:25.560]  And I think they've revealed themselves so intensely now
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:29.560]  that they can't hide behind actual changes
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:32.560]  that you might think need to be made in society.
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:35.560]  Like, they got everything they asked for, plus way more,
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:37.560]  and now they're just going for socialism.
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:40.560]  So, I still think it's the same as what I told you last time.
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:45.560]  I think that there's just going to continuously be a giant cultural divide in America,
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:49.560]  and I think that people are just going to keep moving towards the right.
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:53.560]  That's why they're going to keep trying to import leftist votes.
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:55.560]  Well, you're right.
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  And again, you read about times in history where groups of people
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.560]  just do horribly evil things, and you think, how do they do that?
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  They just get wound up, and a lot of times it's a lenient, powerful system
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:11.560]  or dynasty that liberalizes and empowers the average person
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:15.560]  and then builds up people, but then the corrupt kind of sneak in
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:18.560]  and they get control, and then we're tolerant of corruption,
[1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:21.560]  and then the corruption isn't tolerant of us.
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:24.560]  Yeah, and the corruption starts with the individual,
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:27.560]  and I'm a big history guy, and you saw it with Rome,
[1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:34.560]  where it starts with the individual that forgets about their nation
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:38.560]  and their family and religion and right and wrong,
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:41.560]  and they just start eating all day and stuffing their faces
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:47.560]  and importing slaves and getting the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.
[1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:50.560]  Attila the Hunt, all these guys, they were already just coming in
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:52.560]  because there wasn't good border security in Rome
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:55.560]  because they just kept raising taxes.
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:51:00.560]  It's a story as old as time, but I have faith that America will fight it
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:04.560]  with what we have because we still are a Christian nation
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:07.560]  and we just don't hear about it in the media.
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:09.560]  That's the smartest thing the Left ever did,
[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:11.560]  is they put all the kids in debt from college
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:13.560]  and they just took over the flow of information.
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:17.560]  That's why a small amount of them can make everyone feel like the world's gone crazy,
[1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:22.560]  but as a touring comic, I get to see that people are still good.
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.560]  At least they're still fighting.
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:27.560]  Now you're right, and what are they going to do if they lose the midterms,
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:30.560]  which I think unless their election fraud is massive.
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:32.560]  They're going to lose the midterms.
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:35.560]  We have a group of Newt Gennrich saying that too, we're going to play too.
[1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  So what do they do at that point?
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:41.560]  Just keep escalating because a liar never comes clean.
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:45.560]  Someone like Hillary Clinton, you can see, and we've all known liars in our life,
[1:51:45.560 --> 1:51:49.560]  like pathological liars, not a white lie that you feel bad about and come clean.
[1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:54.560]  They only add to the lie and they will just add to the lie and add to the lie
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:58.560]  until it just becomes just a crazy person in a corner.
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:03.560]  And they don't have as much fundamental power in America as they think.
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  Our military, our police, all of our food, none of this is coming from leftists.
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:12.560]  They have the wizard spells.
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:15.560]  They're changing the definition of words.
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:18.560]  And now they're up to rapists because I was called a Nazi and a white supremacist
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:22.560]  and I was like, how is this possible to use such hyperbole?
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.560]  This is insane. What words are left?
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:26.560]  And now what's left is rapist.
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:29.560]  They would call us pedophiles, but they hold that deer.
[1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:31.560]  They think there's nothing wrong with that.
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:33.560]  So now they're calling everybody a rapist.
[1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:37.560]  They sound like they're on PCP.
[1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:44.560]  Owen Benjamin, I want to play since we mentioned the clip of Kanye West
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:48.560]  and then I've got some other clips since you bring them up that we're going to be getting to here.
[1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:56.560]  But here's Kanye West sitting at some outdoor restaurant with the TMZ people.
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:59.560]  And then there's the disrespect of this reporter.
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:00.560]  No one even knows who he is.
[1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:06.560]  Here's Kanye West, a trailblazer and a guy who sold over a billion dollars of records
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:09.560]  and a guy that just supports bringing America together.
[1:53:09.560 --> 1:53:13.560]  And then the disrespect, like they talking to him like he's a dog.
[1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:16.560]  If I was sitting with some reporter and they said, take that hat off.
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  I tell them, listen, why don't you get your crap and get the hell out of here?
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:25.560]  Just like Kanye said, I was bullied at Saturday Night Live and they cut most of his comedy pieces
[1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:27.560]  and most of his music pieces.
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:31.560]  They put comedy in over his music and basically cut him from the show
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:35.560]  because he wouldn't submit to them and it's not even a scandal.
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:45.560]  And then Kanye West comes out and he plugs Alex Jones and Donald Trump as matrix breakers.
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:49.560]  Days later, they remove that from a whole bunch of newspapers.
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:55.560]  Think of the coordination of corporate news working together to say, we don't want this.
[1:53:55.560 --> 1:53:57.560]  Let's memory hold out of a bunch of newspapers.
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:00.560]  That is unbelievable.
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:06.560]  Yeah. And with Kanye, it's crazy because not only is he a massive star.
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:08.560]  He's a clothing designer.
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:09.560]  He's married to Kim Kardashian.
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:11.560]  He's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  He also has incredible amounts of street cred in the black communities from Chicago.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:19.560]  His debut album, I think it was graduation.
[1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:27.560]  He's rapping with metal in his mouth from an injury that just is falling out of his mouth in his first video.
[1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:35.560]  He was called a genius in Jay-Z albums because he produced all that and they'll take it like that.
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  My picture is painted on the wall of the Hollywood improv.
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:43.560]  I'm painted. An artist next to other great comedians painted me.
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:46.560]  And like that, they can unperson you.
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:50.560]  But the thing about actual alphas is it's okay.
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:53.560]  We'll get mad or we'll get stressed.
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:59.560]  But I think sometimes conflict can either break a man or it can hone you.
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:05.560]  And someone like you, someone like me, someone like Kanye West, it's like Jordan Peterson's another great example.
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:09.560]  Just some like a peeringly meek Canadian professor.
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  And they just thought they could hammer him and bully him and they just created a warrior out of that.
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:23.560]  And we're seeing more and more of that where they don't realize that they can't break everybody.
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:29.560]  And now you've got mainline professors calling for murdering Cabinon, murdering Congress, cutting their desticles off.
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  And the media is like big deal.
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:33.560]  And then I say, Antivus, come into your house to kill you.
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:36.560]  If you're a member of Congress, have your rifle ready by your bed.
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:37.560]  They don't even quote me.
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:40.560]  They just say, Jonestead, use rifles to kill the media.
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.560]  Again, it's like they've just committed to pure lies.
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:48.560]  Oh, yeah. Well, they're now in the pathological state.
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:55.560]  And I've known people like this where, you know, whether it's somebody that's cheating on their girlfriend or boyfriend for a long period of time,
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:56:00.560]  they get to a point when they could just be like, it's nighttime outside.
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:05.560]  And I've known people my whole life like that to a degree where I learn how to deal with it.
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:07.560]  And you can't engage.
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:12.560]  It's almost like a crazy guy in the streets like, you know, my grandmother's in the orange juice on Mars.
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:15.560]  Like you can't be like, no, she's not.
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:23.560]  You literally just have to just grind past it and just hope that like shadows, they just keep going down.
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  You know, we have to fight.
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:31.560]  We can't just do that, that whole conservative attitude where it's like they go low, we go high and ignore it and just keep giving up rights.
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:32.560]  We're not doing that.
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:33.560]  We got to fight.
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:43.560]  But at the same time, the best move is just family, you know, America working hard, like achieving things like the things that make America great,
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:45.560]  which is free speech, right to defend ourselves.
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:53.560]  Like those are the things that we hold tight and keep hammering and just letting the dead wood burn off us by these psychopaths.
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:58.560]  Oh, and Benjamin, thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:56:59.560]  I really appreciate the time.
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:00.560]  It was an honor.
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:01.560]  Honor, my friend.
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:02.560]  You bet.
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:03.560]  You bet.
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:05.560]  And, you know, the good news is humanity is waking up.
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:06.560]  People are getting out of this.
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:07.560]  This transfer.
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:12.560]  And there's so many people from TV and radio and smartphones or whatever, they just, they don't have any memory.
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.560]  It's like they're conscious for like 10 seconds.
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.560]  And I've learned freedom is having a memory.
[1:57:17.560 --> 1:57:19.560]  Yes, it is context, context.
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:21.560]  My mom hates digital watches.
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  She says you need to see where the, where the hands are and where they've been.
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.560]  You know, it's like context is everything and not having moms in the home now is not letting.
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  Oh, let me tell you, I talked to people in 10 seconds later.
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  I don't remember a word I said, and it's scary.
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  You're like, I just talked to you.
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  And I talked to people today five times.
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:41.560]  They remember none of it, none of it.
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  Hey, God bless you.
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:46.560]  Next hour coming up jam patch day with us.
[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:53.560]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:55.560]  heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:58:01.560]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.560]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:12.560]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water,
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:19.560]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance,
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:27.560]  energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:31.560]  So go to infowarstore.com and get supermail vitality before it's gone.

[1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:54.560]  The scientists at infowar's life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.560]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:01.560]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:05.560]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.560]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:17.560]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility,
[1:59:17.560 --> 1:59:20.560]  joint function, immune system and so much more.
[1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:25.560]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients.
[1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:30.560]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:39.560]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:19.560]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide is Alex Jones.
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:01:07.560]  We're back live folks. Thank you for joining us.
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:16.560]  Coming up, we've got a very, very important video that I guess I'll introduce at that time.
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:22.560]  Dealing with the fact that Trump is going to investigate, just like I told you he was going to investigate Big Tech,
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:27.560]  Trump is set to go after in a big way.
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:30.560]  Not just Silicon Valley, but these big mega banks in Silicon Valley.
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:35.560]  They're trying to set up a cashless society that penalized nationalists, conservatives, Christians.
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:37.560]  You name it, they are all big threats to humanity.
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:38.560]  He talked about that.
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:42.560]  He's going to fight globalists and other threats to humanity in a speech he gave.
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:58.560]  So we're going to be going over all of that and we're going to be airing the podcast clips from the story on a website called infowars.com.
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:06.560]  Apple CEO denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones, even though he bragged about it at the time how they made the decision included.
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:11.560]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:20.560]  So get your ducks in a row when you run the slave factories in China and how they all said that when you made the decision from your Sunday call and then they did it.
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:31.560]  And then so it makes him feel powerful as a gulag owner. They always have this vice reporter that makes jokes about George Soros being a Nazi and her eyes are like super far apart.
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:36.560]  And I'm sorry for her if she had fetal infant alcohol damage.
[2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:37.560]  I'm serious.
[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:50.560]  It's what the globalists usually put some sad person who looks like they've got chromosomal damage on television to sit there with Tim Cook so he feels powerful in their presence.
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:58.560]  So we're going to be looking at all of that too coming up here today.
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:05.560]  You know, I'm living in the real world as everybody knows and I'm conscious and I have a memory.
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:08.560]  And I almost sometimes think a memory is a curse.
[2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:19.560]  You know, maybe that's why Christine Blasey Ford works in DARPA funded programs to help erase memories and plant falsehoods.
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:22.560]  Maybe she thinks like that's her area of study because she wants to be happy like she thought.
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:25.560]  I can go to New Zealand. I can erase who I am.
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:28.560]  My students all hate me. I'm this huge liar.
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:31.560]  My ex-boyfriends hate me. My ex-husband hates me.
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:34.560]  You know, I'm running from myself.
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:36.560]  But I've never got on airplanes because I'm so scared.
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:41.560]  You know, it just goes to the complete culture of fraud.
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:57.560]  So I shot a special report that's titled President Trump Set to Investigate Banks or President Trump is Preparing to Investigate Bank Discrimination.
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:05.560]  Or President Trump is Set to Investigate Banks Discriminating Against Conservatives.
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:08.560]  That was the headline when I shot it last night.
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:10.560]  It was the headline this morning.
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  It was the headline an hour ago.
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:14.560]  It was the headline 30 minutes ago.
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:16.560]  It was the headline 10 minutes ago.
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:19.560]  That's going to be the headline when we hear it here in a moment.
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:24.560]  And it's important stuff to you and your family because revelations is a warning.
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:27.560]  You might not want to let this happen.
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:30.560]  You know, God lets us kind of choose our own adventure.
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:33.560]  And I think a lot of these casual systems are in place.
[2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:34.560]  Proposal will be filled.
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:39.560]  But how bad it's going to be, I think is really up to us.
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:41.560]  So we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:43.560]  We're going to air this piece.
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:44.560]  It's very, very important.
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:47.560]  And I suggest everybody pay attention to it.
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:54.560]  NewsWars.com. Tomorrow's News Today.
[2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:21.560]  The fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[2:05:21.560 --> 2:05:27.560]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:32.560]  Infowars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:34.560]  and clinically studied ingredients.
[2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:38.560]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:44.560]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[2:05:44.560 --> 2:05:49.560]  throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[2:05:49.560 --> 2:06:16.560]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:23.560]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones,
[2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:29.560]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[2:06:29.560 --> 2:06:36.560]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:43.560]  To say things like that, the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign
[2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:49.560]  against my campaign to influence voters in the election,
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:51.560]  and then they began to weaponize them.
[2:06:51.560 --> 2:06:59.560]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world,
[2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:04.560]  like infowars, take out pieces, and began to say the most outrageous,
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:07.560]  outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:10.560]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:13.560]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:19.560]  your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:31.560]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:37.560]  Paypal is creating a global monopoly over online purchases and sales.
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:42.560]  Imagine the abuse, the tyranny they can carry out if we don't say no to the system.
[2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:46.560]  Do I think my lawsuit against them is going to save the world? No.
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:51.560]  It's meant to raise an alarm to you, to we the people, and to the president,
[2:07:51.560 --> 2:07:55.560]  who's already taken action against big tech of their censorship.
[2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are the modern Paul Revere's.
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:03.560]  We are raising the alarm, and we are winning when we take action.
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:08.560]  Almost everybody overuses the Hitler Nazi analogies,
[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:12.560]  comparing things to contemporary developments in our society.
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:18.560]  But Hitler went after his political opposition, Jews and many other groups,
[2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:23.560]  and began to cut them out of banking, out of commerce,
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:26.560]  and then out of being able to have shops on the streets.
[2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:33.560]  That started in 1933, by 1937, he had put the Jews and other groups into ghettos.
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:36.560]  And so about a week ago, Paypal said,
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:40.560]  we've been with you 18 years, you've been with us 18 years.
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:43.560]  You sell books, videos, t-shirts, supplements.
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:48.560]  We're not saying you violated our terms of service.
[2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:53.560]  We're saying for moral reasons, because you're a horrible person,
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:56.560]  we're going to break off business with you.
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:05.560]  So let me be crystal clear about why I filed this lawsuit in San Francisco in Paypal's backyard.
[2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:08.560]  I did it to draw attention to what they're doing.
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:11.560]  I did it because it's the right thing to do,
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:16.560]  because we have major banking institutions in Google and Apple moving to China,
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:18.560]  helping suppress their own population.
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:22.560]  We have Google executives and Apple executives going public warning of this.
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:28.560]  This is really a dangerous draconian system where this global cashless society
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:35.560]  that surveils everything we do begins to persecute people for their political views
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:38.560]  and deny them access to the marketplace.
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:40.560]  It's very, very dangerous.
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:45.560]  And I'm doing this because the law firms surrounding the president are part of the swamp,
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:47.560]  and they're scared to do it.
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:49.560]  But I'm not scared to do it.
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:53.560]  We are seeing real bona fide authoritarianism here.
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  So that's my big message to big tech.
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.560]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:01.560]  It's not even about winning this lawsuit.
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:07.560]  It's about drawing attention to what you're doing and making a stand.
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:10.560]  We filed this lawsuit last night and already there's hundreds of articles.
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:15.560]  Alex Jones sued Paypal after import was banned for hate and intolerance.
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:18.560]  That's defamation on its face.
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:22.560]  Even if I was a racist, I deserved to be able to have banking.
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:28.560]  But I support Martin Luther King and the ideas of standing with people for their ideas
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:31.560]  and what they produce and who they are, not what color they are.
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:35.560]  Everyone knows that the KKK and the Nazis hate me.
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:40.560]  So that defamation of them defining me as hate and intolerance
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:44.560]  and blowing me out the political airlock so I can't even engage in commerce
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:46.560]  is incredibly dangerous.
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:49.560]  Here's another headline. Alex Jones' false lawsuit trying to force Paypal
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  to reinstate InfoWars account.
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:58.560]  What we're doing is pointing out that after 18 years of doing business with us,
[2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:03.560]  you are tipping to rape our rights to access to the free market
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:07.560]  and defaming us at the same time with some nebulous term like hate.
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:10.560]  Alex Jones sued Paypal.
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:14.560]  Paypal sued over a block of Alex Jones InfoWars.
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:17.560]  He goes on and on.
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:23.560]  And there's a final article out of the Washington Post that says
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:27.560]  how Alex Jones is poisoning the antitrust debate.
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:30.560]  This was syndicated across the country today.
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:34.560]  You have over 90 big tech companies all in San Francisco
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:38.560]  banning me on every platform you can imagine, even LinkedIn,
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:41.560]  saying I can't even say I'm available for hire.
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:45.560]  Telling me to go to my ghetto and starve to death and die.
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:51.560]  So let me give the arrogant SOBs at the big tech companies
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:54.560]  who make trillions of dollars and are all tax exempt
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:12:00.560]  and run the worst slave factories in China, in Google's case, or Apple's case.
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:05.560]  You won't be so arrogant soon because humanity's waking up to what you've done.
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:08.560]  The inventor of the Internet admits you're an authoritarian threat
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:10.560]  and is developing systems to counter you.
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:13.560]  You thought humanity had submitted to your tyranny.
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:18.560]  We were asleep and now all you've done is awaken the spirit of humanity.
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:19.560]  You've awakened her.
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:23.560]  I'm not being censored because I'm stupid or goofy or fake news.
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:27.560]  I'm being censored, like Tucker Carlson said, because I'm changing the world.
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:30.560]  Thanks to our viewers and our listeners who are taking action.
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:32.560]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:34.560]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:37.560]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:38.560]  Alex Jones.
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:39.560]  His name is Alex Jones.
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:42.560]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:45.560]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:47.560]  Alex Jones is a nut job radio guy.
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:49.560]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:52.560]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:54.560]  if he really believes half of what he says.
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:01.560]  Hate speech. Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:05.560]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:09.560]  1776 will come yet again if you try to take off fire arms.
[2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:11.560]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:13.560]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:19.560]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:21.560]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:22.560]  Dane.
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true.
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:27.560]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S. government,
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:29.560]  saying that they stage attacks.
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:32.560]  They allow them to occur in the United States against U.S. citizens.
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:33.560]  Let's declassify.
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:34.560]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:37.560]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:38.560]  That man threatened this country.
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:40.560]  He is a conspiracy theorist.
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:41.560]  Deeply, I think racist.
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:43.560]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:45.560]  Considered legitimate on the crazy.
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:47.560]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match.
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:51.560]  Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him.
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:54.560]  I'd love to see that in uniform.
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:58.560]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:00.560]  I like that, guys.
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:16.560]  That is the best.
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:18.560]  We have gangsters running this country.
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:20.560]  Criminals, gangsters.
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:25.560]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[2:14:25.560 --> 2:14:29.560]  We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:31.560]  The globalists are going to blow stuff out of the land on you.
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:33.560]  Well, Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:37.560]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now an un-old,
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:39.560]  in-triplicate spade.
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:40.560]  This is real as it is.
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:44.560]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:45.560]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:49.560]  You're out of there.
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:50.560]  You want it, baby?
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:59.560]  You're about to get it.
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:04.560]  We just meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant,
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:07.560]  and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:12.560]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:17.560]  Info wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation,
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:22.560]  blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:24.560]  out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.560]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women,
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:33.560]  no, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:36.560]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us,
[2:15:36.560 --> 2:15:39.560]  when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us,
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:43.560]  when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.

[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:27.360]  Healthcare reform is confusing,

[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:30.640]  keeping your doctor,
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:32.780]  or being able to afford needed prescriptions,

[2:16:56.600 --> 2:16:58.720]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:01.960]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:28.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:30.360]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:31.900]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:17:31.900 --> 2:17:33.160]  I beat the IRS then,
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:34.860]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:36.560]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:38.760]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:40.360]  they thought might never be solved.

[2:20:09.240 --> 2:20:11.240]  And he can suck my f***ing f***ing.
[2:20:11.240 --> 2:20:14.240]  He's a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt.

[2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:18.240]  and give him a Louisville slugger.
[2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:20.240]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:24.240]  Kiss my mother f***ing ass, you bitch, punk, f***ing sucker.

[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:39.240]  Die!
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:41.240]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun,
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:44.240]  the image of President Donald Trump projected on a white bloater,
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:46.240]  our teacher Pale Modi has now been seen
[2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:48.240]  by countless viewers across the internet.
[2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:52.240]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot
[2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:55.240]  about blowing up the White House.
[2:20:55.240 --> 2:20:58.240]  It's an actor dressed to look just like
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:02.240]  President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:05.240]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin

[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:11.240]  are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:14.240]  A rhetoric that has inspired the violence
[2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:17.240]  has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[2:21:17.240 --> 2:21:19.240]  They're involved in the coup,
[2:21:19.240 --> 2:21:29.240]  an active attempt to start a bloody, civil war.
[2:21:49.240 --> 2:22:05.240]  All right, folks, so we're back live.
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:10.240]  Old CEO of Apple that owns the worst
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:12.240]  and runs the worst factories in China
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:14.240]  and who pays zero global tax
[2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:16.240]  and pays no tax in China.
[2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:19.240]  Who's batted against America, but it's okay because he's gay.
[2:22:19.240 --> 2:22:22.240]  See, he frances around, so it's okay.
[2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:26.240]  Bloodthirsty, soulless vampire Tim Cook,
[2:22:26.240 --> 2:22:29.240]  Apple's CEO denies colluding with tech giants
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:31.240]  to ban Alex Jones.
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:33.240]  I've never had any conversation about this
[2:22:33.240 --> 2:22:36.240]  with any tech company.
[2:22:36.240 --> 2:22:39.240]  He told that to the wall-eyed flounder
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:43.240]  from the pro-petaphilia vice channel.
[2:22:43.240 --> 2:22:46.240]  They have a bunch of shows on vice on HBO
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:48.240]  about how great pedophilia is.
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:50.240]  Just wait until they grab your kid out of the backyard.
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:52.240]  It's really great there.
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:54.240]  But Apple's CEO denies colluding with tech giants
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:56.240]  to ban Alex Jones.
[2:22:56.240 --> 2:22:58.240]  I've never had any conversation about this
[2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:00.240]  with any tech company.
[2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:03.240]  Well, really, I can pull up congressional hearings.
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:05.240]  I can pull up the New York Times.
[2:23:05.240 --> 2:23:07.240]  I can pull up the Washington Post.
[2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:09.240]  I can pull up BuzzFeed just three weeks ago.
[2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:11.240]  Tech giants meet in secret at Twitter
[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:14.240]  to discuss how to handle the midterms.
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:21.240]  So there it is on screen for you right there.
[2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:23.240]  And they're so proud of it.
[2:23:23.240 --> 2:23:26.240]  And they all work in concert where Apple and Google
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:29.240]  and Facebook, when they banned me,
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:32.240]  they will all release giant articles
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:35.240]  written days before on the exact minute.
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:39.240]  AP Reuters, USA Today, BuzzFeed, all of it,
[2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:42.240]  will all be at 447.
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:44.240]  They all release the article.
[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:46.240]  Every time, it's at the same minute.
[2:23:46.240 --> 2:23:48.240]  Maybe in the morning, maybe in the evening,
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:50.240]  but it's all the same minute.
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:52.240]  They all get together and they all come up with their story.
[2:23:52.240 --> 2:23:55.240]  Racist evil Nazi demon that hates America.
[2:23:55.240 --> 2:23:57.240]  You know, blah, blah, blah.
[2:23:57.240 --> 2:23:59.240]  And then they release the fraud in unison.
[2:23:59.240 --> 2:24:05.240]  Oh, but Tim Cook, he's never heard of this in his life.
[2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:08.240]  And he was being interviewed by the...
[2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:10.240]  Because these globalists love to have someone
[2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:12.240]  that appears to be mentally deficient interviewing
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:14.240]  and makes them feel more powerful.
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:16.240]  That's like a deformed jester in the old days.
[2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:18.240]  That's what they always do.
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:20.240]  So they have this flounder that's been living
[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:25.240]  in a nuclear weapons reactor cooling tank interviewing him.
[2:24:25.240 --> 2:24:30.240]  Apple CEO colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:32.240]  I've never even had a conversation about this
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:34.240]  when he tech company.
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:36.240]  Oh, yes, in Google and Facebook and all you,
[2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:38.240]  you don't censor anybody either.
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:40.240]  Even though Apple admits they've given all your Apple IDs
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:42.240]  to the Chinese communist government.
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:46.240]  I mean, what a lying pig.
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:48.240]  So the article's up on infowars.com.
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:50.240]  Hey, great headline, Apple CEO denies.
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:53.240]  How about Apple CEO lies through his teeth?
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:55.240]  Says no colluding by tech giants.
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:24:56.240]  Yeah, right.
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:24:58.240]  Well, let's get that any trust lawsuits going
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:00.240]  and let's get all your records.
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:02.240]  Just like Google says, oh, we don't censor.
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:04.240]  They just said the day after Hillary lost.
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:07.240]  We're going to make sure this never happens again.
[2:25:07.240 --> 2:25:11.240]  And it's in all the WikiLeaks.
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:15.240]  What a monster.
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:17.240]  So let's go ahead.
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:19.240]  Tim Cook helps censor in China.
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:21.240]  And Google helps censor in China.
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:23.240]  Political dissidents, let's go ahead and hear him
[2:25:23.240 --> 2:25:25.240]  sit there and tell you how much,
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:27.240]  how much he's never colluded with anybody.
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:28.240]  Here it is.
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:31.240]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:34.240]  Users want from us and what we've always provided them
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:36.240]  is a curated platform.
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:38.240]  We don't take a political stand.
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:40.240]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:43.240]  You can tell that from the stuff on the app store
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:45.240]  and in podcasts, et cetera.
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:49.240]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:51.240]  But at what point were you like, OK, that's it.
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:53.240]  Alex Jones has to go.
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:55.240]  You know, we get into a singular kind of event,
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:25:58.240]  but I think there's enough there
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:01.240]  that reasonable people could agree
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.240]  that if you're going to curate,
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:06.240]  that that should be all.
[2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:08.240]  Did you coordinate with other tech companies
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:09.240]  to kick off Alex Jones?
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:10.240]  No.
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:12.240]  I've never even had a conversation about this
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:13.240]  with any tech company.
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:14.240]  Why not?
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:16.240]  We make our decisions independently.
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:19.240]  And I think that's important.
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:22.240]  What a lion's sack of crap.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:26.240]  They admitted that they had their little Sunday meeting
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:28.240]  and talked to other tech.
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:30.240]  That came out in the news at the time
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:33.240]  and that he led the charge to do that.
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:34.240]  Oh, but he curates.
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:36.240]  Kind of like Hitler was curating in England
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:37.240]  or maybe the communists.
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:40.240]  Stalin was curating in Russia.
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:43.240]  You know, just curating.
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:45.240]  Oh, you're just curating in China
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:46.240]  with the worst factories over there
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:49.240]  and the suicide nets and the forced drugging
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:52.240]  and trying to replace humans with robots.
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:54.240]  You're just curating when you defend the communist regime
[2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:56.240]  that sells political dissidents organs.
[2:26:56.240 --> 2:27:00.240]  Because you're the big, high and mighty Tim Cook.
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:02.240]  You're not involved in anything political.
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:03.240]  Oh, no.
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:05.240]  Apple doesn't give almost all its money
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:07.240]  to the Democratic Party and other socialist parties
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:09.240]  around the world while your tax exempt
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:12.240]  and big rich trillionaire pigs, your company.
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:14.240]  You're a total versus signaling,
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:19.240]  gigantic, galactic-sized fraud.
[2:27:19.240 --> 2:27:21.240]  And you think you've defeated humanity,
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:22.240]  but you haven't.
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:24.240]  And you think by demonizing me,
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:26.240]  you build the straw man for the first time
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:27.240]  in order to take free speech
[2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:29.240]  and then shut everybody else down,
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:32.240]  but you have miserably failed.
[2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:34.240]  Now they're trying to take away our processing
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:38.240]  and I've sued PayPal over it.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:39.240]  And I didn't sue PayPal
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:41.240]  because we need them as a process server
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:45.240]  or as a group to process the orders.
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:47.240]  I did it because they're going to move on
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:48.240]  to all the others which they've done
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:50.240]  and it's going to be a casual society like China
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:52.240]  where if you're not a good little globalist,
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:53.240]  you can't buy or sell.
[2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:54.240]  So I did it for everybody to draw attention
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:55.240]  to the president
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:57.240]  which I know is getting ready to take action.
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:00.240]  So that's what I did was to point out
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:02.240]  what you're doing to conservatives and Christians
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:03.240]  and others.
[2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:05.240]  So they banned us on Apple.
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:07.240]  You still get the Android app free
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:08.240]  at infowars.com.
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:09.240]  And the power of you,
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:10.240]  the listener spread the word,
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:11.240]  hey, your friends and family,
[2:28:11.240 --> 2:28:14.240]  if you've got an Android or a device that isn't Apple,
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:15.240]  get it.
[2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:17.240]  Whatever you do, go to infowars.com.

[2:28:49.240 --> 2:29:18.240]  We'll be back with a real patriot.

[2:31:00.240 --> 2:31:02.240]  it's just as important to make sure your kids
[2:31:02.240 --> 2:31:04.240]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:08.240]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula

[2:32:58.240 --> 2:33:02.240]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:02.240 --> 2:33:04.240]  The Alex Jones Show
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:06.240]  because there is a war on
[2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:35.240]  for your mind.
[2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:37.240]  I just went on during the break
[2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:38.240]  and I said to Tommy,
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:39.240]  I said, listen,
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:41.240]  you need to talk about yourself,
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:43.240]  because you can't get him to do it.
[2:33:43.240 --> 2:33:45.240]  And if they made a movie
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:47.240]  about Tommy Robinson,
[2:33:47.240 --> 2:33:49.240]  because I remember hearing about him
[2:33:49.240 --> 2:33:50.240]  like 12 years ago,
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:51.240]  this guy exposing rape gangs,
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:52.240]  English Defense League.
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:53.240]  He's a racist.
[2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:54.240]  He wasn't.
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:55.240]  They brought in racists.
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:33:56.240]  He left the league.
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:33:57.240]  He works for the Sikhs and others.
[2:33:57.240 --> 2:33:58.240]  You don't have Sikhs.
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:33:59.240]  And I know the statistics.
[2:33:59.240 --> 2:34:01.240]  One of the lowest crime rates in the world.
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:03.240]  They got formed hundreds of years ago
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:05.240]  because the Islamists was trying to kill them in India.
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:07.240]  The Hindus, they're not doing anything.
[2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:09.240]  I mean, okay, Hindus are kind of like Texans.
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:11.240]  Maybe they don't pay their income tax,
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:13.240]  but that's about it.
[2:34:13.240 --> 2:34:15.240]  So, yeah, but, you know,
[2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:17.240]  it's not even about the genetics.
[2:34:17.240 --> 2:34:19.240]  A lot of these Arabs have similar genetics
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:21.240]  to Sikhs or people in India.
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:23.240]  It's the culture.
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:24.240]  It's what Mohammed did.
[2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:26.240]  Does that mean I want to have war with Islam?
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:28.240]  No, but they've got 1.8 billion people.
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:30.240]  They're about to be 3 billion middle of the next decade.
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:32.240]  The globalists have made their bet on them
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:34.240]  that they'll plan to repopulate Europe with Islamists.
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:36.240]  And then we're supposed to just die
[2:34:36.240 --> 2:34:38.240]  and give ourselves over.
[2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:40.240]  So, Tommy, I want to get back into what's happening.
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:41.240]  You've already proven it.
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:43.240]  I know you just can't be stopped to warn about
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:45.240]  the girls being raped and kidnapping
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:47.240]  because you've got a bunch of children on them
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:49.240]  and they've been threatened with ass attack.
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:50.240]  You don't want to get into that.
[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:53.240]  But talk about just what you've been through
[2:34:53.240 --> 2:34:55.240]  in like a five-minute gestalt.
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:34:57.240]  How it began the year in prison,
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:34:59.240]  taking your house,
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:01.240]  the three months, losing all the weight,
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:03.240]  then putting you by the mosque in the jail,
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:05.240]  then throwing feces on you.
[2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:07.240]  And then, again, now you've got a court date.
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:09.240]  I don't know what you can get into on air.
[2:35:09.240 --> 2:35:11.240]  I know the inside baseball.
[2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:13.240]  They're wanting you to say certain things
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:14.240]  and they might send you back.
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:16.240]  So, I want you to be very careful here
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:17.240]  because the world's listening.
[2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:18.240]  They admire you.
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:21.240]  They support you because you are the real deal.
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:23.240]  But we need to focus on Tommy.
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:24.240]  Tommy.
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:25.240]  Tommy.
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:27.240]  Tommy Robinson online.
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:28.240]  Tommy Robinson.online.
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:29.240]  Twitter.
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:31.240]  For now, are they banning you there yet?
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:32.240]  Tee, Robinson, New Era?
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:33.240]  I'm gone, mate.
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:34.240]  I'm banned off Twitter.
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:35.240]  That's right.
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:36.240]  So, we can't go there.
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:38.240]  Where are the best places to contact you first?
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:39.240]  Because everybody's getting first.
[2:35:39.240 --> 2:35:40.240]  So, I've been here.
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:41.240]  And then talk about yourself.
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:43.240]  Talk about yourself.
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:47.240]  So, from when I first started activism,
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:50.240]  within the first six months,
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:52.240]  my house and my parents' houses
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:55.240]  were raided by the police three times.
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:35:57.240]  This become a common thing
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:35:59.240]  over the years that continues.
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:00.240]  Go back to the town.
[2:36:00.240 --> 2:36:02.240]  What you were witnessing.
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:05.240]  So, we were holding demonstrations
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:07.240]  and we were highlighting these issues.
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:10.240]  Now, the same police force that just imprisoned me
[2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:12.240]  outside the court case in Leeds.
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:13.240]  When we first started,
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:16.240]  I'd organized a demonstration in that police force.
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:18.240]  South Yorkshire Police Force
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:20.240]  is the police force that's come out
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:23.240]  and been proven as hiding all of these problems.
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:25.240]  Now, when I first come to their borough...
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:27.240]  Did it turn out in a lot of departments
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:30.240]  some of the leading cops are involved in the pimping?
[2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:33.240]  Some of the leading cops were by the Muslim police officer
[2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:35.240]  who was actually killed in an accident
[2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:37.240]  who was part of it.
[2:36:37.240 --> 2:36:40.240]  We've seen in this South Yorkshire area,
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:42.240]  I organized a demonstration to come
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:44.240]  and talk about these issues.
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:47.240]  But at the time, these issues were not exposed.
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:50.240]  And the police, as a result of that,
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:52.240]  arrested me at the airport,
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:54.240]  raided my wife's house with machine guns,
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:56.240]  raided my mum and dad's house,
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:36:58.240]  put me on full charges that meant
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:02.240]  I couldn't associate with the organisation I formed,
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:04.240]  but again, my bail conditions made sure
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:06.240]  I couldn't enter their entire area.
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:09.240]  So they prevented me from holding a demonstration,
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:11.240]  they prevented me from talking about these issues.
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:14.240]  Once the day had gone past of our demonstration,
[2:37:14.240 --> 2:37:16.240]  they just dropped all the charges.
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:18.240]  I actually have it from ten years ago
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.240]  in black and white writing
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:23.240]  from an independent police investigation
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.240]  where I put in a complaint
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:27.240]  that the police accepted what they'd done
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:29.240]  was politically motivated.
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:31.240]  They accepted the reason they'd done it
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:33.240]  was to silence me.
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:35.240]  And they sent their police officers on training courses.
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:37.240]  So you were politically persecuted.
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:39.240]  Fast forward to your year in prison,
[2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:41.240]  your three months, and now what you're facing.
[2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:43.240]  Because you may be thrown back in.
[2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:45.240]  Yes, fast forward to...
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:47.240]  So that has been a common theme over ten years.
[2:37:47.240 --> 2:37:49.240]  If we get to the most recent case,
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:51.240]  the most recent case, I went to
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:53.240]  the city of Leeds.
[2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:55.240]  In fact, I still have to be careful now
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:37:57.240]  because there's still condition
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:37:59.240]  on this case.
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:01.240]  Basically, when I went there,
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:03.240]  there's a court trial going on
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:05.240]  involving 31 people.
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:07.240]  Now,
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:09.240]  all the information I'm about to tell you now,
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:11.240]  which is the whole reason why
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:13.240]  I'm still arguing my innocence,
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:15.240]  all this information is in the public domain.
[2:38:15.240 --> 2:38:17.240]  Now, when you read the law,
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:19.240]  the law clearly states a judge
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:21.240]  has no power to put
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:23.240]  reporting restrictions on any information
[2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:25.240]  that's already in the public domain.
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:27.240]  Now, what we've witnessed on the last
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:29.240]  six or seven big Muslim
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:31.240]  rape trials,
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:33.240]  that these reporting restrictions
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:35.240]  are put in place at the very start.
[2:38:35.240 --> 2:38:37.240]  And they state
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:39.240]  that there can be no reporting on this
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:41.240]  case whatsoever.
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:43.240]  And so then,
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:45.240]  if there was reporting,
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:47.240]  then you'd be getting the details
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:49.240]  of what the men said to the girls,
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:51.240]  the comments they made,
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:53.240]  and the horrific abuse that these children
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:55.240]  have suffered.
[2:38:55.240 --> 2:38:57.240]  Including even mainstream news admits
[2:38:57.240 --> 2:38:59.240]  a lot of dead girls.
[2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:01.240]  Yeah, plenty of dead girls.
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:03.240]  Plenty of dead girls.
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:05.240]  Plenty of girls who have never been found.
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:07.240]  Their bodies have just never been found.
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:09.240]  And let's be clear, we're hearing about Brett Kavanaugh
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:11.240]  with no witnesses,
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:13.240]  36 years ago, jumping on a girl at a party.
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:15.240]  And the same scumbag
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:17.240]  leftist media here covers up
[2:39:17.240 --> 2:39:19.240]  all the crap going on here
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:21.240]  against women. And again, I'm sick of people claiming
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:23.240]  they care about women. I have a wife, I have three daughters.
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:25.240]  I particularly care about
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:27.240]  women as an instinctive level, and it enrages me
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:29.240]  to watch the left
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:31.240]  and their obsession with abusing women
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:33.240]  and defending radical Islam.
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:35.240]  Well, and their obsession
[2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:37.240]  with the Me Too movement,
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:39.240]  when I hear
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:41.240]  so many comments about someone said something
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:43.240]  sexist or a massive deal
[2:39:43.240 --> 2:39:45.240]  made out of the fact that someone made a comment.
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:47.240]  And I think
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:49.240]  we've got children dying,
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:51.240]  children missing,
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:53.240]  being raped by their thousands
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:55.240]  in every single town and city.
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:57.240]  And you're silent.
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:39:59.240]  And you're not just silent,
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:01.240]  but you actually go out of your way.
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:03.240]  Journalists in this country,
[2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:05.240]  not one of them have challenged
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:07.240]  these reporting restrictions.
[2:40:07.240 --> 2:40:09.240]  So these restrictions are put in place,
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:11.240]  so you can have a trial that lasts two months
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:13.240]  and you will not hear anything.
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:15.240]  And then when the trial finishes,
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:17.240]  they'll lift the reporting restriction
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:19.240]  and you'll get one day of news.
[2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:21.240]  30 men have been convicted
[2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:23.240]  for raping young girls.
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:25.240]  That's it. You won't hear the details.
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:27.240]  You won't hear the ins and outs
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:29.240]  for every other...
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:31.240]  Why does the left cover up for Islam
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:33.240]  from Sweden to England to the US
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:35.240]  and the mass raping and killing of women?
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:37.240]  The whole thing of radical Islam
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:39.240]  and its orthodoxy is enslaving women
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:41.240]  and human. That's a fact.
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:43.240]  Why is the left in love
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:45.240]  with the true satanic patriarchy?
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:49.240]  Well, many of the time,
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:51.240]  as we've heard from the previous journalists
[2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:53.240]  who knew this was happening,
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:55.240]  Andrew Norfolk,
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:57.240]  they only acted when he saw
[2:40:57.240 --> 2:40:59.240]  that the far right or the working class
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:01.240]  were making an issue out of it.
[2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:03.240]  I think many journalists
[2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:05.240]  despise us that much,
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:07.240]  despise the working class that much,
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:09.240]  despise their own country that much.
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:11.240]  And it depends.
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:13.240]  It depends on newspapers you look into
[2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:15.240]  for where the money comes from.
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:17.240]  If you look at the Daily Mirror,
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:19.240]  we see the Saudi influence.
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:21.240]  Sure, it's a sick form of cuckolding.
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:23.240]  It's like funny. The working class
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:25.240]  are getting their daughters sold into slavery by the Muslims.
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:27.240]  Well, they're certainly not...
[2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:29.240]  What they actually do there is they run stories
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:31.240]  about how people are racist or extremist
[2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:33.240]  when they march over it.
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:35.240]  But now it's all come up.
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:37.240]  Now that it's all coming out, what are they going to do?
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:39.240]  Because they're on their heels.
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:41.240]  They want to kill you, my friend.
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:43.240]  You've got to stay alive.
[2:41:43.240 --> 2:41:45.240]  Let me ask you this.
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:47.240]  What are they going to do?
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:49.240]  Because it does seem like
[2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:51.240]  they're more and more on their heels.
[2:41:51.240 --> 2:41:53.240]  Nationalists are getting voted in everywhere in Europe.
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:55.240]  Common sense, life force,
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:41:57.240]  self-preservation is coming back.
[2:41:57.240 --> 2:41:59.240]  Well, I said this.
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:01.240]  We had a day for freedom demonstration
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:03.240]  two months before I was arrested.
[2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:05.240]  And I asked that question.
[2:42:05.240 --> 2:42:07.240]  What are they going to do?
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:09.240]  Because they're now thinking
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:11.240]  what are they going to do next?
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:13.240]  Because, essentially,
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:15.240]  I think I'm in the willing to see.
[2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:17.240]  And I've said that because
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:19.240]  everything I've tried to do for ten years
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  and I'd be willing to sacrifice my life
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:23.240]  to bring the change that's needed.
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:25.240]  Now, I think their intention
[2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:27.240]  has been many times to let me be killed
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:29.240]  or have me be killed
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:31.240]  because that's the thing.
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:33.240]  Now, if that happens,
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:35.240]  after seeing the world response
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:37.240]  in Britain and across the globe,
[2:42:37.240 --> 2:42:39.240]  to my own...
[2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:41.240]  Hold on, we've got to go to break. It's a heartbreak.
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:43.240]  I'm sorry to interrupt you. Come back with the incredible answer.
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:45.240]  About a cliffhanger. This isn't Netflix.
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.240]  It isn't movies. This is a real hero.
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:49.240]  This is a guy they've tried to kill.
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:51.240]  This is a guy tortured and prison repeatedly.
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:53.240]  This is a guy that lost his house.
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:55.240]  His wife and children facing asthma attacks.
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:42:57.240]  This is a real man right here.
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:42:59.240]  It's really hard to have the energy
[2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:01.240]  to go to the gym or to go for a run
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:03.240]  or go to the park or
[2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:05.240]  heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[2:43:05.240 --> 2:43:07.240]  Believe me, I know.
[2:43:07.240 --> 2:43:09.240]  I spend hours in front of a screen
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:11.240]  and then hours in front of bright lights
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:13.240]  every day.
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:15.240]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:17.240]  at InfowarsStore.com,
[2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:19.240]  I still have that energy.
[2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:21.240]  There's no way I could have the energy
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:23.240]  at the end of a long day
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:25.240]  to fight back against the chemicals
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:27.240]  and the food and water,
[2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:29.240]  and endurance, energy, and drive
[2:43:29.240 --> 2:43:31.240]  to get to the gym, get to the park
[2:43:31.240 --> 2:43:33.240]  and get exercise that you need
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:35.240]  for your health.

[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:45.240]  paired with our ultimate fish oil
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:47.240]  or used separately.

[2:44:49.240 --> 2:45:18.240]  now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:21.240]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now,
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:23.240]  but I bought a huge amount of it,
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:25.240]  ordered it six months ago,
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:27.240]  so I get the price down, and I said,
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:29.240]  if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract.
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:31.240]  Well, I broke the contract last week,
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:33.240]  and so this is potentially the last run.
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:35.240]  In fact, right now it is the last run
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:37.240]  of Survival Shield X2,
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:39.240]  and we've got a good supply of it,
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:41.240]  but it'll be gone in a couple of months.
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:43.240]  X2, if you haven't experienced it,
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:45.240]  InfowarsStore.com, if you haven't seen it,

[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:55.240]  It's available right now for limited time,

[2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:31.240]  out of your water supply,

[2:46:45.240 --> 2:46:47.240]  it's time to go big and go home

[2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:59.240]  filtration system today.
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:09.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:12.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:15.240]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:18.240]  on the front lines of the Infowar.
[2:47:18.240 --> 2:47:40.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:42.240]  Imagine a Hollywood movie
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:44.240]  where a guy 12 years ago
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:46.240]  is running a tanning salon in a little town in England,
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:48.240]  and sees 10, 12, 13-year-old girls
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:50.240]  crying for mommy being put in cars.
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:52.240]  And then he talks to the fathers and mothers.
[2:47:52.240 --> 2:47:54.240]  They go, yeah, the police won't help us.
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:56.240]  Our daughters are sold to sex slavery.
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:47:58.240]  And then it comes out
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:00.240]  nine, 10 years after he talks about it,
[2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:02.240]  it's happening in every town.
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:06.240]  And in many areas, the police are involved.
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:08.240]  And it's just incredible.
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:10.240]  So now, he's been put in prison
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:12.240]  for a year because he exposed it.
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:14.240]  They tried to kill him there.
[2:48:14.240 --> 2:48:16.240]  And then in three months,
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:18.240]  he lost his 30-something pounds.
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:20.240]  Recap what you've gone through
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:22.240]  and the fact that a superior court judge
[2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:24.240]  said, and you're the expert
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:26.240]  on English law, you've been through it,
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:28.240]  you've got me wrong, said, okay,
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:30.240]  you were convicted in one hour
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:32.240]  of covering the pedophile gang, which again.
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:34.240]  And then, so they struck that down,
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:36.240]  but still it's got to be reheard.
[2:48:36.240 --> 2:48:38.240]  And I don't know how much you're allowed to say on air.
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:40.240]  You told me a lot of it yesterday
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:42.240]  in that hour-long conversation we had.
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:44.240]  Because people really care about you
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:46.240]  and they want to know what's going on.
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:48.240]  So, recap what happened to you
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:50.240]  in the three months in,
[2:48:50.240 --> 2:48:52.240]  and then the latest info coming up next week.
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:54.240]  So, I went for a judge in Leeds
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:56.240]  where I was reporting on this trial.
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:48:58.240]  I was not
[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:00.240]  asked to plead guilty or not guilty.
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:02.240]  I was refused the opportunity
[2:49:02.240 --> 2:49:04.240]  to speak with my lawyers.
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:06.240]  The case was not adjourned.
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:08.240]  The judge didn't even tell me
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:10.240]  what I'd done or said
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:12.240]  and he sends me to prison.
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:14.240]  And then, so it took them
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:16.240]  a matter of hours to send me to prison,
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:18.240]  but then it took me two months
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:20.240]  to get back before a judge
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:22.240]  to put across our case
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:24.240]  to say this is not how
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:26.240]  the British legal system should work.
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:28.240]  Thankfully,
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:30.240]  the highest court in the land,
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:32.240]  the Court of Appeal, agreed
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:34.240]  and they gave a scathing attack,
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:36.240]  a scathing report
[2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:38.240]  against the judge
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:40.240]  where they said my sentence was unlawful.
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:42.240]  They didn't think about it was unlawful.
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:44.240]  Five major points were unlawful,
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:46.240]  but the point is
[2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:48.240]  they didn't have to retry me.
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:50.240]  There's another case
[2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:52.240]  of a gentleman called West
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:54.240]  where one thing,
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:56.240]  one of the illegalities that the judge
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:49:58.240]  done on my case, he done five on my case.
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:00.240]  There was one illegal thing
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:02.240]  done in a gentleman called West's case
[2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:04.240]  and his conviction was quashed
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:06.240]  and there was no retry.
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:08.240]  They've decided
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:10.240]  to retry me
[2:50:10.240 --> 2:50:12.240]  at the Old Bailey. Next Thursday
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:14.240]  I go to court at the Old Bailey in London,
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:16.240]  the most senior court of our land,
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:18.240]  the court that deals with terrorism,
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:20.240]  high profile murders
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:22.240]  and I'm in court
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:24.240]  for talking on my iPhone
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:26.240]  about Muslim men
[2:50:26.240 --> 2:50:28.240]  who are raping children.
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:30.240]  That's why I'm in court.
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:32.240]  The court case had finished.
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:34.240]  I wasn't prejudiced in a trial
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:36.240]  but it was clear other news
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:38.240]  covered what you said and showed it
[2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:40.240]  they didn't get in trouble.
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:42.240]  You were being persecuted because you are a world leader.
[2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:44.240]  Everything I said was in the public domain.
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:46.240]  In fact,
[2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:48.240]  if you look at what I said,
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:50.240]  the contempt charge,
[2:50:50.240 --> 2:50:52.240]  other journalists such as Rod Liddle
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:54.240]  have been stopped on contempt
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:56.240]  for breaching reporting restrictions.
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:50:58.240]  He got a 4,000 pound fine.
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:00.240]  I spoke to other journalists this week
[2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:02.240]  who collapsed the trial.
[2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:04.240]  There was 11 men on a murder trial
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:06.240]  and he collapsed the trial due to his reporting
[2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:08.240]  and he didn't face any charges.
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:10.240]  We know you're being railroaded
[2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:12.240]  so let's talk about what you're facing next week
[2:51:12.240 --> 2:51:14.240]  and then what you're planning.
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:16.240]  Next week I face
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:18.240]  whether I walk into court
[2:51:18.240 --> 2:51:20.240]  as I've been told
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:22.240]  to apologize and plead guilty
[2:51:22.240 --> 2:51:24.240]  so to meet the government halfway.
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:26.240]  To meet them midway because at the minute
[2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:28.240]  it looks embarrassing for them
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:30.240]  because they've been proven that they're persecuting
[2:51:30.240 --> 2:51:32.240]  and they've been proven that their previous trial
[2:51:32.240 --> 2:51:34.240]  was unlawful and illegal.
[2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:36.240]  So it's whether I walk into court and do that
[2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:38.240]  and then I get to go home
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:40.240]  or whether I walk in
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:42.240]  which in fact I won't be doing anyway.
[2:51:42.240 --> 2:51:44.240]  I will walk into court
[2:51:44.240 --> 2:51:46.240]  with my head held up
[2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:48.240]  and even if I walk out the front door there
[2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:50.240]  and then my head's still held up
[2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:52.240]  or if I go to prison
[2:51:52.240 --> 2:51:54.240]  and I come out in a matter of months
[2:51:54.240 --> 2:51:56.240]  or however long then I'll still walk out
[2:51:56.240 --> 2:51:58.240]  with my head held up
[2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:00.240]  and I'm happy with about all this.
[2:52:00.240 --> 2:52:02.240]  Obviously I'm concerned and I'll be lying
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:04.240]  if I said I wasn't worried.
[2:52:04.240 --> 2:52:06.240]  I don't want to go back to prison.
[2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:08.240]  It has an adverse effect on my whole family
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:10.240]  not just me.
[2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:12.240]  So let's be clear. Tommy Robinson, jail for exposing
[2:52:12.240 --> 2:52:14.240]  pedophile rings and being a hero
[2:52:14.240 --> 2:52:16.240]  and being proven right because he's dangerous.
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:18.240]  What makes you tick?
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:20.240]  I'm not looking to be put in prison or killed
[2:52:20.240 --> 2:52:22.240]  or attacked or boycotted
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:24.240]  but I know I'm right
[2:52:24.240 --> 2:52:26.240]  and so when they attack me
[2:52:26.240 --> 2:52:28.240]  the bad news comes in and suddenly I have like
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:30.240]  five hours of incredible energy
[2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:32.240]  and it reminds me of growing up in Dallas
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:34.240]  when I was a nice sweet little kid
[2:52:34.240 --> 2:52:36.240]  like a ten years old and bullies would beat me up
[2:52:36.240 --> 2:52:38.240]  and I'd come home and I'd said
[2:52:38.240 --> 2:52:40.240]  well you need to fight harder
[2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:42.240]  and I was like eleven or twelve
[2:52:42.240 --> 2:52:44.240]  I put one of the bullies in the hospital
[2:52:44.240 --> 2:52:46.240]  next time he did and I ended up getting in trouble
[2:52:46.240 --> 2:52:48.240]  but that got me out of here.
[2:52:48.240 --> 2:52:50.240]  He said it's okay son we don't start fights
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:52.240]  we finish them.
[2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:54.240]  What makes you at a gut level
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:56.240]  what tears the enemy?
[2:52:56.240 --> 2:52:58.240]  I put a lot of things
[2:52:58.240 --> 2:53:00.240]  if I ever begin to feel sorry
[2:53:00.240 --> 2:53:02.240]  for myself I'll put things into perspective.
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:04.240]  I just spent two and a half months
[2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:06.240]  in prison on solitary confinement
[2:53:06.240 --> 2:53:08.240]  away from my children
[2:53:08.240 --> 2:53:10.240]  so yes that was not good
[2:53:10.240 --> 2:53:12.240]  it hasn't been a good effect
[2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:14.240]  but then I look at members
[2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:16.240]  of the British public who sign up
[2:53:16.240 --> 2:53:18.240]  for our armed forces or the American armed forces
[2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:20.240]  and they leave their children
[2:53:20.240 --> 2:53:22.240]  they kiss them goodbye
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:24.240]  and they go on six month tours
[2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:26.240]  so I just view everything
[2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:28.240]  I may have been in jail
[2:53:28.240 --> 2:53:30.240]  it may have been terrible
[2:53:30.240 --> 2:53:32.240]  there wasn't bullets passing my head every day
[2:53:32.240 --> 2:53:34.240]  That's it, this is a war for our own homelands
[2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:36.240]  we are soldiers in the information war
[2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:38.240]  and once we decide we're expendable
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:40.240]  it doesn't mean we want to die, we love life
[2:53:40.240 --> 2:53:42.240]  but we have to decide we are expendable
[2:53:42.240 --> 2:53:44.240]  and I think once you cross that road
[2:53:44.240 --> 2:53:46.240]  many years ago was it not empowering
[2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:48.240]  when you made the decision
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:50.240]  I'm going to go on to the end
[2:53:50.240 --> 2:53:52.240]  it was empowering
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:54.240]  I don't fear that
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:53:56.240]  I don't fear that
[2:53:56.240 --> 2:53:58.240]  and that's the truth
[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:00.240]  I generally don't fear that because I've accepted that
[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:02.240]  I've accepted that the
[2:54:02.240 --> 2:54:04.240]  never welcome of this path
[2:54:04.240 --> 2:54:06.240]  which I've chosen
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:08.240]  I wrote a letter to my wife and I was in prison
[2:54:08.240 --> 2:54:10.240]  explaining all of this to say that
[2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:12.240]  I'm not in this position through anything other than choice
[2:54:12.240 --> 2:54:14.240]  I know what I'm doing
[2:54:14.240 --> 2:54:16.240]  I'm not a victim, I'm a target
[2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:18.240]  I'm not their victim
[2:54:18.240 --> 2:54:20.240]  and I'm not going to wallow in self pity
[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:22.240]  about a situation that
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:24.240]  is nothing in comparison
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:26.240]  to what many other people go through
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:28.240]  Well these little girls, I mean any time
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:30.240]  I get in the middle of the night and wake up and go
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:32.240]  what are you doing, I think about how the globalists
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:34.240]  are pedophiles and how they hurt children
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:36.240]  and God's just saying do it, you claim you love me
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:38.240]  execute this operation
[2:54:38.240 --> 2:54:40.240]  Yeah, and the other thing
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:42.240]  the other thing, the other judgment to make
[2:54:42.240 --> 2:54:44.240]  all the time is are we morally right
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:46.240]  and if I'm morally right
[2:54:46.240 --> 2:54:48.240]  I'll do anything
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:50.240]  I will go anywhere
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:52.240]  and I will not face
[2:54:52.240 --> 2:54:54.240]  or care about the consequences
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:54:56.240]  of the problems I'm talking about
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:54:58.240]  if I'm morally right
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:00.240]  and once you go past that
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:02.240]  as a moral compass, what we're doing
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:04.240]  is trying to save the future
[2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:06.240]  of our culture, our children
[2:55:06.240 --> 2:55:08.240]  our country, our history
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:10.240]  a thousand years of history in this land
[2:55:10.240 --> 2:55:12.240]  that I'm sitting in and thousands
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:14.240]  of men, if all I have to do
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:16.240]  for five minutes is sit and think
[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:18.240]  about the previous generations
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:20.240]  of what they get and what they sacrifice
[2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:22.240]  and to be honest, even what I'm doing
[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:24.240]  is nothing
[2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:26.240]  or what I've been through, is nothing
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:28.240]  we are a generation of cowards
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:30.240]  born in an era where
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:32.240]  and I also take huge satisfaction
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:34.240]  that so many people have been
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:36.240]  brought off of the fence, they've watched
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:38.240]  what happened, it's last arrest
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:40.240]  I'd like to say a thank you
[2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:42.240]  to Judge Marston who put me
[2:55:42.240 --> 2:55:44.240]  in prison because he has
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:46.240]  read more people than anyone
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:48.240]  I've ever met, he's been the most
[2:55:48.240 --> 2:55:50.240]  successful in bringing people to our courts
[2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:52.240]  so that's all I base
[2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:54.240]  on Alex, I'm sure with himself
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:56.240]  we're right, we're telling the truth
[2:55:56.240 --> 2:55:58.240]  it's a moral battle
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:00.240]  it's a battle that we can't afford to lose
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:02.240]  and the
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:04.240]  consequences are really nothing
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:06.240]  in comparison to what many people think
[2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:08.240]  and now we need intelligence, we need to think
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:10.240]  our steps out because you're a major general
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:12.240]  in this fight, we're going to break two minutes

[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:20.240]  to work with other folks to set up something so that
[2:56:20.240 --> 2:56:22.240]  he can really get out there and be protected when he does it
[2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:24.240]  and we'll be right back after break
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:26.240]  I've got a plug or I can't finance this whole operation

[2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:58.240]  showed up, it was incredible footage
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:00.240]  and then the judge
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:02.240]  punted until
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:04.240]  the 23rd

[3:00:12.240 --> 3:00:14.240]  well roger stone is taking over right now
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:16.240]  but I've got to write a shot down a little bit
[3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:18.240]  because wild horses can't drag me away
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:20.240]  Christine
[3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:22.240]  Blasey Ford's grandfather
[3:00:22.240 --> 3:00:24.240]  father
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:26.240]  brother
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:28.240]  brother in law
[3:00:28.240 --> 3:00:30.240]  were in some of the nastiest areas of the deep state
[3:00:30.240 --> 3:00:32.240]  CIA
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:34.240]  not the folks actually fighting in foreign lands
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:36.240]  or battling communist china or the russians
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:38.240]  or not people actually do work
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:40.240]  but the ruling class brain bug
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:42.240]  psychologist type
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:44.240]  psychiatrist type
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:46.240]  and pacenics one of those but he was the top one
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:48.240]  and he was in combat so he's a good guy
[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:50.240]  and he'll tell you how horrible the whole analyst
[3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:52.240]  you know cultural engineer crew is
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:54.240]  they're the cancer
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:56.240]  I want to be clear about different groups in intelligence agencies
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:00:58.240]  these people are the worst
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:00.240]  and
[3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:02.240]  then we learn
[3:01:02.240 --> 3:01:04.240]  oh the FBI agent that tested her
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:06.240]  former agent gave her two questions
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:08.240]  anybody can look up a standard
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:10.240]  FBI profile test there's
[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:12.240]  generally twenty to fifty
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:14.240]  warm up questions to get a reading
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.240]  where do you live
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:18.240]  where are you born
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:20.240]  who's your husband who's your wife
[3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:22.240]  what do you do what's your favorite color
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:24.240]  she was given two questions period that's not
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:26.240]  a lot of detective tests
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:28.240]  like saying going to college one day is not
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:30.240]  a bachelor's degree
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:32.240]  going to college a month is not a master's
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:34.240]  degree
[3:01:34.240 --> 3:01:36.240]  so then her friend came
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:38.240]  out was all over the news this morning
[3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:40.240]  and said oh oh no
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:42.240]  she never coached me on
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:44.240]  polygraph like her old boyfriend said
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:46.240]  who said she flew over the world
[3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:48.240]  and was lying about being scared about in spaces or planes
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:50.240]  which in her own
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:52.240]  accounts she admits she traveled the whole
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:54.240]  world she admitted that to congress but she can't
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:56.240]  find a DC and none of the witnesses said they
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:01:58.240]  saw what they saw
[3:01:58.240 --> 3:02:00.240]  she said that's because they're sick it's okay
[3:02:00.240 --> 3:02:02.240]  they're sick
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:04.240]  yeah talk about
[3:02:04.240 --> 3:02:06.240]  projection so christine
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:08.240]  ford's friend and i's being helped on polygraph
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:10.240]  fires back at news claims
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:12.240]  but nowhere in ap or fox
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:14.240]  does it tell you this
[3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:16.240]  report blizzy
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:18.240]  ford's best friend also career
[3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:20.240]  fbi agent oh
[3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:22.240]  you might want to mention that anna democrat
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:24.240]  and all the rest
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:26.240]  of it jamie white in full wars
[3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:30.240]  dot com
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:32.240]  so
[3:02:32.240 --> 3:02:34.240]  it just gets
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:36.240]  more and more ridiculous from here on out doesn't
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:38.240]  him and a letter released from christine
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:40.240]  blizzy ford's ex-boyfriend it was revealed
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:42.240]  that ford helped lifelong
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:44.240]  friend monica l mclean
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:46.240]  pass the polygraph test
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:48.240]  but who exactly is monica mclean
[3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:52.240]  well she's the owner of the mcrib no
[3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:54.240]  in addition to being ford's best friend mclean
[3:02:54.240 --> 3:02:56.240]  also is 24 year employee
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:02:58.240]  of the department of justice and fbi
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:03:00.240]  from 92 to 2006
[3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:02.240]  according to her linkedin profile
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:04.240]  but none of the media wanted to point that out did they
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:06.240]  no
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:08.240]  and of course her lawyer
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:10.240]  ford's lawyer is the top swamp lawyer
[3:03:10.240 --> 3:03:12.240]  for mccabe and others the ex-boyfriend
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:14.240]  describes ford's relationship with mclean in a letter
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:16.240]  of tema fox news telling how she helped mclean
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:18.240]  pass the polygraph test which they make the fbi do
[3:03:18.240 --> 3:03:20.240]  all the time wonder why
[3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:22.240]  he'd know that if the story wasn't true
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:24.240]  wonder why you'd even have something like that
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:26.240]  of course he's telling the truth
[3:03:26.240 --> 3:03:28.240]  who would come up with that
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:30.240]  that she had a friend help pass the polygraph
[3:03:30.240 --> 3:03:32.240]  during some
[3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:34.240]  of the time we were dating
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:36.240]  dr ford lived with monica mclean
[3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:38.240]  who understand to be her
[3:03:38.240 --> 3:03:40.240]  lifelong best friend during that time
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:42.240]  it was my understanding that mclean
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:44.240]  was preparing
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:46.240]  was interviewing for jobs
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:48.240]  the fbi of the u.s. attorney's office
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:50.240]  which is now confirmed
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:52.240]  i witnessed dr ford
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:03:54.240]  help mclean prepare
[3:03:54.240 --> 3:03:56.240]  for political polygraph
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:03:58.240]  potential polygraph exam dr ford explained
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:00.240]  in detail what to expect
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:02.240]  how polygraphs worked and helped mclean
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:04.240]  become familiar with less nervous about the exam
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:06.240]  you know right
[3:04:06.240 --> 3:04:08.240]  dr ford was able to help
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:10.240]  because of her background in psychology
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:12.240]  very special background
[3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:14.240]  now you think
[3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:16.240]  her being a democrat swamp
[3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:18.240]  creature would play into this
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:20.240]  but oh no
[3:04:20.240 --> 3:04:22.240]  no no no
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:24.240]  so
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:26.240]  so
[3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:28.240]  it just gets more insane
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:30.240]  and then meanwhile there's the article on
[3:04:30.240 --> 3:04:32.240]  inforwars.com
[3:04:32.240 --> 3:04:34.240]  of tim cook of apple
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:36.240]  who runs the big slave factory in china
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:38.240]  but it's okay he's gay
[3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:40.240]  as long as he's gay it's okay
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:42.240]  bragging about how they censored me
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:44.240]  and just how i deserved it
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:46.240]  i just deserved it
[3:04:46.240 --> 3:04:48.240]  no one knows there's the body of evidence
[3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:50.240]  like running slave factories
[3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:52.240]  helping spoil the chinese people
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:54.240]  like you a mass murderer tim cook by extension
[3:04:54.240 --> 3:04:56.240]  words cannot describe how big
[3:04:56.240 --> 3:04:58.240]  the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:00.240]  inforwars
[3:05:00.240 --> 3:05:02.240]  is being openly targeted by the democratic party
[3:05:02.240 --> 3:05:04.240]  left to cia operatives
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:06.240]  the corrupt justice department
[3:05:06.240 --> 3:05:08.240]  and the entire soros crime syndicate
[3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:10.240]  people say why would you start a fight with them
[3:05:10.240 --> 3:05:12.240]  because they were already dominating
[3:05:12.240 --> 3:05:14.240]  and running america into the ground
[3:05:14.240 --> 3:05:16.240]  and we had no future if we didn't do this
[3:05:16.240 --> 3:05:18.240]  so we've already had incredible success
[3:05:18.240 --> 3:05:20.240]  but if you will simply realize
[3:05:20.240 --> 3:05:22.240]  how epic this is
[3:05:22.240 --> 3:05:24.240]  and understand how real this fight is
[3:05:24.240 --> 3:05:26.240]  and why we've been made the main target
[3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:28.240]  and if you financially support us
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:30.240]  and if you spread the word about our articles
[3:05:30.240 --> 3:05:32.240]  and videos inforwars.com
[3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:34.240]  we won't just continue to stand up against
[3:05:34.240 --> 3:05:36.240]  these brutal scompags
[3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:38.240]  we'll win
[3:05:38.240 --> 3:05:40.240]  we have huge sales at inforwars.com right now
[3:05:40.240 --> 3:05:42.240]  and we're still able to operate
[3:05:42.240 --> 3:05:44.240]  and stuff shipped out to you
[3:05:44.240 --> 3:05:46.240]  despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce
[3:05:46.240 --> 3:05:48.240]  and you're right to the market
[3:05:48.240 --> 3:05:50.240]  but if you don't stand up and support us financially
[3:05:50.240 --> 3:05:52.240]  soros the globe will spring when
[3:05:52.240 --> 3:05:54.240]  this is inforwars darkish hour
[3:05:54.240 --> 3:06:16.240]  music
[3:06:16.240 --> 3:06:18.240]  well
[3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:20.240]  at this point
[3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:22.240]  there's just too much news to even cover
[3:06:22.240 --> 3:06:24.240]  I've been forced to
[3:06:24.240 --> 3:06:26.240]  file a lawsuit against PayPal
[3:06:26.240 --> 3:06:28.240]  I have an 18 year relationship
[3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:30.240]  with them
[3:06:30.240 --> 3:06:32.240]  and
[3:06:32.240 --> 3:06:34.240]  the reason I filed a suit against them
[3:06:34.240 --> 3:06:36.240]  is to draw attention to what's happening
[3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:38.240]  whatever comes from it
[3:06:38.240 --> 3:06:40.240]  their contract
[3:06:40.240 --> 3:06:42.240]  is toxic
[3:06:42.240 --> 3:06:44.240]  you have your rights
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:46.240]  you shouldn't make sharecroppers waive all their rights for a chance to
[3:06:46.240 --> 3:06:48.240]  you'll be employed by them
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:50.240]  music
[3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:52.240]  and
[3:06:52.240 --> 3:06:54.240]  they demonized me when they said I was a hate monger
[3:06:54.240 --> 3:06:56.240]  and an evil person
[3:06:56.240 --> 3:06:58.240]  when they banned me
[3:06:58.240 --> 3:07:00.240]  so that's a form of defamation
[3:07:00.240 --> 3:07:02.240]  and you know when you've got
[3:07:02.240 --> 3:07:04.240]  them working with third world dictators
[3:07:04.240 --> 3:07:06.240]  you've got them working with the nation of Islam
[3:07:06.240 --> 3:07:08.240]  you've got them working with Hezbollah
[3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:10.240]  you've got them working with care
[3:07:10.240 --> 3:07:12.240]  and by the way
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:14.240]  I'm not Lewis Farrakhan's enemy
[3:07:14.240 --> 3:07:16.240]  and a lot of what Farrakhan says
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:18.240]  is taken out of context and I've interviewed Farrakhan
[3:07:18.240 --> 3:07:20.240]  at certain levels I think Farrakhan said some things that are true
[3:07:20.240 --> 3:07:22.240]  a lot of things I disagree with
[3:07:22.240 --> 3:07:24.240]  so I'm not calling for Farrakhan to be kicked off PayPal
[3:07:24.240 --> 3:07:26.240]  it's that
[3:07:26.240 --> 3:07:28.240]  anybody that knows
[3:07:28.240 --> 3:07:30.240]  my show knows that I really like Martin Luther King
[3:07:30.240 --> 3:07:32.240]  he was a great speaker
[3:07:32.240 --> 3:07:34.240]  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:36.240]  and I really believe in
[3:07:36.240 --> 3:07:38.240]  what you stand for and what you do
[3:07:38.240 --> 3:07:40.240]  if you're great at art, if you write a great book
[3:07:40.240 --> 3:07:42.240]  I'm going to read your book, if you cook great food I'm going to come to your restaurant
[3:07:42.240 --> 3:07:44.240]  if you play great music I'm going to go listen to you
[3:07:44.240 --> 3:07:46.240]  I think there's women
[3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:48.240]  beautiful from every stripe of human
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:50.240]  you know, community
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:52.240]  and
[3:07:52.240 --> 3:07:54.240]  so
[3:07:54.240 --> 3:07:56.240]  that's where I stand
[3:07:56.240 --> 3:07:58.240]  and I don't need to sit there and virtue signal all day
[3:07:58.240 --> 3:08:00.240]  that I'm not a Nazi but let me tell you something
[3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:04.240]  they've called reporters that work here
[3:08:04.240 --> 3:08:06.240]  white nationalists
[3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:08.240]  because they covered
[3:08:08.240 --> 3:08:10.240]  Charlottesville
[3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:12.240]  Charlottesville was led
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:14.240]  by a bunch of Democrat operatives
[3:08:14.240 --> 3:08:16.240]  all of them
[3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:18.240]  who a year before had worked for Hillary or Obama
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:20.240]  and then all suddenly dressed up like Nazis
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:22.240]  and they're all a bunch of
[3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:24.240]  let's just say it, I'm not going to guess them because they're gay
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:26.240]  but they're a bunch of gay
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:28.240]  drama students
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:30.240]  and drama professors
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:32.240]  who
[3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:34.240]  you know
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:36.240]  wanted to burn torches and go make Trump look bad
[3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:38.240]  I mean that's what it was
[3:08:38.240 --> 3:08:40.240]  it was just a gay drama club out there
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:08:42.240]  dressed up like Nazis
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:44.240]  and there's been so many cases of that
[3:08:44.240 --> 3:08:46.240]  and then reporters go cover it and you get called white supremacists
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:48.240]  and listen
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:50.240]  I don't like white supremacists
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:52.240]  but I don't like black supremacists, spanish supremacists
[3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:54.240]  any of this. We've got videos on infowars.com
[3:08:54.240 --> 3:08:56.240]  I haven't even gotten to today
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:58.240]  with the incredible Millie Weaver and the amazing
[3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:00.240]  Gavin Winsor shot
[3:09:02.240 --> 3:09:04.240]  where there are Mexicans
[3:09:04.240 --> 3:09:06.240]  who are illegal aliens, they say they are
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:08.240]  wearing Mexico
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:10.240]  soccer jerseys
[3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:12.240]  like Trump F America
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:14.240]  there's a new video out, we need to blip it
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:16.240]  we should air it towards the end of this hour
[3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:18.240]  just insanity
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:20.240]  and then there's a guy who lost his daughter
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:22.240]  when a drunk illegal alien
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:24.240]  hit her going 100 miles an hour head on
[3:09:24.240 --> 3:09:26.240]  with three of his own kids in the car
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:28.240]  they didn't die, she did
[3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:30.240]  and this racist
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:32.240]  in my view, Hispanic lady, is saying f off
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:34.240]  gringo
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:38.240]  so yeah, if I was walking down the street
[3:09:38.240 --> 3:09:40.240]  and I saw KKK everywhere, I'd be concerned
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:42.240]  I walk around and I see large groups
[3:09:42.240 --> 3:09:43.240]  of whites
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:45.240]  trained to hate being white
[3:09:45.240 --> 3:09:47.240]  and screaming white people need to have their balls chopped off
[3:09:47.240 --> 3:09:49.240]  and kill Cabinon, kill the Republicans
[3:09:49.240 --> 3:09:51.240]  you know, that's major professors
[3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:53.240]  they're not getting in trouble, when you talk about KKK
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:09:55.240]  K type crap, I'm seeing it
[3:09:55.240 --> 3:09:57.240]  from white professors and leftists
[3:09:57.240 --> 3:09:59.240]  radicalizing Hispanics and others
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:01.240]  where you show up in Tennessee
[3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:03.240]  at a Trump rally, maybe we should roll some of that
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:05.240]  as B roll
[3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:08.240]  headline, father who lost daughter confronts illegals
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:10.240]  and he just looks at him
[3:10:10.240 --> 3:10:12.240]  and he says, I lost my daughter and they're getting his face
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:14.240]  there's a guy from Argentina
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:17.240]  who's here legally, he's like Jesus, just be here legally
[3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:21.240]  but again, ladies and gentlemen
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:23.240]  that's what we've gotten to in this country
[3:10:23.240 --> 3:10:26.240]  where Alex Jones rails against big tech
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:28.240]  bombshell, PayPal bans info wars
[3:10:28.240 --> 3:10:31.240]  after lobbying by Soros funded group
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:33.240]  info wars falls emergency injunction against PayPal
[3:10:33.240 --> 3:10:35.240]  and federal court
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:37.240]  really wanted to show was their headlines
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:39.240]  Alex Jones says PayPal
[3:10:39.240 --> 3:10:41.240]  info wars banned for hate and intolerance
[3:10:41.240 --> 3:10:43.240]  this magic word, I think Tim Cook
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:45.240]  running slave factories in China is hating intolerance
[3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:48.240]  I think them shutting down free speech is hating intolerance
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:50.240]  but they just say these magic words
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:52.240]  and I'm blown out the air lot
[3:10:54.240 --> 3:10:56.240]  so they're the clear and present danger
[3:10:56.240 --> 3:10:58.240]  what are we going to do about it
[3:10:58.240 --> 3:11:00.240]  there's another article on info wars.com
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:03.240]  if you pull it up
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:06.240]  that's the latest
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:08.240]  with folks that are so brainwashed
[3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:10.240]  while they're inside this country
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:13.240]  and so trained to hate this nation
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:16.240]  that they don't even know what planet they're on
[3:11:16.240 --> 3:11:18.240]  they want to get here as soon as they can
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:21.240]  but they want to turn it into the third world nation
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:29.240]  that they came from
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:31.240]  why do they fear info wars?
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:35.240]  because we talk about real issues
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:39.240]  because we break down the real facts
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:41.240]  I don't care how long it takes
[3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:44.240]  I'm going to pull up the article on info wars.com
[3:11:44.240 --> 3:11:47.240]  I tell you Fox Insider puts bugs on your phone man
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:49.240]  once I went there it just keeps launching
[3:11:49.240 --> 3:11:51.240]  all this crazy ass stuff
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:53.240]  I'll set it for five hours
[3:11:53.240 --> 3:11:55.240]  if you go to info wars.com
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:57.240]  I'm just going to set it for hours
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:11:59.240]  if you go to info wars.com
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:01.240]  and you come there
[3:12:01.240 --> 3:12:03.240]  and there's just a whole other article
[3:12:03.240 --> 3:12:05.240]  by Millie Weaver right there
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:07.240]  below the top stories in Featured
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:09.240]  there it is
[3:12:09.240 --> 3:12:11.240]  anti-Trump protesters declare Mexico first
[3:12:11.240 --> 3:12:13.240]  and they've got Mexican flags
[3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:15.240]  hanging on them
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:17.240]  all this stuff
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:19.240]  this is crazy town
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:21.240]  and that's where all our reporters should be
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:23.240]  is at the Trump rallies
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:25.240]  that's where we should really be
[3:12:25.240 --> 3:12:27.240]  Facebook and Twitter and YouTube
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:29.240]  so that we can't communicate with you
[3:12:29.240 --> 3:12:31.240]  so you can't see what the globalists have set up
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:33.240]  and what the globalists have done
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:35.240]  and what they've developed
[3:12:35.240 --> 3:12:37.240]  and what they have set up in this nation
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:39.240]  to bring us down
[3:12:39.240 --> 3:12:41.240]  that's it
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:43.240]  so I'm going to end this segment
[3:12:43.240 --> 3:12:45.240]  and let Roger Stone take over
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:47.240]  but man that's some powerful video
[3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:49.240]  it might even make one of our shows today
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:51.240]  it might even make it on the air today
[3:12:51.240 --> 3:12:53.240]  probably not though
[3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:55.240]  Millie Weaver is on fire
[3:12:55.240 --> 3:12:57.240]  and I salute her and I thank her
[3:12:57.240 --> 3:12:59.240]  and I really really appreciate her
[3:12:59.240 --> 3:13:01.240]  so Roger's coming up
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:03.240]  in just a moment
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:05.240]  if you don't support us we're suing PayPal
[3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:07.240]  that's going to be expensive
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:09.240]  we're battling sorrows
[3:13:09.240 --> 3:13:11.240]  and I'm not bitching how I'm here to kick their ass politically
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:13.240]  but you might want to bet on the horse
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:15.240]  and you might want to fund the operation
[3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:17.240]  that's 110% in as hard as I can
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:19.240]  because let me tell you something
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:21.240]  a lot of people don't have memories anymore
[3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:23.240]  their brains, the TV and culture
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:25.240]  whatever mesmerization
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:27.240]  they send through these damn phones doesn't work on me
[3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:29.240]  it only pisses me off
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:31.240]  so
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:33.240]  I'm conscious, I'm aware
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:35.240]  and I'm not going to let people that aid in the bed
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:37.240]  mass murderers like Tim Cook run my life
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:39.240]  and I believe we will beat this
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:41.240]  sorry SOB and the rest of them
[3:13:41.240 --> 3:13:43.240]  as long as you take action but I need your hopes
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:45.240]  I need your prayers and I need your support
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:47.240]  tomorrow's the last day
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:49.240]  maybe even today I don't know I got new specials coming out
[3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:51.240]  plus the great new tropic 40% off

[3:14:01.240 --> 3:14:03.240]  calm confident
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:05.240]  gait I should probably drink a whole bottle of this
[3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:07.240]  actually don't do that folks take the
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:09.240]  recommended amount and consult your physicians before you take it
[3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:11.240]  it's a little tongue in cheek comment
[3:14:11.240 --> 3:14:13.240]  and I'm pretty wound up with the energetic level
[3:14:13.240 --> 3:14:15.240]  34 days out from this critical election
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:17.240]  and just trying to get people out of
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:19.240]  the commas
[3:14:19.240 --> 3:14:21.240]  out of the trances even people think they're awake
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:23.240]  are in these trances with no memory
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:25.240]  I witness it constantly
[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:27.240]  just no memory even an hour before
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:29.240]  and it's like a time warp but it's okay
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:31.240]  those of us that have
[3:14:31.240 --> 3:14:33.240]  memory it's a gift
[3:14:33.240 --> 3:14:35.240]  from God
[3:14:35.240 --> 3:14:37.240]  those of us that have consciousness it's an amazing thing

[3:14:57.240 --> 3:14:59.240]  with a lot of his face
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:01.240]  he'll give them an ultimatum they'll crap all over him
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:03.240]  and then he'll take them to the wood shed like he's done
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:05.240]  China that's how Trump works
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:07.240]  it's through a process of giving people a chance

[3:17:07.240 --> 3:17:09.240]  bay heating pad did you know
[3:17:09.240 --> 3:17:11.240]  that the American College of Physicians
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:13.240]  said that one of the best ways to treat

[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:43.240]  with great care before we introduce them
[3:17:43.240 --> 3:17:45.240]  to the public you can easily find sunny
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:47.240]  bay heating pads on Amazon
[3:17:47.240 --> 3:17:49.240]  just go to Amazon.com
[3:17:49.240 --> 3:18:15.240]  for sunny bay heating pads
[3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:19.240]  find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[3:18:19.240 --> 3:18:21.240]  alkalinity and pH
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:23.240]  what we learned was that there was in fact
[3:18:23.240 --> 3:18:25.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:27.240]  and acidity in the rainwater
[3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:29.240]  next we tested the water from our
[3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:31.240]  Alexa pure gravity filter
[3:18:31.240 --> 3:18:33.240]  and not only were the heavy metal levels
[3:18:33.240 --> 3:18:35.240]  within safe measure but the pH
[3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:37.240]  was also restored to optimal levels
[3:18:37.240 --> 3:18:39.240]  as it turns out
[3:18:39.240 --> 3:18:41.240]  the filter on the Alexa pure
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:43.240]  raises the pH of the water
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:45.240]  so what we've learned is that volcanic
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:47.240]  ash and acid rain can contaminate
[3:18:47.240 --> 3:18:49.240]  a rainwater supply
[3:18:49.240 --> 3:18:51.240]  but more importantly a good water
[3:18:51.240 --> 3:19:15.240]  filtration system will purify it.
[3:19:21.240 --> 3:19:23.240]  this is the modern day lifestyle
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:25.240]  with the screen time and the extended hours

[3:20:33.240 --> 3:20:35.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:37.240]  I'm Roger Stone and not even
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:39.240]  technological difficulties
[3:20:39.240 --> 3:20:41.240]  can stop us from bringing you
[3:20:41.240 --> 3:20:43.240]  the real news
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:45.240]  I'm in Washington D.C. today
[3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:47.240]  for a series of meetings to talk about
[3:20:47.240 --> 3:20:49.240]  grassroots activism
[3:20:49.240 --> 3:20:51.240]  supporting the president's
[3:20:51.240 --> 3:20:53.240]  supreme court nominee
[3:20:53.240 --> 3:20:55.240]  and also to begin planning
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:20:57.240]  to thwart what is clearly
[3:20:57.240 --> 3:20:59.240]  coming down the pike
[3:20:59.240 --> 3:21:01.240]  quite simply
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:03.240]  if Brett Kavanaugh is rejected
[3:21:03.240 --> 3:21:05.240]  you have seen the
[3:21:05.240 --> 3:21:07.240]  dress rehearsal for the impeachment
[3:21:07.240 --> 3:21:09.240]  of President Donald Trump
[3:21:09.240 --> 3:21:11.240]  you have seen the two-party
[3:21:11.240 --> 3:21:13.240]  duopoly's dry run
[3:21:13.240 --> 3:21:15.240]  here's how it works
[3:21:15.240 --> 3:21:17.240]  if the Democrats
[3:21:17.240 --> 3:21:19.240]  win the House this November
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:21.240]  a few short days from now
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:23.240]  as soon as they take control
[3:21:23.240 --> 3:21:25.240]  in January
[3:21:25.240 --> 3:21:27.240]  they will surely vote articles
[3:21:27.240 --> 3:21:29.240]  of impeachment against Donald Trump
[3:21:29.240 --> 3:21:31.240]  because they are
[3:21:31.240 --> 3:21:33.240]  empty-handed on the question
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:35.240]  of Russian collusion
[3:21:35.240 --> 3:21:37.240]  that is Russian
[3:21:37.240 --> 3:21:39.240]  coordination collusion
[3:21:39.240 --> 3:21:41.240]  conspiracy with the Trump campaign
[3:21:41.240 --> 3:21:43.240]  their new excuse
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:45.240]  will be sexual assault
[3:21:45.240 --> 3:21:47.240]  by Donald Trump
[3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:49.240]  as with Judge Kavanaugh
[3:21:49.240 --> 3:21:51.240]  there is of course no evidence
[3:21:51.240 --> 3:21:53.240]  or proof of that but there are
[3:21:53.240 --> 3:21:55.240]  a number of women who surfaced
[3:21:55.240 --> 3:21:57.240]  briefly in the 2016 campaign
[3:21:57.240 --> 3:21:59.240]  with these accusations
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:01.240]  none of whom had any
[3:22:01.240 --> 3:22:03.240]  corroboration any evidence
[3:22:03.240 --> 3:22:05.240]  any proof
[3:22:05.240 --> 3:22:07.240]  that what they were saying was true
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:09.240]  they quickly disappeared
[3:22:09.240 --> 3:22:11.240]  but believe me folks
[3:22:11.240 --> 3:22:13.240]  they'll be back
[3:22:13.240 --> 3:22:15.240]  and now there's a new standard
[3:22:15.240 --> 3:22:17.240]  the standard is guilty
[3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:19.240]  until proven innocent
[3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:21.240]  there will be a hysteria
[3:22:21.240 --> 3:22:23.240]  created in the country
[3:22:23.240 --> 3:22:25.240]  the president will be accused
[3:22:25.240 --> 3:22:27.240]  by weeping women in the Senate
[3:22:27.240 --> 3:22:29.240]  all of which of course will be
[3:22:29.240 --> 3:22:31.240]  televised
[3:22:31.240 --> 3:22:33.240]  and the president's
[3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:35.240]  weak need Republicans
[3:22:35.240 --> 3:22:37.240]  supporters will head
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:39.240]  for the exits they will
[3:22:39.240 --> 3:22:41.240]  vote with the Democrats
[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:43.240]  we need to move aggressively
[3:22:43.240 --> 3:22:45.240]  but first let's examine
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:47.240]  why this is happening
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:49.240]  the last few days
[3:22:49.240 --> 3:22:51.240]  have been revealing
[3:22:51.240 --> 3:22:53.240]  between Bob Woodward's
[3:22:53.240 --> 3:22:55.240]  book
[3:22:55.240 --> 3:22:57.240]  op ed
[3:22:57.240 --> 3:22:59.240]  and Obama's speech
[3:22:59.240 --> 3:23:01.240]  you have evidence that the deep state
[3:23:01.240 --> 3:23:03.240]  is preparing for the same exact type
[3:23:03.240 --> 3:23:05.240]  of takedown that they use
[3:23:05.240 --> 3:23:07.240]  to remove president John F. Kennedy
[3:23:07.240 --> 3:23:09.240]  in his case
[3:23:09.240 --> 3:23:11.240]  their game plan was somewhat more
[3:23:11.240 --> 3:23:13.240]  violent
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:15.240]  you see much like president Kennedy
[3:23:15.240 --> 3:23:17.240]  Donald Trump
[3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:19.240]  is for peace
[3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:21.240]  he wants to lessen tensions
[3:23:21.240 --> 3:23:23.240]  with North Korea
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:25.240]  to lessen tensions
[3:23:25.240 --> 3:23:27.240]  with the Russians
[3:23:27.240 --> 3:23:29.240]  after the Bay of Pigs
[3:23:29.240 --> 3:23:31.240]  Fiasco when president
[3:23:31.240 --> 3:23:33.240]  John Kennedy refused
[3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:35.240]  to mount an all-out assault
[3:23:35.240 --> 3:23:37.240]  against Cuba and after
[3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:39.240]  the Cuban missile crisis
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:41.240]  in which JFK signaled
[3:23:41.240 --> 3:23:43.240]  that he wanted talks with Russia
[3:23:43.240 --> 3:23:45.240]  to lessen national
[3:23:45.240 --> 3:23:47.240]  prospects for a nuclear
[3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:49.240]  holocaust while it was
[3:23:49.240 --> 3:23:51.240]  too much for the deep state
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:53.240]  and they took him down
[3:23:53.240 --> 3:23:55.240]  prior to these
[3:23:55.240 --> 3:23:57.240]  more recent signals
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:23:59.240]  the Washington Post
[3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:01.240]  phony anonymous op ed
[3:24:01.240 --> 3:24:03.240]  the Bob Woodward
[3:24:03.240 --> 3:24:05.240]  book and Obama's incredible
[3:24:05.240 --> 3:24:07.240]  speech in which he
[3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:09.240]  grabbed credit for a surging
[3:24:09.240 --> 3:24:11.240]  economy that he predicted would never
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:13.240]  surge again
[3:24:13.240 --> 3:24:15.240]  the evidence was
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:17.240]  somewhat thinner but still
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:19.240]  more troubling
[3:24:19.240 --> 3:24:21.240]  you had a series of anonymous
[3:24:21.240 --> 3:24:23.240]  leaks out of Obama's
[3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:25.240]  intelligence services
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:27.240]  regarding
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:29.240]  the alleged collusion
[3:24:29.240 --> 3:24:31.240]  with the Russians
[3:24:31.240 --> 3:24:33.240]  one of these was even admitted to
[3:24:33.240 --> 3:24:35.240]  under oath by FBI director
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:37.240]  James Comey
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:39.240]  then you had a series
[3:24:39.240 --> 3:24:41.240]  of anti-Trump political messages
[3:24:41.240 --> 3:24:43.240]  that were found in the
[3:24:43.240 --> 3:24:45.240]  text of changes between Peter
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:47.240]  Stroke and other FBI agents
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:49.240]  regarding the fact
[3:24:49.240 --> 3:24:51.240]  that they could find
[3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:53.240]  no real evidence of Russian collusion
[3:24:53.240 --> 3:24:55.240]  there was as Lisa Page said
[3:24:55.240 --> 3:24:57.240]  no there
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:24:59.240]  there and
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:01.240]  then the Democratic Party
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:03.240]  produced a dossier
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:05.240]  not a document created
[3:25:05.240 --> 3:25:07.240]  by law enforcement
[3:25:07.240 --> 3:25:09.240]  or legitimate intelligence agencies
[3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:11.240]  but a partisan document
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:13.240]  that was then used
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:15.240]  as the legal rationale
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:17.240]  for the surveillance
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:19.240]  of the Republican
[3:25:19.240 --> 3:25:21.240]  candidate for president
[3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:23.240]  an abuse of power
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:25.240]  that makes Watergate look like
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:27.240]  small potatoes
[3:25:27.240 --> 3:25:29.240]  and then lastly very similar to Watergate
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:31.240]  a former CIA
[3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:33.240]  and FBI
[3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:35.240]  operative
[3:25:35.240 --> 3:25:37.240]  approached members
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:39.240]  of the Trump campaign
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:41.240]  in an effort to plant
[3:25:41.240 --> 3:25:43.240]  faux evidence
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:45.240]  of Russian collusion
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:47.240]  these are the seeds
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:49.240]  of sedition
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:51.240]  these are the underlying
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:53.240]  aspects
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:55.240]  of the game in play
[3:25:55.240 --> 3:25:57.240]  to remove our president
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:25:59.240]  now there are two things
[3:25:59.240 --> 3:26:01.240]  that the deep state
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:03.240]  requires before they can make
[3:26:03.240 --> 3:26:05.240]  their move on Donald Trump
[3:26:05.240 --> 3:26:07.240]  first and foremost
[3:26:07.240 --> 3:26:09.240]  is the complete silencing
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:11.240]  of Infowars.com
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:13.240]  they want Alex Jones
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:15.240]  shut up and as quickly
[3:26:15.240 --> 3:26:17.240]  as possible
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:19.240]  because they know that millions of Americans
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:21.240]  tune into Infowars
[3:26:21.240 --> 3:26:23.240]  through whatever app
[3:26:23.240 --> 3:26:25.240]  or whatever platform they choose
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:27.240]  to get the truth
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:29.240]  the raw I like to call it
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:31.240]  stone cold truth about what's happening
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:33.240]  in Washington
[3:26:33.240 --> 3:26:35.240]  and what the globalists are really up to
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:37.240]  then as I have said here many times
[3:26:37.240 --> 3:26:39.240]  they would like to lock me up
[3:26:39.240 --> 3:26:41.240]  having come up with
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:43.240]  empty handed of any evidence
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:45.240]  of Russian collusion
[3:26:45.240 --> 3:26:47.240]  or WikiLeaks collaboration
[3:26:47.240 --> 3:26:49.240]  or any involvement regarding
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:51.240]  the acquisition or publication
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:53.240]  of John Podesta's emails
[3:26:53.240 --> 3:26:55.240]  now Robert Mueller
[3:26:55.240 --> 3:26:57.240]  the hit man for the deep state
[3:26:57.240 --> 3:26:59.240]  is out trying to fabricate some
[3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:01.240]  other offense in order to silence me
[3:27:01.240 --> 3:27:03.240]  don't let them do it folks
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:05.240]  go to the Infowars.com site
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:07.240]  right now because we need
[3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:09.240]  your help as never before
[3:27:09.240 --> 3:27:11.240]  Infowars is a beacon
[3:27:11.240 --> 3:27:13.240]  of freedom we are
[3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:15.240]  Freedom Command Central
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:17.240]  this is where you will hear up to the minute reports
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:19.240]  on exactly what the deep state
[3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:21.240]  is up to in their efforts
[3:27:21.240 --> 3:27:23.240]  to take down our president
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:25.240]  we will tell you when and how
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:27.240]  to act with grassroots activism
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:29.240]  to counter the efforts
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:31.240]  of the left
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:33.240]  but we cannot do it without your
[3:27:33.240 --> 3:27:35.240]  support and we cannot
[3:27:35.240 --> 3:27:37.240]  do it while we are facing
[3:27:37.240 --> 3:27:39.240]  the kind of censorship that
[3:27:39.240 --> 3:27:41.240]  they hope to put on us
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:43.240]  we are really
[3:27:43.240 --> 3:27:45.240]  not crying wolf
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:47.240]  we are operating under as you can
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:49.240]  see some technological
[3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:51.240]  restraints
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:53.240]  but we do know this
[3:27:53.240 --> 3:27:55.240]  shutting down Infowars is crucial
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:27:57.240]  Tim Cook is lying
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:27:59.240]  it is only through the process
[3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:01.240]  of discovery
[3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:03.240]  and lawsuits that we are going to
[3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:05.240]  be able to prove
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:07.240]  that the Apple CIO
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:09.240]  lies through his teeth
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:11.240]  when he says
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:13.240]  there is no coordination
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:15.240]  there has never been any discussions
[3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:17.240]  regarding the censorship
[3:28:17.240 --> 3:28:19.240]  of Alex Jones
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:21.240]  he lies and only in a court of law
[3:28:21.240 --> 3:28:23.240]  will we prove it
[3:28:23.240 --> 3:28:25.240]  I am Roger Stone you are on the Alex Jones
[3:28:25.240 --> 3:28:35.240]  show and I'll be right back

[3:28:57.240 --> 3:28:59.240]  when they tried to seize my mother's house
[3:28:59.240 --> 3:29:01.240]  I sued the IRS in one
[3:29:01.240 --> 3:29:03.240]  I beat the IRS then and I have been beating them ever since
[3:29:03.240 --> 3:29:05.240]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:07.240]  and I have helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:09.240]  they thought might never be solved

[3:30:49.240 --> 3:30:53.240]  888-253-3139
[3:30:53.240 --> 3:30:55.240]  we've taken thousands of years of known research
[3:30:55.240 --> 3:30:57.240]  and put it together with our own four years
[3:30:57.240 --> 3:30:59.240]  of seeking and testing
[3:30:59.240 --> 3:31:01.240]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:31:01.240 --> 3:31:03.240]  to detoxify the body
[3:31:03.240 --> 3:31:05.240]  that's why I'm introducing ZShield
[3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:07.240]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support
[3:31:07.240 --> 3:31:09.240]  it's made in the USA
[3:31:09.240 --> 3:31:11.240]  it's filled with
[3:31:11.240 --> 3:31:13.240]  known compounds from nature
[3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:15.240]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[3:31:15.240 --> 3:31:17.240]  and it supports the info war
[3:31:17.240 --> 3:31:19.240]  it is a classical 360 win
[3:31:19.240 --> 3:31:21.240]  this is the formula that I personally
[3:31:21.240 --> 3:31:23.240]  have been taking for over a year
[3:31:23.240 --> 3:31:25.240]  and now we believe we have come as close
[3:31:25.240 --> 3:31:27.240]  to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[3:31:27.240 --> 3:31:29.240]  as you can possibly get
[3:31:29.240 --> 3:31:31.240]  you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family

[3:33:17.240 --> 3:33:25.240]  welcome back
[3:33:25.240 --> 3:33:27.240]  I'm Roger Stone
[3:33:27.240 --> 3:33:29.240]  pinch hitting for the Alex Jones show
[3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:31.240]  and broadcasting from
[3:33:31.240 --> 3:33:33.240]  a hotel room in Washington DC
[3:33:33.240 --> 3:33:35.240]  where I'm here to
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:37.240]  not only meet with activists
[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:39.240]  in preparation for the
[3:33:39.240 --> 3:33:41.240]  deep states move on our president
[3:33:41.240 --> 3:33:43.240]  which is surely coming
[3:33:43.240 --> 3:33:45.240]  the Kavanaugh
[3:33:45.240 --> 3:33:47.240]  assault is the
[3:33:47.240 --> 3:33:49.240]  dry run for the establishment
[3:33:49.240 --> 3:33:51.240]  it is their first attempt
[3:33:51.240 --> 3:33:53.240]  to take down
[3:33:53.240 --> 3:33:55.240]  a presidential nominee
[3:33:55.240 --> 3:33:57.240]  and to delay
[3:33:57.240 --> 3:33:59.240]  his supreme court appointment
[3:33:59.240 --> 3:34:01.240]  in the hopes that they will gain control
[3:34:01.240 --> 3:34:03.240]  of the US senate this November
[3:34:03.240 --> 3:34:05.240]  and for
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:07.240]  the president's attempt
[3:34:07.240 --> 3:34:09.240]  to have a conservative majority
[3:34:09.240 --> 3:34:11.240]  on the supreme court
[3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:13.240]  now judge Brett Kavanaugh
[3:34:13.240 --> 3:34:15.240]  was not my first choice
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:17.240]  for this nomination in fact
[3:34:17.240 --> 3:34:19.240]  I took to the airwaves right here
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:21.240]  at InfoWars wrote an extensive
[3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:23.240]  piece about why I was
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:25.240]  concerned regarding his close
[3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:27.240]  relationship with the Bush
[3:34:27.240 --> 3:34:29.240]  crime family
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:31.240]  and his role in the
[3:34:31.240 --> 3:34:33.240]  cover-up of the death
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:35.240]  of Vince Foster
[3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:37.240]  the White House council
[3:34:37.240 --> 3:34:39.240]  to Bill and Hillary Clinton
[3:34:39.240 --> 3:34:41.240]  whose body was found in
[3:34:41.240 --> 3:34:43.240]  the Park Virginia
[3:34:43.240 --> 3:34:45.240]  I don't think Foster was murdered
[3:34:45.240 --> 3:34:47.240]  by the Clintons I believe
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:49.240]  he took his own life
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:51.240]  but I'm virtually certain that the
[3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:53.240]  Clintons particularly Mrs. Clinton
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:34:55.240]  ordered that his body
[3:34:55.240 --> 3:34:57.240]  be removed from the old
[3:34:57.240 --> 3:34:59.240]  executive office building where I think he committed
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:01.240]  suicide after
[3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:03.240]  relentless verbal
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:05.240]  abuse by the first lady
[3:35:05.240 --> 3:35:07.240]  in an open White House
[3:35:07.240 --> 3:35:09.240]  staff meeting, senior staff meeting
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:11.240]  that would explain why
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:11.240]  the FBI
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:13.240]  Tech Toxicology
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:15.240]  report
[3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:17.240]  showed that his body was completely
[3:35:17.240 --> 3:35:19.240]  covered by fiber
[3:35:19.240 --> 3:35:21.240]  from a carpet
[3:35:21.240 --> 3:35:23.240]  that's because they rolled him in a carpet
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:25.240]  to remove him
[3:35:25.240 --> 3:35:27.240]  and I was concerned about the role
[3:35:27.240 --> 3:35:29.240]  that Brett Kavanaugh played
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:31.240]  regarding a man named Patrick Knowlton
[3:35:31.240 --> 3:35:33.240]  Knowlton was just an everyday
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:35.240]  citizen who happened along
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:37.240]  the park at the wrong time
[3:35:37.240 --> 3:35:39.240]  saw men emerging from the woods
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:41.240]  where they had dumped
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:43.240]  the body of Vince Foster
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:45.240]  and then made the mistake
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:47.240]  of reporting that to the local
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:49.240]  police
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:51.240]  that brought Brett Kavanaugh
[3:35:51.240 --> 3:35:53.240]  and the full force of the FBI
[3:35:53.240 --> 3:35:55.240]  to his door
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:35:57.240]  demanding that he change his memory
[3:35:57.240 --> 3:35:59.240]  of what he had seen
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:01.240]  and instructing him that he had seen
[3:36:01.240 --> 3:36:03.240]  a car with Arkansas
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:05.240]  plates there
[3:36:05.240 --> 3:36:07.240]  at the park that in fact he hadn't seen
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:09.240]  he had seen
[3:36:09.240 --> 3:36:11.240]  a blue car with Arkansas plates
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:13.240]  but as I recall it Foster's car
[3:36:13.240 --> 3:36:15.240]  planted later at the park
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:17.240]  was brown
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:19.240]  all of that said I also said
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:21.240]  that I would support whoever the president
[3:36:21.240 --> 3:36:23.240]  nominated and I believe
[3:36:23.240 --> 3:36:25.240]  that the charges
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:27.240]  against Brett Kavanaugh
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:29.240]  from all of these
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:31.240]  various women are false
[3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:33.240]  what's amazing to me
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:35.240]  is that these same liberals
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:37.240]  these so called feminists
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:39.240]  continue to this day
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:41.240]  to have no issue
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:43.240]  with Bill Clinton
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:45.240]  Bill Clinton is not only a
[3:36:45.240 --> 3:36:47.240]  serial sexual assaulter
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:49.240]  but he's also a rapist
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:51.240]  who violently bit women through the
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:53.240]  upper lip in order
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:36:55.240]  to disable them
[3:36:55.240 --> 3:36:57.240]  he bit Juanita Broderick
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:36:59.240]  who has been very brave
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:01.240]  in recent days speaking out
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:03.240]  against her abuse
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:05.240]  at the hands of Bill Clinton
[3:37:05.240 --> 3:37:07.240]  and pointing out the hypocrisy
[3:37:07.240 --> 3:37:09.240]  of those on the left
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:11.240]  who
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:13.240]  to this day refused
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:15.240]  to criticize Clinton
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:17.240]  for his abuse of women
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:19.240]  but more precisely those feminists
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:21.240]  who have no issue
[3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:23.240]  with the fact that it was Hillary
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:25.240]  Clinton who ran
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:27.240]  the campaign to silence
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:29.240]  Bill's victims
[3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:31.240]  Hillary Clinton who hired
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:33.240]  the heavy handed private detectives
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:35.240]  and the mean lawyers
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:37.240]  to threaten women like Juanita
[3:37:37.240 --> 3:37:39.240]  Broderick and Kathleen
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:41.240]  Willie and Paula Jones
[3:37:41.240 --> 3:37:43.240]  and so many others
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:45.240]  into silence
[3:37:45.240 --> 3:37:47.240]  Hillary Clinton told us that she
[3:37:47.240 --> 3:37:49.240]  was an advocate
[3:37:49.240 --> 3:37:51.240]  for women when in fact
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:53.240]  she was a terrorizer
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:55.240]  of women
[3:37:55.240 --> 3:37:57.240]  today I saw a video
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:37:59.240]  of Hillary Clinton
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:01.240]  attacking Bill's victims
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:03.240]  calling Jennifer Flowers
[3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:05.240]  who was
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:07.240]  in a consensual relationship
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:09.240]  with her husband
[3:38:09.240 --> 3:38:11.240]  a failed cabaret singer
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:13.240]  calling the whole issue
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:15.240]  of Bill's abuse of women
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:17.240]  Willie Horton
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:19.240]  part two
[3:38:19.240 --> 3:38:21.240]  nice try Hillary
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:23.240]  you are busted
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:25.240]  anybody who wants the facts
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:27.240]  on the Clinton's war on women
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:29.240]  can go to my book
[3:38:29.240 --> 3:38:31.240]  the Clinton's war on women
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:33.240]  it's available at the infowars.com
[3:38:33.240 --> 3:38:35.240]  store now
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:37.240]  this is the definitive
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:39.240]  oppo dump on Bill and Hillary Clinton
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:41.240]  the abusers of women
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:43.240]  that the feminists who are raging
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:45.240]  against Brett Kavanaugh
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:47.240]  still refuse even today
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:49.240]  to criticize
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:51.240]  hypocrisy
[3:38:51.240 --> 3:38:53.240]  thy name is liberal
[3:38:53.240 --> 3:38:55.240]  senator Maisie Harono
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:38:57.240]  an amazing interview
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:38:59.240]  the other day where she said
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:01.240]  men just need to shut up
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:03.240]  and that it's time to step up
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:05.240]  and block the appointment
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:07.240]  of Brett Kavanaugh
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:09.240]  based on no evidence
[3:39:09.240 --> 3:39:11.240]  no corroboration and no proof
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:13.240]  but where was Maisie Harono
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:15.240]  when senior U.S.
[3:39:15.240 --> 3:39:17.240]  senator Dan
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:19.240]  in a way
[3:39:19.240 --> 3:39:21.240]  the man who dominated
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:23.240]  by a democratic machine
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:25.240]  was a U.S. senator
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:27.240]  and he was accused of sexual assault
[3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:29.240]  by a woman named Lenore Kwok
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:31.240]  a hairdresser
[3:39:31.240 --> 3:39:33.240]  at that point senator Harono
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:35.240]  was in her 12th
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:37.240]  term in the Hawaii
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:39.240]  house and do you know what she said
[3:39:39.240 --> 3:39:41.240]  nothing
[3:39:41.240 --> 3:39:43.240]  absolutely nothing
[3:39:43.240 --> 3:39:45.240]  so Maisie
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:47.240]  why didn't you
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:49.240]  step up as you put it
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:51.240]  perhaps you're the one
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:53.240]  who should shut up
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:55.240]  it is extraordinary
[3:39:55.240 --> 3:39:57.240]  to see the
[3:39:57.240 --> 3:39:59.240]  enormous hypocrisy of these
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:01.240]  democrats
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:03.240]  let's take for example Richard
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:05.240]  Blumenfall
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:07.240]  Blumenfall actually has
[3:40:07.240 --> 3:40:09.240]  the Cajones to read
[3:40:09.240 --> 3:40:11.240]  the latin translation
[3:40:11.240 --> 3:40:13.240]  of the legal maxim
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:15.240]  that if you are caught lying
[3:40:15.240 --> 3:40:17.240]  about one thing it is reasonable
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:19.240]  to assume that you are lying about everything
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:21.240]  well senator Blumenfall
[3:40:21.240 --> 3:40:23.240]  what about you're lying
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:25.240]  about serving in the military
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:27.240]  in Vietnam
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:29.240]  when you never were anywhere near
[3:40:29.240 --> 3:40:31.240]  Vietnam
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:33.240]  you use this in every campaign
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:35.240]  for public office you ran in
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:37.240]  we still have no apology from you
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:39.240]  we still have no acknowledgement
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:41.240]  that you lied
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:43.240]  are you really do you really have
[3:40:43.240 --> 3:40:45.240]  the audacity
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:47.240]  to accuse Brett Kavanaugh
[3:40:47.240 --> 3:40:49.240]  of lying giving
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:51.240]  your history as a
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:53.240]  serial liar
[3:40:53.240 --> 3:40:55.240]  yes that's Richard Blumenfall
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:57.240]  he's a disgrace to those brave men
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:40:59.240]  and women from the nutmeg state
[3:40:59.240 --> 3:41:01.240]  who did serve their country
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:03.240]  in Vietnam
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:05.240]  yet he continues
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:07.240]  his unrelenting attack
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:09.240]  on Brett Kavanaugh
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:11.240]  in the meantime
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:13.240]  folks I want to commend Alex Jones
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:15.240]  for having the courage to sue PayPal
[3:41:15.240 --> 3:41:17.240]  it's really not
[3:41:17.240 --> 3:41:19.240]  about the economics it's about
[3:41:19.240 --> 3:41:21.240]  exposing exactly what's going on here
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:23.240]  and before it's all over
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:25.240]  I fear he's going to have to sue
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:27.240]  Apple, Facebook
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:29.240]  Twitter and all of these
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:31.240]  social media platforms
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:33.240]  that are so desperate
[3:41:33.240 --> 3:41:35.240]  to end the clarion call
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:37.240]  of what we do here at info wars
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:39.240]  because you see it's only under oath
[3:41:39.240 --> 3:41:41.240]  and in discovery that we can really
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:43.240]  prove their insidious plot
[3:41:43.240 --> 3:41:45.240]  that we can prove
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:47.240]  that the Apple CEO Tim Cook
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:49.240]  when he says he's never
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:51.240]  discussed Alex Jones with anyone
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:53.240]  is lying through his teeth
[3:41:53.240 --> 3:41:55.240]  in the meantime
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:41:57.240]  these lawsuits cost money
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:41:59.240]  and therefore I ask you to go to the
