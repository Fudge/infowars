[00:00.000 --> 00:03.960]  The Gold Rush lasts 15 to 23 years.
[00:03.960 --> 00:09.640]  Today experts are calling for gold to jump from $6.50 to over $1,000 an ounce or more.
[00:09.640 --> 00:13.920]  Read all about it in the latest Future of Gold magazine from Swiss America.
[00:13.920 --> 00:19.000]  Call now toll free 1-877-703-2193.
[00:19.000 --> 00:26.320]  That's 1-877-703-2193 for the Future of Gold Free.
[00:26.320 --> 00:32.320]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.320]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:45.320 --> 00:48.320]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:48.320 --> 00:52.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52.320 --> 00:59.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59.320 --> 01:06.320]  In the Encyclopedia Britannica 1999 edition, if you turn to Yellow Journalism, it details
[01:06.320 --> 01:12.320]  William Randolph first helping organize and stage propaganda for the Spanish-American War,
[01:12.320 --> 01:17.320]  the enactment of the Federal Reserve and many other globalist imperial programs.
[01:17.320 --> 01:24.320]  There's only one other media group in history known for being more associated with the government
[01:24.320 --> 01:27.320]  and propaganda, that is, in history still operating.
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.320]  George Arwell, of course, fashioning the character Winston off of himself in the Ministry of Truth
[01:32.320 --> 01:39.320]  in a fictional nightmare future dystopia, fashioned the Ministry of Truth off of the BBC.
[01:39.320 --> 01:44.320]  Where black is white, up is down, left is right.
[01:44.320 --> 01:52.320]  And we are joined by Guy Smith, the producer, director who made the Primetime Sunday program,
[01:52.320 --> 01:57.320]  9-11 conspiracies for the BBC. He'll be with us for the entire hour.
[01:57.320 --> 02:05.320]  Dylan Avery will be popping in, as well as Paul Joseph Watson from Sheffield, England.
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.320]  Guy Smith, I appreciate you coming on.
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.320]  No, pleasure, Alex. I don't know about Yellow Journalism, but I guess we just followed
[02:13.320 --> 02:16.320]  the evidence where it led us.
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.320]  Oh, I was speaking of Hearst Publishing. Certainly you're a journalist. You know about Hearst Publishing, right?
[02:20.320 --> 02:21.320]  Certainly do.
[02:21.320 --> 02:28.320]  And, yeah, Cher Toff's cousin, the Homeland Security Director, telling me it wasn't a hit piece,
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.320]  and then it was. I was talking about a previous hit piece.
[02:32.320 --> 02:38.320]  Guy, you told me over the phone that it wasn't a hit piece, but you also laughed and said you don't believe
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.320]  the stuff we've put out. I mean, can you honestly say that this isn't an attempt at debunking?
[02:45.320 --> 02:51.320]  Yeah, Alex. I really appreciate coming on your show, and I admire much of the work you do
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.320]  in talking about subjects that perhaps the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about.
[02:56.320 --> 02:59.320]  But we didn't set out to do a hit piece, as you call it.
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.320]  What we did is that we set out to investigate the evidence and to see where it led us.
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.320]  And if it turned out that some of the conspiracy theories were true,
[03:08.320 --> 03:10.320]  I would have gladly said that in the film.
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.320]  You know, we're not acting on behalf of any government agency.
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.320]  Is it funded and controlled by 10 Downing Street?
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.320]  No, it's not actually. The BBC is funded by the public through a license fee system.
[03:25.320 --> 03:29.320]  It's a complicated system, which doesn't really operate.
[03:29.320 --> 03:32.320]  It doesn't have any similarity to anything that operates in the States.
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.320]  But basically, people who have a television in Britain have to pay a tax.
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.320]  They pay that tax to the government, and then the government hands it on to the BBC.
[03:40.320 --> 03:43.320]  And just two years ago, they made the director of the BBC resign
[03:43.320 --> 03:49.320]  and apologizing for putting out pieces claiming that Blair knew about WMDs and other things.
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.320]  Now, all totally admitted the BBC was right there.
[03:52.320 --> 03:55.320]  Well, I mean, that's a whole different story.
[03:55.320 --> 03:58.320]  But I mean, I can gladly talk about that if you like.
[03:58.320 --> 04:02.320]  But I guess the main thing is to talk about the program that we made last night
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.320]  and that you said a hit piece.
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.320]  And I'm saying it's not a hit piece.
[04:06.320 --> 04:09.320]  What it's doing is investigating the conspiracy theories.
[04:09.320 --> 04:12.320]  And we did that in an objective and a balanced way.
[04:12.320 --> 04:14.320]  And we followed the evidence.
[04:14.320 --> 04:17.320]  We followed the trail, and we followed where the trail led us.
[04:17.320 --> 04:20.320]  A balanced way. You had 11 debunkers.
[04:20.320 --> 04:24.320]  We've timed it out. You gave them at least three times more time
[04:24.320 --> 04:27.320]  than you gave the three 9-11 truthers.
[04:27.320 --> 04:32.320]  Well, we talked to a lot of people on all sides of the debate.
[04:32.320 --> 04:34.320]  Yeah, that's certainly the case.
[04:34.320 --> 04:37.320]  It was almost four to one, almost four to one the time you gave them.
[04:37.320 --> 04:39.320]  Four to one. Is that balanced?
[04:39.320 --> 04:42.320]  Yeah, but Alex, you know that you carry a lot more weight than any debunkers.
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.320]  And when you come on there, you have a lot more impact than anybody
[04:46.320 --> 04:48.320]  who's an expert or anything like that.
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.320]  So you had very condescending and sarcastic, and please, please.
[04:54.320 --> 04:59.320]  You had your say in the film, and many people will watch the program
[04:59.320 --> 05:01.320]  and they can make up their own minds.
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.320]  Why did you interview me for off and on for a week?
[05:05.320 --> 05:08.320]  I know it had to be over 20 hours of footage, and I was in there three minutes.
[05:08.320 --> 05:10.320]  Well, it wasn't actually a week.
[05:10.320 --> 05:14.320]  I mean, we came to Dallas and we met you on the Saturday.
[05:14.320 --> 05:16.320]  You came to Dallas to interview me there,
[05:16.320 --> 05:18.320]  then you interviewed me in Austin in my studio, then the other studio.
[05:18.320 --> 05:20.320]  Off and on for a week, you were here.
[05:20.320 --> 05:22.320]  No, it wasn't. It was over two days, actually.
[05:22.320 --> 05:25.320]  I mean, I can be absolutely quite certain about that.
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.320]  We interviewed you in Dallas, and then we interviewed you the next day in Austin.
[05:29.320 --> 05:31.320]  Guy Smith, stay there.
[05:31.320 --> 05:34.320]  We're going to be right back on the other side of this break to walk through this.
[05:34.320 --> 05:36.320]  We appreciate...
[05:36.320 --> 05:42.320]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands.
[05:42.320 --> 05:44.320]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[05:44.320 --> 05:47.320]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove
[05:47.320 --> 05:49.320]  that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[05:49.320 --> 05:52.320]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:52.320 --> 05:56.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[05:56.320 --> 06:00.320]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.320 --> 06:03.320]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[06:03.320 --> 06:09.320]  a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture,
[06:09.320 --> 06:12.320]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[06:12.320 --> 06:16.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[06:16.320 --> 06:18.320]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.320 --> 06:22.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[07:36.320 --> 07:39.320]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[07:39.320 --> 07:42.320]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods,
[07:42.320 --> 07:45.320]  you are not correctly attacking the cancer,
[07:45.320 --> 07:48.320]  and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[07:48.320 --> 07:51.320]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery,
[07:51.320 --> 07:56.320]  burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[07:56.320 --> 07:59.320]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die,
[07:59.320 --> 08:02.320]  with lace med inks, patented methodology.
[08:02.320 --> 08:06.320]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[08:06.320 --> 08:10.320]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size
[08:10.320 --> 08:14.320]  without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[08:14.320 --> 08:16.320]  Laser technology at its best.

[09:00.320 --> 09:02.320]  So let me just go back.
[09:02.320 --> 09:05.320]  Let's be conservative and say it's 10 hours of footage.
[09:05.320 --> 09:10.320]  Why did you only use three minutes of me in there if it's so balanced?
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.320]  I hate to disagree with you that we interviewed you for 10 hours
[09:14.320 --> 09:16.320]  or for 20 hours or over a week.
[09:16.320 --> 09:18.320]  I mean, we filmed an interview with you.
[09:18.320 --> 09:21.320]  You made some very coaching points,
[09:21.320 --> 09:23.320]  and you're in the film.
[09:23.320 --> 09:25.320]  What's the complaint?
[09:25.320 --> 09:26.320]  Well, I mean, wait a minute.
[09:26.320 --> 09:28.320]  I mean, you interviewed me for like three hours at the grassy knoll
[09:28.320 --> 09:30.320]  and you followed us around and we're taping off and on
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.320]  during a five-hour event at night.
[09:32.320 --> 09:34.320]  And the next day you interviewed me,
[09:34.320 --> 09:36.320]  you videotaped the two-hour radio show
[09:36.320 --> 09:38.320]  and you interviewed me about two hours after.
[09:38.320 --> 09:41.320]  I talked to you constantly on the phone for weeks before that.
[09:41.320 --> 09:42.320]  But let's not digress.
[09:42.320 --> 09:44.320]  There's a lot of points to make here.
[09:44.320 --> 09:47.320]  My point is, are you denying that you had 11 debunkers
[09:47.320 --> 09:49.320]  and three 9-11 truthers in the film
[09:49.320 --> 09:52.320]  and are you denying that they had a lot more time than we did?
[09:52.320 --> 09:54.320]  No, I'm not denying that.
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.320]  We interviewed three main conspiracy theorists,
[09:58.320 --> 10:01.320]  you, Dylan Avery and Jim Fetzer.
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.320]  Your views represent many other people in America.
[10:05.320 --> 10:06.320]  I accept that.
[10:06.320 --> 10:09.320]  And likewise, those of Dylan Avery and Jim Fetzer.
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.320]  And they had a good say in the program.
[10:13.320 --> 10:15.320]  We gave them a lot of attention
[10:15.320 --> 10:19.320]  and a lot of opportunity to voice their views in the program.
[10:19.320 --> 10:22.320]  And the program then went to investigate the claims
[10:22.320 --> 10:25.320]  that you and the other two guys are making.
[10:25.320 --> 10:27.320]  And that's what we did in the program.
[10:27.320 --> 10:31.320]  If it turned out that the trail that we followed
[10:31.320 --> 10:33.320]  led us to a different conclusion,
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.320]  we would have said that all I can report is what we found out.
[10:37.320 --> 10:40.320]  And in the end, people must make up their own views
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.320]  to whether they want to believe us or they don't.
[10:42.320 --> 10:44.320]  And if they don't, I accept that too.
[10:44.320 --> 10:47.320]  I'm not trying to force this down anybody's throat.
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.320]  I'm not trying to force anybody to accept what we're saying.
[10:51.320 --> 10:53.320]  I'm just saying, look, this is what we did.
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.320]  This is what we investigated.
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.320]  Why didn't you have, say, Kevin Ryan of Underwriting Laboratories,
[10:58.320 --> 11:00.320]  their own internal report said that
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.320]  1800-degree jet fuel couldn't melt steel that doesn't melt.
[11:04.320 --> 11:05.320]  And it was molten.
[11:05.320 --> 11:06.320]  That's on record.
[11:06.320 --> 11:08.320]  We have the aerial photographs and the firefighters.
[11:08.320 --> 11:10.320]  It was molten four weeks later.
[11:10.320 --> 11:16.320]  How does 1800 degrees melt steel that non-structural raw steel
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.320]  doesn't start melting till 2,554 degrees?
[11:19.320 --> 11:22.320]  Structural hardened steel until 3,300.
[11:22.320 --> 11:24.320]  And those are numbers people can just pull up instantly
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.320]  on any engineering website.
[11:27.320 --> 11:30.320]  Why didn't you guys include that in your film?
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.320]  Well, the reality is that we had 59 minutes.
[11:34.320 --> 11:39.320]  And frankly, we could have spent all day talking about just the twin towers.
[11:39.320 --> 11:41.320]  We covered a lot of ground in the program.
[11:41.320 --> 11:45.320]  Everything from the hijackers arriving in America before the attacks
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.320]  through to how the government tried to, the CIA and the FBI,
[11:49.320 --> 11:52.320]  tried to cover up their mistakes after the attacks.
[11:52.320 --> 11:55.320]  So, you know, we only have 59 minutes.
[11:55.320 --> 11:57.320]  Just as now, we only have this one hour for this program.
[11:57.320 --> 11:59.320]  There's not everything we can talk about.
[11:59.320 --> 12:02.320]  So we decided to concentrate on some things more than others.
[12:02.320 --> 12:05.320]  Now, clearly, one can make a whole hour just discussing the melting point of steel
[12:05.320 --> 12:07.320]  and exactly what happened to the twin towers.
[12:07.320 --> 12:10.320]  But I guess the bottom line with the twin towers
[12:10.320 --> 12:13.320]  is are you saying that they were demolished?
[12:13.320 --> 12:17.320]  Now, if you were, then one has to look at why that happened
[12:17.320 --> 12:19.320]  and how that happened.
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.320]  And we looked into that and we came to the conclusion
[12:21.320 --> 12:23.320]  that the evidence just doesn't support that conspiracy.
[12:23.320 --> 12:25.320]  Okay, let me stop you right there.
[12:25.320 --> 12:27.320]  Let me bring on Paul Watson from England who's been writing articles.
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.320]  You may have even seen some concerning the piece that you did.
[12:30.320 --> 12:33.320]  You use a nova simulation in the piece
[12:33.320 --> 12:36.320]  that has been completely debunked by David Ray Griffin and others.
[12:36.320 --> 12:38.320]  They claim there's no central steel columns.
[12:38.320 --> 12:40.320]  They claim it was a hollow shaft.
[12:40.320 --> 12:43.320]  Paul Watson, you want to comment on the nova piece?
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.320]  Well, yeah, firstly, I would like to say that
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.320]  I actually counted 13 debunkers compared to so-called conspiracy theorists.
[12:51.320 --> 12:53.320]  So it was an even greater number.
[12:53.320 --> 12:55.320]  And I would ask Mr. Smith,
[12:55.320 --> 12:59.320]  why when we've had government officials, scientists, first responders,
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.320]  MI5 agents on this show talking about our side of the evidence,
[13:03.320 --> 13:09.320]  did he decide to give 10 minutes to a producer of a sci-fi show
[13:09.320 --> 13:13.320]  that went off the air five years ago?
[13:13.320 --> 13:15.320]  Mr. Smith?
[13:15.320 --> 13:18.320]  Yeah, we decided to talk to Frank Spottnitz
[13:18.320 --> 13:22.320]  because he had very many interesting things to say about conspiracy theories.
[13:22.320 --> 13:23.320]  It's as simple as that.
[13:23.320 --> 13:27.320]  Basically, that it's a modern religion of delusionals.
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.320]  Now, in the nova piece, it shows...
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.320]  Paul, you've measured it in time to give him the exact seconds,
[13:35.320 --> 13:39.320]  and it comes out to about 55 seconds for the towers to fall,
[13:39.320 --> 13:41.320]  but in reality, they fell in a little over 10 seconds,
[13:41.320 --> 13:44.320]  so even the nova piece is false.
[13:44.320 --> 13:45.320]  Paul?
[13:45.320 --> 13:46.320]  Well, that's right.
[13:46.320 --> 13:52.320]  If you take the conservative estimate and say the towers fell in 14 to 16 seconds,
[13:52.320 --> 13:55.320]  what we've got is Mr. Smith in the documentary
[13:55.320 --> 13:58.320]  near the beginning when he talks about control demolition.
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.320]  He uses a graphic animation from nova,
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.320]  which is a PBS scientific documentary,
[14:05.320 --> 14:11.320]  which depicts the collapse of the twin towers at a rate of six floors per second,
[14:11.320 --> 14:16.320]  meaning that the total collapse of each tower would have taken around 66 seconds.
[14:16.320 --> 14:20.320]  So it's a patently false and misleading graphic to use,
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.320]  and my question is, will there be a retraction of this graphic,
[14:25.320 --> 14:27.320]  which is blatantly false and misleading,
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.320]  and only lends to the bias that was already decided on
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.320]  in dismissing questions about control demolition?
[14:36.320 --> 14:37.320]  Mr. Smith?
[14:37.320 --> 14:39.320]  That graphic wasn't misleading.
[14:39.320 --> 14:41.320]  I don't know, you're talking about it coming from nova.
[14:41.320 --> 14:44.320]  It was actually made by the BBC, that graphic.
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.320]  Well, the point is, it was used on a program as well, I don't know.
[14:48.320 --> 14:55.320]  But the point is, if you're suggesting that the World Trade Center was demolished by explosives,
[14:55.320 --> 15:00.320]  then I would say, where is the cast iron evidence to back that up?
[15:00.320 --> 15:02.320]  And moreover, if you're saying...
[15:02.320 --> 15:04.320]  Okay, let me stop you then.
[15:04.320 --> 15:08.320]  Craig Bartmer, who was in the news on record,
[15:08.320 --> 15:10.320]  given citations on the pile for five days,
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.320]  their one-seven collapse has reported,
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.320]  and I've got now over 15 firefighters and police coming on in the next week.
[15:17.320 --> 15:19.320]  We're lining them all up for one show.
[15:19.320 --> 15:20.320]  Hope you tune in.
[15:20.320 --> 15:22.320]  It'll be three hours of witnesses that said,
[15:22.320 --> 15:25.320]  we were told, get back from seven, they were going to bring it down,
[15:25.320 --> 15:28.320]  so it wouldn't damage other buildings, they were going to blow it up.
[15:28.320 --> 15:30.320]  We have CNN with two cops going, get back, get back.
[15:30.320 --> 15:33.320]  Seven's going to come down, get back, they're bringing it down.
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.320]  Okay, we clearly have this over and over again.
[15:37.320 --> 15:42.320]  In fact, right now, go ahead, let's first play the molten steel clip from New York TV.
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.320]  Here are firefighters talking about molten steel like a foundry like lava.
[15:46.320 --> 15:47.320]  Here it is.
[15:47.320 --> 15:53.320]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel, molten steel running down the channel rails
[15:53.320 --> 15:55.320]  like you're in a foundry.
[15:55.320 --> 15:56.320]  Like lava.
[15:56.320 --> 15:57.320]  Like lava.
[15:57.320 --> 15:59.320]  Like a volcano.
[15:59.320 --> 16:02.320]  Okay, now let's play the next clip,
[16:02.320 --> 16:04.320]  just in case you've never seen these or heard these,
[16:04.320 --> 16:05.320]  and the videos are up on the website.
[16:05.320 --> 16:08.320]  Here's CNN with two cops saying, get back, they're going to bring it down.
[16:08.320 --> 16:10.320]  Seven's coming down, they say it three times.
[16:10.320 --> 16:11.320]  Here it is.
[16:11.320 --> 16:12.320]  CNN.
[16:12.320 --> 16:32.320]  Okay, so we not only have that, and again, there's over 15 coming on the show.
[16:32.320 --> 16:33.320]  We already had a bunch of them on.
[16:33.320 --> 16:36.320]  I've interviewed Bartimer for a video for an upcoming film in New York.
[16:36.320 --> 16:38.320]  He can barely breathe.
[16:38.320 --> 16:43.320]  Now, he tried to be interviewed by you, and you didn't want to talk to him,
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.320]  and he said that he was there, and they said, get back, they're going to bring the building down.
[16:47.320 --> 16:49.320]  Now, you just heard clips.
[16:49.320 --> 16:52.320]  I'm asking you, why didn't you want to talk to a police officer?
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.320]  Well, I don't know about that particular police officer.
[16:57.320 --> 16:58.320]  But you met him.
[16:58.320 --> 16:59.320]  You met him.
[16:59.320 --> 17:00.320]  He was there.
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.320]  He went up in upstate New York to meet with you.
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.320]  I guess he must have been one of the people who is at Dylan Avery's house.
[17:06.320 --> 17:08.320]  Yes, yes, a police officer.
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.320]  What you're referring to.
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.320]  Yes, yes.
[17:10.320 --> 17:15.320]  Well, look, we could spend all day talking about whether there was molten steel
[17:15.320 --> 17:18.320]  or whether it was something else in the basement of the World Trade Center.
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.320]  But what you have to do is to look at the bottom line theory.
[17:22.320 --> 17:25.320]  Now, if you're saying those twin towers were demolished,
[17:25.320 --> 17:31.320]  I have yet to understand why they were demolished and how they were demolished.
[17:31.320 --> 17:35.320]  All I can say is that the evidence that we have looked at just doesn't stack up.
[17:35.320 --> 17:40.320]  Is it really plausible that people would have flown two planes into these twin towers
[17:40.320 --> 17:42.320]  and laced them with demolition charges?
[17:42.320 --> 17:43.320]  We're not saying that.
[17:43.320 --> 17:44.320]  No, they were preplaced.
[17:44.320 --> 17:45.320]  What about seven?
[17:45.320 --> 17:47.320]  No plane hit seven.
[17:47.320 --> 17:52.320]  The CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence, it was a giant intelligence building.
[17:52.320 --> 17:54.320]  It had the command center.
[17:54.320 --> 17:56.320]  FEMA claimed they were there the night before.
[17:56.320 --> 17:57.320]  Then they tried to retract.
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.320]  Then Giuliani in congressional testimony admitted they were running tripod tube,
[18:02.320 --> 18:08.320]  an attack on the complex, so they'd already moved out the night before to the end of the pier.
[18:08.320 --> 18:14.320]  But is it really plausible, do you think, that World Trade Center seven would have been demolished
[18:14.320 --> 18:20.320]  and five years later nobody who is involved in planting those demolition charges
[18:20.320 --> 18:26.320]  wouldn't have spoken to their wife or girlfriend or come forward and admitted that they were part of that?
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.320]  Hold on, let me finish.
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.320]  They have Tuskegee for 40-plus years killing black men with syphilis secret, the atomic soldiers,
[18:33.320 --> 18:37.320]  the ringworm children in Israel where they radiated 110,000.
[18:37.320 --> 18:41.320]  The Manhattan Project kept secret with over 100,000 people involved.
[18:41.320 --> 18:42.320]  Come on.
[18:42.320 --> 18:47.320]  The people who were involved in that in black ops know they'd be killed the minute they went public.
[18:47.320 --> 18:52.320]  Well, you talk about the Manhattan Project and that's a very interesting example,
[18:52.320 --> 18:57.320]  but it's something that's quite different because here, remember, 3,000 American citizens died.
[18:57.320 --> 19:01.320]  Or American and citizens from other countries as well, including Britain.
[19:01.320 --> 19:07.320]  So, you know, it's like you seem to think that we're trying to cover something up.
[19:07.320 --> 19:09.320]  You know, we're not covering anything up.
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.320]  All we're doing is looking at the evidence in an objective and dispassionate way
[19:13.320 --> 19:16.320]  and trying to test whether it stands up to discrimination.
[19:16.320 --> 19:18.320]  Guy Smith, no modern steel building.
[19:18.320 --> 19:25.320]  You can show some two-story thing in England or some two-story thing that's tar-roofed in Chicago.
[19:25.320 --> 19:27.320]  No modern steel building has ever fallen.
[19:27.320 --> 19:31.320]  Look at the Madrid, 100-foot wide-eyed flames, almost two days burning.
[19:31.320 --> 19:33.320]  No major steel members collapsed.
[19:33.320 --> 19:35.320]  It's scientific facts.
[19:35.320 --> 19:41.320]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane, had small fires, and symmetrically collapsed.
[19:41.320 --> 19:42.320]  You said, give us evidence.
[19:42.320 --> 19:45.320]  I just gave you the name of a police officer.
[19:45.320 --> 19:47.320]  I just played CNN where they're saying, get back.
[19:47.320 --> 19:48.320]  They're going to bring the building down.
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.320]  It's going to blow up.
[19:49.320 --> 19:50.320]  Now, what more?
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.320]  I mean, I can go on for hours with these clips and you will not address it.
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.320]  No, it's not that I'm not addressing it.
[19:56.320 --> 20:03.320]  I'm just saying that I don't believe that that evidence proves that there was a conspiracy to demolish World Trade Center 7.
[20:03.320 --> 20:06.320]  And it's something, you know, I accept that we're not going to agree on this.
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.320]  And that's fair enough.
[20:07.320 --> 20:13.320]  And I'm very happy to come on the program and talk about my view and say, look, this is what we've found out.
[20:13.320 --> 20:20.320]  If we had found evidence to show that it was demolished by explosives, you know, we would have put that in our film.
[20:20.320 --> 20:22.320]  We're not trying to cover anything up here.
[20:22.320 --> 20:27.320]  All I can say is that I don't believe the evidence that you're putting forward.
[20:27.320 --> 20:29.320]  All right, stay there.
[20:29.320 --> 20:35.320]  I'd like to hear how you don't believe it and walk through things with Dylan Avery and Paul Joseph Watson on the other side.
[20:35.320 --> 20:38.320]  The war on terrorism.
[20:38.320 --> 20:41.320]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[20:41.320 --> 20:46.320]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[20:46.320 --> 20:47.320]  So what do you do?
[20:47.320 --> 20:52.320]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[20:52.320 --> 20:55.320]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[20:55.320 --> 21:00.320]  Sheltering in place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical and radioactive fallout,
[21:00.320 --> 21:06.320]  developed by Wayne LaBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health,
[21:06.320 --> 21:10.320]  communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S. government,
[21:10.320 --> 21:17.320]  gives you easy-to-follow video instructions and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[21:37.320 --> 21:39.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[21:39.320 --> 21:42.320]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[21:42.320 --> 21:47.320]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[21:47.320 --> 21:52.320]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued.
[21:52.320 --> 21:58.320]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.320]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[22:02.320 --> 22:06.320]  it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[22:06.320 --> 22:11.320]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[22:11.320 --> 22:15.320]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[22:15.320 --> 22:20.320]  Call for your copy today. It's 800-686-2237.
[22:20.320 --> 22:24.320]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market,
[22:24.320 --> 22:27.320]  you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[22:27.320 --> 22:34.320]  Call 800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[22:34.320 --> 22:38.320]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[22:38.320 --> 22:42.320]  Did you know that at the 29-pawned Marine Base located in California,
[22:42.320 --> 22:45.320]  a questionnaire was given to Marine Station there?
[22:45.320 --> 22:49.320]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[22:49.320 --> 22:54.320]  Would the Marines accept this? The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was,
[22:54.320 --> 23:02.320]  I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[23:02.320 --> 23:06.320]  Is this what Americans want? Force confiscation of guns?
[23:06.320 --> 23:11.320]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free
[23:11.320 --> 23:14.320]  one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[23:14.320 --> 23:21.320]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[23:21.320 --> 23:27.320]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[23:27.320 --> 23:35.320]  Please call now. Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[23:35.320 --> 23:41.320]  It's a fact. You can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[23:41.320 --> 23:46.320]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.320]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[23:50.320 --> 23:54.320]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and unlike the Federal Reserve,
[23:54.320 --> 23:57.320]  the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[23:57.320 --> 24:04.320]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[24:04.320 --> 24:07.320]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[24:07.320 --> 24:13.320]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[24:13.320 --> 24:17.320]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[24:17.320 --> 24:26.320]  Call Day of Jubilee. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time at 920 293 8024.
[24:26.320 --> 24:49.320]  That's 920 293 8024 and ask for Robert. Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[24:49.320 --> 24:57.320]  Welcome back, Guy Smith. I appreciate him joining us, spending time with us today.
[24:57.320 --> 25:01.320]  Guy, I want to let Paul ask you questions. Dylan Avery asked the question first.
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.320]  We do appreciate your time and in the next segment, it's a long 15-minute segment.
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.320]  This is just a quick five-minute one. We'll let you run for a few minutes and I'll shut up and hear what you have to say.
[25:09.320 --> 25:12.320]  But I'd like you to answer this question because we've answered yours.
[25:12.320 --> 25:19.320]  I kept begging you, please let me cover Operation Northwood's, the official U.S. government plan to carry out 9-11,
[25:19.320 --> 25:21.320]  style attacks to blame it on a foreign enemy.
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.320]  I said, Gulf of Tonkin was staged, now declassified, Operation Ajax and Iran.
[25:26.320 --> 25:30.320]  That's so important that there is a past MO.
[25:30.320 --> 25:33.320]  People who try to debunk us always say, why would they do it? What would they gain?
[25:33.320 --> 25:41.320]  Trillions in oil, billions in opium, control, military contracts, domestic police state, just like Hitler burned his own Reichstag.
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.320]  You told me, no, Northwood isn't going in here, it doesn't fit into it, it doesn't matter.
[25:47.320 --> 25:50.320]  Now tell me, why have you made a film about the 9-11 Truth Movement?
[25:50.320 --> 25:55.320]  Why you wouldn't cover the central issues of the history of government-sponsored terror
[25:55.320 --> 25:59.320]  and the history of plans to carry out terror against the American people?
[25:59.320 --> 26:01.320]  Will you please answer that question?
[26:01.320 --> 26:10.320]  Yes, indeed, Alex. Operation Northwood is fascinating and from a historical point of view, it's a very interesting story.
[26:10.320 --> 26:17.320]  But I have yet to see any evidence that links Operation Northwood to what happened on 9-11.
[26:17.320 --> 26:22.320]  There's no doubt that the American government and other governments, no doubt the British government as well,
[26:22.320 --> 26:28.320]  has been involved in all sorts of operations in the past, force-flag operations as you call it.
[26:28.320 --> 26:36.320]  But I have no doubt, as you mentioned, the Gulf of Tonkin is a very interesting example.
[26:36.320 --> 26:45.320]  But I have no evidence and I have yet to see any convincing theories that show that what happened
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.320]  with the proposal of Operation Northwood was put into practice on 9-11.
[26:49.320 --> 26:53.320]  Well, this is why it's important, Guy, and you make a valid point.
[26:53.320 --> 27:00.320]  This is why it's important. Let's say a 6'2 grey-haired man with a red birthmark on his left cheek
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.320]  is videotaped robbing a bank and pistol-whipping the clerk.
[27:05.320 --> 27:12.320]  And then the police run through a database of mug books and they notice that a bank robber who fixed that description
[27:12.320 --> 27:15.320]  got out of prison six months ago and lives in the area.
[27:15.320 --> 27:20.320]  And they go by his house and they pull him over when he leaves and he's got the cash in the trunk.
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.320]  If you've got people that have done this before and plan to do this, my goodness, I think that's pretty darn important.
[27:26.320 --> 27:27.320]  What do you think?
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.320]  Well, I think that Operation Northwood was a very interesting subject.
[27:32.320 --> 27:39.320]  It's something that was talked about more than 40 years ago, just because there was this plan more than 40 years ago,
[27:39.320 --> 27:45.320]  which I don't deny, if you're absolutely right, it existed, although of course it wasn't actually adopted by the president.
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.320]  Well, it was green-lighted and Kennedy said no and then got his head blown off.
[27:48.320 --> 27:51.320]  And let me guess, you don't think the government was involved killing Kennedy, right?
[27:51.320 --> 27:57.320]  Well, that's a whole other story. I don't know, to be honest, because I haven't investigated the Kennedy assassination.
[27:57.320 --> 28:02.320]  The debunkers are losing because 92% of Americans in major polls know the truth now, Guy.
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.320]  Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know about JFK, to be honest.
[28:05.320 --> 28:13.320]  But what I do know is that I haven't seen any evidence that links Operation Northwood to what happened at 9-11.
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.320]  There's no doubt, as I said before, that there are lots of operations that have happened in the past
[28:17.320 --> 28:21.320]  that have been carried out by the American government and other governments that are very unsavory.
[28:21.320 --> 28:25.320]  But that doesn't mean to say that 9-11 was one of those operations.
[28:25.320 --> 28:29.320]  Because I haven't seen the evidence. If you show me the evidence, then I'll believe it.
[28:29.320 --> 28:33.320]  Uh-huh. It shows that they've planned this before and they've carried out operations before.
[28:33.320 --> 28:34.320]  Well, let's go ahead.
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.320]  Well, I think what it shows is that 40 years ago, there were people who thought that things like this could be done and should be done.
[28:39.320 --> 28:49.320]  And then in 1964, it was done with Tonkin and in 1967, it was done with the Liberty and similar things, Operation Gladio in Europe.
[28:49.320 --> 28:50.320]  But let's just go back.
[28:50.320 --> 28:56.320]  Oh, and that doesn't prove that the present occupants of the White House, and I'm not defending them anyway.
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.320]  I'm just saying I haven't seen the evidence.
[28:58.320 --> 29:04.320]  Why would British SAS members last year caught dressed up like Arabs driving around shooting people with plastic explosives?
[29:04.320 --> 29:11.320]  Well, let's just keep on Operation Northwood from what I'm saying is that just because there was this plan 40 years ago,
[29:11.320 --> 29:18.320]  it doesn't prove that the current occupants of the White House dusted it off and put it into practice in 2001.
[29:18.320 --> 29:24.320]  Even though PNAC said we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event, and Brzezinski said we needed a Pearl Harbor event.
[29:24.320 --> 29:31.320]  By the way, Brzezinski said two weeks ago in Congressional testimony that there may be a false flag attack blamed on Iran in this country.
[29:31.320 --> 29:36.320]  Well, I think the PNAC report didn't say we should have a Pearl Harbor event.
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.320]  It said it would help.
[29:37.320 --> 29:39.320]  Minus that catalyzing event.
[29:39.320 --> 29:42.320]  And then Brzezinski said it would help.
[29:42.320 --> 29:49.320]  I don't think it says actually it would help. I think what it says is that it wouldn't happen unless there was a Pearl Harbor event.
[29:49.320 --> 29:53.320]  Gee, we want to invade these countries. It won't happen unless this happens.
[29:53.320 --> 29:55.320]  We need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.320]  Well, I mean, I hear what you're saying.
[29:58.320 --> 30:04.320]  I guess people who disagree with what you're saying would say if it really was then a plot,
[30:04.320 --> 30:09.320]  why would the PNAC report writers publish their report in advance and put it all over the Internet?
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.320]  Because they're arrogant. Stay there. I apologize to Paul and Dylan.
[30:13.320 --> 30:14.320]  We will go to you guys.
[30:14.320 --> 30:17.320]  You can have the floor in questions for Guy Smith on the other side.
[30:17.320 --> 30:18.320]  We'll be right back.
[30:18.320 --> 30:20.320]  Thank you for joining us, guys. Stay with us.
[30:25.320 --> 30:29.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[30:29.320 --> 30:33.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:36.320 --> 30:38.320]  Hey, Jane. How's it going?
[30:38.320 --> 30:40.320]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[30:40.320 --> 30:44.320]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[30:44.320 --> 30:46.320]  Oh, Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[30:46.320 --> 30:51.320]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again if there was only something natural I could take
[30:51.320 --> 30:54.320]  that would help control my blood sugar that really works.
[30:54.320 --> 30:56.320]  Have you tried sucrablast?
[30:56.320 --> 31:00.320]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds,
[31:00.320 --> 31:02.320]  there's sucrablast.
[31:02.320 --> 31:07.320]  Sucrablast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.
[31:07.320 --> 31:11.320]  For a limited time, you can get a free consultation from a sucrablast specialist.

[31:14.320 --> 31:17.320]  That's 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[31:17.320 --> 31:21.320]  Or visit them on the web at MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[31:21.320 --> 31:24.320]  That's MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[31:24.320 --> 31:26.320]  So, Jane, what do you think?
[31:26.320 --> 31:30.320]  I'm going to call sucrablast to set up a free consultation right now.
[31:30.320 --> 31:33.320]  Excellent, Jane. You'll be glad you did.
[31:33.320 --> 31:37.320]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24,
[31:37.320 --> 31:40.320]  what shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[31:40.320 --> 31:42.320]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars,
[31:42.320 --> 31:45.320]  for nations shall rise against nations and kingdom against kingdom,
[31:45.320 --> 31:49.320]  and there shall be famines, disease and earthquakes in many places.
[31:49.320 --> 31:51.320]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[31:51.320 --> 31:55.320]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[31:55.320 --> 31:58.320]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[31:58.320 --> 32:01.320]  Second Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy,
[32:01.320 --> 32:03.320]  and you do well if you take heed.
[32:03.320 --> 32:07.320]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[32:07.320 --> 32:10.320]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer,
[32:10.320 --> 32:12.320]  Packet B, the Unholy Alliance.
[32:12.320 --> 32:14.320]  These materials document the global leaders,
[32:14.320 --> 32:17.320]  political and religious, behind the scenes.
[32:17.320 --> 32:20.320]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy,
[32:20.320 --> 32:23.320]  tyrants and wars, the new world order and much more.
[32:23.320 --> 32:26.320]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[32:26.320 --> 32:30.320]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[32:30.320 --> 32:35.320]  That's 1-888-211-1715 and ask for Packet B.
[32:35.320 --> 32:39.320]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[32:39.320 --> 32:41.320]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[33:34.320 --> 33:50.320]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[33:50.320 --> 33:53.320]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
[33:53.320 --> 33:56.320]  and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[33:56.320 --> 33:59.320]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[33:59.320 --> 34:02.320]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[34:02.320 --> 34:05.320]  We fired one small one and they began to run it
[34:05.320 --> 34:10.320]  down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[34:10.320 --> 34:13.320]  We looked down a river and we see the British come
[34:13.320 --> 34:16.320]  and there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums.
[34:16.320 --> 34:18.320]  They stepped so high and they made a bugle string.
[34:18.320 --> 34:21.320]  We stood beside our cotton veils and didn't say a thing.
[34:21.320 --> 34:24.320]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[34:24.320 --> 34:27.320]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[34:27.320 --> 34:29.320]  We fired one small one and they began to run it
[34:29.320 --> 34:34.320]  down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[34:34.320 --> 34:37.320]  Old Hickree said we could take them by surprise
[34:37.320 --> 34:40.320]  if we didn't fire muskies till we looked them in the eye.
[34:40.320 --> 34:43.320]  We held our fire till we see their faces well.
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.320]  Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave them well.
[34:46.320 --> 34:49.320]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[34:49.320 --> 34:52.320]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[34:52.320 --> 34:54.320]  We fired one small one and they began to run it
[34:54.320 --> 34:57.320]  down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[34:57.320 --> 34:58.320]  Welcome back.
[35:01.320 --> 35:05.320]  Our guest is Guy Smith, BBC producer, director.
[35:05.320 --> 35:08.320]  We appreciate him coming on and letting us go over the piece
[35:08.320 --> 35:11.320]  that he put out.
[35:11.320 --> 35:15.320]  And now I'd like to give Bill and Avery a chance
[35:15.320 --> 35:17.320]  to ask a few questions and then of course Guy
[35:17.320 --> 35:19.320]  can ask questions of him or make statements that he'd like
[35:19.320 --> 35:21.320]  and then Paul Watson to come back in.
[35:21.320 --> 35:24.320]  Bill and Avery, producer of Loose Change 1 and 2,
[35:24.320 --> 35:26.320]  that by the way we carry at infowars.com
[35:26.320 --> 35:28.320]  and prisonplanet.com where you can watch for free
[35:28.320 --> 35:32.320]  at Google Video as well as my film Terror Storm.
[35:32.320 --> 35:34.320]  Let's now go to Guy Smith.
[35:34.320 --> 35:37.320]  Dylan, do you have any questions or comments for him?
[35:37.320 --> 35:39.320]  Yeah, my first one is how can I drop out of something
[35:39.320 --> 35:41.320]  I never attended?
[35:41.320 --> 35:43.320]  So I think that...
[35:43.320 --> 35:45.320]  Well, your narrator referred to me
[35:45.320 --> 35:48.320]  as a self-professed dropout indicating that I actually
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.320]  went to college and stopped attending when in reality
[35:51.320 --> 35:53.320]  I applied for Purchase College twice
[35:53.320 --> 35:55.320]  and because the film program there is entirely selective,
[35:55.320 --> 35:57.320]  I was not selected.
[35:57.320 --> 36:00.320]  So in all of your research I found it interesting
[36:00.320 --> 36:02.320]  that you couldn't even get the facts about me right.
[36:02.320 --> 36:04.320]  And of course that's been one of the rumors
[36:04.320 --> 36:06.320]  is that you're this evil dropout.
[36:06.320 --> 36:08.320]  I mean, so is Bill Gates and Rush Limbaugh
[36:08.320 --> 36:10.320]  and Dick Cheney for that matter,
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.320]  but the point is that you'd mentioned earlier
[36:12.320 --> 36:14.320]  you thought that would be in the piece.
[36:14.320 --> 36:17.320]  So that guy, you talk about he's a self-professed dropout,
[36:17.320 --> 36:19.320]  but you don't have video of Dylan saying he was a dropout
[36:19.320 --> 36:21.320]  because he never went to college.
[36:21.320 --> 36:23.320]  Yeah, I know Dylan didn't go to college.
[36:23.320 --> 36:26.320]  I guess the way we use the term dropout in English,
[36:26.320 --> 36:28.320]  I don't know about American,
[36:28.320 --> 36:31.320]  is somebody who doesn't go the conventional route.
[36:31.320 --> 36:33.320]  It doesn't mean literally that you dropped out of college
[36:33.320 --> 36:35.320]  because I know that you...
[36:35.320 --> 36:37.320]  Let me bring Paul Watson up. He's English.
[36:37.320 --> 36:40.320]  Okay, let's bring Paul Watson from Sheffield on.
[36:40.320 --> 36:43.320]  Paul, does dropout mean you never went to college?
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.320]  No, dropout implies explicitly
[36:46.320 --> 36:48.320]  that you went to university
[36:48.320 --> 36:50.320]  and were not able to complete the course
[36:50.320 --> 36:52.320]  the girl you dropped out.
[36:52.320 --> 36:54.320]  That's what it means in America. That's what it means in England.
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.320]  Well, it can also mean that you drop out of a system
[36:57.320 --> 36:59.320]  or you drop out of society.
[36:59.320 --> 37:01.320]  It can mean lots of things.
[37:01.320 --> 37:04.320]  Okay, well listen, I am a college dropout
[37:04.320 --> 37:06.320]  even though I had a 3.8 grade average
[37:06.320 --> 37:08.320]  because I didn't need it.
[37:08.320 --> 37:10.320]  Now Steve Watson that works in our research department
[37:10.320 --> 37:12.320]  has a master's degree in political science and foreign affairs,
[37:12.320 --> 37:15.320]  so he thinks it's an inside job too.
[37:15.320 --> 37:18.320]  He has a master's degree, is it okay now?
[37:18.320 --> 37:21.320]  No, I'm not trying to dissuade anybody
[37:21.320 --> 37:23.320]  from believing it's an inside job.
[37:23.320 --> 37:26.320]  If you want to believe it's an inside job, that's fine.
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.320]  That's up to you and I fully accept
[37:30.320 --> 37:32.320]  that you have a right to think that.
[37:32.320 --> 37:35.320]  All I can say is that we investigated the story,
[37:35.320 --> 37:38.320]  we looked into it, we didn't find the evidence
[37:38.320 --> 37:41.320]  that supports that theory and that's all.
[37:41.320 --> 37:43.320]  There's nothing more to it than that.
[37:43.320 --> 37:46.320]  Well, you know what, maybe Paul in Sheffield
[37:46.320 --> 37:49.320]  means different, so maybe somebody from London.
[37:49.320 --> 37:53.320]  Born and bred, London, call in 1-800-259-9231.
[37:53.320 --> 37:56.320]  Let us know, does dropout mean never went to college?
[37:56.320 --> 37:58.320]  Because in my book that's not what it means
[37:58.320 --> 38:00.320]  and Paul says you're incorrect.
[38:00.320 --> 38:03.320]  Come on, guy, we know it's a snipe at Dillon Avery.
[38:03.320 --> 38:06.320]  Like he's some gutter snipe miscreant
[38:06.320 --> 38:08.320]  out there rubbing his oily hands together
[38:08.320 --> 38:12.320]  and attacking the beautiful crown's operation.
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.320]  Well, I would say on the contrary,
[38:14.320 --> 38:16.320]  we interviewed Dillon for the film
[38:16.320 --> 38:18.320]  and we showed how his film has had enormous impact
[38:18.320 --> 38:20.320]  and has been viewed tens of millions of times
[38:20.320 --> 38:22.320]  all around the world.
[38:22.320 --> 38:24.320]  And we were trying to make a serious point.
[38:24.320 --> 38:27.320]  We were showing how now conspiracy theories
[38:27.320 --> 38:29.320]  can proliferate through the internet
[38:29.320 --> 38:31.320]  in a way that they couldn't have done in the past.
[38:31.320 --> 38:33.320]  Do you think there should be some type of regulation
[38:33.320 --> 38:35.320]  to stop this type of hateful spread?
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.320]  No, not at all. I think it's a very healthy thing for society
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.320]  and I think it's great that you're talking about it
[38:42.320 --> 38:45.320]  and that's why I'm very happy to come on your show
[38:45.320 --> 38:47.320]  because I think it's good that we should talk about
[38:47.320 --> 38:49.320]  all these things. I think that's really important
[38:49.320 --> 38:51.320]  and that's why we made the program.
[38:51.320 --> 38:53.320]  Okay, fair enough. Dillon, any other questions?
[38:53.320 --> 38:55.320]  Dillon, any other questions?
[38:55.320 --> 38:57.320]  Man, Alex, I got tons of questions.
[38:57.320 --> 38:59.320]  My first one is, you know, Guy,
[38:59.320 --> 39:01.320]  your narrator makes a lot of jabs about how
[39:01.320 --> 39:03.320]  we're disrespecting the family members
[39:03.320 --> 39:05.320]  and how we're going to continue to ask questions
[39:05.320 --> 39:07.320]  no matter how much it displeases the victims.
[39:07.320 --> 39:09.320]  Have you ever heard of the Jersey Girls?
[39:09.320 --> 39:11.320]  Maybe the Family Steering Committee?
[39:11.320 --> 39:14.320]  Maybe Bill Doyle? Maybe Bob McElvane?
[39:14.320 --> 39:16.320]  You know, I mean, the list and names are what I want to add.
[39:16.320 --> 39:19.320]  The head of the biggest victims family group
[39:19.320 --> 39:22.320]  who lost his son in the attacks
[39:22.320 --> 39:24.320]  said that he believes it's an inside job.
[39:24.320 --> 39:27.320]  We have the transcript in the audio on prisonplanet.com
[39:27.320 --> 39:29.320]  and he said this last year and he said that more than half
[39:29.320 --> 39:31.320]  of his members believe it's an inside job.
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.320]  So what do you say to that, Guy?
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.320]  What I say is that I accept that they have the right to that view.
[39:37.320 --> 39:40.320]  All I can say is that we didn't come to that conclusion.
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.320]  Yes, there'll be many people who are families of victims
[39:44.320 --> 39:46.320]  who support the conspiracy theories
[39:46.320 --> 39:48.320]  claiming that it was an inside job.
[39:48.320 --> 39:50.320]  The official story is a conspiracy theory, Guy.
[39:50.320 --> 39:54.320]  You claim two passports fell out of the sky at ground zero,
[39:54.320 --> 39:57.320]  unburned, and then the FBI had to retract that.
[39:57.320 --> 39:59.320]  They planted those passports.
[39:59.320 --> 40:02.320]  Well, I haven't seen any evidence to prove that those passports
[40:02.320 --> 40:03.320]  have gone.
[40:03.320 --> 40:07.320]  I've seen lots of theories on the Internet.
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.320]  No, the FBI has now said that they didn't find the passports.
[40:11.320 --> 40:13.320]  You didn't know that?
[40:13.320 --> 40:15.320]  Well, I think the passports, as I understand it,
[40:15.320 --> 40:18.320]  were found by passers-by and handed into the FBI.
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.320]  Oh, my gosh.
[40:21.320 --> 40:23.320]  Just like all the confession letters.
[40:23.320 --> 40:25.320]  Hey, I tried to get you to talk about how the dean
[40:25.320 --> 40:27.320]  of the Defense Language School said three of the hijackers
[40:27.320 --> 40:32.320]  trained in a secret program in 2000 in Monterey, California.
[40:32.320 --> 40:34.320]  I tried to get you to cover Newsweek where hijackers
[40:34.320 --> 40:37.320]  were reportedly trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[40:37.320 --> 40:39.320]  I tried to get you to interview Mr. Springman,
[40:39.320 --> 40:41.320]  the former head of the U.S. Embassy,
[40:41.320 --> 40:43.320]  who was told let him into the U.S.
[40:43.320 --> 40:45.320]  they're really anti-terror fighters
[40:45.320 --> 40:47.320]  and that they're terror designations to cover.
[40:47.320 --> 40:49.320]  Guy, why didn't that make it in the film?
[40:49.320 --> 40:52.320]  Well, yeah, there are over 50 different conspiracy theories
[40:52.320 --> 40:54.320]  around 9-11 because...
[40:54.320 --> 40:57.320]  That's admitted, sir. They started court-martialing
[40:57.320 --> 40:59.320]  the head of the Defense Language School
[40:59.320 --> 41:02.320]  until he said he would shut up about it.
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.320]  I talked to him.
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.320]  What's the bottom line that you're trying to say, Alex?
[41:08.320 --> 41:12.320]  Are you saying that we're part of this conspiracy?
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.320]  Well, I'm saying that just like people in Russia or Germany
[41:16.320 --> 41:19.320]  or China couldn't believe the government had gone bad
[41:19.320 --> 41:21.320]  and then later they had to admit it,
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.320]  I think that you have a preconceived notion,
[41:24.320 --> 41:27.320]  a preconceived view, and I'm saying you disregarded
[41:27.320 --> 41:30.320]  most of the key evidence, like 44,000 U.S. troops
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.320]  and 18,000 British troops
[41:32.320 --> 41:34.320]  mashed into Shikistan and Uzbekistan
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.320]  in the four months before 9-11
[41:36.320 --> 41:38.320]  in Newsweek and Associated Press reporting
[41:38.320 --> 41:40.320]  that Bush, the day before the attacks, had the launch orders
[41:40.320 --> 41:43.320]  to attack Afghanistan on his desk.
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.320]  Well, I mean, it's very difficult to answer them
[41:48.320 --> 41:50.320]  from these points because what you're doing
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.320]  is you're quoting things that you claim that you've heard
[41:53.320 --> 41:55.320]  and there's some things that are on the Internet.
[41:55.320 --> 41:56.320]  No, they're mainstream.
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.320]  Okay, let me stop you right there.
[41:58.320 --> 42:00.320]  What about the two FBI agents that went to prison
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.320]  for insider trading before 9-11?
[42:05.320 --> 42:10.320]  Well, I don't know the details of that particular story,
[42:10.320 --> 42:13.320]  but I do know that there are a lot of stories
[42:13.320 --> 42:15.320]  that are circulating on the Internet
[42:15.320 --> 42:17.320]  that are not based on fact.
[42:17.320 --> 42:19.320]  They're based on supposition.
[42:19.320 --> 42:21.320]  They're not based on fact. You're not giving facts.
[42:21.320 --> 42:22.320]  Let me just go back here.
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.320]  Do you know where the story of the Israelis
[42:24.320 --> 42:25.320]  not being in the building came from?
[42:25.320 --> 42:27.320]  It came from Herat and the Jerusalem Post
[42:27.320 --> 42:30.320]  because Otago Instant Messaging Head said,
[42:30.320 --> 42:33.320]  yes, we got a call that something was going to happen.
[42:33.320 --> 42:35.320]  Get our people out of the building,
[42:35.320 --> 42:37.320]  and most 9-11 researchers say that Israel
[42:37.320 --> 42:39.320]  clearly wasn't running the attacks.
[42:39.320 --> 42:41.320]  It may have been in some small support role
[42:41.320 --> 42:45.320]  because MI6, Mossad, Shin Bet, CIA are all joined at the hip.
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.320]  That's a real report that, indeed, there were warnings.
[42:48.320 --> 42:50.320]  The Arabs weren't in the buildings either
[42:50.320 --> 42:51.320]  because they had warnings,
[42:51.320 --> 42:53.320]  and there were locals doing insider trading.
[42:53.320 --> 42:55.320]  Everybody seemed to know about it.
[42:55.320 --> 42:57.320]  The buildings were at half capacity that day.
[42:57.320 --> 42:59.320]  Well, all I can say, Alex,
[42:59.320 --> 43:02.320]  is that the parts of you, I don't share that view
[43:02.320 --> 43:04.320]  from the research that we have done.
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.320]  Are you denying that Otago's head was in the newspapers
[43:07.320 --> 43:09.320]  in Israel saying they got a warning?
[43:09.320 --> 43:10.320]  Clearly showing they weren't involved
[43:10.320 --> 43:11.320]  because they were public going,
[43:11.320 --> 43:12.320]  yeah, we got warnings.
[43:12.320 --> 43:14.320]  I think what you've done here, Alex,
[43:14.320 --> 43:16.320]  is you've raised a very interesting and important point,
[43:16.320 --> 43:19.320]  and that is that much of what is on the Internet
[43:19.320 --> 43:22.320]  about 9-11 is based on news reports.
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.320]  Now, those news reports are not necessarily always accurate.
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.320]  What happens, as we've seen with the conspiracy theory
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.320]  alleging that 4,000 Jews didn't turn up for work that day,
[43:33.320 --> 43:35.320]  is that the story gets into the media
[43:35.320 --> 43:37.320]  and then it gets twisted and distorted
[43:37.320 --> 43:40.320]  like what we call in England Chinese whispers,
[43:40.320 --> 43:42.320]  and it just continues and proliferates
[43:42.320 --> 43:45.320]  and becomes more and more complicated.
[43:45.320 --> 43:47.320]  And what we tried to do in our research
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.320]  was to go back to primary sources to eyewitnesses.
[43:51.320 --> 43:54.320]  And we presented that information.
[43:54.320 --> 43:56.320]  Now, I fully accept that many people
[43:56.320 --> 43:59.320]  who are listening to your program won't accept that.
[43:59.320 --> 44:01.320]  All I'm asking people to do, I guess,
[44:01.320 --> 44:04.320]  is to watch our program with an open mind
[44:04.320 --> 44:06.320]  and come to their end conclusions.
[44:06.320 --> 44:08.320]  Some people may agree with this
[44:08.320 --> 44:09.320]  and some people may disagree.
[44:09.320 --> 44:10.320]  Let me get a comment to all Watson.
[44:10.320 --> 44:14.320]  That's a good healthy debate in a democratic society.
[44:14.320 --> 44:16.320]  Paul Watson, you've got more comments.
[44:16.320 --> 44:17.320]  Well, Mr. Smith says,
[44:17.320 --> 44:20.320]  let people come to their own conclusions.
[44:20.320 --> 44:22.320]  How is that possible when the program is laden
[44:22.320 --> 44:24.320]  with so much bias?
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.320]  We keep hearing this word objective.
[44:26.320 --> 44:29.320]  My question is, how can Mr. Smith justify
[44:29.320 --> 44:33.320]  using this strong implication on numerous occasions
[44:33.320 --> 44:34.320]  throughout the documentary
[44:34.320 --> 44:37.320]  that questioning the official story of 9-11
[44:37.320 --> 44:40.320]  is insulting and hurtful to the victims?
[44:40.320 --> 44:43.320]  How can he justify such a blatant and cynical attempt
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.320]  to emotionally sway the viewer
[44:46.320 --> 44:48.320]  when we've had Bill Doyle on the program
[44:48.320 --> 44:50.320]  who is the largest representative,
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.320]  the largest group of 9-11 families,
[44:52.320 --> 44:54.320]  and it was a government cover-up in itself
[44:54.320 --> 44:56.320]  in the very hours after 9-11,
[44:56.320 --> 44:59.320]  the result of which now we have a situation
[44:59.320 --> 45:01.320]  where 20% of the first responders
[45:01.320 --> 45:03.320]  are dying from that government cover-up.
[45:03.320 --> 45:07.320]  And by the way, major medical institutions admit
[45:07.320 --> 45:09.320]  their lungs are full of asbestos and concrete,
[45:09.320 --> 45:12.320]  and we have the internal EPA documents
[45:12.320 --> 45:14.320]  that are ordered to shut it down and cover it up.
[45:14.320 --> 45:16.320]  That's been in all the major U.S. newspapers,
[45:16.320 --> 45:19.320]  and we were called conspiracy theorists on that.
[45:19.320 --> 45:22.320]  The truth is, every time the government does something wrong,
[45:22.320 --> 45:24.320]  they just say we're conspiracy theorists.
[45:24.320 --> 45:25.320]  Mr. Smith?
[45:25.320 --> 45:28.320]  Yeah, let me go back to the point that Paul was making.
[45:28.320 --> 45:33.320]  Yes, there are some relatives who are very much in favor
[45:33.320 --> 45:36.320]  of what you're doing and suggesting that this is an inside job.
[45:36.320 --> 45:37.320]  The majority.
[45:37.320 --> 45:41.320]  But there are also many relatives of victims of 9-11
[45:41.320 --> 45:44.320]  who find what you're doing deeply abhorrent.
[45:44.320 --> 45:46.320]  But you claimed it was all of them.
[45:46.320 --> 45:48.320]  You implied it was all of them.
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.320]  The bias.
[45:49.320 --> 45:51.320]  Well, I didn't imply it was all of them.
[45:51.320 --> 45:54.320]  We have talked to many relatives who...
[45:54.320 --> 45:56.320]  You did imply he's a dropout.
[45:56.320 --> 45:58.320]  You did imply it was all of them.
[45:58.320 --> 46:00.320]  You had some psychological tests on there
[46:00.320 --> 46:02.320]  where basically you're a bunch of shut-in nuts,
[46:02.320 --> 46:05.320]  and it's a religion, and you had some fiction writer
[46:05.320 --> 46:07.320]  get up there from the Lone Gunman
[46:07.320 --> 46:09.320]  and the X-Files for the show,
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.320]  the producer, and basically say that it's a religion that we have.
[46:13.320 --> 46:16.320]  No, sir, steel doesn't melt until over 2700 degrees,
[46:16.320 --> 46:19.320]  and there were people in the wounds of those buildings,
[46:19.320 --> 46:21.320]  waving, begging for help, and then giant columns
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.320]  severed right next to them, and then there was molten steel.
[46:24.320 --> 46:26.320]  That's a fact.
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.320]  Well, I mean, again, I come back to the fundamental point.
[46:31.320 --> 46:34.320]  You're saying that it was an inside job
[46:34.320 --> 46:36.320]  carried out by the American government
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.320]  to start a war for oil in the Middle East and in Asia.
[46:40.320 --> 46:43.320]  And, you know, I hear that view,
[46:43.320 --> 46:46.320]  and I accept that there are many people who believe that view.
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.320]  All I can say is that having looked at the story,
[46:50.320 --> 46:53.320]  having researched the story, having talked to many eyewitnesses,
[46:53.320 --> 46:56.320]  we don't come to the same conclusion in our program.
[46:56.320 --> 46:58.320]  Hey, I played eyewitnesses saying,
[46:58.320 --> 47:00.320]  get back, they're going to blow up the building,
[47:00.320 --> 47:02.320]  and I've got a bunch of other clips I could play.
[47:02.320 --> 47:04.320]  I give the actual witnesses, I give names,
[47:04.320 --> 47:07.320]  we sent you police officers, we sent you people,
[47:07.320 --> 47:09.320]  and you didn't interview them,
[47:09.320 --> 47:11.320]  and you make these large, broad brush statements
[47:11.320 --> 47:13.320]  about how you've disproven what we've said,
[47:13.320 --> 47:15.320]  and it isn't true.
[47:15.320 --> 47:17.320]  Does Mr. Smith admit that there was a bias
[47:17.320 --> 47:20.320]  in editing before the editing of his program,
[47:20.320 --> 47:22.320]  and that he had already come to the conclusion
[47:22.320 --> 47:25.320]  that he chose to support the side of the debunkers?
[47:25.320 --> 47:27.320]  Does he admit that bias?
[47:27.320 --> 47:29.320]  Yeah, he told me that at PF Chang's restaurant
[47:29.320 --> 47:31.320]  that he didn't agree with me about this stuff.
[47:31.320 --> 47:33.320]  He doesn't agree about Dr. Kelly.
[47:33.320 --> 47:35.320]  Mr. Smith, you're held to a higher standard
[47:35.320 --> 47:38.320]  as a BBC journalist to produce a balanced program,
[47:38.320 --> 47:40.320]  and you've already come to a bias
[47:40.320 --> 47:42.320]  before you've even finished the filming.
[47:42.320 --> 47:44.320]  Do you admit that?
[47:44.320 --> 47:47.320]  We went into this project with an open mind,
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.320]  and let's face it, if supposing during our research
[47:51.320 --> 47:54.320]  we had found that some of these conspiracy theories were true,
[47:54.320 --> 47:57.320]  we would have certainly put that into the film,
[47:57.320 --> 47:59.320]  because actually it would have made a much more dramatic
[47:59.320 --> 48:01.320]  and sensational film.
[48:01.320 --> 48:03.320]  The front page of the newspapers this morning.
[48:03.320 --> 48:06.320]  Yeah, and then Blair wouldn't take a bunch of your funding again
[48:06.320 --> 48:08.320]  and make your director resign.
[48:08.320 --> 48:10.320]  Nobody's trying to censor us,
[48:10.320 --> 48:12.320]  or nobody is trying to stop us.
[48:12.320 --> 48:14.320]  Everybody knows they've been censoring the BBC.
[48:14.320 --> 48:16.320]  There are 37 documents.
[48:16.320 --> 48:18.320]  Hell, in your country, they arrested Robin Page
[48:18.320 --> 48:22.320]  for saying that rural communities deserve rights.
[48:22.320 --> 48:24.320]  I can absolutely give you an assurance
[48:24.320 --> 48:26.320]  that nobody is trying to censor
[48:26.320 --> 48:28.320]  what we were saying in this program,
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.320]  and if we had found through our objective research
[48:32.320 --> 48:34.320]  some evidence to back up the theory
[48:34.320 --> 48:36.320]  that World Trade Center 7 was demolished
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.320]  or United 1993 didn't crash at Shanksville,
[48:40.320 --> 48:42.320]  then we would have put that into the program.
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.320]  Well, Mr. Smith, your conclusions
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.320]  were not based on the evidence.
[48:46.320 --> 48:48.320]  They were based on portraying Dylan Avery and Alex Jones
[48:48.320 --> 48:50.320]  as a kind of religious cult.
[48:50.320 --> 48:53.320]  You called Alex an evangelical preacher, basically.
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.320]  And then you cut to the X-Files guy saying we're a religion.
[48:57.320 --> 49:00.320]  Well, he didn't say you're a religion.
[49:00.320 --> 49:02.320]  He was talking about why people believe
[49:02.320 --> 49:04.320]  in conspiracy theories nowadays,
[49:04.320 --> 49:06.320]  and I think he made a very valid point
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.320]  about how in the past we found it difficult
[49:09.320 --> 49:11.320]  to understand what was going on in our world,
[49:11.320 --> 49:13.320]  so we created myths, and now what we're doing
[49:13.320 --> 49:15.320]  is doing much the same sort of thing.
[49:15.320 --> 49:17.320]  9-Eleven's a myth.
[49:17.320 --> 49:20.320]  The official story is a fraud, Mr. Smith.
[49:20.320 --> 49:22.320]  It's ridiculous.
[49:22.320 --> 49:25.320]  NIST has given five different reasons building 7 fell,
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.320]  and now they're saying it could have been
[49:27.320 --> 49:29.320]  because of explosions.
[49:29.320 --> 49:32.320]  Can I ask you a question, Alex?
[49:32.320 --> 49:34.320]  Sure.
[49:34.320 --> 49:35.320]  I hear what you're saying,
[49:35.320 --> 49:37.320]  and there are many people who will agree with you,
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.320]  but some of the people who oppose what you're saying
[49:40.320 --> 49:42.320]  and who disagree with what you're saying
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.320]  may ask this question, and that is,
[49:45.320 --> 49:48.320]  why is it that nobody in the five years since 9-Eleven,
[49:48.320 --> 49:51.320]  who is involved in that conspiracy,
[49:51.320 --> 49:54.320]  has come forward to admit their part in it?
[49:54.320 --> 49:56.320]  Because it would only take a few hundred people
[49:56.320 --> 49:58.320]  to run the op.
[49:58.320 --> 50:00.320]  Many people that were involved,
[50:00.320 --> 50:02.320]  I believe they were involved in a simulation,
[50:02.320 --> 50:04.320]  and that's how they bootlegged it,
[50:04.320 --> 50:06.320]  and they've done this many, many times.
[50:06.320 --> 50:08.320]  Let me give you an example.
[50:08.320 --> 50:10.320]  Let me answer your question.
[50:10.320 --> 50:13.320]  5,000-plus U.S. troops died from 1959 to 1964
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.320]  when the Vietnam War officially kicked off,
[50:15.320 --> 50:18.320]  and they didn't announce until 1965,
[50:18.320 --> 50:21.320]  a year after the war was really on,
[50:21.320 --> 50:24.320]  that thousands had died in covert operations previously.
[50:24.320 --> 50:27.320]  Thousands of U.S. troops have died in Colombia
[50:27.320 --> 50:30.320]  in the last 10 years, and that's only barely come out.
[50:30.320 --> 50:33.320]  They covered up until they wanted to.
[50:33.320 --> 50:36.320]  5,000 dead U.S. troops,
[50:36.320 --> 50:39.320]  just like the Russians covered up their true losses
[50:39.320 --> 50:41.320]  in Afghanistan, so don't tell me for a minute,
[50:41.320 --> 50:44.320]  they can't keep Black Ops secret.
[50:44.320 --> 50:48.320]  I am absolutely convinced that if there was a Black Ops,
[50:48.320 --> 50:50.320]  as you say, on 9-Eleven,
[50:50.320 --> 50:52.320]  it first of all would have involved
[50:52.320 --> 50:54.320]  not just hundreds, but thousands of people,
[50:54.320 --> 50:57.320]  and I'm quite sure that that Black Ops
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.320]  would have leaked by now,
[50:59.320 --> 51:02.320]  that people tell their wives, they tell their girlfriends,
[51:02.320 --> 51:04.320]  they tell their priests, they feel guilty
[51:04.320 --> 51:06.320]  about what they've done.
[51:06.320 --> 51:08.320]  This was a Black Ops operation,
[51:08.320 --> 51:10.320]  if what you say is true,
[51:10.320 --> 51:12.320]  that was against the American people.
[51:12.320 --> 51:14.320]  I'm absolutely certain that that story
[51:14.320 --> 51:16.320]  would have leaked out by now.
[51:16.320 --> 51:18.320]  People would have talked.
[51:18.320 --> 51:20.320]  He's been leaking with firefighters and police
[51:20.320 --> 51:22.320]  talking about how they were told to get back,
[51:22.320 --> 51:24.320]  that they were going to blow up Building 7,
[51:24.320 --> 51:26.320]  and more and more is going to leak,
[51:26.320 --> 51:28.320]  and people like Sybil Edmonds who want to talk
[51:28.320 --> 51:30.320]  have been gagged, and FBI agent Robert Wright
[51:30.320 --> 51:32.320]  has been told he'll be arrested.
[51:32.320 --> 51:34.320]  If he tells people what he knows,
[51:34.320 --> 51:37.320]  all he said is the Bush's vacation would have been live.
[51:37.320 --> 51:40.320]  It's here after a year in production
[51:40.320 --> 51:42.320]  and traveling the distant lands.
[51:42.320 --> 51:44.320]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[51:44.320 --> 51:46.320]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove
[51:46.320 --> 51:48.320]  that Western governments are orchestrating
[51:48.320 --> 51:50.320]  terror attacks against their own populations
[51:50.320 --> 51:52.320]  as a pretext to enslave them.
[51:52.320 --> 51:54.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[51:54.320 --> 51:56.320]  an inside job,
[51:56.320 --> 51:58.320]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[51:58.320 --> 52:00.320]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[52:00.320 --> 52:02.320]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us
[52:02.320 --> 52:04.320]  to war in Iran, a White House program
[52:04.320 --> 52:06.320]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[52:06.320 --> 52:08.320]  secret police torture,
[52:08.320 --> 52:10.320]  the latest 9-11 information,
[52:10.320 --> 52:12.320]  and much, much more.
[52:12.320 --> 52:14.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide
[52:14.320 --> 52:16.320]  for government-sponsored terrorism.
[52:16.320 --> 52:18.320]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[52:18.320 --> 52:20.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone
[52:20.320 --> 52:22.320]  who wants to be truly informed must see.

[54:41.320 --> 54:43.320]  Guys, Smith only have one more question for you
[54:43.320 --> 54:45.320]  and then Paul's got a question
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.320]  and Dylan does and we appreciate you spending an hour with us.
[54:47.320 --> 54:49.320]  We want you to know that we see what the piece did,
[54:49.320 --> 54:51.320]  tugging on the heartstrings,
[54:51.320 --> 54:53.320]  oh, look how we're putting all this out.
[54:53.320 --> 54:55.320]  It's not going to work.
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.320]  We're going to totally dissect it 110%.
[54:57.320 --> 54:59.320]  But you didn't get into Pakistan,
[54:59.320 --> 55:01.320]  ISI, you didn't get into $100,000
[55:01.320 --> 55:03.320]  wired to Muhammad Atta.
[55:03.320 --> 55:05.320]  You didn't cover any of that
[55:05.320 --> 55:07.320]  and people are going to look at that.
[55:07.320 --> 55:10.320]  So, are you a little concerned now
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.320]  over the huge furor this is created
[55:12.320 --> 55:13.320]  or do you like it?
[55:13.320 --> 55:14.320]  No, not at all.
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.320]  I think it's great that people are discussing this subject
[55:17.320 --> 55:19.320]  and it's a really good thing that people
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.320]  are coming to their own conclusions
[55:21.320 --> 55:24.320]  and I absolutely accept that many people
[55:24.320 --> 55:26.320]  will believe that there are conspiracy theories
[55:26.320 --> 55:28.320]  that are true and that's good.
[55:28.320 --> 55:30.320]  That's fine, you know.
[55:30.320 --> 55:33.320]  We keep using that little pacifier,
[55:33.320 --> 55:35.320]  your blanket that it's a conspiracy theory,
[55:35.320 --> 55:37.320]  conspiracy theory, no, corruption
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.320]  and evil in the global empire.
[55:39.320 --> 55:41.320]  Do you believe there's a one-world government being formed?
[55:41.320 --> 55:43.320]  I mean, do you even know that's real?
[55:43.320 --> 55:47.320]  Well, I don't know whether there's a one-world government
[55:47.320 --> 55:49.320]  being formed or not.
[55:49.320 --> 55:52.320]  The brief of our program was to look at what happened at 9-11.
[55:52.320 --> 55:54.320]  Yeah, but I mean, I had dinner with you.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.320]  You don't think Dr. Kelly was killed even when he said he was.
[55:56.320 --> 55:58.320]  You don't think Diana was killed by the government
[55:58.320 --> 56:00.320]  even when she said, I mean, she said,
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.320]  Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident
[56:02.320 --> 56:03.320]  and you just poo-poo that.
[56:03.320 --> 56:06.320]  I mean, every like if I said, Billy Bob says he's going to kill me
[56:06.320 --> 56:08.320]  with a battle axe and I'm killed a week later
[56:08.320 --> 56:10.320]  and people saw Billy Bob walking away.
[56:10.320 --> 56:12.320]  Oh, no, Billy Bob's not involved.
[56:12.320 --> 56:14.320]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul.
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.320]  Paul, quickly fire your final questions at his lordship.
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.320]  Well, in a sense, Mr. Smith tags us with the label
[56:22.320 --> 56:24.320]  of conspiracy theories when he supports
[56:24.320 --> 56:27.320]  the official conspiracy theory and in doing so,
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.320]  he uses a sole clip of a firefighter on 9-11
[56:31.320 --> 56:34.320]  discussing damage to Building 7's sprinkler system
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.320]  while omitting literally dozens and dozens of reports,
[56:38.320 --> 56:41.320]  both footage and from the official firefighter tapes
[56:41.320 --> 56:46.320]  who reported bombs at all levels of the Twin Towers and Building 7
[56:46.320 --> 56:49.320]  and that is not part of his documentary,
[56:49.320 --> 56:54.320]  which suggests clear bias because he's using individual clips.
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.320]  He keeps saying show evidence, we show it and then he ignores it.
[56:57.320 --> 57:02.320]  The evidence that we presented in the program
[57:02.320 --> 57:05.320]  is the evidence that we believe to be credible.
[57:05.320 --> 57:08.320]  There are many stories that World Trade Center 7
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.320]  was demolished by explosives.
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.320]  I have yet to see any credible evidence
[57:12.320 --> 57:15.320]  that stands that theory up, just as I have yet to see any...
[57:15.320 --> 57:17.320]  Firefighters reporting bombs is not credible.
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.320]  You didn't even mention it.
[57:20.320 --> 57:22.320]  You didn't even have to conclude that it was right.
[57:22.320 --> 57:24.320]  You could have just mentioned it,
[57:24.320 --> 57:27.320]  but it's not a balanced peace guy, it's a biased peace.
[57:27.320 --> 57:29.320]  And everyone can see that.
[57:29.320 --> 57:32.320]  Well, it's interesting because,
[57:32.320 --> 57:35.320]  as well as hearing from the likes of you,
[57:35.320 --> 57:38.320]  I've also had many emails and calls from people
[57:38.320 --> 57:40.320]  who are saying that we're giving too much airtime
[57:40.320 --> 57:42.320]  to the conspiracy theories.
[57:42.320 --> 57:45.320]  So I guess it's like one can't please everyone all the time.
[57:45.320 --> 57:49.320]  We understand and I appreciate you at least coming on this show.
[57:49.320 --> 57:52.320]  Will Fast, Dylan Avery, final question.
[57:52.320 --> 57:54.320]  Yeah, you know, throughout the documentary
[57:54.320 --> 57:55.320]  and throughout this interview,
[57:55.320 --> 57:57.320]  Guy talks a lot about following the evidence
[57:57.320 --> 58:00.320]  and how he feels that he covered the 9-11 truth movement,
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.320]  when in reality, as you mentioned, Alex,
[58:02.320 --> 58:05.320]  there was a glaring omission from this BBC documentary
[58:05.320 --> 58:07.320]  that any objective documentary would have covered.
[58:07.320 --> 58:09.320]  Although he lauded the fact that two of the hijackers
[58:09.320 --> 58:11.320]  live with a tested FBI informant,
[58:11.320 --> 58:13.320]  he refused to ask Senator Bob Graham why,
[58:13.320 --> 58:15.320]  on the morning of 9-11,
[58:15.320 --> 58:17.320]  he was meeting with George Tenet of the CIA
[58:17.320 --> 58:19.320]  and the head of the Pakistani ISI,
[58:19.320 --> 58:22.320]  who had wired Muhammad Atta, the lead hijacker,
[58:22.320 --> 58:25.320]  $100,000 right before the attacks.
[58:25.320 --> 58:29.320]  Yeah, the role of the Pakistani ISI is a fascinating story,
[58:29.320 --> 58:32.320]  and that's actually something that we could well be returning to
[58:32.320 --> 58:33.320]  in another program.
[58:33.320 --> 58:36.320]  We might be making a whole program about that connection
[58:36.320 --> 58:38.320]  between Pakistan and the hijackers.
[58:38.320 --> 58:41.320]  Getting another bucket of white paint out for that, huh?
[58:41.320 --> 58:43.320]  I'd say watch this space,
[58:43.320 --> 58:45.320]  because that is a very interesting story.
[58:45.320 --> 58:48.320]  Guy Smith, I appreciate you spending time with us,
[58:48.320 --> 58:50.320]  and I hope to get you back up in the future
[58:50.320 --> 58:52.320]  in the next few months as this develops.
[58:52.320 --> 58:53.320]  Can we have you back on?
[58:53.320 --> 58:55.320]  Yeah, I'll be happy to come back on,
[58:55.320 --> 58:57.320]  and I think if I could say one final thing very quickly,
[58:57.320 --> 58:59.320]  and that is the good thing that it's great
[58:59.320 --> 59:00.320]  to talk about these subjects.
[59:00.320 --> 59:02.320]  It's great to add different points of view.
[59:02.320 --> 59:05.320]  It is. I appreciate you coming on.
[59:05.320 --> 59:06.320]  It's good to get us thinking.
[59:06.320 --> 59:07.320]  I want to thank Paul Watson, Dylan Avery.

[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.320]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.320]  We first interviewed him almost three years ago,
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  and he's been on the case for a lot longer than that.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.320]  Yesterday at the end of the broadcast,
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.320]  my radio producer walked in
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320]  with the Salt Lake City Tribune headline,
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]  Nichols.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.320]  McVay had high-level FBI help.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  Here is the Desert News headline.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.320]  Nichols says bomb was FBI op.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.320]  We've known this from a massive mountain
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.320]  of confirmed evidence
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.320]  since just months after the horrible attack
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.320]  that killed 163 people back in 1995.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.320]  But now, Jesse Trinadu,
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.320]  on the trail of who murdered his brother
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.320]  in federal prison, Kenneth Trinadu,
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.320]  and we have the horrible autopsy photos
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.320]  up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.320]  has literally been spending much of his life on this case,
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:54.320]  a successful attorney and lawyer counselor in his own right.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.320]  And I just got in touch with him this morning
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.320]  after I learned of this last night.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.320]  I went on coast to coast AM and covered it.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.320]  And he joins us now for the next 30 minutes
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.320]  and I hopefully will be able to line him up
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.320]  for an hour early next week
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.320]  so we can get into more detail.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320]  He's given us some of the documents, the case.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.320]  Those are going up on infowars.com right now.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.320]  This is bombshell material.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320]  Literally, maybe once a year
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.320]  will my heart start beating faster with the story.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.320]  That's happening right now.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.320]  So joining us is Jesse Trinadu.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.320]  Thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.320]  Thank you for having me.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  If I'm not mistaken,
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320]  we're the first one to broadcast this story back in 2004.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.320]  Well, now it's really broken wide open.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320]  Thanks to your work.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.320]  We've got three minutes before break
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  and we'll come back in detail at all.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.320]  But just out of the gate,
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320]  tell us in a nutshell about yourself, about your brother,
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.320]  how you got involved in this case.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.320]  And now the prison interview you did
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.320]  with Larry Nichols, it's unbelievable.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.320]  Well, basically my brother was killed
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.320]  a few months after the bombing.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.320]  He had been convicted of a federal crime
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.320]  back in the late 70s, had done his time.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  He was paroled in 1988.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.320]  He had a dispute with his probation officer
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.320]  about drinking beer.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320]  We challenged that and lost.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.320]  A couple of months after the bombing,
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  my brother is driving across the border.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320]  He lived in San Diego.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320]  He'd been over visiting friends in Mexico.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  He's arrested supposedly for pro-violation.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.320]  At the time, we didn't understand that it didn't make sense
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.320]  that we assumed that was what it was for.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.320]  In hindsight, now it's clearly that wasn't the case
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.320]  because the judge who sentenced him was in San Diego.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320]  The crime was committed in San Diego.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  His probation officer was in San Diego.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.320]  Any parole hearing would have to be in San Diego.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  So he was sent to Oklahoma City for some reason
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.320]  and was dead two days later.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.320]  And we never had a reason for it.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.320]  Now, they claimed it was suicide,
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.320]  but he, again, had electrical burn marks, cuts, and bruises
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320]  over his entire body.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.320]  It is truly grisly he was clearly tortured to death.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.320]  His throat was slashed.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.320]  All of while in federal custody.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.320]  And the government said they tried to have his body cremated
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320]  before we saw him.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  And then finally, we get him home.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  But we never had a motive.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.320]  And that was difficult to say to people why the FBI,
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  especially would have killed him and tortured him.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  Now, we're going to get to that later.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.320]  But in the process of your investigation,
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  you've now got the documents that the affidavit has been sealed.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320]  So you can't talk about certain names.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.320]  But before it got sealed by the feds in a desperate attempt
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320]  to block this evidence from coming out,
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.320]  we do have the names.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.320]  We do have the information because you were able to tell
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  different news reporters about this.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.320]  In particular, the desert news,
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]  before that happened.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  So we're going to go over this after the break.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.320]  But I want to get into how you got in contact with Larry Nichols,
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.320]  why he's now gone public.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.320]  And by the way, his story fits exactly with what the FBI
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.320]  police investigators and many others have brought forward
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:15.320]  in the, what, 11-plus years since the OKC bombing in 1995.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320]  Our guest is Jesse Trinadu.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.320]  We'll be back after this quick break to detail this.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.320]  This story is ultra-massive and incredibly important.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.320]  It's here after a year in production
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.320]  and traveling the distant lands.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320]  Mighty Film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.320]  that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.320]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.320]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320]  by British intelligence.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.320]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.320]  a White House program to disseminate fake news,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.320]  NSA spying, secret police torture,
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.320]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320]  of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.320]  Terror Storm is a film and everyone who wants to be truly
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.320]  informed must see.

[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.320]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.320]  that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.320]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.320]  is big enough, the size of the vibration will become
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320]  so large that the glass shatters.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320]  Using this similar principle,
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.320]  Royal Raymond Reif discovered that disease organisms
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.320]  can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.320]  uses the same technology for relief or elimination
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.320]  of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.

[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.320]  It is the 22nd day of February, Thursday, 2007,
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.320]  one of the most important broadcasts I've ever done.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.320]  It was almost three years ago that I interviewed
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.320]  Jesse Trinadu, his brother, Kenneth Trinadu, was murdered.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.320]  That's how this lawyer got on the case.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.320]  My God, does it fit him with all the other evidence we have?
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.320]  Unfortunately, it shows that the Oklahoma City bombing
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.320]  of the Alfred P. Murrow Building was an inside job.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.320]  Here's the headline of the Desert News.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.320]  Before the filing was sealed, the reporters were able to see it.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.320]  Now our guest is unable to specifically talk about the filing.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.320]  The most shocking allegation, the 19-page signed declaration
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.320]  by Nichols assertion, that the whole bombing plot
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.320]  was an FBI operation that McVeigh let slip during a bout of anger
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.320]  that he was taking instructions from
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.320]  former FBI official Larry Potts,
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  who helped run the Ruby Ridge debacle.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.320]  Very senior, personal friends, very high level
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.320]  with the then FBI director.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.320]  McVeigh also said he was part of a secret military assassin's team
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.320]  who had been recruited out of the military.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.320]  That's exactly the M.O. we have from state police, local police,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.320]  detectives and FBI.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.320]  This is absolutely off the charts, incredible.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.320]  And I guess you've got in and got this affidavit.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.320]  It is the man we're speaking to right now, Jesse Trinadu,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.320]  got in to see Larry Nichols,
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  and that is a saga in and of itself.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  Let's walk through it, please, sir.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.320]  But basically, I didn't start out to solve the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.320]  I started out to find out who killed my brother and why.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.320]  It all started in probably December of 1995
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  or January of 1996, and I got an anonymous call.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.320]  A caller said that my brother had been killed by the FBI,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.320]  that it was a case of mistaken identity,
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  that it was an interrogation that got out of hand,
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.320]  that my brother 50-profiled, a caller said,
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.320]  of a group who were robbing banks
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.320]  and to fund the tax, money to fund the tax on the federal government.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.320]  So somebody had a conscience and called you?
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.320]  Called me. Of course, I dismissed it.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.320]  I thought it was far-fetched, unbelievable.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320]  And then about six months later,
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.320]  I read a story in the Los Angeles Times
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.320]  about a man named Richard Lee Guthrie
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.320]  who was found hanging in his cell while in federal custody.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  He was supposed to give a tell-all interview the next day
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.320]  before he died about the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.320]  He was a member of a group called the Midwest Bank Robbery Gang,
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:24.320]  and the story said he had robbed banks to get money to attack the federal government.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.320]  And they didn't have a photograph of Guthrie, though, just the story.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.320]  And then shortly before he was executed,
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.320]  I received a message from Timothy McVeigh,
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.320]  who told me that when he saw my brother's photograph
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.320]  and heard what happened to him,
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320]  he knew that the FBI killed my brother
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.320]  because they mistook him for Richard Lee Guthrie.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.320]  And Guthrie, I believe, was John Doe, too.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.320]  And the description for John Doe, too, when my brother was picked up,
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.320]  was white male, five-foot-nine, powerful upper-body bill, dark-complexed,
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320]  believed to be in Canada or Mexico,
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.320]  driving mid-1980s Chevrolet pickup, dragon tattoo, left forearm.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.320]  My brother comes across the border at San Diego
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.320]  and his friends, 1986 Chevrolet pickup,
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:09.320]  five-foot-nine, powerful upper-body bill, dark-complexed,
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  dragon tattoo, left forearm.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.320]  The only other person I know of with that description was Richard Lee Guthrie.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.320]  So they clearly killed your brother and Guthrie
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.320]  in prison with the same classic hanging.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.320]  Unbelievable. Please continue.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  Well, as I said, it was difficult to convince people my brother had been murdered
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.320]  because no one likes to think the government of the United States does those kind of things.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.320]  But we have the autopsy photos. Please describe those.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.320]  Well, his head was smashed to the skull in three places.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320]  His throat was slashed.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320]  His stun gun burns all over his body.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.320]  Even the soles of his feet are bruised from being beaten.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.320]  He's beaten head to toe, front to back, tortured extensively,
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.320]  and then he was, we now know, strangled with a pair of plastic handcuffs
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320]  after they beat him to a pulp.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.320]  And obviously, he couldn't tell him anything because he didn't know anything.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.320]  But that started me on the quest to...
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.320]  I said, I didn't start out to solve the bombing.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.320]  I started off to find the men who killed my brother,
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.320]  but every trail has taken me back to the bombing.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.320]  And that's when I filed that lawsuit here in the federal court in Utah,
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:26.320]  asking the judge to order the FBI to produce all documents related to a failed sting operation.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:33.320]  They were running at a white supremacist paramilitary training camp in eastern Oklahoma called Elohim City.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.320]  And that led to the bombing. It got out of hand.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:44.320]  Let's walk through how you were able to get in touch with Nichols, how he tried to contact John Ashcroft,
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.320]  how the media was then blocked from ever being able to reach him,
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  how you were able to get in, and what Larry Nichols told you.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:56.320]  Well, Terry Nichols reached out to me apparently before he contacted me several years ago.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.320]  He had written to Attorney General Ashcroft,
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:04.320]  volunteering to tell everything he knew about the bombing and the others involved.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.320]  Not only did no one from Attorney General Ashcroft's office follow up with Nichols,
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:15.320]  they actually issued apparently an order barring him from all contact with the media.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:21.320]  It was there after that he reached out to me and I was able to get into the scene and spend a day and a half with him.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.320]  Describe how he reached out, what you had to go through to be able to meet with him,
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320]  and what happened in an hour and a half meeting.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.320]  It was a day and a half.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.320]  Day and a half, excuse me.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:35.320]  Basically, I was able to come in under the radar, I'm sure that if I'd known why I was there, I would never have gotten in.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.320]  But you're a lawyer, you're a counsel, that probably helped you out.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:44.320]  I'm sure it did, but the real story is that this man apparently wants to tell his story.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.320]  Now, I can't assure your audiences that what he says is true.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:56.320]  You, sir, have more knowledge about, I mean, you're relating things about the history of the bombing case that I wasn't aware of.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.320]  So you apparently have studied this a long time and know a lot about it, a lot more than I do.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:09.320]  Well, I made it my first film about it in 1997, but I've just interviewed literally hundreds of experts on the subject.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:16.320]  Now, I know they've sealed this, but we can talk about what the press has reported and any other facets you feel comfortable in getting into.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.320]  What did Larry Nichols tell you, what's in the affidavit?
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:31.320]  That I don't feel comfortable talking about, but just I can tell you what is already out there in the public record as a result of this lawsuit that led me to go see Mr. Nichols.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  Sure.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:45.320]  When you sue under the Freedom of Information Act, there are, for documents, government documents, there are two exemptions that are bulletproof that you cannot get around, that you will not get the documents.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.320]  There's national security and...
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.320]  Well, that's actually three.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  The other two are if there's an ongoing criminal investigation or if the government has promised anonymity or confidentiality to informants.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:08.320]  I was fearful that the government would come back, the FBI would come back and say they had reopened the investigation, in which case that would have gotten nothing.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:17.320]  Instead, they came back and told the federal judge that they had promised confidentiality to four informants and, please, not to turn over any documents.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.320]  Well, the judge said he would allow them to black the names out, but to turn the documents over.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:32.320]  And the documents show that the FBI's informants were robbing banks and armored cars with Tim McVeigh to get the money to construct a bomb.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:39.320]  And that one of the four informants was actually the explosives instructor who taught him how to make the bomb.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.320]  Now, to be specific here, this is the creating the history, the ledger, and this is what McVeigh said.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:52.320]  They were staging fake robberies to create the illusion that it was an organic, domestic group that was going to carry out the attacks.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:58.320]  Classic black ops, where they go out and engage in criminal activities as a smokescreen.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.320]  That's basically what some of the things that Nichols said.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:09.320]  Sure. Classic black ops, gladio type ops, but please continue.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:17.320]  As I said, the documents are not me making this up.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:24.320]  The documents show that at least as recently as two days before the bombing that they actually called Elohim City asking for help.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:32.320]  And this was reported by one of the informants that four months before the bombing, another informant had not only reported the plan,
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.320]  but it said that they had actually scouted the target.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:43.320]  Now, how was one of the informants earlier, and she tried to warn them and then they tried to arrest her and charge her, telling her to shut up.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.320]  They did prosecute her, but she wasn't convicted.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.320]  Yes.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.320]  Please continue.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:18:01.320]  And so many of these things had, I would not have gotten where I am today on this, but for people have, and I don't know who has done it, had leaked me copies of records.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.320]  There's a lot of feds that don't like killing kids in a daycare. They're not going to put up with it.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.320]  And that made my case in front of the federal judges.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:20.320]  So I had unknown to the FBI, I had two copies, two documents already about this operation. And so when I asked for the records, they came back.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.320]  The FBI did and reported to the judge that there were no such documents.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320]  And then I filed those two copies.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:33.320]  And then the FBI came back and said that they were fake and I had an affidavit from an FBI agent who said they were real.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.320]  And with that, the judge lost all patience with the FBI.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320]  They had no credibility with him.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:47.320]  And then later, didn't it turn out that the similar documents and some of the same documents have been released before, but without some of the names blacked out and then that proved they were real?
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320]  Yes.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.320]  Yes, they found a way out to another source, apparently.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.320]  They never denied the documents or they now concede.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:04.320]  And when they were ordered to produce them to do a manual search, they came back and produced about 100 pages of them.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:10.320]  Where does it go from here? I mean, where does your suit go? How much danger is Nichols in?
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.320]  Quite honestly, I'm afraid. I was surprised he's still alive.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:25.320]  Not only is my brother dead, Guffrey dead, I had an eyewitness to my brother's murder and he was found hanging in his cell too.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.320]  People have a habit of dying off in this case.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:35.320]  But I guess you've got a serious beef, so you're way past Karen. They murdered your brother.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:39.320]  That and I was smart enough to not keep anything a secret.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:49.320]  And as soon as I, and I thankful to your show and others like you, sir, that had that the story get out there because to me, that was my best insurance policy.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:53.320]  Oh, my heart was beating this morning just to get you on for my safety.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:00.320]  I mean, I know you cannot keep this type of stuff secret. You've got to get it out immediately. That's your insurance policy.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.320]  And I was surprised how quickly they were able to get everything sealed.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:11.320]  Final segment with you, sir, after this quick break, other key facets will walk through and delineate here.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:20.320]  With our guest attorney at law, Jesse Trinadu, his brother, was brutally tortured to death, Kenneth Trinadu.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:28.320]  The bottom line is, no man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that's in the right and keeps on coming.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.320]  Texas Ranger Captain Bill McDonnell will be right back.

[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:56.320]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:39.320]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:46.320]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.320]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.

[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:36.320]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism,
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.320]  but globalism.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:44.320]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.320]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.320]  I called our guest at about 8 a.m. this morning.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.320]  My time, and he was already at the office, he's been there since 5 a.m.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.320]  Mountain.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.320]  He's very exhausted, a lot of filings.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.320]  He's got his own practice, of course.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.320]  We really appreciate him spending time with us to come on today, and we're trying to get him on for longer next week.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.320]  In the five minutes we've got left, Jesse, trying to do...
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  Where is your case going now?
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  What's going to happen with this 19-page affidavit that has been filed?
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.320]  And what are some of the materials you sent us today that we posted on infowars.com?
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.320]  Well, first of all, again, Mr. Jones, I want to thank you for...
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:26.320]  May have been the first... I think you were the first person to report this story back in 2004, and didn't say it was crazy.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:35.320]  What I filed that affidavit for was to get an order from the judge to allow me to take the deposition of Terry Nichols into videotape that deposition.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.320]  That's the only way his story will ever get out there.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.320]  Good Lord, you have a video?
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.320]  No, I said that's to get an order to allow that to happen.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.320]  To order the government to produce them and let me take that deposition and videotape that deposition.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.320]  You cannot tell that whole story in the declaration, but you cannot tell...
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.320]  He's made that very clear to me.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.320]  I know you'd like to be able to tell us what you learned in the day and a half of interview with him.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.320]  The more important things are the documents that were attached to that affidavit that were sealed to.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:15.320]  Most of them were from the FBI, and some were from Tim McVeigh's defense team outlining exactly what happened.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.320]  So the defense team knew?
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.320]  Yes.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.320]  But Stephen Jones didn't bring that out?
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.320]  I don't think they were allowed to bring it out.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:28.320]  If I recall correctly, and I wasn't paying attention to the trial, that the judges would not allow any evidence of other people being involved.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:37.320]  Bottom line, Nichols and yourself are in grave danger while this is sealed, and I know you can't violate this federal proceeding in a seal order,
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:47.320]  but these documents, you just said it, the defense detailing inside job, did the federal documents detail that?
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.320]  I read them that way.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320]  Good.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:55.320]  I read them as others involved.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:01.320]  Bottom line, you're educated inside view of this off the cuff.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.320]  Why do you think the government was involved orchestrating this?
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320]  I don't know if they intended it.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:17.320]  I think that my feeling is that the FBI had fumbled the ball so badly at Waco and Ruby Ridge that I do remember this,
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.320]  that they were under constant pressure and criticism from Congress and from the media and from the public.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320]  The ATF was close to being disbanded.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:35.320]  I think they put together this harebrained idea at Elohim City to lure in all these militia groups under the pretense of teaching them how to rob banks and armored cars and attack the federal government.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.320]  And I think they planned to catch them in the act.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:43.320]  I don't, for a moment, think they intended the bombings take place.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.320]  Well, that's what the, you know, the ATF tried to leak and claim.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:53.320]  The same thing every time they got caught in England with British intel carrying out taxis, they always claimed they just missed it.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.320]  And let me tell you, sir, I've studied this.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:02.320]  They may tell some of their VATF that showed up in bomb gear a minute after the bomb went off.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.320]  But for the insiders, they meant to bomb at the whole time.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.320]  You know, that building was blown from the inside out.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:16.320]  Well, I'm not an explosive instructor, but my personal view is it got away from them.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320]  Well, either way, they're culpable.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:25.320]  Yes, I mean, you can't, to me, I think you step way over the line when your informants are robbing banks and armored cars.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:32.320]  Well, did you see the report out of the Orlando Sentinel where the Nazi rally was led and organized by an FBI informant?
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.320]  I read that report.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320]  I mean, I've seen this a hundred times.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.320]  In fact, I've never really seen a big case where it didn't the feds running it.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:48.320]  Well, my experience at least in this case has been whenever you have three people who get together to criticize the federal government, two of them will be informants.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.320]  Absolutely.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320]  We've got about a minute and a half left.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.320]  Any other key points you'd like to add, sir?
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.320]  Other than that, they've not denied it.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:06.320]  I mean, the accusations I made against the FBI are that they set up this operation, that they had informants who robbed banks with McVeigh to fund the attack,
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.320]  that they had an informant who was the explosive instructor and taught them how to make the bomb, and they got away from them.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.320]  They have not once denied those accusations.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  They have just begged this federal judge not to order the release of the documents.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:23.320]  Now, clearly, if I made those accusations against you, wouldn't you have denied them?
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.320]  Absolutely.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:33.320]  Then we have Danny Coulson, who claimed he got up there in just an hour or so from Dallas by car with the hotel receipt that he was there the night before.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:42.320]  Well, so one other thing I might add is, it's my understanding that the BBC is going to run an hour special on the bombing and perhaps the government's involvement.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.320]  It's going to be a total whitewash. I was in the 9-11 piece last week.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.320]  No, because I didn't see it. I don't know.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.320]  I haven't seen it yet, but I don't know.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.320]  It's supposed to be the 4th of March.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.320]  Okay, we've got 20 seconds left. Any other points, sir?
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.320]  Other than I expect to help a fight from the Department of Justice over that deposition.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320]  Trying to keep it sealed indefinitely?
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.320]  Well, not let it happen. Not let me be able to take Nicole's complete statement.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.320]  What's the time frame on getting that statement?
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:16.320]  Whenever the judge hears the case and orders, it rules on the motion.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:22.320]  Thank you so much for your courage, Jesse Trinidad. Let me talk to you for one minute off air. Thank you for joining us.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.320]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.320]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.320]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.320]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:49.320]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:05.320]  Why don't we try it? Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night. Yeah, just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.

[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.320]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:43.320]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested. Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:52.320]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:33:00.320]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later,
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:09.320]  we know we're doing something right. It's a well-thought-out formula. I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:15.320]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:40.320]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com. That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:34:01.320]  To paraphrase that passage in the Bible, there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. You throw something into the deepest depths of the ocean and it will one day be tossed back onto the shore.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:14.320]  Again, I just think about my job, what I do. This morning, as I was scrambling, setting up this guest and reading news articles and going back and doing research, refreshing my memory.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:26.320]  I just literally almost hit my knees and thank God that I'm in this position. I never thought that I would be a radio broadcaster internationally.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:35.320]  I never thought I'd be a news hound. I never thought I'd be doing what those old gum shoes did long ago, what the straw hat reporters did.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:45.320]  Here we are, 21st century front line muck records, engaging the New World Order at point blank range.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:53.320]  It's scary too to do what we do because we're going toe to toe with these guys. We're going against them 110% to bring them down.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:59.320]  I would have been all over this story and been on the phone with Trinadu yesterday and I would have had Trinadu on Coast to Coast AM with me last night.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:07.320]  I didn't even think to call Coast to Coast AM to get on the show. I didn't think to even call Trinadu, even though he was in the article and I broke the story as you heard him say,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:20.320]  because I was too busy down in the law office filing lawsuits on someone, which makes me even matter at them for the lies they put out that I have to spend all this money to get my good name back.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:40.320]  Excuse me. So, excuse me, it just makes me angry because my time is so precious. I am so frustrated because there's so many things that I need to do, so many things we need to get done.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:55.320]  All right. Don't want to explode here on air. There is so much happening, so much going on. We've got Kevin Barrett in studio.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:11.320]  The Wisconsin professor has been all over national, international television, exposing 9-11. And then I don't even know now if I want to have that Cliff Kincaid, Neocon, and conservative's clothing on in a third hour,
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:26.320]  but I've got him coming on just so you can hear the type of stuff these people put out. So, that's coming up. And there is just so much going on.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:40.320]  I don't even know what to say. Let me just read over these articles now to give you some more background on Oklahoma City, because this is a direct line into 9-11.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:57.320]  Nichols McVeigh had high-level FBI help. Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols says a high-ranking FBI official apparently was directing Timothy McVeigh and the plot to blow up a government building
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:04.320]  and might have changed the original target of the attack according to a new affidavit found in the U.S. District Court in Utah.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:13.320]  The official and other conspirators are being protected by the federal government in a cover-up to escape its responsibility for the loss of life in Oklahoma.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:23.320]  Nichols claims in the February 9th lawsuit affidavit for the lawsuit. And let me just add, I was talking to Jesse Trinadu during that three-minute break,
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:34.320]  and he added some more points. He said that he was out of time, he had to go to court, but that he never has been called a coup, never been called a liar, never been demonized by the FBI.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:42.320]  They're just desperately trying to ignore him. Well, the ignoring him is over. The ignoring him is over.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:47.320]  The official and other conspirators are being protected by the federal government.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:54.320]  Documents that supposedly help back up his allegations have been sealed to protect information in them, to protect the informants.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:00.320]  Such as social security numbers and dates of birth, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Utah had no comment on the allegations.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  The FBI and Justice Department of Washington, D.C., also declined comment.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:11.320]  Nichols does not say what mode of the government would have to be involved in the bombing.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:23.320]  The affidavit was filed in a lawsuit brought by Salt Lake City Attorney Jesse Trinadu, who believes his brother's death in a federal prison was linked to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:37.320]  The lawsuit, which seeks documents from the FBI under the Federal Freedom of Information Act, alleges that authorities mistook Kenneth Trinadu for a bombing conspiracy and that guards killed him in an interrogation that got out of hand.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.320]  No, that's not what he says. FBI went in and killed him and tortured him to death.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:50.320]  Trinadu's death a few months after the April 19th-95 bombing was real to suicide after several investigations. The government has adamantly denied any wrongdoing of the death.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:57.320]  Why didn't they publish the photos? I know for a fact, Trinadu gave him the photos. They're up on infowars.com.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:17.320]  He's got the double-point shock wounds all over his body under his arms. Of course, we don't post these, but genitals, feet, huge, look like electrical burns where the rods weren't working, so they just hooked something up to a wall outlet, slid his throat, beat his whole head in.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:33.320]  Just, I mean, this guy's purple from end to end. In the app to David, Nichols says he wants to bring closure to the survivors and families of the attack in the Alford B. Murrow building, which took 168 lives.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:43.320]  He alleges that he wrote then-Attorney General John Ashcroft in 04, offering to help him identify all parties who played a role in the bombing, but never got a reply.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:54.320]  Nichols, serving a life sentence at the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, McVeigh, who carried out the bombing, was executed in 2001.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.320]  McVeigh and Nichols were the only defendants indicted in the bombing, however, Nichols alleges others were involved.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:13.320]  McVeigh told him he was recruited for undercover missions while serving in the military, according to Nichols. He says he learned sometime in 95 that there had been a change in the bomb target, and it was going to be Nebraska, Omaha, Dallas.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:21.320]  They were looked at different places. That there had been a change in the bombing target, and the McVeigh was very upset by that.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:31.320]  There, in what I believe was an actual slip of the tongue, McVeigh revealed the identity of a high-ranking FBI official who was apparently directing McVeigh in the bomb plot. Nichols says in the affidavit.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:41.320]  So again, two newspapers have seen this. Now they've shielded it. Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:52.320]  Nichols also says that McVeigh threatened him and his family to force him to rob Roger Moore, an Arkansas gun dealer of weapons and explosives. He later learned that the robbery was staged.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:59.320]  So Moore, who was in on the phony heist, could deny any knowledge of the bombing plot if stolen items were traced back to him, Nichols claims.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:05.320]  He adds that Moore allegedly told his attorney that he would not be prosecuted in connection with the bombing because he was a protected witness.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:15.320]  There's federal documents. Moore could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Again, they did the research Tuesday as came out yesterday morning Wednesday. It's now Thursday.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:26.320]  In addition, Nichols says McVeigh must have had help building the bomb. The evidence that he and McVeigh built the day before the bombing did not resemble the one that ultimately was used.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:33.320]  Nichols says, and despite a level of expertise and sophistication that neither man had, there's a lot more than what this article put.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  You just heard the lawyer who's got the affidavit filed the day and a half interviews with him.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:58.320]  Now let's read the DesertNews.com story. All these are up on infowars.com and prisonpundit.com with a whole bunch of pages of documents, federal documents, for the first time being posted at infowars.com right now.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:09.320]  I'm told they've been up for 30 minutes. Oh, man. Nichols says bombing was FBI op. Boy, that's an interesting headline out of a mainstream newspaper.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:25.320]  Detailed confession filed in Salt Lake about Oklahoma City plot. The only surviving convicted criminal in the April 19th, 95 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrow Federal Building in Oklahoma City is saying
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:34.320]  his co-conspirator, Timothy McVeigh, told him he was taking orders from a top FBI official in orchestrating the bombing.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  Let me say that again. Told him that he was taking orders from a top FBI official in orchestrating the bombing.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:55.320]  A declaration from Terry Lynn Nichols filed in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City has privity one of the most detailed confessions by Nichols to date about his involvement in the bombing as well as the involvement of others.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:07.320]  The declaration was filed as part of the Salt Lake City attorney Jesse Trinadu's pending long-full death suit against the government for the death of his brother in federal corrections facility in Oklahoma City.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:16.320]  Trinadu claims his brother was killed during an interrogation by FBI agents when agents mistook his brother for a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation.
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:36.320]  The most shocking allegation in the 19-page signed declaration is Nichols' assertion that the whole bombing plot was an FBI operation and that McVeigh let slip during a bout of anger that he was taking instruction from former FBI official Larry Potts of Ruby Ridge fame.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:51.320]  Potts was no stranger to anti-government confrontations having been the lead FBI agent in Ruby Ridge in 92 which led to the shooting death of Vicki Weaver, the wife of Separatist Randy Weaver.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:44:01.320]  Potts also reportedly involved in the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas in 93 which resulted in the fire that killed 81 Branch Davidian followers.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:06.320]  He's now a former FBI agent, by the way. He was an FBI agent.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:31.320]  Potts retired from the FBI under intense pressure and criticism for the cover-up of an order to allow agents to shoot anyone seen leaving the Weaver cabinet at Ruby Ridge. When contacted, the FBI's main office in D.C. said it would not provide immediate comment on Nichols' claims Tuesday.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:42.320]  What did I tell you, folks? Men formerly associated with special forces. In the next few years, I've had these guys following me and they've not even threatened me.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:49.320]  Hey, man, I'm an American defending the Republic. You do whatever you need to, criminals. You'll see what they'll do to you later.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:45:01.320]  In the next few years, the two men hatched a bombing plot in October 94. You think it's manly to kill people, don't you? Kill good people. You kill me, you've got God to deal with, punks.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:19.320]  In the next few years, the two men hatched a bombing plot in October 94. McVeigh and I stole explosives from a quarry in Marion, Kansas, consisting of eight and a half cases of boxes containing 229, two and a half inch sticks of gel-type explosive known as Tuvex.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.320]  Again, they told everybody it was fuel oil.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:33.320]  Nichols wrote, adding that only a small amount was used in the actual bombing. It was while traveling the gun show circuit that Nichols claims the two obtained bomb-making knowledge and materials using the bombing.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.320]  And, of course, that was an FBI informant teaching them for the diversionary bomb that were bombs inside.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:57.320]  One example is that McVeigh allegedly attended a gun show in Nob Creek, Kentucky in 93 at this gun show. McVeigh had the opportunity to make contact with about 20 people who were bomb experts. McVeigh told me that he himself had no knowledge about how to construct a bomb, but that he always wanted to gain more knowledge about how to conduct bombs.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:09.320]  He struck bombs, Nichols stated. Nichols says he knew McVeigh was building the bomb in November 94. He left for the Philippines to get away from the area to avoid being implicated. I did not want to be present when McVeigh did explode a bomb.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:16.320]  Consequently, I left for the Philippines to be out of the country, he wrote. This is basically the newspaper whitewash of all this, folks.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:28.320]  Now, the statement contradicts findings by Congressman Denner Roerbacher, who studied the bombing, has made public last year. It indicated Nichols had traveled to the Philippines to receive bomb training from impossible foreign terrorists.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:41.320]  Yeah, that's the Republican fallback. They had Iraqi Republican Guard clearly involved. This is all black ops work, folks. You've got white supremacists, you've got militias, you've got sheep dipped special forces McVeigh, you've got bank robbers running around,
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:51.320]  but you've got Arabs at the scene and those videotapes have been sealed, but I've interviewed the police and others and FBI's on record saying they saw the sealed surveillance tapes showing the Arabs.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:47:05.320]  So then it gets so confusing. You're like, did the mob kill JFK? Did the military? Did the Cubans? No, they're all involved. That's how black ops work. You have different levels of deniability.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:21.320]  Then you've got bombs inside that Jane Graham, who was the head of HUD, was going through one of the maintenance sides to get up quicker as she was late to work and she saw guys drilling the columns planting large sticks of gray butter the day before.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:35.320]  After hearing about the bombing of the federal building, which killed 168 adults and children, Nichols said he panicked when his name came up on the radio and he wanted to turn himself in, but not before hiding evidence including explosives using the bombing.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:51.320]  The claims may and the declaration have added yet more twist to the mystery surrounding the bombing. Some familiar with the bombing's history, so Nichols' claims seem to indicate the FBI put McVeigh up to the plot as a draw for radicals, but that the situation got out of control and McVeigh became a runaway informant.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.320]  That is not what happened. That's their fallback story. It always is.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:05.320]  I mean, how many of those British bombings? Oh, we didn't stop it in time. Then you turn out the guy cooking the bombs, British intel, the guy driving its British intel.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.320]  We had those men on the show, by the way.
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  After reviewing the declaration, Warbacher told the Desert Warning News that Nichols' claims should be investigated by the tree with extreme skepticism.
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  I need to caution people to remember that Terry Nichols is a mass murderer. Of course, Warbacher a month ago was on CNN going, there's a conspiracy, a cover-up of Oklahoma, Clinton, Clinton.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:33.320]  Clearly Clinton was involved, but this goes deeper to the black-out government. Ruby Ridge was planned under George Bush Sr.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:39.320]  George Bush Sr. brought in the nearly 3,000 Iraqis. Clinton brought in almost 2,000 more.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:45.320]  They were trained here by the CIA in the 80s, brought back in at the end of Desert Storm.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:50.320]  Source, Washington Post, LA Times, So Should Press.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.320]  Then there's stuff like this, World Net Daily.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:49:01.320]  Was FBI early arrival in Oklahoma City? Hotel receipt show, Top Terror Man showed up 9 hours before blast.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:07.320]  Danny Coulson was in the DFW, Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.320]  And he said that, oh, he couldn't get on the Southwest Airlines in time to fly up there.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:18.320]  So he drove and got there in a record 2 hours, but then people reported he was there in less than an hour after the bombing.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:26.320]  Now that's on record. Then it turns out he checked into a hotel 9 hours before the blast.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.320]  The FBI's top counter-terrorism agent checked into an Oklahoma, this is from January 19, 2002.
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:40.320]  The FBI's top counter-terrorism agent checked into an Oklahoma City hotel nearly 9 hours before a truck bomb nearly leveled the Alpha P Murrow building,
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  according to a receipt obtained by World Net Daily, despite claims that he was in Texas the morning of the attack.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  The Embassy Suites Hotel, Danny Coulson, then director of the FBI's Terrorism Task Force,
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:50:03.320]  founding commander of the Bureau's hostage rescue team, was dated April 19, 2005 with a check-in time of 0.20 or 12.20 a.m.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:08.320]  Military time for 12.20 a.m.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:15.320]  His last name is spelled Coulson on the receipt, but it indicates he is with the FBI located at 50-pin place.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.320]  Yeah, they misspell on purpose.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:23.320]  The truck bomb exploded at 9.03 a.m. devastating half the building and killing 168 men, women, and children.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:30.320]  According to the receipt, Coulson checked out of his hotel room at 4.06, April 27, at 11.16 a.m.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:34.320]  Now get ready for this. They now have spun it and admit it.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:41.320]  The existence of the receipt and subsequent questions it raises surrounding the FBI's official denial of prior knowledge of the OKC bombing was first reported
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:49.320]  by J.D. Cash of the McMurtin, Oklahoma Daily Gazette, a small town paper that has been out front in the stories in OKC related reports.
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:58.320]  Since the bombing, listen to this, officials at the Department of Justice have repeatedly assured victims that the FBI had no prior knowledge of any plot to bomb the Murrow building.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:08.320]  My paper said Wednesday, however, evidence of Coulson's clandestine trip fits squarely with substantial bodies of details found in hundreds of pages of other official documents
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:19.320]  The paper's evidence revealing weeks of planning by an elite corps of drug and counterterrorism experts who were closely monitoring members of various far-right groups
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:23.320]  that considered religious extremists and threats to the safety and security of our nation.
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:30.320]  So there's their spin, they were shadowing them, yes, they were helping them rob banks too.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:52:01.320]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?

[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:40.320]  It's year after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:48.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:56.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:08.320]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:14.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.

[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:40.320]  Good morning, honey. Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:41.320]  Yeah.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:43.320]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:46.320]  I just realized we forgot to pack the travel-burky system.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:52.320]  I can't drink this cabin water, and what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake? Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:56.320]  Honey, cheer up. I brought our sport-burky purifiers.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.320]  What?
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:07.320]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our sport-burky purifiers.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:12.320]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:59.320]  Coming up in studio, Kevin Barrett, out there fighting the New World Order toe-to-toe, exposing the inside job that is 9-11, his new book, 9-11 in American Empire, Christian Jews and Muslims Speak Out.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:10.320]  Before we end this hour, I do want to remind all of you that I'm a documentary filmmaker, and my film, Road to Tyranny, was the first film out on 9-11.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:19.320]  I put out an emergency version of it that was only available for a few months, two weeks after 9-11, which was just a presentation with video clips.
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:34.320]  Then three months later, in early 2002, I released the three-hour film, which right under three hours, 45 minutes of 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, is the definitive documentary on Oklahoma City alone.
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:41.320]  Surveillance tapes of the Iraqi Republican Guard hired by the CIA, brought in by George Bush Sr.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:48.320]  In case locals caught them, they were going to claim Arabs did it, and I interviewed the police, the state police, they even arrested them.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:55.320]  They had bomb-making materials, the blue jogging suits, they had the surveillance videos from the surrounding areas.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  I have police surveillance, they shot in the weeks before. You also had white supremacists involved, all these groups, so they could blame different groups for it later.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:11.320]  But it was entirely a government bombing with a diversionary provocateur truck bomb outside, with explosives inside, blowing the building out.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:19.320]  General Benton K. Parton's in the film, all the clips, all the documentation, the newscast, where they're reporting unexploded bombs, and they're removing the bombs.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:28.320]  Governor Keating breaking it down. You need to get Road to Tyranny just for the 45 minutes of the almost three hours.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:33.320]  So we start the film with a history of government-sponsored terror. We then go into Oklahoma City.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:42.320]  We of course go into the attack in 1993, where the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, provocateured the whole incident with the attack there.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:50.320]  And then of course we go into 9-11, where they can't count on provocateurs anymore, or patsies. They just totally stage the event themselves.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.320]  And we walk through that and then show you why they wanted to do it, the police state and the wars they wanted to start.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.320]  And we set in the film in 2002, they're going to invade Iraq, and they're going to invade other countries.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  I ran Syria because we went off the PNAC documents themselves.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:10.320]  So early 2002, it is a testament. The film just gets better with time, more and more accurate with time as things flesh out.
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:17.320]  You need to get 9-11 the Road to Tyranny if you don't have it on DVD or VHS. It's over three hours with the extras.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:27.320]  But the film is close to three hours, and it's got about 30 minutes of extras at the end than I did because it's more of a second edition later in 2002.
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:31.320]  There's really been three editions of it, but that's the final edition of Road to Tyranny.
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:36.320]  All three of my police state films are now in a box set for $34.95. That's 45% off.
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:42.320]  Police state 2000, which shows the Marines training to put you in camps, admitting they're training to take your guns and put you in camps.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:49.320]  And the FEMA camps and the whole police state grid, then police state II, the takeover, then police state III total enslavement.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.320]  It's what one of the films is three hours long, the others are over two.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:58:02.320]  So we're talking about almost 10 hours of footage on those three DVDs in one box set available at infowars.com.
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:07.320]  We've got 9-11 Inside Job infowars.com, black baseball caps now available.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:10.320]  We've got 9-11 Inside Job black t-shirts now available.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:20.320]  We've got little FM transmitters you can plug into your computer and play the radio show for a couple houses around you, or you can boost it with an antenna and go several hundred feet further.
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:23.320]  Those are now available at infowars.com.
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:29.320]  And your purchase of these items not only gets you more informed to have these key tools on your shelf in your library,
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:37.320]  it supports what we're doing here in my growing staff and the different operations we've launched against the globalists in our war against their tyranny and dehumanization.

[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:27.320]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:34.320]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:45.320]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethane and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene and MTBE.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:50.320]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:59:50.320 --> 02:00:06.320]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro particulate from water or even the nutritional mineral feeds. Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:14.320]  Get a two pack for only $99 or a four pack for only $188 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:55.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:11.320]  Literally, waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation. Monday through Friday, live from 11 to 2, central, standard time.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.320]  By the way, I'm tired of forgetting, I know my staff is listening.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:22.320]  Guys, get me the list of the five affiliates we got last week, because I keep saying I'm going to plug them and I never get a proper list.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:26.320]  I hear the names, I thank the program directors and then I just forget about it.
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  I want to get that and thank them before this hour ends. I want to thank them on the Sunday show that's gotten a lot of new affiliates as well.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.320]  We're just so blessed, so thankful to God.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:44.320]  Any guests coming up? I witness two government operatives and 7-7 bombings in 2005. Right now, Mark in Canada, thanks for holding. You're on the year.
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:45.320]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:46.320]  Good, sir.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:53.320]  Good, big fanboy here. I like Bobby, the caller before. I'm burning Terra Storm copies right now. I've been handing them out in Ottawa.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:57.320]  I go for walks at night. I give out Terra Storm and 9-11 Revisited.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  Well done.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:04.320]  Those are the two I've chosen and I just take about eight or nine out at night, walk around. I always come home without them.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.320]  I don't know if the people watch them.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.320]  That's the best is to fire and forget. Carpet bombing, info wars, the best procedure.
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.320]  Yeah, that's what I've been doing. So I'm doing my part. I also went to a rally yesterday in my first protest, so that was kind of cool.
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:20.320]  I have questions. I've been trying to call in for a while, so these are kind of dated.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.320]  The bare, tainted HIV inoculations.
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:26.320]  Yes, by design.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:33.320]  Is there anybody who has been looking into the WHO and the Red Cross, International Red Cross,
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:40.320]  was taught it was all over Australian papers, knowing that it had AIDS in it, knowingly delivering it. It's publicly admitted.
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:46.320]  Okay. Is there anybody who's tracking, though, the growth of the epidemic?
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  The Healier Society has tried to. They've been robbed once and there's been firebombings as well of the doctor who worked in the prisons in Little Rock.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:04.320]  And so there's been some strange deaths as well. So yeah, people have been trying.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:07.320]  But again, the murders and the firebombings didn't stop it from coming out.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:13.320]  Okay, okay, excellent. Would you ever have David Suzuki on your show to discuss global warming?
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.320]  I don't know to show my, who is David Suzuki?
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  David Suzuki is a big Canadian environmentalist. He's been around for years.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:26.320]  Well, okay, now I've heard the name. I had to place it. Did you hear my analysis of it?
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:30.320]  Oh, I've listened to your show since Charlie Sheen came out pretty much daily.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.320]  So what did you think?
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:43.320]  Oh, I think you're bang on. I'm just curious if he would agree with you about the solution that they're proposing if, you know, or if he would be saying it's not 3% it's 10% that kind of stuff.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.320]  Well, listen, that's not me just saying 3%. I mean, there's a bunch of different studies.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:54.320]  And even the UN study, you know, says, well, humans are 6% of it, but it still is the tipping point.
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:04:03.320]  The sun's heating up. And then the point is, regardless, regardless, their solution of a global tax has nothing to do with it.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:04.320]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.320]  Yeah, no, I agree. I agree.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:17.320]  My next question has to do with Ron Paul and Mike Rivera has been talking about the Jefferson Manual and that it takes one governor to start the impeachment procedures.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:20.320]  And that is starting up in New Mexico and several other states.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:25.320]  Okay, so Ron Paul isn't in a position to start that as well.
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.320]  They already used it against him in his last campaign.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:33.320]  Infectively, when he came on my show and said Bush should be impeached, that was already used against Paul.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:39.320]  So I don't know if he will call for something like that because then it would be misinterpreted by conservatives.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.320]  But certainly he says he says anyone who voted for the war should be removed and impeached.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.320]  Okay, okay.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:56.320]  Next question, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the other thing that stipulates that the U.S. can't supply aid to a country that is a nuclear power unless it allows inspectors.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:00.320]  That's another thing Mike Rivera has talked about. Is that going to matter?
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:04.320]  Like, is there any way that they can even enforce that?
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:12.320]  No, no. And you can't enforce it and the U.N. doesn't enforce it and Israel doesn't follow it and China doesn't follow it.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:15.320]  So the point is, South Africa's got nukes, brother.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:23.320]  Listen, I appreciate your call. Pakistan, India. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Big guest.
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:37.320]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:47.320]  The film Terror Storm is complete. Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:55.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:06.320]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:12.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:17.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:38.320]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:43.320]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:52.320]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:07:01.320]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable. The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:08.320]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[02:08:50.320 --> 02:09:18.320]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Now 8 minutes 42 seconds into this second hour and for the balance of the hour I'm extremely honored to be joined by
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:28.320]  Steve Watson of infowars.net and prisonplanet.com from London, England and Daniel Obuchaki also joining us from England.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:42.320]  Now let me just set the table here. On the morning of 7-7-2005 three bombs blew up destroying three different passenger carriages killing quite a few people tragically.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:58.320]  Over an hour later a bus that had been specifically singled out and redirected and these reports had already come out by other witnesses exploded causing quite a few deaths and injuries.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:12.320]  And then it came out that the former head of Scotland Yards public relations Peter Powers had been hired to run a drill of the exact same trains exact same times being bombed the exact same day.
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:28.320]  And we've had the actuary mathematics done on that. It's in the truck to Gillians. That's 43 zeros my friends behind it. That's many, many more times, billions of times more than all the grains of sand in all the world.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:35.320]  On 9-11 they're doing a drill of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center in Pentagon at the exact same time yet again as well.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:43.320]  It's always the same MO. They do this in case other compartments of the government discover it. The other operatives can just say, hey, we're taking part in a drill.
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:54.320]  It also bootlegs the funding. It also creates chatter that confuses echelon info pole 9, the NSA, MI6, the different listening stations.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:57.320]  So if they pick up on it they can say, oh, that's just the drill too.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:06.320]  And there are hundreds of points concerning the London bombing. First they said that it was simultaneous and they said, no, it wasn't simultaneous.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:15.320]  It turned out they were correct. It was simultaneous bombings on all three of the trains. Something went wrong. We had surmised from all the evidence.
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  Something hadn't detonated on the bus. People reported there was not an Asian man down there. People reported that suddenly there was just an explosion.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.320]  Folks had reported that the bus had been singled out and diverted. I talked to bus drivers who'd heard about it.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:35.320]  I talked to technicians who worked in that bus terminal about strange things and strange technicians working on that bus.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:45.320]  And so from the evidence we had, something hadn't gone off simultaneously in the bus, so they redirected it while they were redirecting it to make sure it went off from all the evidence we have.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:57.320]  MI6, MI5 or some private agency that was carrying this out clearly in collusion with the government needed time to cover up what was happening with the bus because something had gone wrong.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:05.320]  So for an hour and several minutes they were announcing a power surge had caused some type of explosions.
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:16.320]  Now you've got three blown up trains, dead people everywhere, they're coming out bleeding, dying, they're telling everyone bombs went off, and the police are saying, no, no, no, it's a power surge.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:28.320]  While meanwhile, black sedans, blue sedans, motorcycles are directing this particular bus, the Hackney Bus to Tavistock Park, Tavistock Square.
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:42.320]  On board that bus is Daniel Obatsiki, and Daniel is there, and he's now going to tell you what he witnessed, and this is a eyewitness.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:53.320]  Now other eyewitnesses interviewed by police, and again most police aren't involved in this, that's why we have Scotland Yard going, we don't think these guys knew they had bombs, we don't think that they were suicide bombers,
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:13:04.320]  we think someone gave them these packages, but then you've got the problem of one of the bombers, passports, ID cards being found at two different bombings, and somebody messed up in the planting.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:14.320]  You've got Benjamin Netanyahu being admitted, associated press, at least 30 minutes before getting a call and being told don't get on the trains, stay in your hotel room.
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:16.320]  This is all on record.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:24.320]  You've got Giuliani there when this happens, all very suspicious folks, same people, same players, this is so disgusting.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:32.320]  And so we have Daniel there on the bus, and he's going to tell you what he witnessed, this is huge.
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:38.320]  I cannot hype this enough, I know Steve's working on a part two of this, so I want to bring up Daniel.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.320]  Daniel, thank you for coming on.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.320]  That's okay, how are you doing?
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:57.320]  Good, sir. Tell us a little bit about yourself and then give us a nutshell, give us a thumbnail sketch of what happened on that bus that morning, what you witnessed, and then any more details that you haven't already given us for the info wars.net story.
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.320]  And I first want to say thank you for your courage, sir.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:04.320]  Tell us first about yourself and how you got the courage to go public.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  Okay, I'm just a regular guy, born, bred, work in London, and that day I was on my way to work in Old Street, and there was some kind of disruption going on.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:26.320]  We were told it was a power surge and we were evacuated, and that's how I became to be on the bus.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:37.320]  And then after that, the bus left Euston, full of passengers who were also evacuated, and the bus seemed to be going nowhere.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:44.320]  So I looked out, because I was standing on the lower deck, because I wasn't sure whether I was on the correct bus.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:55.320]  And then I peered ahead and I saw these two cars, which were a Mercedes and a BMW blue and black, which seemed to be in front of the bus holding it up.
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:04.320]  And it was diverted about four or five minutes later down towards Tavistock Square.
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:12.320]  And I think the results are quite evident for everyone else to see what took place in Tavistock Square.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  Please continue with what you got in the square, what you saw.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:30.320]  Oh, well, after the explosion, you can understand, I was on the floor, so it took about five seconds till the noise had actually quietened down,
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  and then I just got up and then I ran and escaped and ran straight down the street.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:50.320]  After a few paces down the street, I saw a man holding a camcorder, it looks like a camcorder, who was walking towards me, filming the bus itself.
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:59.320]  I was confused by this and I stopped and skidded to a halt and looked left, right, and what was going on.
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:08.320]  Then I looked behind me and I saw the bus, the upper deck of which had been completely destroyed by the bomb explosion.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:22.320]  And then I just, I think at that point, my mind must have just changed into some kind of, I was really not frightened,
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:33.320]  I was aware that something amiss was going on and I was just looking at the people moving into the actual space on the square.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:43.320]  There were guys who were hanging around, there was a roll of policemen who were just standing there in yellow fluorescent suits, jackets.
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:49.320]  They weren't doing anything, they were just watching, there was this guy filming and I'm saying, what is going on here?
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:58.320]  It didn't feel right. So I actually went and helped some woman who had been walking beside the bus, she was covered in blood,
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:05.320]  and then I helped her to get some kind of help at a hotel which was further down the square.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:15.320]  And I passed this gentleman who seemed to have acquired some kind of injuries, but I can understand for the life of me how this was possible,
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:24.320]  because he was 40, 50 meters away from the bus itself. So he was making a lot of noise and trying to get people's attention,
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  but I just saw his actual injuries as fake.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:37.320]  In fact, you write in your description that within 60 seconds he had a bandage on his head and there weren't even paramedics around him.
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:39.320]  Exactly, they hadn't even shown up yet.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  Can you say that in your own words though? I mean describe it in detail for us.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  Well, he had a bandage around his head and his trouser leg had been slit neatly along the seam and he was rolling on the pavement.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:18:06.320]  This was 50 meters away from the bus itself. The bus bomb itself blew backwards, so one lady who was at the back where I was standing,
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:13.320]  I was standing in the center of the bus or by the window, she actually died and someone walking behind the bus also died.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:23.320]  So the bus blew backwards, the bomb blew backwards. So this guy was just a complete fake injury and he was just some guy who was...
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:29.320]  I don't know what his role was specifically. There were a lot of people observing, I noted.
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:34.320]  Some people were running forward, the medical staff and the medical professionals were...
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:38.320]  You could tell who they were because they were trying to see what they could do for people, half of them.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:43.320]  Some people were just, they weren't going to make it. Some people, they were trying to do something for them,
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:49.320]  but then there were these other people who were just watching, taking notes, organizing people, moving...
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  How many seconds, I mean how long did it take you to get out of the bus and then how long did it take you,
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:59.320]  could you say 60 seconds to then notice that this guy is way up the street with a bandage on his head rolling around?
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  I left the bus within 12 seconds, I got down that street in another 10 seconds, so within 25 seconds I had witnessed the cameraman
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  and about 15 seconds after that I actually noted this chap, so it was within 45 seconds he was actually with some kind of headband
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  lying on the street. I don't know how he got there because if it was a bus blast, he must have been flung about 40 to 50 feet
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:38.320]  and that is not really feasible with the injuries which he was displaying.
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:41.320]  And it was the wrong direction from the way the blast started.
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:47.320]  How many operative types or police did you see when you got off the bus around you already staring at it?
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:58.320]  Okay, there were about four guys in blue bottoms who had rucksacks, they were kind of foot soldier types,
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:03.320]  there were about two or three people who were just standing in the doorway just watching everything
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:11.320]  and there was another guy who was coordinating everything, coordinating in plain clothes and coordinating police
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:17.320]  when they finally came forward to actually do something.
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:20.320]  Just all there waiting, oh here comes the bus, boom!
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:26.320]  Unbelievable sir, please stay with us, we've got Steve Watson waiting in the wings with other key comments and questions,
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:30.320]  your courage is amazing.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:38.320]  Good morning honey, wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific and it's the first day of our vacation.
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:41.320]  Yeah. Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:45.320]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burky system.
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:49.320]  I can't drink this cabin water and what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:51.320]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:55.320]  Honey, cheer up, I brought our sport burky purifiers.
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:56.320]  What?
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:21:03.320]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water
[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:06.320]  so I packed our sport burky purifiers.
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:11.320]  You know, this is a terrific cabin and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:18.320]  Don't ruin your vacation, get a travel burky today for only $209 or get a sport burky for only $39.

[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:33.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:39.320]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers and investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:43.320]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:50.320]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:58.320]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.320]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:09.320]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:14.320]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:19.320]  Call 800-686-2237, make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:29.320]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:54.320]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse and when America had begun to disarm,
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:23:00.320]  the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.

[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.320]  A Little Piece of You
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:54.320]  A Little Piece of Me
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  Will Die
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.320]  A Miracle
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:03.320]  For This Is America
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:06.320]  Daniel Obochak, he is our guest.
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:08.320]  Born in Bread, Londoner.
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:12.320]  Talking to her in the break, it was just unbelievably powerful.
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:17.320]  I remember making Terror Storm and saying to Rob, my editor here in the office,
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:19.320]  I go, that photo looks fake.
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:26.320]  Bandages all over his face, thinly placed, no blood except on his chest,
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.320]  and it looked like it was put on out of a ketchup dispenser in little squirters
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:34.320]  that you use just kind of dribble down the front.
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:37.320]  And so many times my instincts are right.
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:41.320]  Well, it turns out that's the individual that within 60 seconds was flopping around
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:45.320]  and prancing around in front of cameras and all the waiting police.
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:49.320]  And notice though, they didn't, all over every major newspaper in the world,
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:53.320]  all over every major television network in the world, every news program in the world.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:56.320]  No one interviewed him, no one said, where is he now?
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:00.320]  No one said his name, everybody else they show blood of your bleeding.
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.320]  A day later they'd say, here's their name.
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:05.320]  Not him, and now the photo's being jerked everywhere.
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:10.320]  Please relay and repeat the words you told me during the breakdown.
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:13.320]  Please, in your own words, lay this out.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:20.320]  Yeah, this guy, he was the one that got my kind of curiosity going
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:26.320]  because I walked past there with this, this woman who was a hurt.
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:32.320]  And then I saw him, he had this bandage around his head, his leg seemed to,
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:39.320]  his childhood leg was torn, and this was within 45, less than 60 seconds after the explosion.
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:44.320]  The time before any medical staff had come forward.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.320]  And the thing about him was, he just seemed so fake,
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:54.320]  so I thought this man must have had prior knowledge, prior intelligence,
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:57.320]  and he was positioned here, for what reason I don't know.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:01.320]  Then I conducted a search of my own online,
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:08.320]  because a few days after the 7th of July his picture, his image was everywhere.
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:12.320]  About a month ago I looked and it had been totally pulled.
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:19.320]  I mean, it wasn't on any of the BBC websites, it wasn't on any of the international news sites.
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:21.320]  You just couldn't find this guy.
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:27.320]  I actually spent about two days searching, and then I got two images of him,
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:32.320]  and that's what you see on WorldWideWebTheForceBomb.com, which is my site,
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:38.320]  where the truth and the facts of what happened in Tabasco Square that day are.
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.320]  Now again, your story meshes with all the other witnesses, all the other evidence we have,
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:45.320]  but I want to be clear before it brings Steve Watson up in the next segment,
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.320]  who broke this with you, and I really am thankful for his great journalistic skills and your courage.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:56.320]  Going back, specifics, slow down, take your time.
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  When you see the blue and black Mercedes and the motorcycle cop and the discussion with the bus driver,
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:09.320]  and it's redirected, let's go back to when they first directed you in the bus to Tabasco Square.
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.320]  Okay, yeah. What do you want to know?
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:16.320]  Just slow down and describe everything to me.
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:21.320]  Just slow down and tell me how they pulled up, what they did, what their body motions were like,
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:23.320]  just everything, what they looked like.
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:29.320]  Okay, it left Houston bus station and proceeded down Houston Road.
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:36.320]  It was supposed to go straight from Houston to King's Cross, but these two cars were blocking his path.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:44.320]  And then after a short time, a police motorcyclist whizzed up on his bike and had a word with one of the drivers.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:48.320]  White man, black man, Asian man, what did they look like?
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:53.320]  Oh, the police, the drivers were of European appearance.
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:29:00.320]  The motorcyclist had a helmet, so he had a brief word with one of the drivers.
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:03.320]  And I thought, okay, thank God for that.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:09.320]  This guy would tell the driver to go and then we can get to where we need to be going.
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:16.320]  But instead of the police motorcyclist getting the car to leave, they told him to leave
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:19.320]  and then he just turned around and sped off.
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:21.320]  Did you see them flash anything?
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:23.320]  They didn't flash anything.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:25.320]  He waved something.
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:31.320]  It could have been some kind of card or path or something, but as soon as the police motorcyclist...
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:34.320]  Who waved? The driver or the bloomer? Sadie or the black?
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:37.320]  The driver of the BMW.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:40.320]  And what color? The BMW was blue, correct?
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:45.320]  Blue, yes. The driver of the BMW waved the motorcyclist away.
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:47.320]  With some form of identification.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:50.320]  I only assumed he had some form of identification.
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:52.320]  You saw him, something in the hand waved it.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:53.320]  Yeah, that was it.
[02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:56.320]  Absolutely key. Stay there.
[02:29:56.320 --> 02:30:01.320]  Your debriefing will continue on the other side. Steve Watson will join in.
[02:30:01.320 --> 02:30:05.320]  This is absolutely vital and we're trying to keep this man safe right now
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:08.320]  by him getting his entire story out in more detail.
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:20.320]  I'm Alex Jones, battling the New World Order at Point Blank Range.
[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:24.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:30.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:33.320]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN news bulletin.
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:35.320]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.320]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:43.320]  If so, when you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:44.320]  Here's why.
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:48.320]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.320]  without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:54.320]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely
[02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:57.320]  that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:01.320]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:06.320]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:10.320]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:13.320]  and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:16.320]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:19.320]  Go to www.outin90.com.
[02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:25.320]  That's www.outin90.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:30.320]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:34.320]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:38.320]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:42.320]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:43.320]  I was so amazed.
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:46.320]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light.
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:49.320]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:54.320]  www.solarwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:59.320]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning products,
[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:01.320]  also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:03.320]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.320]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:10.320]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:12.320]  Plus, the service was great.

[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:31.320]  What is the secret of the sea?

[02:32:55.320 --> 02:33:01.320]  to get the same nutritional value found in only one pound of walker's exclusive blend of sea plants.

[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:29.320]  That's W-A-C-H-T-E-R-S.com.
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:50.320]  I know it was two years ago or a year and a half ago.
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:54.320]  I know that it's not big and spectacular like 9-11.
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:59.320]  But a lot of people died and it was used when the British nation was refusing to go along
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:04.320]  with the war in Iraq when Tony Blair had barely hung on to his position
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:10.320]  when he had lost almost the entire majority that the Labor Party had in parliament.
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:15.320]  And it came right when they were having their big G8 summit in Glen Eagles
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:18.320]  and it was used as a grandstanding platform to say,
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:24.320]  see the terrorists are hitting us, we've got to get tough in every indices, every piece of evidence.
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:28.320]  Even Scotland Yard and other police forces who had real detectives out were going,
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.320]  these guys weren't suicide bombers.
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:32.320]  That's buried in the newspaper.
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:35.320]  These guys, we think somebody planted this stuff on them or they didn't know.
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:37.320]  They don't fit the M.O.
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:40.320]  There was a bomb under one of the trains, not in it.
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:42.320]  Eyewitnesses said that.
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:44.320]  At all these, there's hundreds of points.
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:46.320]  We put them in the film Terror Storm.
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:48.320]  But I hope you'll get from infowars.com.
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:52.320]  That's why it's so important we spend about 30 minutes of the two-hour film
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:55.320]  or a little bit more than 30 minutes in London documenting this.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.320]  And we even show shots of newsstands.
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:34:59.320]  We were there two weeks after the attacks.
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.320]  And we show newsstands where there's literally like 15, 20 newspapers and magazines
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:08.320]  and it's all pictures of the bombing.
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:12.320]  And half of them are this guy with the thin one layer of bandage.
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:16.320]  And folks, I've worked, you know, for a large animal vet, my dad's a normal surgeon.
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:18.320]  I've been in hospitals. I've worked around it.
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:23.320]  You know, I've worked in the medical field when I was in college as a dental assistant.
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:26.320]  But even if you haven't, you know, common sense.
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:31.320]  You don't take thin gauze bandage.
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:37.320]  Thin, one layer, one layer.
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:42.320]  And if you even put that on a scuff on your knee that really doesn't bleed but kind of just seeps, you know,
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:46.320]  when you're playing touch football and you fall down on your knee and it just kind of seeps.
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:48.320]  I mean, it was just seeping.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:53.320]  Just a microscopic graze. It would stick to his face.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:36:01.320]  No, it appears to be a cap woven heavily on the top and then just thin, thin one straps around his face.
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:05.320]  Like it was some type of already woven helmet he just put on his head.
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  45 to 60 seconds after the blast.
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:13.320]  He's flopping around way towards the front, 50 yards north of it.
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:17.320]  There's other people videotaping, spook types walking around.
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:20.320]  And then no interviews with him. We never learned his name.
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:24.320]  He's just, you remember the guy with the bandage.
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:29.320]  And those eyes have it all ferret like scanning, calculating.
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:32.320]  And I just remember going, man, that is what something's going on.
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.320]  That doesn't look right.
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:41.320]  And then he has like a potato, a ketchup bottle, you know, that you spray onto your potatoes.
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:43.320]  You spray onto your french fries.
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.320]  It's like a dribble on his shirt.
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:52.320]  And you take movies like The Quiet American by Graham Greene, which is based on real events.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.320]  They just changed the names.
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:37:00.320]  That's when the Times of London reporter who's based there in Southern Vietnam,
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:02.320]  he's been recruited by the CIA guy.
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:04.320]  He doesn't know he's CIA.
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:09.320]  And the CIA guy is actually running terror attacks to blame it on the north to escalate the war.
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:15.320]  This is before the war really kicks off in the late 1950s, and it's based on true stories.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.320]  That really happened.
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:19.320]  And then all of a sudden he doesn't know, he didn't know the guy's CIA.
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:22.320]  And suddenly these bombings blow up in the square and kill all these women and children.
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:27.320]  And then he's running around the CIA guy giving orders in Vietnamese.
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:32.320]  And the Times of London writer just goes, and just leans back and realizes,
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:42.320]  well, literally the man you're listening to right now saw something just like you see in that movie.
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:49.320]  Just like what you see in that fictionalized account of real events in Vietnam.
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:51.320]  Okay, that's why this is so important.
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:56.320]  Daniel, I want to go to Steve Watson to bring him up for any questions.
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:05.320]  He's been holding for 20 minutes, but I'd like you to then talk about what happened in a nutshell after all of this.
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:08.320]  What started happening from that point on, Placer?
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:09.320]  I will do.
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:11.320]  Okay, yeah.
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:20.320]  Well, it took the police investigating anti-terrorist branch of Scotland Yard seven months to question me.
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:26.320]  I actually called them, contacted the emergency information hotline the following day,
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:32.320]  but they didn't get back to me until the end of January in 2006.
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:39.320]  And I just felt it was as though they were trying to whitewash me to make out that I was not even there
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:47.320]  to actually completely dis-make it look as though I was not even on board the bus.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:50.320]  But it is on record that you were there and there's an upcoming book concerning it.
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:54.320]  Yeah, there is. That's what the fourth bomb, the book, is about.
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:39:02.320]  And what I went through, I had some surveillance, I don't know whether they were MI5 anti-terrorist branch
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:08.320]  or what government organization, but I had a lot of probing.
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:18.320]  I even gave an interview with a journalist called Duffy if he was working for the Sunday Mirror.
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.320]  And he showed me a picture. This was a week after the actual 7-7.
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:27.320]  He showed me a picture of Hasseep Hussein and then he asked me,
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:40.320]  have you seen this person? And I said no. And about a day or two after that then, Hasseep Hussein was named as the bus bomber in the British press.
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:44.320]  And let's be clear, none of the people on the bus said they saw any Asian men.
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:50.320]  No, they didn't. And I was downstairs, I saw no Asian guy at all.
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:57.320]  None of your own words describe it. Did you see any Asian men?
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:08.320]  None whatsoever. None on board the bus, none carrying a rucksack at Houston or on the bus, or at Tavza Square.
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:12.320]  Off the charts. Absolutely off the charts.
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:20.320]  Now you describe this harassment as overt surveillance, I guess to intimidate you. Walk us through that, some of the stuff they did.
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:31.320]  It started by following me when I came out of my office on lunch breaks. They were waiting on the corner.
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:42.320]  There's a place called the honourable artillery barracks and that's 10 minutes from where I worked and that's where they kept all the dead bodies from the 7-7 attacks.
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:51.320]  So the police outside there, every time I used to walk past, they used to have something to say, call my name or something like that.
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:41:01.320]  And I think it was just a campaign trying to put psychological stress and pressure upon me because obviously if it came down to me testifying,
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:10.320]  they want me to be deemed unfit to testify or something like that. But I think they just didn't want a public inquiry anyway.
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:13.320]  So they got their own way and there was no public inquiry.
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:18.320]  Any other types of harassment? And then let's talk about how you finally got your meeting with the police and what they did.
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:29.320]  Yeah, well, I was chased once in Aldgate. A guy just came after me. I had arranged to meet someone from the office and then I got there.
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:39.320]  This guy came after me so I actually ran into this building and then he ran in there and followed me and I actually hid in some offices.
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:49.320]  What did he look like? I mean, I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, but if somebody wants to run up on me, I'm going to deck them. I guess it's smarter to run.
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:54.320]  Explain to me what happened. Describe it in detail. What did he look like? Did he growl and start running at you?
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:42:03.320]  He was actually there waiting for me. That's the thing which came through me initially. He was there waiting for me and as soon as I went past him,
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:10.320]  he just set off across the road and came after me. So I didn't run because I was scared of him because I'm not scared of any of these people.
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:12.320]  Obviously you're on air.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:18.320]  I know I'm not scared. If they want to do what they want to do, go ahead and do it. The truth is he's going to be out there regardless.
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:24.320]  So I just tried to escape from him by ducking into some building.
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:34.320]  I'm stupid. My instinct was I would have gotten a fight, but you're smart because by then you knew it was police and actually they would have then got you claiming you just assaulted an officer.
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:41.320]  The 50 cameras on you in the surveilled city of 4.5 million would have all malfunctioned and they would have claimed you assaulted an officer.
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:54.320]  Yeah, precisely. That's what they were trying to do all along because they asked my flatmate whether I had any criminal convictions. They were already delving into my background and my past.
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:07.320]  Trying to find out whether I had any kind of dodgy or criminal past or tendencies or convictions and I think they were trying to use that as a kind of weapon with which they designed me.
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:19.320]  It's a lever. That's what spooks and operatives and informants do. We dealt with that here locally. Please continue. I want to bring Steve Watson up. You're just telling so much more now.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:24.320]  Steve, thanks for holding any other key points you want to bring up here with Daniel.
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:47.320]  I was just going to say, why do you think it is that the police didn't ask you to come in and give a statement straight away? It was later revealed that they relied on the testimony of people who were at the scene but they were either injured or even unconscious in some cases.
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:57.320]  And also, could you talk about some of the phone calls that you got from, you said you got some phone calls from different police departments across the country.
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:02.320]  And you posted those up on your website as well. Yeah, talk about that.
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:21.320]  Yeah, they were from the West Yorkshire Police Constabulary. They were the police constabulary investigating the four alleged bombers and one of them decided to call me one evening and suggest something which I couldn't make out.
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:39.320]  I said, hey, you've got the wrong number guy. But he continued and called the following day and I recorded it and posted it on the web. It just says that I had a vehicle which was involved with transporting something or other to do with the investigation into the 777 bombing.
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:54.320]  You know, I tell you what, I forgot to do this. John, will you go to his website and then you'll give my producer at the network your website again. We've got a link to it on Apple Wars.
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:45:09.320]  World Wide Web. The fourth bomb is the four number four TH bomb dot com. Yeah, go to the fourth bomb dot com. And I know I've listened to that a few days ago. Where specifically is that clip so we can grab that right now and play it?
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:32.320]  If you go to one of the four boxes, I think it's the third box. You also got audio on the web and video from the police interrogating you. Let's tell that story. Finally, six months later, after demanding it, you get their meeting with them. Tell us about that.
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:54.320]  It was just, it wasn't as much as I had hoped it would. They just took my details. But what they did was, he rushed through it. It took four hours, but he rushed through it. It wasn't really as if they were depending on my information and I witness account as a vital part of the inquiry.
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:46:13.320]  Because of course, they had already completed their inquiries or whatever they wanted to say were their inquiries months ago. So what they did was they waited till they'd worked out their story and then kept me running and then brought me in and just said, hey, okay, what's your story?
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:21.320]  Just so that they could do their paperwork. But that's all it was just paperwork. Tell folks about the diagram.
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:42.320]  Are you talking about which one? Because there's been quite a few. Oh, yeah, the bus diagram, which they asked me to find. The bus diagram, which they asked me to mark out where the people were sitting on the bus and where the people were standing and what happened on the bus.
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:47:04.320]  The diagram was the complete wrong layout for the bus. And I said to the anti-terrorist branch detective who was taking my statement, this is completely incorrect. So by me signing this, that's just going to make, just going to render everything which I've told you inadmissible.
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:12.320]  So I think it was just a ploy. They didn't really want my information, as you would understand.
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:20.320]  Amazing. Steve, there's a lot of other facets to this. Any other questions you've got for the guests we have?
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:36.320]  Yeah, I would also point out that Daniel had a shirt, which I believe he still has, with victim's blood on it, which should have been taken for forensic testing, but they weren't even interested in that either.
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:50.320]  It's as if they've worked out previously a line to take on this, and they weren't deviating from the line, even though you've got a firsthand witness here saying this is incorrect. You've got a layout of the bus, which is incorrect.
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:56.320]  I mean, if this doesn't tell us that we need an independent inquiry on this, then what else does?
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:48:16.320]  Daniel Obachaki, knowing what you know now, knowing all the evidence concerning government involvement or block ops involvement, intelligence involvement in past attacks and in the 7-7 attack, seeing your bus directed by these shadowy government characters,
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:24.320]  seeing people on the ground seconds after it happened, the fake bandages, what do you think was really going on there? Who do you think was behind the bombings?
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:40.320]  Well, I know who wasn't behind the bomb, the bomb of the bus, but I couldn't really hazard a guess. It was obviously someone with a lot of power, higher up.
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:50.320]  I've got to live out here, so it's quite obvious who did it, but unless I can actually provide evidence, that's what the website is about.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:54.320]  Putting the evidence out there so people can decide for themselves.
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.320]  But who didn't do it? Because you didn't see an Asian, no one else on record said they did.
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:04.320]  It has to be sustained. It didn't do it. It has to be sustained. It didn't blow up the bus, but hey, who did?
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:10.320]  So that's what we've got to find out, and that's what we're all working towards, and the truth will out.
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:19.320]  That's one thing I know. It's going to out. Everything you're doing, everything like-minded individuals are doing will feed to that.
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:28.320]  Absolutely. This is just off the charts, powerful, and again, it fits with the other witness testimonies, all the other information we have.
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:38.320]  How do you think individuals who did carry this out can live with themselves just killing innocent Britoners on a bus?
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:49.320]  I don't think they really care. They have a role, and they have an objective, and their goal is doing that.
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:50:00.320]  If it kills people, they say, hey, that's just how it goes. We're saving you from the evil terrorists and all the crazy people in the world who are out to destroy you.
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:06.320]  So they probably see their role as helping people, even though they're just killing people.
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:10.320]  Yeah, we've got to kill a few, so they'll accept security to keep them safe.
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:11.320]  Exactly.
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:14.320]  Totally six. Steve Watson?
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:29.320]  Yeah, and I mean, if we do delve into a bit of the evidence, we've got numerous advance warnings from other intelligence agencies from French, Spanish, the Saudis who gave an exact time frame for this,
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:37.320]  and Scotland Yard themselves who told the Israeli Embassy on the very morning, minutes before it was going to go off,
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:45.320]  and Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in a hotel on Tavistock Square, which is a point that is often missed,
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:53.320]  he was told to stay in the hotel, which kind of proves that they had precise location information as well,
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:58.320]  so we need to keep working towards outing the truth on this.
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:06.320]  Well, we need to put this guy's face up everywhere, and we've got technologies to scan his face, do a composite,
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:10.320]  by reducing to the lines beneath the bandages.
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:20.320]  I actually know some police sketch artists who can, we can use computer mapping to get this guy's face.
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:25.320]  This is the type of stuff we'll put a six feet under, but what the hell?
[02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:33.320]  We've got to stop the murders.
[02:51:33.320 --> 02:51:39.320]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:43.320]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:47.320]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:54.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.320 --> 02:52:00.320]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news,
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:06.320]  NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:10.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:12.320]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:16.320]  Terror Storm is a film and everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:28.320]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[02:59:28.320 --> 02:59:35.320]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:47.320]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey Lite's LED lamps as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:53.320]  Its multi-voltage capabilities and multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for a flexible source of electricity.
