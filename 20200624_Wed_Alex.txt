[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Strap yourselves in for one hell of an upcoming transmission.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  We are live.
[00:15.000 --> 00:22.400]  We are go on this Wednesday, June 24th, 2020, global transmission.
[00:22.400 --> 00:26.200]  We are 131 out from the election.
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.200]  Okay, let's lay it out here.
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.200]  Jesse Small, it was never really punished for putting out his insane hoax.
[00:37.200 --> 00:42.200]  In fact, he still has stuck to his guns and been called a hero by Maxine Waters.
[00:42.200 --> 00:51.200]  Well now, Bubba Wallace, the BSR, has gone into an ass car stall.
[00:51.200 --> 00:58.200]  Turns out they have surveillance footage going back over a year that that's just the same looped rope that's on all the stalls.
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.200]  I have one in my house.
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.200]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen, he's not backing down.
[01:05.200 --> 01:07.200]  But look at this.
[01:07.200 --> 01:14.200]  Imagine if one of my crew members was walking by and they saw my tennis shoes and they saw what looks like a noose.
[01:14.200 --> 01:20.200]  That's like a schizophrenic person that thinks the sun is following him or they see what looks like a snake cloud that's going to eat him.
[01:20.200 --> 01:22.200]  Look, can we document him shop please?
[01:22.200 --> 01:23.200]  Look at this.
[01:23.200 --> 01:32.200]  Imagine how scared Bubba Wallace would get and he can drive that race car around the track of 240 miles an hour.
[01:32.200 --> 01:39.200]  But Jones on air threatening with a black noose.
[01:39.200 --> 01:42.200]  This is the level of BS, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42.200 --> 01:43.200]  He's not a good driver.
[01:43.200 --> 01:45.200]  He's not doing well.
[01:45.200 --> 01:49.200]  So his PR firm came up with the same thing that Colin Kaepernick's done.
[01:49.200 --> 01:52.200]  He's claimed all these racists are trying to get you.
[01:52.200 --> 01:57.200]  But by the way, there's some cords over there.
[01:57.200 --> 02:00.200]  And later I'm going to get a wireless mic over there.
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.200]  I'm actually seeing some cords on camera three that look like three nooses.
[02:05.200 --> 02:07.200]  Who set that camera up?
[02:07.200 --> 02:10.200]  I know that's set up the right way.
[02:10.200 --> 02:12.200]  But I want whoever.
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.200]  Was it you, John that set up that camera?
[02:13.200 --> 02:16.200]  You're fired for putting a noose.
[02:16.200 --> 02:20.200]  We have black employees in there and you put nooses in here.
[02:20.200 --> 02:21.200]  Oh my God.
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.200]  I mean today.
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.200]  Oh, it looks just like it is a noose.
[02:26.200 --> 02:28.200]  It is a noose.
[02:28.200 --> 02:33.200]  See, we don't realize the microaggressions we engage in folks.
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.200]  In fact, bring me a wireless mic right now to play run one in here on that camera boom.
[02:37.200 --> 02:39.200]  That looks like a big news right there.
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.200]  In fact, someone could hang themselves on that.
[02:41.200 --> 02:46.200]  I'm sure lawyers will have probably anything that can hurt you's got to be banned.
[02:46.200 --> 02:53.200]  So I'm just not realizing that the boom mic and the whole system looks like a noose.
[02:53.200 --> 02:59.200]  In fact, you know, this cord right here kind of looks like a noose too.
[02:59.200 --> 03:07.200]  You know, we joke about this folks, but this is the total mind control going on by design in this country.
[03:07.200 --> 03:09.200]  So thank you for the wireless microphone.
[03:09.200 --> 03:11.200]  Now I can, I don't need to hook it up.
[03:11.200 --> 03:12.200]  I'm just going to come over here.
[03:12.200 --> 03:13.200]  I know it's not playing.
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.200]  The camera guy's having a heart attack.
[03:15.200 --> 03:16.200]  It's okay.
[03:16.200 --> 03:24.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to hang myself right now in the noose.
[03:24.200 --> 03:26.200]  Here we are.
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.200]  Again, I want to show TV viewers right here.
[03:30.200 --> 03:31.200]  This is a noose right here.
[03:31.200 --> 03:33.200]  You see that?
[03:33.200 --> 03:36.200]  That's a tool of lynching right there ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36.200 --> 03:40.200]  For all TV viewers to see, now it gets worse.
[03:40.200 --> 03:41.200]  Look at this right here.
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.200]  This looks like a noose in this camera.
[03:43.200 --> 03:45.200]  And look, if you can only see it, there was a mirror.
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.200]  The cable on this camera looks like a noose.
[03:48.200 --> 03:53.200]  In fact, can we get it out front and then maybe have a shot where people can see me hanging myself through that.
[03:53.200 --> 03:54.200]  There you go.
[03:54.200 --> 03:56.200]  You see that noose right there?
[03:56.200 --> 03:57.200]  You see that noose?
[03:57.200 --> 03:58.200]  In fact, they're killing me.
[03:58.200 --> 04:00.200]  Oh no, no, no.
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.200]  Nooses everywhere.
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.200]  Call the FBI.
[04:06.200 --> 04:08.200]  White supremacist everywhere.
[04:08.200 --> 04:16.200]  There's another noose right there.
[04:16.200 --> 04:20.200]  Jones made a little of the noose.
[04:20.200 --> 04:25.200]  I forgot to shoot video of this morning on one of the garage doors.
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.200]  I guess it was broken for a while a few years ago.
[04:28.200 --> 04:31.200]  Somebody jury rigged a noose on there.
[04:31.200 --> 04:33.200]  You hurt myself on that.
[04:33.200 --> 04:35.200]  You see the insensitivity?
[04:35.200 --> 04:41.200]  Jones's studio was filled with KKK nooses.
[04:41.200 --> 04:48.200]  Now if you're an actual Nazi collaborator, George Soros, you're good.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.200]  Did you all realize you got nooses on your shoes?
[04:50.200 --> 04:52.200]  I called for shoelaces to be banned.
[04:52.200 --> 04:59.200]  They're a sign of white supremacism.
[04:59.200 --> 05:04.200]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage
[05:04.200 --> 05:06.200]  who thought they'd set up their world government
[05:06.200 --> 05:12.200]  believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.200]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design,
[05:17.200 --> 05:23.200]  and if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling,
[05:23.200 --> 05:26.200]  their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[05:26.200 --> 05:30.200]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us,
[05:30.200 --> 05:32.200]  they themselves fall into it.
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.200]  But God is the master of the universe but gives us free will and this plan is a test.
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.200]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain
[05:40.200 --> 05:43.200]  or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[05:43.200 --> 05:48.200]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[05:48.200 --> 05:50.200]  Everything hinges on you.
[05:50.200 --> 05:51.200]  Everything.
[05:51.200 --> 05:55.200]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.200]  God bless and good luck.
[06:25.200 --> 06:29.200]  We're not a public, not a democracy, and it's fighting for its very life
[06:29.200 --> 06:32.200]  against the forces of the New World Order.
[06:32.200 --> 06:34.200]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones.
[06:34.200 --> 06:43.200]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, June 24th, 2020 transmission.
[06:43.200 --> 06:47.200]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations tells us what it is and finally they're being honest.
[06:47.200 --> 06:51.200]  They said we've bet on communist China, Trump will be defeated.
[06:51.200 --> 06:55.200]  President Xi Jinping must destroy Trump to save America.
[06:55.200 --> 06:59.200]  And they say that the military is preparing a coup against the president
[06:59.200 --> 07:03.200]  and that all the civil unrest and the COVID is all our fault.
[07:03.200 --> 07:08.200]  The European Union has officially come out saying Americans are going to be banned
[07:08.200 --> 07:13.200]  this holiday season coming up in a few months from flying to Europe
[07:13.200 --> 07:17.200]  because we're the epicenter of the virus and we're the bad guys.
[07:17.200 --> 07:21.200]  Because the very same United Nations is counting everyone that dies of gunshot wounds,
[07:21.200 --> 07:28.200]  car wrecks, you name it, they control our policy, cancer, pneumonia, the flu.
[07:28.200 --> 07:32.200]  As COVID deaths, that's completely official and admitted.
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.200]  And they're calling Austin, Texas, the epicenter with 123 deaths
[07:37.200 --> 07:39.200]  and 22 people on ventilators right now.
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.200]  And you go and saying, oh yeah, I got a cough.
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.200]  Oh, you test positive here.
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.200]  We're going to kill you now.
[07:44.200 --> 07:46.200]  And they stick a tube down your throat.
[07:46.200 --> 07:52.200]  They admit that it's killing 70% of those that are dying is from the ventilator.
[07:52.200 --> 08:00.200]  And of that overall, 52% of all deaths have happened in nursing homes.
[08:00.200 --> 08:06.200]  Nursing homes, ladies and gentlemen, where the United Nations directives said
[08:06.200 --> 08:13.200]  you need to send people that test positive for COVID-19 but who are asymptomatic
[08:13.200 --> 08:17.200]  because the virus is a bad pneumonia and is only generally able to kill people
[08:17.200 --> 08:20.200]  that have two or three already preexisting conditions that are extremely old.
[08:20.200 --> 08:22.200]  All of this has come out.
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.200]  We're going to be laying it all out today.
[08:26.200 --> 08:29.200]  But America's democratic unraveling.
[08:29.200 --> 08:35.200]  Countries fall the same way businesses do gradually and then suddenly.
[08:35.200 --> 08:37.200]  Hollywood and the globalists with the chai comms are licking their lips.
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.200]  There's big articles out today on a market watch out of the Wall Street Journal
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.200]  about the decline of the U.S. dollar could happen at warp speed.
[08:46.200 --> 08:50.200]  In the era of coronavirus warrants prominent economics.
[08:50.200 --> 08:52.200]  Economist Steven Roach.
[08:52.200 --> 09:00.200]  And they've all been joining in over and over and over and over again,
[09:00.200 --> 09:06.200]  saying America's weak, America's bad, America's over, the dollar's over.
[09:06.200 --> 09:13.200]  Oh my gosh, Trump's inflating the currency because China and the EU are.
[09:13.200 --> 09:16.200]  And so all over the news every day America's done.
[09:16.200 --> 09:17.200]  America sucks.
[09:17.200 --> 09:18.200]  America's over.
[09:18.200 --> 09:20.200]  America, America, America.
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.200]  These are the good guys.
[09:22.200 --> 09:29.200]  These are the liberals doing everything they can to lie and deceive and silence
[09:29.200 --> 09:37.200]  and shackle and muzzle and choke and suffocate and demoralize the American people.
[09:37.200 --> 09:40.200]  But they are the authors of all of it.
[09:40.200 --> 09:41.200]  They are the criminals.
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.200]  They're the pro pedophile forces.
[09:43.200 --> 09:46.200]  They are the enemy.
[09:46.200 --> 09:58.200]  So that's all coming up today in great, great detail.
[09:58.200 --> 10:08.200]  Now, we're going to dissect the entire COVID-19 fraud here today.
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.200]  And the latest developments and why it's so critical to expose this and how clamped down to is here.
[10:13.200 --> 10:19.200]  You can see the Drudge Report headline, Texans urge to stay indoors.
[10:19.200 --> 10:22.200]  And Austin is the new epicenter.
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.200]  There's a lawyer in D.C. getting ready to fly down here tomorrow.
[10:25.200 --> 10:27.200]  And his law firm told him, don't do it.
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.200]  Austin's had a massive spike.
[10:32.200 --> 10:38.200]  And you go look at the massive spike, a couple thousand cases of people that tested positive.
[10:38.200 --> 10:43.200]  And surprise, surprise, almost all of them don't even have a fever or a cold.
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.200]  They're asymptomatic.
[10:47.200 --> 10:53.200]  But if you tell them you can't breathe easily, they're going to put a tube down your throat
[10:53.200 --> 10:58.200]  and blow your lungs out and get $52,000 on your dead ass.
[10:58.200 --> 11:04.200]  Because Austin is a cesspit blue city as blue as the deepest blue sea.
[11:04.200 --> 11:05.200]  Absolutely corrupt.
[11:05.200 --> 11:09.200]  The city council runs narcotics, child trafficking, all of it.
[11:09.200 --> 11:11.200]  So does Houston.
[11:11.200 --> 11:17.200]  When they take your city over, it's gone.
[11:17.200 --> 11:19.200]  So we'll be laying all of that out today.
[11:19.200 --> 11:22.200]  And the governor of Texas Abbott has now kneeled to the UN.
[11:22.200 --> 11:27.200]  He's bowed to the WHO and Fauci and the NIH and to Governor Newsom.
[11:27.200 --> 11:31.200]  The governor of Texas is now Gavin Newsom.
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.200]  When he says jump, Governor Abbott says, yes, sir, boss, how high and clicks his heels.
[11:37.200 --> 11:39.200]  Not once, but twice.
[11:39.200 --> 11:41.200]  Very, very disgusting.
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.200]  But this is the out of control nanny state.
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.200]  The governor should be exposing that depending on which Bill Gates model,
[11:50.200 --> 11:53.200]  it was 25 to 22 times less than the death they said.
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.200]  But now we're told we can't let one person ever die.
[11:57.200 --> 11:59.200]  So we can't leave.
[11:59.200 --> 12:02.200]  And because America is doing hundreds of times the testing of any other country,
[12:02.200 --> 12:04.200]  we're the leader in it.
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.200]  And the law firms tell the meat packing plants, everybody, they go,
[12:07.200 --> 12:09.200]  test all 2,000 of your employees.
[12:09.200 --> 12:10.200]  And they test them.
[12:10.200 --> 12:11.200]  They go, well, 400 have it.
[12:11.200 --> 12:12.200]  No one's sick.
[12:12.200 --> 12:14.200]  They test 1,300 have it.
[12:14.200 --> 12:15.200]  None of them are sick.
[12:15.200 --> 12:17.200]  This is in the news.
[12:17.200 --> 12:19.200]  But they still shut down.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.200]  It's made up.
[12:20.200 --> 12:22.200]  The tests are fraudulent.
[12:22.200 --> 12:23.200]  They're out of China.
[12:23.200 --> 12:25.200]  And they're out of Bill Gates Foundation.
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.200]  And they're all the same test that look for the debris, not the antibodies,
[12:29.200 --> 12:38.200]  but the debris that you've had a coronavirus or the flu.
[12:38.200 --> 12:41.200]  Both viruses will be show your positive.
[12:41.200 --> 12:47.200]  I've seen Fauci on TV three months ago admitted that the test don't really work.
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.200]  It's a fraud.
[12:50.200 --> 12:53.200]  If you're fighting for your life and you can't breathe,
[12:53.200 --> 13:00.200]  you need, according to the doctors, to take Z-PAC, vitamin C, vitamin D3, and think.
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.200]  And that's all known.
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.200]  But you don't see billboards saying that.
[13:03.200 --> 13:04.200]  You don't hear announcements saying that.
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.200]  You hear, wear your mask.
[13:06.200 --> 13:12.200]  But I have all the articles from even the CDC and the Journal American Medicine saying,
[13:12.200 --> 13:14.200]  do not wear a mask unless you're sick.
[13:14.200 --> 13:16.200]  It does not protect you.
[13:16.200 --> 13:17.200]  It's a hoax.
[13:17.200 --> 13:18.200]  It's a joke.
[13:18.200 --> 13:21.200]  It's a fraud.
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.200]  It actually creates a place where viruses can live for a couple of days instead of them
[13:25.200 --> 13:27.200]  30 seconds in the sunlight.
[13:27.200 --> 13:33.200]  So they become these big sponges filled with viruses breeding in your saliva and bacteria.
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.200]  They're dirty bandages.
[13:37.200 --> 13:39.200]  Go to restaurants, anywhere.
[13:39.200 --> 13:42.200]  And they're sitting there grabbing the food, taking your money with the same pair of gloves
[13:42.200 --> 13:43.200]  like that does anything.
[13:43.200 --> 13:48.200]  Turns out viruses live longer on gloves than they do on your regular skin.
[13:48.200 --> 13:50.200]  It's all theater.
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.200]  Kabuki theater.

[14:01.200 --> 14:04.200]  Turns out they've got surveillance footage going back over a year that that's what's on
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.200]  the garages and they know that.
[14:08.200 --> 14:13.200]  We now have the new big specials that launch today, 4th of July.

[14:47.200 --> 14:49.200]  Bottom of the B12 taken under the tongue.
[14:49.200 --> 14:50.200]  So good for your whole body.
[14:50.200 --> 14:51.200]  Sold out for months.
[14:51.200 --> 14:52.200]  Now finally back in stock.
[14:52.200 --> 14:54.200]  Ultra 12, 50% off.

[14:59.200 --> 15:00.200]  33% off.
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.200]  Store-able food now back in stock, shipping within three to four weeks on average.
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.200]  And with all the craziness, now is the time to get that high quality store-able food in
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.200]  the last 25 years.
[15:09.200 --> 15:11.200]  I would not wait on that.
[15:11.200 --> 15:14.200]  If you think stuff's going to settle down or anything like I told you a few months ago,
[15:14.200 --> 15:17.200]  no, they're going to pull the race for a card and they sure as Hades they did.
[15:17.200 --> 15:19.200]  I just, I've got them dialed in.
[15:19.200 --> 15:21.200]  Next they're going to do mass shootings, bomb federal buildings.
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.200]  It's going to get bad and they're going to try to totally bring down the economy, kill
[15:24.200 --> 15:25.200]  the dollar.
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.200]  And if they are successful and then they got a 30% chance of doing it, you're looking
[15:29.200 --> 15:31.200]  like in a road warrior scenario.
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.200]  It's so bad that I've put in a well in the solar panels and I've never done that.
[15:35.200 --> 15:40.200]  I'm not forgiving that advice, but I'm actually got bulldozers and backhoes going and I'm
[15:40.200 --> 15:41.200]  not playing games.
[15:41.200 --> 15:43.200]  I mean, that's how bad it is.
[15:43.200 --> 15:44.200]  So, not evacuating.
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.200]  It's right outside town, but we're having to go into defensive positions now.
[15:48.200 --> 15:49.200]  It's that bad.
[15:49.200 --> 15:51.200]  If I was you, I could store more food while you still can.
[15:51.200 --> 16:17.200]  That's what I'm going to do.
[16:17.200 --> 16:43.200]  That's what I'm going to do.
[16:43.200 --> 16:48.200]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole
[16:48.200 --> 16:50.200]  operation trying to topple statues?
[16:50.200 --> 16:52.200]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[16:52.200 --> 17:21.200]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[17:21.200 --> 17:27.200]  It's great to keep with you and, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.200]  effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[17:30.200 --> 17:32.200]  We're really excited about it.
[17:32.200 --> 17:34.200]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[17:34.200 --> 17:38.200]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.200]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[17:42.200 --> 17:45.200]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[17:45.200 --> 17:52.200]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[17:52.200 --> 17:59.200]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[17:59.200 --> 18:15.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:15.200 --> 18:19.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[18:19.200 --> 18:28.200]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.200]  The power combine is winning.
[18:33.200 --> 18:35.200]  You know why they're winning?
[18:35.200 --> 18:40.200]  Because we think they're a joke and we're rejecting them and they look like they're failing
[18:40.200 --> 18:42.200]  in all their different attacks.
[18:42.200 --> 18:50.200]  The Russiagate hoax, the coups, the Ukraine hoax, the impeachment, chop, chas, pulling
[18:50.200 --> 18:55.200]  down the monuments, but they're undermining the confidence in the civilization.
[18:55.200 --> 19:00.200]  And in the Wall Street Journal, in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, in Market
[19:00.200 --> 19:03.200]  Watch, on CNBC, I turn on TV.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.200]  China's doing a great job.
[19:05.200 --> 19:08.200]  America's doing a terrible job with COVID.
[19:08.200 --> 19:09.200]  Next channel.
[19:09.200 --> 19:11.200]  Well, you know the dollars being devalued.
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.200]  It could go down any time and that'll be the end of the US dollar.
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.200]  You know China's strong.
[19:20.200 --> 19:25.200]  That's the equivalent of being in the middle of the ocean with a life raft and sharks are
[19:25.200 --> 19:31.200]  swimming around you and you've got the crazy Democrats stabbing it with a knife and you're
[19:31.200 --> 19:32.200]  like, don't do that.
[19:32.200 --> 19:33.200]  The sharks will eat us.
[19:33.200 --> 19:35.200]  They go, the sharks are friendly.
[19:35.200 --> 19:44.200]  Communist China and, you know, the MS-13 love us.
[19:44.200 --> 19:48.200]  But of course, they're going to crash the dollar and then once they get control of the country,
[19:48.200 --> 19:49.200]  bring it back.
[19:49.200 --> 19:54.200]  But after you're totally in depression, they want to break our will so damn bad and create
[19:54.200 --> 19:55.200]  a dystopia so bad.
[19:55.200 --> 20:01.200]  And I just hope if they're successful, all of you remember that you didn't take it serious.
[20:01.200 --> 20:06.200]  Because I'm just trying to tell you, my spidey sense is shaking off the chart.
[20:06.200 --> 20:08.200]  If there was a gauge, it's broken.
[20:08.200 --> 20:09.200]  There's steam coming out of it.
[20:09.200 --> 20:12.200]  We are in mega massive danger.
[20:12.200 --> 20:16.200]  You know, in loss in space, the old loss in space, when Robbie the Robot goes, danger,
[20:16.200 --> 20:18.200]  danger, danger, danger.
[20:18.200 --> 20:19.200]  His head would blow off.
[20:19.200 --> 20:20.200]  There's so much danger.
[20:20.200 --> 20:25.200]  Fire would shoot out.
[20:25.200 --> 20:34.200]  And it's so pathetic that 20, 30% of the American people literally hate their country when they
[20:34.200 --> 20:37.960]  have never been outside the nation and have no idea about how things work or how things
[20:37.960 --> 20:43.200]  operate and how spoiled, rotten they've been.
[20:43.200 --> 20:48.200]  I'll hit the huge COVID-19 news next segment.
[20:48.200 --> 20:51.200]  But let me just get into general news this segment.
[20:51.200 --> 21:02.200]  I'm looking at stacks of articles with headlines about the decline of the US dollar.
[21:02.200 --> 21:03.200]  The dollar could plunge at any moment.
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.200]  The dollar could be gone.
[21:04.200 --> 21:05.200]  Warp speed.
[21:05.200 --> 21:06.200]  These are headlines.
[21:06.200 --> 21:08.200]  And these are major economists.
[21:08.200 --> 21:10.200]  The same ones that told us that Trump would never win.
[21:10.200 --> 21:15.200]  The same ones that told us we never achieve a 3% growth rate.
[21:15.200 --> 21:20.200]  Running around, promoting all of this.
[21:20.200 --> 21:27.200]  So that is the equivalent of you're sitting there on a Sunday morning and your dad walks
[21:27.200 --> 21:29.200]  in with a five gallon can of gasoline.
[21:29.200 --> 21:32.200]  He starts pouring it all over himself, all over you.
[21:32.200 --> 21:37.200]  And then he goes over and gets some matches and says, you ready to go see Jesus now?
[21:37.200 --> 21:41.200]  You'd be running out the door before he even went for the matches.
[21:41.200 --> 21:43.200]  You'd say, dad's gone crazy.
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.200]  But this isn't daddy.
[21:44.200 --> 21:49.200]  This is the new world order that we know lies to us constantly is obsessed with pedophilia,
[21:49.200 --> 21:55.200]  tells us our country sucks, burns the flag, tears down George Washington.
[21:55.200 --> 21:58.200]  Now they've attacked the Lincoln Memorial again.
[21:58.200 --> 22:00.200]  They're pledging to attack it again.
[22:00.200 --> 22:02.200]  And they're openly saying, oh, we know who Lincoln is.
[22:02.200 --> 22:07.200]  He isn't good enough, you know, by today's crazy standards of whatever.
[22:07.200 --> 22:12.200]  Magically, this is a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:12.200 --> 22:14.200]  So let me tell you what else is coming up.
[22:14.200 --> 22:17.200]  Big stack of open government pedophilia in the news.
[22:17.200 --> 22:18.200]  It's mainstream news now.
[22:18.200 --> 22:20.200]  And that's really the good news.
[22:20.200 --> 22:24.200]  Here's the bad news.
[22:24.200 --> 22:30.200]  The bad news is people don't realize how much trouble we're in.
[22:30.200 --> 22:37.200]  But the good news is the globalist are so mentally ill, so evil and set up such parasitic systems
[22:37.200 --> 22:43.200]  and are so surrounded by other corrupt evil people and the idiots that they're all eating their own.
[22:43.200 --> 22:49.200]  And that's why they want to bring America and Europe and the rest of it down as fast as they can to have a global reorganization
[22:49.200 --> 22:57.200]  on a planetary Marshall plan is what Soros and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers are calling for to try to then prop themselves up.
[22:57.200 --> 23:02.200]  And if we can just hold out and show that they're the ones destroying the economy and the culture and the planet,
[23:02.200 --> 23:05.200]  they won't be destroyed and not us.
[23:05.200 --> 23:12.200]  But they are trying to take us with them.
[23:12.200 --> 23:17.200]  And that's why it's getting more and more mentally ill, more and more insane.
[23:17.200 --> 23:27.200]  With videos now out of the chas chop zone and other areas in D.C. onto Seattle where people flagellate themselves and beat themselves
[23:27.200 --> 23:33.200]  because they're slaves and walk around with nooses hanging around their necks.
[23:33.200 --> 23:35.200]  Like Jesse Smollett did.
[23:35.200 --> 23:41.200]  But they're white and the black folks tell them that they're the slaves as if they deserve that as if they did something wrong.
[23:41.200 --> 23:43.200]  This is all mind control.
[23:43.200 --> 23:46.200]  This is all mental illness.
[23:46.200 --> 23:48.200]  Slavery is still going on in Africa.
[23:48.200 --> 23:50.200]  It's still going on in the Middle East.
[23:50.200 --> 23:56.200]  And only bad manager slavers were doing things like you see there.
[23:56.200 --> 23:58.200]  And that's not the fitting that institution.
[23:58.200 --> 23:59.200]  I hate it.
[23:59.200 --> 24:00.200]  I'm about human liberty.
[24:00.200 --> 24:05.200]  But it's all just these weird, cliched, idiotic things.
[24:05.200 --> 24:09.200]  And to see what the psychological war chiefs can get us to do and get us to engage in.
[24:09.200 --> 24:14.200]  And there's not much more time to turn this around.
[24:14.200 --> 24:21.200]  But the media and the corporate culture is showing all this burning and all this looting and all this idiocy
[24:21.200 --> 24:27.200]  and are pretending like it's legitimate trying to get even more people to go out and do it to then say Trump's out of control.
[24:27.200 --> 24:29.200]  The police have been overthrown.
[24:29.200 --> 24:31.200]  The local government's been overthrown.
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.200]  We've got to come in with the United Nations and take control of it.
[24:33.200 --> 24:38.200]  And that's officially been announced by the Democrats under the Strong Cities Initiative.
[24:38.200 --> 24:42.200]  This isn't something that's coming or something that John Birch Society told you about 50 years ago.
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.200]  It's here, now, operational in your face.
[24:47.200 --> 25:00.200]  And so you look at this NASCAR driver, Bubba B.S. Wallace, saying that the rope to pull down the garage was a noose.
[25:00.200 --> 25:03.200]  I guess a noose big enough for a cat's neck.
[25:03.200 --> 25:07.200]  And he's this big hero.
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.200]  People say, well, you know, he's an idiot.
[25:11.200 --> 25:13.200]  But see, there's people out there that'll still believe this.
[25:13.200 --> 25:19.200]  There's people still believe Jesse Smollett, Smollier, that all this happened to him.
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.200]  I mean, every garage I've ever seen has got a hand pull on it as a backup.
[25:25.200 --> 25:28.200]  I've got one just like at my house.
[25:28.200 --> 25:34.200]  But see, that's how this works now, ladies and gentlemen, because you get to be the victim.
[25:34.200 --> 25:45.200]  And so you go and you project onto everything what you want to find so that, again, you can be all over the news and get attention for yourself.
[25:45.200 --> 25:53.200]  And you watch, he will end up getting Nike sponsorship out of this.
[25:53.200 --> 25:57.200]  Maybe he'll, you know, bozo the clown is here, whatever.
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.200]  But he'll do it now, even though he's about as black as I am.
[26:01.200 --> 26:05.200]  I mean, seriously, I think I got a tan better than this guy right now.
[26:05.200 --> 26:11.200]  And he goes on Don Lemon, who remember had Smollett on and said, you're a hero and oh, you're so incredible.
[26:11.200 --> 26:13.200]  And it's never backtrack on that.
[26:13.200 --> 26:16.200]  And so now he's doubled down yet again.
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.200]  That's all coming up today.
[26:20.200 --> 26:23.200]  It's all about pissing on America.
[26:23.200 --> 26:30.200]  It's all about showing to the corporate masters, whether you be black or white, that you hate this country and you're going along with the fake narrative.
[26:30.200 --> 26:33.200]  That's what the master about what it's all about.
[26:33.200 --> 26:40.200]  It's all about a symbol that you will do whatever you're told because you're in the cult.
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.200]  Well, guess what?
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.200]  Info wars isn't in the cult and our incredible audience of activists aren't in the cult.
[26:45.200 --> 26:46.200]  And we're awakened.
[26:46.200 --> 26:50.200]  We have the facts and I have information that will devastate, devastate on every front.
[26:50.200 --> 26:52.200]  The COVID hoax.
[26:52.200 --> 26:54.200]  Stay with us.
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.200]  I told you this five months ago and now it's official.
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.200]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and he is permanent.
[27:01.200 --> 27:10.200]  The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control hoax knew that once they got the public for several months to wear mask and social distance,
[27:10.200 --> 27:19.200]  they would be able to permanently turn it on and off anytime they want by putting handcuffs on someone and then add new demands that people take force inoculations,
[27:19.200 --> 27:24.200]  that they have contact tracing on their phones and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[27:24.200 --> 27:31.200]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government, forced inoculation and complete enslavement of the human population.
[27:31.200 --> 27:33.200]  This is medical tyranny.
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.200]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates UN takeover.
[27:36.200 --> 27:38.200]  This is the end of civilization.
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.200]  As you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.200]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[27:46.200 --> 27:48.200]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[27:48.200 --> 27:49.200]  Show them the numbers.
[27:49.200 --> 27:52.200]  Show them the facts and explain that it's the end of the world.
[27:52.200 --> 27:54.200]  As we know it, if we don't wake up and resist.
[27:54.200 --> 28:04.200]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[28:04.200 --> 28:09.200]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[29:54.200 --> 30:23.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:23.200 --> 30:33.200]  It is Wednesday, June 24th of the year, is 2020.
[30:33.200 --> 30:39.200]  Maybe too little too late, but at least Congress is now waking up to what's actually happening.
[30:39.200 --> 30:46.200]  Media executives warn Big Tech is secretly seizing all the power over information.
[30:46.200 --> 31:01.200]  The channel comes out and says that there is a concerted effort by Big Tech to censor and control the outcome of the election and to control and dominate and bully people and that they've also lied to Congress about it.
[31:01.200 --> 31:18.200]  But the way to go after them is for the massive concerted ongoing surveillance of people, even in their private text, working with outside groups to control opinion.
[31:18.200 --> 31:19.200]  That's racketeering.
[31:19.200 --> 31:20.200]  That's organized crime.
[31:20.200 --> 31:21.200]  That's illegal surveillance.
[31:21.200 --> 31:23.200]  And there's so many other facets.
[31:23.200 --> 31:27.200]  There's Communist China working with Big Tech very closely to suppress their people.
[31:27.200 --> 31:38.200]  That is the biggest recipient of slave labor of the Uyghurs, 3 million enforced labor death camps where they reportedly execute up to a thousand a week.
[31:38.200 --> 31:44.200]  Drone footage has even been leaked of the men being marched to be executed with bags over their heads.
[31:44.200 --> 31:46.200]  This is all confirmed.
[31:46.200 --> 31:55.200]  But Tim Cook, like a demonic walking stick, is up there telling you how much he loves Black Lives Matter, so it's okay.
[31:55.200 --> 31:57.200]  It's beyond sick.
[31:57.200 --> 31:59.200]  They broke into Jeffrey Dahmer's house.
[31:59.200 --> 32:02.200]  He's got all these bodies in the refrigerator and in these barrels.
[32:02.200 --> 32:03.200]  He says, it's okay.
[32:03.200 --> 32:05.200]  I gave $10 to La Rotary Club.
[32:05.200 --> 32:08.200]  It's like, I mean, I gave money to Black Lives Matter.
[32:08.200 --> 32:10.200]  So we run death camps.
[32:10.200 --> 32:12.200]  Come on.
[32:12.200 --> 32:13.200]  That's all coming up.
[32:13.200 --> 32:18.200]  But let me hit this right now.
[32:18.200 --> 32:25.200]  COVID-19 is man-made so that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UN can finally patent a new virus.
[32:25.200 --> 32:35.200]  But it's in the cold family of Corona and then it's had some other viruses sliced into it.
[32:35.200 --> 32:38.200]  It has major gain of function.
[32:38.200 --> 32:41.200]  It's very communicable.
[32:41.200 --> 32:42.200]  But that's it.
[32:42.200 --> 32:50.200]  If you have a deficiency of vitamin C, D, zinc, or any of the combinations, then it can go into your cells, replicate, and kill you.
[32:50.200 --> 32:54.200]  But generally, it's the autoimmune response of the lungs that's killing people.
[32:54.200 --> 33:01.200]  And instead of them giving them, I've talked to medical doctors on air about this, massive dosages of anti-inflammatories or benadryl,
[33:01.200 --> 33:16.200]  they put a tube down their throat and start pumping the lungs up when the lungs are falling apart and disintegrating because they're having an autoimmune response just like your legs do to poison ivy or to a bug bite, a bee sting.
[33:16.200 --> 33:18.200]  So again, there's so many fronts to this.
[33:18.200 --> 33:23.200]  If you don't have zinc and you don't have vitamin D and you don't have C, your cells, you'll die anyways.
[33:23.200 --> 33:26.200]  A regular cold will come by and you'll die.
[33:26.200 --> 33:30.200]  They're having starvation in the third world.
[33:30.200 --> 33:35.200]  It's not usually starvation if there is even a death certificate.
[33:35.200 --> 33:42.200]  They just say die out of a cold, die out of the flu.
[33:42.200 --> 33:53.200]  So it's on record that the machines are killing people and it's on record that they sent people that had COVID-19 into the nursing homes and that's over half the deaths.
[33:53.200 --> 34:01.200]  This is the sensational information, the people that ran this, the UN, the NIH, Fauci.
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.200]  Trump has to come out and say we were all deceived, not just sideline Fauci.
[34:06.200 --> 34:13.200]  He has to call for a criminal investigation and say, hey, I was deceived, but the blue states followed the UN orders.
[34:13.200 --> 34:15.200]  They sent people their deaths.
[34:15.200 --> 34:19.200]  Trump should completely own it because he didn't do it consciously.
[34:19.200 --> 34:21.200]  They did it consciously and it will destroy them.
[34:21.200 --> 34:23.200]  It will burn him.
[34:23.200 --> 34:27.200]  It will destroy them.
[34:27.200 --> 34:36.200]  If I was Trump, because he's surrounded by traitors and surrounded by cowards and they're ready to assassinate him at any moment, they know it's risky, but if they think it's too dangerous, they will.
[34:36.200 --> 34:46.200]  He's got to say he's having a press conference or a Face the Nation type deal on general issues that have his own notes he pulls out.
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.200]  And then he goes over this, how they sent people to the nursing homes to spread the death.
[34:51.200 --> 34:52.200]  That's over half the death.
[34:52.200 --> 34:59.200]  They wouldn't let the public know about zinc and vitamin D3 or vitamin C when all the studies show that.
[34:59.200 --> 35:04.200]  They didn't want you to know about hydroxychloroquine because it pushes zinc into the cells because they don't want you to have hope.
[35:04.200 --> 35:09.200]  And they take all the regular deaths from other things and put it in the COVID column.
[35:09.200 --> 35:18.200]  And now the EU says America did the bad job and they're now calling it the European virus and they're now saying it's America's fault and saying planes can't fly to Europe.
[35:18.200 --> 35:23.200]  They're getting ready to announce that because we're the bad guy.
[35:23.200 --> 35:24.200]  Here's the headline.
[35:24.200 --> 35:28.200]  EU may bar American travelers as it reopens borders citing failures on virus.
[35:28.200 --> 35:30.200]  This is a selective takeover.
[35:30.200 --> 35:35.200]  China's open.
[35:35.200 --> 35:38.200]  We're not.
[35:38.200 --> 35:44.200]  We're at immunity music festival to take place in July against the advice of medical experts when independent.
[35:44.200 --> 35:52.200]  But you've got the former head of Rockefeller University Hospital top neurologist come out and say if you let it run its course we'd already be immune to it.
[35:52.200 --> 35:53.200]  But they don't want that.
[35:53.200 --> 35:59.200]  They want you locked up inside until they have double the death rates again in the blue areas they control.
[35:59.200 --> 36:00.200]  Don't open the door.
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.200]  Japan and haunted houses goes drive through.
[36:03.200 --> 36:08.200]  Again, they can't even talk to each other.
[36:08.200 --> 36:11.200]  This is the proper Canada, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:11.200 --> 36:13.200]  And this is how they're operating.
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.200]  Meanwhile, Texas Governor Abbott capitulates to California pushes mask.
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.200]  Of the beast to buy and sell.
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.200]  I wanted to actually show you the state regulations that are still just that regulations in California that is not mandatory.
[36:27.200 --> 36:34.200]  If you have anxiety or you have asthma or you have a pre-existing condition and they're not allowed to ask you what your condition is.
[36:34.200 --> 36:42.200]  And my wife has now been doing this at the grocery stores and at the shops and they've been told and they know this and they shut their mouths.
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.200]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.200]  And again, these masks do not even protect you.
[36:48.200 --> 36:49.200]  But don't worry.
[36:49.200 --> 36:51.200]  We'll play this clip when we come back.
[36:51.200 --> 37:02.200]  We've used Joy Behar says her and her husband go around vigilante style, making sure everyone wears their mask.
[37:02.200 --> 37:03.200]  Wow.
[37:03.200 --> 37:06.200]  Meanwhile, here's the Journal of American Medicine.
[37:06.200 --> 37:09.200]  Mass should not be worn by healthy people to prevent respiratory infection.
[37:09.200 --> 37:17.200]  There is no evidence that wearing mask prevents healthy people from getting sick and mask can be short supply and unavailable for people who need them.
[37:17.200 --> 37:25.200]  They're going to say the cloth ones are totally worthless and they're actually worse and collect viruses and then allow them to live longer and be spread longer.
[37:25.200 --> 37:26.200]  Yeah.
[37:26.200 --> 37:30.200]  They say they die in open air in sunlight in 30 seconds.
[37:30.200 --> 37:32.200]  That's an estimate they say without sunlight two minutes.
[37:32.200 --> 37:33.200]  Yeah.
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.200]  But oh, don't go to the beach though.
[37:36.200 --> 37:38.200]  Cloth masks are useless against COVID-19.
[37:38.200 --> 37:40.200]  Here it is right here.
[37:40.200 --> 37:42.200]  This is from the CDC.
[37:42.200 --> 37:44.200]  Mass don't work.
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.200]  We're going to cover it all when we come back.
[37:47.200 --> 37:50.200]  But meanwhile, Oregon County makes mass mandatory, but only for white people.
[37:50.200 --> 37:57.200]  It said that it's a sign of slavery for blacks to wear it or Hispanics and that could be used for racial profiling, whatever that means.
[37:57.200 --> 37:59.200]  So only whites have to wear it.
[37:59.200 --> 38:01.200]  I'm not kidding.
[38:01.200 --> 38:03.200]  It's all a random exercise of power.
[38:03.200 --> 38:06.200]  That story is up on infowars.com.
[38:06.200 --> 38:13.200]  And that's why we've launched wecan'tbreath.news because the psychological studies show it depresses people.
[38:13.200 --> 38:17.200]  It causes them to epoxy, build up carbon dioxide in the blood.
[38:17.200 --> 38:19.200]  It helps spread disease.
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.200]  It makes people think they're safe when they're not from other things.
[38:22.200 --> 38:27.200]  It takes away from nutrition, which people do have to have.
[38:27.200 --> 38:29.200]  Wecan'tbreath.news.
[38:29.200 --> 38:32.200]  When I come back, I'm going to show you the California Department of Public Health.
[38:32.200 --> 38:40.200]  And I'm going to show you the Texas statements and others that are on record showing you that there is no law or no regulation.
[38:40.200 --> 38:41.200]  You have to do this.
[38:41.200 --> 38:44.200]  And by law, they have to give you those loopholes just like there's no law.
[38:44.200 --> 38:46.200]  You've got to take vaccines.
[38:46.200 --> 38:52.200]  So again, wecan'tbreath, ladies and gentlemen, wecan'tbreath.news.
[38:52.200 --> 38:59.200]  If you want to take action, if you want to fight back on your email, on your Twitter, on your Facebook, that's not a banned URL yet.
[38:59.200 --> 39:01.200]  Or hashtag wecan'tbreath.
[39:01.200 --> 39:02.200]  Put that out.
[39:02.200 --> 39:03.200]  Take action.
[39:03.200 --> 39:10.200]  And the site we're adding videos right now in articles shows these documents, shows these studies, shows these exemptions.
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.200]  You can print them right off, right there, and shove it back in their face.
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.200]  But I'm going to show you all of this in great detail when we return.
[39:18.200 --> 39:20.200]  So it's not just my speculation.
[39:20.200 --> 39:21.200]  You're speculating.
[39:21.200 --> 39:22.200]  I'm telling you the truth.
[39:22.200 --> 39:23.200]  You'll see it for yourself.
[39:23.200 --> 39:30.200]  We can take action because they want to keep the mask on, to keep America shut, to destroy the economy, to kick Trump out in the election.
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.200]  And then they're going to bring in the cell phone tracking, which they've already announced, the Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton's control.
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.200]  That's mainstream news.
[39:36.200 --> 39:38.200]  I'll show you that out of USA Today.
[39:38.200 --> 39:40.200]  The Clintons are going to control the contact racers.
[39:40.200 --> 39:47.200]  They come to your door and the apps on your phone that Google and Apple say they're going to put on there whether you like it or not.
[39:47.200 --> 39:49.200]  They're making their tyrannical move.
[39:49.200 --> 39:54.200]  We've got to fight back or be totally enslaved.
[39:54.200 --> 40:07.200]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[40:07.200 --> 40:21.200]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, that there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and then going down the drain.
[40:21.200 --> 40:26.200]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[40:26.200 --> 40:31.200]  But God is the master of the universe but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[40:31.200 --> 40:38.200]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[40:38.200 --> 40:43.200]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[40:43.200 --> 40:45.200]  Everything hinges on you.
[40:45.200 --> 40:46.200]  Everything.
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.200]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[40:50.200 --> 40:53.200]  God bless and good luck.
[40:53.200 --> 41:02.200]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC in Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die.
[41:02.200 --> 41:05.200]  We did not do exactly as they said.
[41:05.200 --> 41:07.200]  And it turned out it was all frauds.
[41:07.200 --> 41:14.200]  The models, the testing, taking regular depths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[41:14.200 --> 41:17.200]  But none of them are getting sued, none of them are getting prosecuted.
[41:17.200 --> 41:26.200]  None of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[41:26.200 --> 41:35.200]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people creating hysteria and saying the numbers spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election.
[41:35.200 --> 41:37.200]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[41:37.200 --> 41:39.200]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city.
[41:39.200 --> 41:41.200]  We've got to lock down again.
[41:41.200 --> 41:42.200]  Everything's over.
[41:42.200 --> 41:47.200]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[41:47.200 --> 41:55.200]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it, your choice.
[41:55.200 --> 42:05.200]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[42:05.200 --> 42:09.200]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[42:09.200 --> 42:16.200]  Now, open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[42:16.200 --> 42:21.200]  Now, the internal operations of the globalist are being externalized.
[42:21.200 --> 42:24.200]  You must decide which side you're on.
[42:24.200 --> 42:33.200]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[42:33.200 --> 42:37.200]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[42:37.200 --> 42:40.200]  The delusions must end now.
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.200]  Info wars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[42:45.200 --> 42:49.200]  Most people that are aware of the new order decided to join it out of fear.
[42:49.200 --> 42:51.200]  They are truly fearless.
[42:51.200 --> 43:20.200]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[43:20.200 --> 43:25.200]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[43:25.200 --> 43:34.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have, because we are going into hardcore United Nations controlled bondage.
[43:34.200 --> 43:44.200]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing they're going under UN control and turning their police into community activist organizers.
[43:44.200 --> 43:46.200]  This is just the beginning.
[43:46.200 --> 43:58.200]  Everything is going to accelerate now from this point out, so it's here. No more games. The new order has arrived.
[43:58.200 --> 44:09.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:09.200 --> 44:21.200]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.200]  By the way, it's not bragging when I say this. It's actually embarrassing.
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.200]  I was on the view like in 2006, 2007, something like that.
[44:29.200 --> 44:33.200]  And then Joy Behar said, hey, come over and do my CNN show with me.
[44:33.200 --> 44:37.200]  So I go over there and they're taping it and she literally starts hitting on me.
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.200]  Because I was bashing the war and stuff. She thought I was a Democrat.
[44:41.200 --> 44:46.200]  And I'm like, no, I'm more of a libertarian. She's like, oh, look at man, what are you doing later?
[44:46.200 --> 44:49.200]  I mean, this woman is just completely out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:49.200 --> 44:53.200]  So it's not bragging. She's as ugly as Mr. Ed.
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.200]  But here she is, ladies and gentlemen, like the Seahag hit on me.
[44:58.200 --> 45:01.200]  Or like the witch with the apple and Snow White.
[45:01.200 --> 45:08.200]  Mira, Mira on the wall. Who's the ugliest new owner? Which of them all? Bachelors. She's old and Bachelors. She's spiritually ugly.
[45:08.200 --> 45:11.200]  She's out saying that she drives around with her husband.
[45:11.200 --> 45:15.200]  Boy, feel sorry for that guy. She must have been something back with electricity.
[45:15.200 --> 45:17.200]  Still a line from Caddyshack.
[45:17.200 --> 45:29.200]  And this individual is saying she's out vigilante style looking for who's not wearing the mask. Here she is.
[45:29.200 --> 45:35.200]  All we have. Wait a second. Barring a vaccine. All we have is social distancing and masks.
[45:35.200 --> 45:41.200]  Neither of which is happening in this country right now. There is no leadership telling us.
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.200]  This is going to go on and on and on. And I'll tell you the truth. It's making me crazy.
[45:45.200 --> 45:53.200]  All I do is I get in my car maybe with Steve and we go around town looking for people who are not wearing masks.
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.200]  Jealous of my life? That's it. That's what I do.
[45:56.200 --> 46:00.200]  Well, run your mouth with me, witch, and you'll get the teeth.
[46:00.200 --> 46:07.200]  Now, let's get serious. I'm going to go down Sunday to the south side of the Capitol, right there on 11th Street,
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.200]  and then we're going to walk the 100 yards up to the Capitol steps, give some speeches.
[46:11.200 --> 46:15.200]  We've got a couple of pastors coming out. So this will also be a church service.
[46:15.200 --> 46:24.200]  And you know, they're still arresting Christians and Jews that try to have church services or synagogue services in New Jersey and New York.
[46:24.200 --> 46:32.200]  But DeBlasio is endorsing pulling down the statues and hundreds of thousands marching for, quote, black trans people.
[46:32.200 --> 46:40.200]  Because they're so incredibly persecuted in one of their alternate dimension. I'm not sure.
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.200]  And so we're going to be out there. You watch the media will demonize us. They're out there spreading.
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.200]  How dare them? Because they want to wage war on logic.
[46:48.200 --> 46:53.200]  There are only a few thousand cases in Travis County. Travis County is over two million people.
[46:53.200 --> 46:58.200]  Only a hundred and twenty something have died. Most of them super old with three or four conditions.
[46:58.200 --> 47:03.200]  They're taking again people from the regular death list of putting it on there. It's a hoax.
[47:03.200 --> 47:07.200]  Remember, it was only going to last two weeks. So the hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed.
[47:07.200 --> 47:10.200]  That's all you got to do is wear a mask. Don't leave your house for two weeks.
[47:10.200 --> 47:18.200]  And I told you, it's going to be forever because the Bill and Melinda Gates battle plan said two years till a vaccine.
[47:18.200 --> 47:24.200]  You take your vaccine, you take contact tracers, you take home inspections, you take forced inoculations.
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.200]  Your cell phone tracks you. But I turn on the Internet today and it's articles everywhere.
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.200]  Alex Jones lies, says Bill Gates is involved in contact tracing or wants apps on your phone.
[47:35.200 --> 47:40.200]  Then I can pull up the very groups he runs are pushing it.
[47:40.200 --> 47:45.200]  Because they don't want us to organize against it now. They want to deny they're doing it while they sell it.
[47:45.200 --> 47:48.200]  Hey, we're going to put apps on your phone. We're going to make you have it.
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.200]  Contact tracers are coming to your house. Bill Clinton's foundation runs it. Chelsea's on the board.
[47:52.200 --> 47:59.200]  I can play Bill Clinton saying it. I've played the clips of Bill Clinton on TV saying,
[47:59.200 --> 48:02.200]  well, we run this thing through our foundation, Bill Gates.
[48:02.200 --> 48:05.200]  And we're going to send people to your house. We need about two million people.
[48:05.200 --> 48:08.200]  And we're going to have an app on your phone and Big Tech's doing a great job working with us.
[48:08.200 --> 48:12.200]  And we're going to contact tracers. Make sure you don't get close to people that you shouldn't.
[48:12.200 --> 48:16.200]  And then Netanyahu announces it.
[48:16.200 --> 48:21.200]  Oh, my gosh. But let me hit the key point here. This needs to happen everywhere.
[48:21.200 --> 48:25.200]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters. This Sunday, your capital, your city council,
[48:25.200 --> 48:28.200]  your county seat, you may be one person, you may be 10 people.
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.200]  But if you've got a real church, you should go have your open air church service.
[48:33.200 --> 48:37.200]  Even if you believe the COVID hoax, that's the same place to be out in the sunshine
[48:37.200 --> 48:42.200]  and preach the First Amendment, which is free speech and religion.
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.200]  So that's why we're having this rally for free speech and open air church service.
[48:46.200 --> 48:48.200]  Everybody's welcome whether you're a Christian or not.
[48:48.200 --> 48:54.200]  This Sunday at the Texas Capitol in the governor's mansion is approximately 300 yards away.
[48:54.200 --> 48:59.200]  We're going to march up there and just say shame on you Abbott going with what Newsom wants the one he's pushing.
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.200]  Now, let me hit this because this is important.
[49:03.200 --> 49:10.200]  Number one, here it is, you know, in Oregon and in California, they're exempting the homeless and minorities.
[49:10.200 --> 49:12.200]  I'm not kidding from wearing the mask.
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.200]  Well, fine, except everybody. It's much crap.
[49:15.200 --> 49:20.200]  But here is the state of California Health and Human Services Declaration June 18th.
[49:20.200 --> 49:23.200]  Guidance for the use of face coverage. It's guidance.
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.200]  Then they asked the cities and counties to do unconstitutional laws, hoping they're stupid.
[49:28.200 --> 49:30.200]  That's what the governor's done.
[49:30.200 --> 49:33.200]  There's no law, just guidance, but then they say it's the law.
[49:33.200 --> 49:41.200]  Persons for whom wearing a face covering would create the risk of a person related to their work as determined by local state and federal regulations and workplace safety guidelines.
[49:41.200 --> 49:47.200]  Persons who are obtaining a service involving the nose or face, which is temporary removal of the face covering.
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.200]  And it goes on persons who are of age who can't do it.
[49:51.200 --> 49:55.200]  Persons that are swimming. Oh, thanks for telling me how to wear a mask while I'm swimming. I kill you.
[49:55.200 --> 50:02.200]  Persons with a medical condition, mental health conditions, the key one, or disability that prevents wearing a mask covering.
[50:02.200 --> 50:08.200]  This includes persons with a medical condition for whom wearing a face covering would obstruct breathing or make them unconscious.
[50:08.200 --> 50:11.200]  It goes on. It goes on for asthma. It goes on for mental illness.
[50:11.200 --> 50:13.200]  It goes on for anxiety.
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.200]  You do not have to wear the damn mask.
[50:16.200 --> 50:22.200]  And I've got the Texas documents right here for you from the Travis County.
[50:22.200 --> 50:24.200]  Pull up any county you want.
[50:24.200 --> 50:31.200]  There are a few crazy judges in the in these states that county levels say, I don't care who you are, you got to wear one. Yeah, it's a load of bull.
[50:31.200 --> 50:34.200]  And it's got to be challenged.
[50:34.200 --> 50:36.200]  Overhead shot, please.
[50:36.200 --> 50:38.200]  So there it is for you.
[50:38.200 --> 50:53.200]  COVID-19 prevention guidance order, all based on a fraud, all based on a hoax, all based on something that hasn't happened, all based on using the regular deaths in the COVID column, all based on shipping COVID patients into nursing homes where the only group could actually kill.
[50:53.200 --> 50:57.200]  Run down people with no vitamins or minerals in the dark.
[50:57.200 --> 50:59.200]  We're 85.
[50:59.200 --> 51:05.200]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, and people need to understand that this is going on.
[51:05.200 --> 51:09.200]  We've got flyers going up.
[51:09.200 --> 51:17.200]  That you can hang in your local areas that you can pass out that we encourage you to print off and help us pass out downtown this weekend or in your area.
[51:17.200 --> 51:26.200]  Here's an example of the stuff we've been posting I am exempt from all regulation managing face mask uses in public wearing a mask poses a health risk to me under the ADA and HIPAA.
[51:26.200 --> 51:29.200]  I am not required to disclose my medical conditions.
[51:29.200 --> 51:43.200]  Anyone Department of Justice, ADA violation information line 805143001 organizations of businesses can be fined $75,000 for the first ADA violation and $100,000 for any subsequent violations.
[51:43.200 --> 51:45.200]  Attention government agents.
[51:45.200 --> 51:47.200]  This is something a citizen made.
[51:47.200 --> 51:49.200]  We've put it over at.
[51:49.200 --> 51:50.200]  I can't breathe.
[51:50.200 --> 51:51.200]  We can't breathe.
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.200]  We can't breathe.
[51:52.200 --> 51:54.200]  News and a bunch of other flyers.
[51:54.200 --> 51:56.200]  But this is the law.
[51:56.200 --> 51:57.200]  This is accurate.
[51:57.200 --> 51:59.200]  This is the truth.
[51:59.200 --> 52:02.200]  We're also shooting an informational video about it that breaks it all down.
[52:02.200 --> 52:06.200]  It's going up the next few minutes to that site and a band on video.
[52:06.200 --> 52:13.200]  Here's another one as face mask requirements pop up across the Texas governor Abbott faces criticism from local leaders for not doing enough.
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.200]  And that's why he responded last week with this BS.
[52:18.200 --> 52:26.200]  And then, of course, earlier, I showed you all the headlines where it is admitted that the mask do not protect you and actually spread disease.
[52:26.200 --> 52:31.200]  And that the American Journal of Medicine said you shouldn't do it just a few months ago.
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.200]  Here it is.
[52:32.200 --> 52:33.200]  JAMA.
[52:33.200 --> 52:36.200]  Mass should not be worn by healthy people to prevent respiratory infection.
[52:36.200 --> 52:42.200]  There is no evidence that wearing mask prevents healthy people from getting sick and mask can be in short supply.
[52:42.200 --> 52:44.200]  And it goes on with all the studies.
[52:44.200 --> 52:46.200]  Face mask should only be used.
[52:46.200 --> 52:50.200]  Individuals with symptoms of respiratory infections such as coughing, sneezing, and sometimes fever.
[52:50.200 --> 52:55.200]  Healthcare workers, persons taking care of those in close contact with someone with respiratory infection.
[52:55.200 --> 52:56.200]  And they go on.
[52:56.200 --> 52:58.200]  Don't get around old people if you've got it.
[52:58.200 --> 52:59.200]  What's the government do?
[52:59.200 --> 53:00.200]  Send people with it to the old people.
[53:00.200 --> 53:01.200]  I mean, come on, folks.
[53:01.200 --> 53:03.200]  They've done this out in the open.
[53:03.200 --> 53:06.200]  Cloth, mask are useless against COVID-19.
[53:06.200 --> 53:07.200]  Another big article.
[53:07.200 --> 53:10.200]  Lisa Rousseau, doctor lays it all out.
[53:10.200 --> 53:12.200]  Here's another one.
[53:12.200 --> 53:13.200]  River Cities reader.
[53:13.200 --> 53:14.200]  Mass don't work.
[53:14.200 --> 53:18.200]  A review of science relevant to COVID-19 social party.
[53:18.200 --> 53:21.200]  COVID review of science relevant to COVID-19.
[53:21.200 --> 53:26.200]  It goes all through the big studies, a whole big list of studies that it does not protect you and it's all a giant hoax.
[53:26.200 --> 53:27.200]  And the left knows that.
[53:27.200 --> 53:32.200]  That's why they're saying only white people in California and Oregon have to wear them.
[53:32.200 --> 53:41.200]  But don't worry, Joy, the Seahag Bayhar is running around trying to find out who's not wearing them so that she can confront them
[53:41.200 --> 53:47.200]  and explain that she's this big, wonderful virtue signal that we should all bow down to.
[53:47.200 --> 53:48.200]  That is quite the segment.
[53:48.200 --> 53:54.200]  We've got Carpe Duncan, who just got banned Trump's favorite meme maker because he dare criticize CNN.
[53:54.200 --> 53:55.200]  He'll be joining us.
[53:55.200 --> 53:59.200]  We have a lady fired from the local big grocery store chain because she had a medical condition.
[53:59.200 --> 54:00.200]  They said, we don't care.
[54:00.200 --> 54:01.200]  You're fired.
[54:01.200 --> 54:02.200]  She's got a major lawsuit.
[54:02.200 --> 54:04.200]  We're going to help her get a lawyer.
[54:04.200 --> 54:07.200]  And so much more, the time to push back is here.
[54:07.200 --> 54:09.200]  The time to fight back is now.
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.200]  And Larry Pinkney of the original Black Panther Party, a sensational guest.
[54:13.200 --> 54:16.200]  We've had him on for 15 years, but he's just explosive in the last interview.
[54:16.200 --> 54:19.200]  He's with us in the third hour today.
[54:19.200 --> 54:23.200]  Please tell folks to tune in to your local radio stations that are broadcasting us right now.
[54:23.200 --> 54:25.200]  And please tell folks about band.video.
[54:25.200 --> 54:30.200]  That's band.video and infowars.com forward slash show and share those links.
[54:30.200 --> 54:32.200]  The truth lives at infowars.
[54:32.200 --> 54:33.200]  Tomorrow's news today.
[54:33.200 --> 54:35.200]  The people aren't laying down here.
[54:35.200 --> 54:36.200]  We're fighting back.
[54:36.200 --> 54:40.200]  And thanks to you supporting us, we are winning the hearts and minds.
[54:40.200 --> 54:41.200]  They'll be right back.
[54:41.200 --> 55:10.200]  Stay with us.
[55:41.200 --> 56:07.200]  We'll be right back.
[56:07.200 --> 56:14.200]  We'll be right back.
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.200]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[56:42.200 --> 57:07.200]  Infowars.com.
[57:07.200 --> 57:36.200]  Well, you have to remember my grandmother was coerced into signing an X for me to become sterilized,
[57:36.200 --> 57:40.200]  but she didn't understand what sterilization or tuberculosis was.
[57:40.200 --> 57:52.200]  All she knew, I believe, is that her food supplements were being threatened to be taken away from her if she did not consent.
[57:52.200 --> 57:55.200]  It is a moment 20 years in the making.
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.200]  Dozens of indigenous Peruvian women arrive to give testimony to national prosecutors.
[58:00.200 --> 58:04.200]  The beginning is of a possible new criminal case on their behalf.
[58:04.200 --> 58:14.200]  In the 1990s, during the regime of strongman president Alberto Fujimori, they were sterilized without their consent by doctors working for the Peruvian Health Service.
[58:14.200 --> 58:18.200]  Sterilization has been among us long before most of us were even born.
[58:18.200 --> 58:28.200]  In 1936, the Nazis defended their forced sterilization program by propagandizing the United States as an ally in the eugenics movement.
[58:28.200 --> 58:35.200]  The atrocities of World War II would rapidly alter the United States collective attitude toward eugenics.
[58:35.200 --> 58:44.200]  In 1970, the tricky Dick Nixon administration overwhelmingly increased Medicaid-funded sterilization of low-income Americans.
[58:44.200 --> 58:53.200]  These sterilizations were voluntary as a matter of policy, but anecdotal evidence later revealed that they were often involuntary as a matter of practice.
[58:53.200 --> 58:58.200]  Patients were given misleading information regarding the procedures they would endure.
[58:58.200 --> 59:06.200]  And as sterilization became the norm, in 1979, according to a survey conducted by family planning perspectives,
[59:06.200 --> 59:18.200]  70% of American hospitals failed to adequately follow U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines regarding informed consent in cases of sterilization.
[59:18.200 --> 59:28.200]  It wasn't until 1981 that Oregon performed the last legal forced sterilization in U.S. history, and we would all be fools to think it ended there.
[59:28.200 --> 59:31.200]  The globalists increased their efforts worldwide.
[59:31.200 --> 59:40.200]  As the new American writes, the United Nations Population Fund is under heavy fire after an investigation by the Population Research Institute
[59:40.200 --> 59:49.200]  that showed yet again that the U.N. is working with the Communist dictatorship ruling mainland China to enforce its barbaric one-child policy,
[59:49.200 --> 59:57.200]  complete with forced abortions, involuntary sterilization, kidnapping of illegal children, and other brutal tactics.
[59:57.200 --> 1:00:06.200]  The evidence of U.N. complicity in the atrocious human rights violations is undeniable, according to PRI President Stephen Moser.
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:16.200]  By the mid-1980s, according to Chinese government statistics, birth control surgeries, abortions, sterilizations, and IUD insertions were averaging more than 30 million a year.
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:21.200]  Many, if not most of these procedures were performed on women who submitted only under duress.
[1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:24.200]  We now see child labor on the rise in China.
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:26.200]  Why do we see child labor on the rise in China?
[1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:33.200]  Because there are labor shortages now in Guangdong Province, where the one-child policy began to be enforced in the early 80s.
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:42.200]  And besides bringing in workers from other provinces under abysmal conditions, they are now bringing in children into the workforce, taking them out of schools,
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.200]  or converting schools, actually, into factories.
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:46.200]  We know what works.
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:56.200]  You know, human capital, agricultural sector, taking advantage of innovation, whether that's new seeds, new vaccines, or the digital platform.
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:05.200]  You know, it's clear if we make the right investments to help these countries, they can get virtually all their citizens out of extreme poverty.
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:16.200]  Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between the years 2000 and 2017.
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:25.200]  In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly vaccine strain,
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:28.200]  meaning it is coming from Gates' vaccine program.
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.200]  We can thank the childless buffoons currently leading the planet into their own private hell,
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:42.200]  and our own acquiescence to their lunacy for the typhoon of anger the remaining generations will unleash on all of us.
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:56.200]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:15.200]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:21.200]  I recently had a woman in the street walls with my youngest daughter, and my daughter walked close to her and she said,
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:25.200]  get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:28.200]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is mental illness.
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:32.200]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:36.200]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:40.200]  This is total and complete mind control.
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:43.200]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.200]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:47.200]  It's a U.N. Bill Gates plan.
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:50.200]  They've been proven to be criminal liars, and they must be defeated.
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.200]  They must be exposed.
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:59.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:05.200]  We have a new Jesse Smollett.
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:08.200]  He's being hailed, even though he's been caught day one as a fraud.
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:10.200]  Bubba Wallace.
[1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:14.200]  Mark Dice exposing yesterday the FBI confirmed today that this is accurate.
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:17.200]  There's video inside the NASCAR garage over a year ago,
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  and the other garages of exactly these little loops that we all have in our garages to hand to pull them down.
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.200]  Here it is.
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.200]  I can't say with 100% certainty at this point,
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:36.200]  but I would give it a 99.9% chance that the supposed news found in the NASCAR garage of Bubba Wallace
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:39.200]  was this garage pole,
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:44.200]  shown on the official NASCAR YouTube channel during one of their garage cam walkthroughs
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:48.200]  of the Talladega Super Speedway in Alabama,
[1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:55.200]  where Bubba Wallace's crew supposedly found the noose that somebody left in his garage.
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:57.200]  The moment I first heard about the noose,
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:04:01.200]  I figured it was just an extension cord coiled up and hung on the wall
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:04.200]  or an air compressor hose or a tow rope,
[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:09.200]  because of the hysteria somebody mistook it for a hate symbol.
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:14.200]  Just like somebody did at Michigan State University when the noose that they found
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:17.200]  turned out to be just a broken shoelace,
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:20.200]  or like the nooses found in an Oakland park,
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:24.200]  which just turned out to be exercise equipment,
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:30.200]  or the KKK rally that a student thought they saw through the window at Bowling Green State University,
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:35.200]  which turned out to be some lab equipment that had plastic coverings over it.
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:43.200]  I've been racing all my life.
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:48.200]  We've raced out of hundreds of garages that never had garage pools like that,
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:58.200]  so people that want to call it a garage pool and put out old videos and photos of knots being as their evidence.
[1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:03.200]  Go ahead, but from the evidence that we have and that I have,
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:05.200]  it's a straight-up noose.
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:08.200]  The FBI has stated it was a noose over and over again.
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:12.200]  NASCAR leadership has stated it was a noose.
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:17.200]  I can confirm that I actually got evidence of what was hanging in my garage,
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:21.200]  over my car, around my picker guys, to confirm that it was a noose,
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:29.200]  and never seen anything like it.
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:37.200]  Turns out they got footage from over a year ago of the same garages with the exact same pools.
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:42.200]  This is so mentally ill, it's like if I took my shoe off
[1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:47.200]  and then walked by one of our black crew members,
[1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:51.200]  our white crew members, are they going to think, are they going to see a bunny rabbit and say,
[1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:52.200]  don't step on the rabbit?
[1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:53.200]  That's another form.
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:55.200]  Oh, look, it's a little black bunny rabbit.
[1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.200]  Or are they going to see a noose?
[1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:02.200]  Because that's what's happening all over the United States, folks.
[1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:08.200]  They're not pulling down statues of abolitionists because they're old.
[1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:10.200]  This is the mass mental illness.
[1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:12.200]  This is the hysteria.
[1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:17.200]  This is what things have turned into, and anything that offends someone,
[1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:18.200]  they get rid of regardless.
[1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:26.200]  So should we ban classic shoelaces is the question.
[1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:31.200]  Now, getting very, very serious, we're going to be launching a nationwide worldwide movement
[1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:36.200]  against how they're trying to suffocate our rights and physically suffocate us with these masks
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:41.200]  that even the American Medical Journal says does not protect you from COVID-19.
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.200]  But a lot of people have anxiety issues.
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:45.200]  They have issues with oxygenation.
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:50.200]  They admit it can cause too much carbon dioxide to be in your blood.
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:55.200]  But you also have the fact that in California and Oregon, they're saying only white people have to wear it.
[1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:59.200]  We're not going to oppress black people with a symbol of smothering them.
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.200]  And I agree.
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:02.200]  This is a symbol of like a burka.
[1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:03.200]  It's very oppressive.
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:05.200]  And they say, oh, just go ahead and wear cloth.
[1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:06.200]  We don't care.
[1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:08.200]  It's just a sign that you're subservient.
[1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:15.200]  And though, again, the CDC says these cloth masks again do nothing except keep viruses alive that would have died in the open air.
[1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:19.200]  So the mask becomes like a sponge that they live in.
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:27.200]  Well, Bonnie Tudlip has actually worked on the campaign of the governor of Texas who I've liked in many areas.
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:37.200]  But now that he's become a repeater or a minion of the UN and, of course, other organizations like the California governor.
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:43.200]  Now that he's done that, I have to say I'm very, very upset under, quote, pressure by cities in Texas to let everything lock down.
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:49.200]  There he is just a week ago with the family of George Floyd, not wearing his mask.
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:52.200]  And you see people everywhere wearing the mask that are down under their nose.
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:59.200]  It's all a symbol of subservience ahead of the force vaccines, ahead of the contact tracers that Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Foundation run.
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:04.200]  I'm going to show you mainstream news articles where they say they're in charge of it.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:07.200]  And then separate articles saying I'm making it up. They're not in charge of it.
[1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:13.200]  They go, well, it's not Clinton. It's a foundation. It's not Bill Gates. It's a foundation. They play these games.
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:17.200]  So who died and made these guys our gods? Well, they did.
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  And our subservience makes them that.
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:25.200]  So Bonnie works as an overnight stalker at H.E.B. and I've met her before out of Second Amendment rallies.
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:30.200]  And they fired her last week for speaking up.
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:36.200]  So now it's physically a gag ball, not just a covering of, I guess, surreal law.
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:41.200]  So Bonnie, thanks for your, thanks for your courage. Fauci says we're not supposed to shake hands.
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:44.200]  It's a pleasure to shake your hand again. Good to see you again.
[1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:46.200]  And I'm glad you reached out to us through Facebook.
[1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:48.200]  Pellis, what happened to your thought criminal?
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:56.200]  Okay, so I do overnight stalking at H.E.B., which is a very physically intense job at H.E.B.
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:09.200]  I, along with numerous employees across all of H.E.B. stores, went online to the H.E.B. platform that's strictly for employees to speak about this mask issue.
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:14.200]  I spoke out very abruptly, very passionately.
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:16.200]  I have asthma.
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:26.200]  Wearing a mask when I have asthma is literally suffocating me. I have dizzy spells. I struggle to pull pellets.
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:30.200]  A lot of these pellets weighing 50 or more pounds, or a lot more than that.
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:34.200]  Oh, and that's the exemptions too. If you're having to do exertion, of course you can't wear a mask.
[1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:45.200]  Yeah, exactly. Unfortunately, with H.E.B. and most businesses right now, they're not looking at, oh, this person is working an intense job.
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:48.200]  They're just virtue-sittling and run by the law firms.
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:54.200]  Yeah, they're just putting it out there. Everybody mandatory has to do it. If you don't do it, you get written up.
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:59.200]  What's crazy is I actually, as I have crew members, I went and looked at the law. If anyone even has anxiety, you don't have to.
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:07.200]  And again, I'm not trying to be a tough guy here, but I've never had anxiety. When I've tried to wear a mask, I start having an anxiety attack, and I can't breathe in them.
[1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:09.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:22.200]  A lot of my associates have PTSD. They're veterans. They have PTSD. I have PTSD from a car crash. I survived having something over my mouth when I suffer with claustrophobia.
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:27.200]  I have severe anxiety to the point where I have to take myself off the floor.
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:40.200]  Well, that's it. I don't want to get into personal stuff and talk about weaknesses, but I was in, like, eight, nine years ago. It's even in a Vanity Fair article. They were there covering me when I did it.
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:48.200]  And it was this big Ozarks Museum outside of, I guess it was Hot Springs. And it's like, oh, you go into it. It's like underneath the mountains. It was these little tubes for kids.
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:59.200]  Well, I weigh 250 pounds. I get in there, literally can't get out. And I have to totally control myself to finally find a way out of there. And I had claustrophobia after it happened.
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:09.200]  And so now I've noticed I didn't used to have close space issues. Now I have close space issues. And now that I wear a mask, I'll just say it on air. I mean, it literally starts making me have an anxiety attack.
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.200]  Yeah, that's been the same thing.
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:27.200]  Yeah, that's the exact same experience for myself, other employees. And I simply spoke out because I'm fed up. I'm fed up of someone else forcing these ridiculous mandates on me without knowing who I am personally without knowing what I struggle with medically.
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:33.200]  And I'm supposed to do just because we have to save a few. It should be a choice, not something that's forced on us.
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:44.200]  But again, even the state exemptions say if you're doing outdoor work, or you're doing heavy things, or you need to do it for your job, or you have anxiety, or you have a preexisting medical condition.
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:58.200]  Exactly. Our Greg Caesar with Austin City Council came up with specific exceptions to the order. And one of them specifically states wearing a mask poses a safety or health risk. You're not required to wear a mask.
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:05.200]  Can I show TV viewers that please? And again, this is from the City Council. And again, they know they have to leave these loopholes because they know there's lots of people can't do this.
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:06.200]  Exactly.
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:16.200]  And I'm not trying. Everybody knows I like to be tough. I just got to be honest. I even got fancy expensive masks that have the breather on them. I can wear a gas mask. It's like a $500. That's not a problem. But these masks just don't work.
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:18.200]  Exactly. Yeah.
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:30.200]  And that's the frustrating thing that a lot of these businesses say with ATB, they're not looking at the entire laws that's been written where it says wearing a mask poses a safety or health risk.
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:35.200]  So when I speak up or another employee speaks up about it, it's like, no, everybody's wearing a mask.
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:43.200]  Well, we're not litigious. And we might be able to get you a job in our warehouse if you wanted as a stalker. But I think we really should sue ATB.
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:51.200]  I don't shop there anymore, by the way. They're so rude when you go in, they try to make my three-year-old daughter wear a mask, and my wife almost got in a fist fight with them. We'll be right back.
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:26.200]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:32.200]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:36.200]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:45.200]  So this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out. It smells great.
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:49.200]  It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:14:05.200]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:19.200]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and then going down the drain.
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.200]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:29.200]  But God is the master of the universe but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:36.200]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:40.200]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:47.200]  Everything hinges on you. Everything. Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:15:02.200]  God bless and good luck.
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:21.200]  The answer to tyranny is the people.
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:27.200]  All right, Bonnie Cudlip is here with us. She's an activist I've met her before, second of an activist, worked at H.E.B. for years.
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:29.200]  That fired last week as an overnight stalker.
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:35.200]  For just explaining to people, I can't wear a mask and pull these big pallets around and out of the back of the warehouse.
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:38.200]  And we're exempt from it. She has the city exemption, the state exemption.
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:41.200]  I just showed those to you last hour. I'll show them to you again.
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:46.200]  We're posting them with informational videos right now to WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:51.200]  I'll be out there this Sunday, but she just showed me more horrible news about Governor Abbott.
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:57.200]  And listen, the governor is a listener of the show. The governor's office is going to be a lot of good intel.
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:09.200]  I think the governor overall is a good guy, but he's giving into this medical tyranny and letting California and letting the CDC and letting the U.N. be the directors of how we operate.
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:17.200]  He needs to attack the fraud that the COVID deaths are 25 times less than what they said, and that most of those are people that had other diseases.
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:25.200]  It's enough of the hoax, my God. Now the EU is blaming America and saying we're going to be banned from Europe. This is ridiculous.
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:35.200]  So, Bonnie, you've got other articles here with the contact tracing deal, and all these different globalist companies are involved in this, and Abbott's going along with this crap.
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:41.200]  Yeah, so I'm a huge fan of Abbott's. Everybody knows he follows me personally on social media.
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:48.200]  This is not a bash on Abbott, but we voted for him to do the right thing. And when I saw this, I was appalled.
[1:16:48.200 --> 1:17:02.200]  He awarded $295 million to a company called the MTX Group that will be in charge of contact tracing here in the state of Texas.
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:06.200]  And when you research them, they're tied all into the globalist.
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:16.200]  Well, when I research MTX and you can Google this yourself, go to their website. One of their biggest sponsors is Google.
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:21.200]  And I don't know if people are aware of what Google was trying to do in China recently, helping the Chinese...
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:31.200]  Social credit score and tracking them. Google and Apple have merged their operating system to have a program on your phone that doesn't show up,
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:36.200]  unless you opt in. But as of two months ago, all the phones are being tracked whether you like it or not.
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:37.200]  Yeah.
[1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:40.200]  And they put it in one merge system. They made the announcement. It's totally illegal.
[1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:46.200]  And then I have Bill Clinton admitting he's the one with his foundation running that program.
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:50.200]  And then when we talk about this, oh, Bill Clinton's not involved. Bill Gates isn't involved.
[1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:55.200]  I have the videos of them on TV saying it. Please continue.
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:18:03.200]  Yeah. So he awarded $295 million to this company, along with Google, that is going to continue with the contact tracing.
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:08.200]  I don't know if people have looked at their phones, their iPhones, especially in the updates.
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:11.200]  It specifically said contact tracing for COVID purposes.
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:17.200]  That's right. It's on all your phones. And now any three digit number put into Google, your search and a phone number gives you COVID free form.
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.200]  Oh, yeah. Exactly.
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:25.200]  This is how Google and Apple get their social credit score. This is how they start tracking you.
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:30.200]  They've already been doing it. It's their excuse to introduce you to the fact that, yes, we run your life.
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:34.200]  We decide where you can go and what you can do. This is it. This is the big enchilada.
[1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:35.200]  Yeah.
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:40.200]  And Abbott has taken the Mark of the Beast hook line and sinker. Very shameful of Governor Abbott.
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:48.200]  And the bad thing about this contact tracing, which most people aren't aware of, is you can come into another individual who may have the same app on their phone
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:53.200]  and you're basically releasing your information to that individual. That's how simple it is.
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:57.200]  Oh, it's an absolute total nightmare. We can't breathe. News. You're going to join us this Sunday out there?
[1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:59.200]  Yes, of course.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:05.200]  That's at noon on the south side of the Capitol. We're going to march up the steps of the Capitol and we're going to go over to the governor's mansion.
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:10.200]  I never thought I'd be protesting the governor, but this is this is I'm more mad at Abbott because I like Abbott.
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:11.200]  This really pisses me off.
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:12.200]  Exactly. Exactly.
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:20.200]  And I spoke out because I moved here all the way from California to work his campaign because I was so passionate about what he stood for.
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:23.200]  And now he's basically under psycho Newsome's control.
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:31.200]  Exactly. He I come from California. I was raised in California. I know all the laws in California.
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:33.200]  I know every single thing that's going on there right now.
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:43.200]  And to have got governor Abbott basically on the exact same path as governor Newsome. It scares me. And how does it? How does it not scare anybody else?
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:49.200]  I moved here gave up my life in California to come here because I believed in him and I believed in everything he stood for.
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:56.200]  And now I feel like he's slapping us in the face because he's what trying to please certain groups of people.
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:02.200]  Well, all these mayors put him under pressure saying every death is your fault. If you don't do it, it's how they hold us hostage.
[1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:06.200]  But he's got to go on the offense and say really a lot of those deaths are people that had something else.
[1:20:06.200 --> 1:20:12.200]  And he's got to go on the offense just like Trump has to go on the offense. You can't just neutral play games.
[1:20:12.200 --> 1:20:18.200]  In fact, speaking of California, here's the guidance for use of face coverings says for any psychological asthma, any reason don't have to.
[1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:19.200]  Yeah.
[1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:26.200]  There's California and Texas has this too. But again, these companies are so ignorant that you've got a major lawsuit against ACP.
[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:28.200]  I know you don't want to sue them, but you got to sue them.
[1:20:28.200 --> 1:20:36.200]  They're not people aren't doing their research. Employees aren't doing their research. And I am a firm believer in I research before I believe anything that's been told to me.
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:44.200]  You know, and as far as our governor goes, we voted for him to be, you know, outspoken, you know, he's supposed to fight for us.
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:50.200]  These mayors, he's the governor. You know, he should be fighting back against us. This is ridiculous.
[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:53.200]  He needs to lead in the same way Trump's leading right now.
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:58.200]  Well, instead, he's just saying the counties and cities all blew now that the big cities can gang rape you.
[1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:02.200]  And that's what they're saying. It's totally absolutely disgusting.
[1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:10.200]  I could show the listeners this. I mean, this is USA Today, all of it. Oh, that the Clinton Foundation, their heroes, they're running the contact tracing.
[1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:16.200]  They're going to control everybody. They're going to be in charge of it. Oh, thank God, the Clintons are doing this.
[1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:24.200]  I mean, here it is. Apple and Google released coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps. Put it on your phone whether you like it or not. USA Today.
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:34.200]  Who runs it? George Soros, Billa Melinda Gates and Chelsea Clinton on the board. This is mainstream news.
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:38.200]  I mean, my God, you can't get these people out of our lives.
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:48.200]  Yeah. And now with, you know, the mayor invoking all of this onto local businesses, these businesses are going to be fine if they're not pushing the masks on people.
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:58.200]  And I think that that is extremely harmful. A lot of these businesses already suffered enough with closures now because the city doesn't want to be responsible for a lawsuit.
[1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:02.200]  It's like, oh, let's push on to creating hysteric neurotic neuroses.
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:11.200]  And now like 40% of women are on psychotropic 20% of men, they're literally running a giant mind screw on us. And now they're telling citizens, help us about your neighbors.
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:17.200]  If they're not wearing masks, whatever, you know, we need you to call on them. So this is just the total real police state rollout.
[1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:23.200]  The police state is citizens spying on each other and unconstitutional garbage. The police state isn't police.
[1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:28.200]  Yeah, police state is not having a bill of rights checks and balances. And this is what the left's giving us.
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:33.200]  Yeah, exactly. And if you talk to law enforcement, a lot of them aren't pushing it because they know what our rights are.
[1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:42.200]  Well, it's absolute crap. The studies show it doesn't protect you and COVID-19 is a hoax. We've got to, and my hoax is, yeah, it's a real virus, like a regular cold, basically.
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:50.200]  Yeah, exactly. And how long is this going to last? They're saying that we're supposed to be wearing these masks until the vaccine comes about. How long is that going to be?
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:54.200]  And who is going to take these vaccines? This is just ridiculous.
[1:22:54.200 --> 1:23:01.200]  Well, that's it. Wearing the mask, that's the key, is the symbol of your slavery, your burqa you're wearing, just like women wearing burqas in the Middle East.
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:10.200]  And it's a symbol you're going to submit, and they admit that. This is a symbol that you will submit to the vaccine and the contact tracers that will come to your house and the app on your phone, whether you like it or not.
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:13.200]  They're just doing it. This is the takeover.
[1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:18.200]  Exactly. And like my grandfather told me growing up, if you don't stand for something, you're going to fall for anything.
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:25.200]  Bonnie Cudlip, you are at Instagram at patrioticgirlnextdoor at patrioticgirlnextdoor.
[1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:34.200]  And you're going to be out there this Sunday, high noon, Texas capitol, south side with us for the wecan'tbreath.news first protest going nationwide.
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:40.200]  And wecan'tbreath.news, ladies and gentlemen, is just full of videos, documents, articles, and printouts with your rights.
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:44.200]  You can hand these bureaucrats and put them on notice of their criminal activity.
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:48.200]  We'll be right back with Carpe Dontham. Stay with us.
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:20.200]  Now, all over the world, people are taking means trying to overthrow police and put leftists in control.
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:24.200]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:27.200]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer?
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:30.200]  Leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people.
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:35.200]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:42.200]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:44.200]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:25:10.200]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:14.200]  We can't stop it. Even if Big Tech censors us, we still have Band-Aught Video.
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:21.200]  We still have the key website, wecan'tbreath.news, where the science and the real facts are posted.
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:26.200]  The Fauci and the UN hope nobody gets to see, but they can't stop you.
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:28.200]  So share those links, too.
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:30.200]  Wecan'tbreath.news and Band-Aught Video.
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:35.200]  And join me this Sunday, the 28th, in downtown Austin at the south side of the Capitol.
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:38.200]  We're going to protest this and then march to the nearby governor's mansion.
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:44.200]  Don't lay down in this tyranny. Take action and say no to the COVID-19 lockdown martial law.
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.200]  We're breaking it all down. Have the facts posted at wecan'tbreath.news.

[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:33.200]  and support healthy nerve and brain cells.

[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:59.200]  Get Ultra 12 today to support the InfoWars store and experience true B12 power.
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:12.200]  Well, we're about to go to Carpe Donkton, the number one meme maker in the world.
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:14.200]  Trump has tweeted dozens of his tweets.
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:17.200]  They've gotten hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of views,
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:22.200]  and he put out that latest one about CNN and how they would edit The White Baby to be racist.
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:28.200]  It was obviously a joke. They said he put out fake news, copyright violation, and he was banned.
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:33.200]  But Bonnie Kudlip, who I've met before out of Second Amendment rallies,
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:37.200]  I saw her when she was behind a desk in there, and then I went out during a break.
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:42.200]  She came in and was sitting down, telling her story about being fired from a major grocery store chain here in Texas.
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:46.200]  H.E.B. for being an overnight stalker and saying, I don't want to wear a mask.
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:48.200]  I'm exempt from it. I have asthma.
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:51.200]  Then she starts getting up. She has crutches under the desk.
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:56.200]  She's like, oh yeah, I broke my foot pulling the pallets. That's another reason they fired me.
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:27:58.200]  And H.E.B. is known for no workers comp.
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:02.200]  It's as close to slave labor as you can get. Terrible company. Terrible people.
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:06.200]  People that own it, family knew them way back at Baylor. Just horrible scum of the earth.
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:09.200]  But that's a side issue. Now you've worked inside there.
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:16.200]  You recap the story and the parts that you didn't tell folks about your foot getting broken dragging around this mask.
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:21.200]  Okay, so overnight stalking, we bring out massive, heavy pallets.
[1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:25.200]  And I was just pulling on one of the pallets during our nine o'clock shift.
[1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  Customers are in there trying to get access to groceries.
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:32.200]  And first of all, our pallets are all broken so the wheels don't move properly.
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:36.200]  So you have to pull and tug or someone has to push on them unnecessarily.
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:44.200]  And I was wearing a mask that night and I was struggling to pull on this pallet.
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:49.200]  And one of my associates comes behind the pallet to push it to kind of help me along with it.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.200]  And the pallet ran over my foot.
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:29:01.200]  You're like a slave building the pyramids in the Ten Commandments and then they start crushing you under and the H.E.B. doesn't care.
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:08.200]  I honestly felt like that because once I reported it to my direct supervisor, all he did was put some frozen peas on it.
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:11.200]  We waited an hour and he put me back out on the floor to work.
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:13.200]  And now you've gone to the dodger, you got a broken foot.
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:18.200]  So my accident wasn't reported, apparently I found out.
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:23.200]  And I was still working on it for a full week, a broken foot for a full week.
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:30.200]  And then when I finally was able to see a doctor because another employee came to me and said, hey, you got to go see a doctor and H.E.B. has to take care of it.
[1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:37.200]  The doctor said, you have a broken foot and you've been working on it for a week doing your regular job duties.
[1:29:37.200 --> 1:29:38.200]  Yeah.
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:40.200]  And then H.E.B. fired you.
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:45.200]  And a week after that is when I started talking about the mask issue and I was fired from that.
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:48.200]  All right. Well, I can tell you, they're a terrible company, terrible people.
[1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:49.200]  I know all about them.
[1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:55.200]  And I remember growing up, my grandmother talking about, you know, Rusty Butts is the name of the guy that found with a real piece of trash.
[1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:57.200]  All right. Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:00.200]  We'll see you at the rally Sunday of a We Can't Breathe dot news.
[1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:01.200]  Thank you so much for coming in.
[1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:02.200]  Thank you. Thank you for having me.
[1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:03.200]  Thank you.
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:05.200]  All right.
[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:17.200]  Just last week, Carpe Donkton and I were playing phone tag about him going ahead and getting a site on Bandot video because of all the censorship and then wallop big national news story breaking yesterday.
[1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:21.200]  Carpe Donkton banned for the video.
[1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:22.200]  We're about to play.
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:26.200]  Now, for radio listeners, you've got to go to Bandot video to see it on the streams.
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:27.200]  You can't see it on Twitter.
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:28.200]  It's been banned.
[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:31.200]  But most of you probably already saw it.
[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:36.200]  Carpe Donkton, Trump's favorite meme maker, probably one of the top memers in the world, if not the top.
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:38.200]  He's certainly amongst the top two or three.
[1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:44.200]  And so now he's a thought criminal CNN said he first tried to deceive people, even though it's purely satire.
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:45.200]  Anybody can tell that.
[1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:51.200]  And they said it was a copyright violation, even though it's completely protected because it's transformative speech.
[1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:53.200]  It's clearly fair use.
[1:30:53.200 --> 1:31:17.200]  But here is the thought crime.
[1:31:17.200 --> 1:31:30.200]  I do burn suddenly appear every time you are near just like me.
[1:31:30.200 --> 1:31:36.200]  They love to be close to you.
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:52.200]  Why do stars fall down from the sky every time you walk by just like me?
[1:31:52.200 --> 1:31:53.200]  So America's not the problem.
[1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:55.200]  Fake news is the problem.
[1:31:55.200 --> 1:31:56.200]  And it's a funny joke.
[1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:58.200]  I'll see it and turns everything into racism.
[1:31:58.200 --> 1:32:00.200]  They're using the fake NASCAR news.
[1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:03.200]  They're still saying it's really the FBI says it's totally false.
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:04.200]  They went back years ago.
[1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:06.200]  They show the same things hanging there in videos.
[1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:10.200]  Carpe Donkton, a real badge of honor now that you're getting banned everywhere.
[1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:15.200]  And I'm told that the president is fully aware of this and really upset right now.
[1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:19.200]  Thank you for joining us from memeworld.com and now band.video.
[1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:22.200]  And for a while, I guess you're shown on YouTube Carpe Donkton.
[1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:24.200]  Hey, how are you doing, man?
[1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:30.200]  It's always fun to talk to you right in the middle of a firestorm, isn't it?
[1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:31.200]  Absolutely.
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:36.200]  So tell us what's happened behind the scenes, what led up to this, this great meme, how
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:37.200]  you had the idea.
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:40.200]  Well, now you're banned for thought crime.
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:43.200]  Well, you know, it's actually an old one.
[1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:47.200]  It seems like the old ones get me into more trouble than the new ones.
[1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:51.200]  It was from last September.
[1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:54.200]  It just suddenly showed up again.
[1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:58.200]  I do a lot of stuff and it's not necessarily totally relevant at the time.
[1:32:58.200 --> 1:33:02.200]  And then it seems like nine months later than we have a major meltdown.
[1:33:02.200 --> 1:33:03.200]  That's right.
[1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:04.200]  You're always ahead of your time.
[1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:08.200]  So it had a few million views, but now that it had 20 million or 10 million, whatever
[1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:10.200]  it is, that's when they got pissed.
[1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:11.200]  Yeah, no.
[1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:15.560]  CNN just absolutely threw a fit.
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:20.200]  I don't think they've thrown that big of a fit since the Time Magazine one.
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:23.200]  So they absolutely lost their minds.
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:31.200]  You know, I started getting messages on Saturday about Don Lemon bringing the parents on,
[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:34.200]  and they were all upset about it.
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:42.200]  I mean, surprise, surprise, the point of the video is to show how CNN only shows the first
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:46.200]  part of a video or the last part of the video and cuts out all the context.
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:51.200]  And of course they cut out the end part, which has the actual message.
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:55.200]  They show the front part and they're like, oh my God, this is so bad.
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:58.200]  So they did exactly what you said they do.
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:33:59.200]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:05.200]  Yeah, their coverage of this story has been exactly what the meme was trying to show.
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:09.200]  So, you know, irony of ironies.
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:11.200]  It's incredible because I saw the CNN piece.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:12.200]  In fact, I should have sent it to the crew.
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:14.200]  He could pull it up, guys, pull it up.
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:16.200]  What was the headline like?
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:20.200]  MemeMaker puts out fake CNN video, fake news.
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:22.200]  And obviously it's satire.
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:24.200]  It's a joke about what they do.
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:26.200]  That's why they hate it because it is true.
[1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:29.200]  Everybody knows it's a joke, but it points out what frauds they are.
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:35.200]  Well, you know what's so funny is that the main reason that they're so upset by this
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:39.200]  is that people actually thought it was a real CNN clip.
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:45.200]  That's how bad their reputation is, is that they thought their viewers would be confused
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:50.200]  that it's a different font and, you know, it doesn't even look like a real CNN broadcast.
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:56.200]  But their viewers would think that that was actually how they portrayed the video.
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:35:02.200]  And, I mean, that just proves the point of the whole meme that they freaked out about.
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:05.200]  Well, there you are, Twitter permanently suspends account.
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:08.200]  You, you are evil, but they claim copyright, right?
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:10.200]  Not fake news.
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:15.200]  Yeah, so what they're doing is, and this is something that I pointed out, you know,
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:20.200]  two, maybe three years ago, that copyright was going to be the new frontier for censorship.
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:25.200]  It's just such an easy way for them to come after your account.
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:35.200]  I mean, every time that I get a DMCA takedown, which was, you know, once a week, twice a week,
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:41.200]  it's for something that is clearly a meme, it's clearly satire or parody.
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:48.200]  It's transformative, it's protected, it's obvious, it's a fraudulent claim.
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:56.200]  It is. And what they bank on and the way that they operate is that if you want to contest it,
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:03.200]  you have to open yourself up to several different liabilities, one being you have to send in all your information,
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:06.200]  your private information, your address, your phone.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:11.200]  Which they then dock, CNN is famous for doxing people and working with Big Tech to dox you.
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:14.200]  But you also have to send it to a, you have to send it to a third party,
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:17.200]  a party that you don't know, it could be some, some dude in Switzerland.
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:22.200]  Like, why am I going to send my, my private address to some random person?
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:24.200]  Because anyone can do these claims.
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:30.200]  It just, just takes time and you just file the right paperwork and Twitter will make you send stuff over.
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:34.200]  Interpretives and patriots and nationalists and real liberals, we don't complain, we don't harass,
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:37.200]  we don't file reports until now.
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:40.200]  Let's talk about how we strike back with Carpe Dong,
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:44.200]  where people can now find his work on the other side of this quick break.
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:48.200]  Please stay with us. Remember, your voice is king.
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:54.200]  We're already to the latter part of June and of course most of the country is not completely reopened again
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:37:01.200]  and already foushee and the UN billable indicates criminal combiner telling us don't go to Trump rallies.
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:07.200]  Oh no, but the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:14.200]  to the Democrat Party, Black Lives Matter, all white people are evil, mind control, brainwashing events.
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:18.200]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:23.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:28.200]  because we are going into hardcore United Nations controlled bondage.
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:32.200]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:38.200]  they're going under UN control and turning their quote police into community activist organizers.
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:42.200]  This is just the beginning. Everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:54.200]  So it's here. No more games. The new world order has arrived.
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:18.200]  We're covering up for the NIH and the UN. They're actually sending people with communicable diseases to nursing homes
[1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:22.200]  during COVID-19 to actually jack up numbers and kill people.
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:29.200]  We're breaking it all down. Have the facts posted and we can't breathe.News, the evidence, the nurses, the doctors, the scientists,
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:34.200]  the virologists exposing the COVID-19 is a tyranny, is a hoax and is a lie.
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:39.200]  Only the truth can set us free from this great lie and the truth is posted right now
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:43.200]  and needs you to take action by spreading it at WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:39:09.200]  For more information, go to WeCan'tBreathe.News today.
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:20.200]  We're going to take action by spreading it at WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:48.200]  We're breaking it all down.
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:53.200]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:54.200]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:02.200]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:03.200]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:21.200]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:27.200]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:35.200]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:40.200]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:47.200]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me.
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:51.200]  Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:58.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:15.200]  The forced inoculations are being prepared. The contact tracing run by Bill Gates and Bill Clinton is public.
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:21.200]  And they are training you not to wear your mask. You can't go outdoors, so you do what they say. This is their takeover.
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:23.200]  Whole things a giant hoax.
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:31.200]  All right, Carpe Dongtum, one of the top meme makers in the world, is our guest, and he has been put into the Phantom Zone, now banned off of Twitter,
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:38.200]  because CNN complained, because the president tweeted what he had to say. So more and more, they just banned whatever Trump tweets.
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:43.200]  Or if Trump makes a statement, they block his tweet.
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:48.200]  Finally, Congress realized this is what's happening.
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:54.200]  Here's the headline, as they listen to media executives that explain that big tech is secretly seizing all the power.
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:42:00.200]  They're not secretly doing it. They're doing it out in the open. They're bigger than the government. They're bigger than the NSA.
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:03.200]  If the NSA did this, they'd all be in prison.
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:12.200]  It's outrageous how the new royalty of Silicon Valley, how they help the Chinese with people in death camps, how they surveil everyone and how they just do whatever they want.
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.200]  It's disgusting.
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:17.200]  Yeah, I mean, they're out of control right now.
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:22.200]  I mean, they've been moving towards this out of control thing for a while.
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:33.200]  But I think that they've seen that the 2020 election is going to decide what the next four years looks like as far as tech.
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:35.200]  And they don't like what they see.
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:42.200]  You know, when Trump is reelected, he will have that gloves off mentality of, I mean, what are you going to do?
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:45.200]  Are you just going to impeach me again?
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:54.200]  And I think they're scared to death of that type of power and that type of attitude.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.200]  Well, they have nothing to lose because they've never been punished.
[1:42:57.200 --> 1:42:59.200]  Now, let's talk about memeworld.com.
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:02.200]  You started that a year ago or so as a place, as a backup.
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:05.200]  A lot of the great contributors you've got hadn't been totally banned.
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:08.200]  But now we were talking this morning, now's the time to really promote memeworld.
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:10.200]  You were also wanting to get a channel.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:14.200]  I don't know if the crew contacted you to, you know, get you the...
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:17.200]  Yeah, they're free for banned.video.
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:23.200]  So you can start cloning all your information there while you're still on YouTube for now so that you're millions of fans and the president.
[1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:28.200]  Because if President Trump starts promoting parlor, it'll go from up and coming to number one.
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:32.200]  If he starts promoting banned.video or launches his own damn free service.
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:39.200]  All I want is a place where we can see Trump ads or info wars, info or carpe donkem stuff.
[1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:44.200]  Right. Well, I think that's what everyone wants is a place to do that.
[1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:48.200]  And so memeworld is...
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:53.200]  It's a place where I've collected, you know, some of the best meme people in the world,
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:57.200]  which they probably won't be on social media in the next couple of months.
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:04.200]  I mean, if they... I think that's something that this banning of me has exposed is if they can ban me,
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:10.200]  one of the most vanilla plays by the rule guys, they can ban anybody on Twitter.
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:15.200]  I mean, anybody can be gone tomorrow just for saying the wrong thing or posting the wrong thing.
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:22.200]  And memeworld is just a place where, you know, you can put up all of that stuff that gets taken down.
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:26.200]  Well, here's how it works. Anything good, anything viral gets banned.
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.200]  If you want to be mediocre and no one looks at you, you'll be fine because they're not looking at you.
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:32.200]  If you're successful, you'll be banned.
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:36.200]  And so they've already banned 80% of people. Everybody keeps hanging on.
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:42.200]  I'm telling folks, before they did that, we had to go build things and make it all about our new platforms.
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:46.200]  Because, I mean, Band-Aught Video routinely has videos that get over a million views.
[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:52.200]  And so the only point I'm making is, if everybody else had gotten on the bandwagon to promote that, it'd be a hundred times bigger.
[1:44:52.200 --> 1:45:00.200]  Right. And I think there's two sides to this coin because we need to be building infrastructure like you're doing.
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:02.200]  And I really appreciate that you are doing that.
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:12.200]  And at the same time, we have to fight on those other platforms to make sure that our voices...
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:16.200]  What Twitter wants is for us to all leave.
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:20.200]  Because then they have a monopoly on it and they can just do that.
[1:45:20.200 --> 1:45:24.200]  I agree. Everyone should keep creating sub-accounts on Twitter, Facebook,
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:28.200]  and then bombing them with content from Mean World and Band-Aught Video.
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.200]  Right. And I think that's something that should be done.
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:36.200]  Because all of these platforms are important.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:42.200]  And I think that fighting in all of the space is possible is the only way that we can really get the message out.
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:46.200]  And I'm really glad that you guys are doing Band-Aught Video.
[1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:52.200]  And you know, you've got places like Bitshoot and places like Parler and Cloud Hub.
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:54.200]  All those things like...
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:46:00.200]  And how big would it be if Trump started promoting Cloud Hub and Mean World and Parler and Band-Aught Video?
[1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:02.200]  I mean, why does he start doing that now?
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:09.200]  Well, you know, I think Parler and Cloud Hub are two ones that he could really easily do that.
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:11.200]  They both have a lot of features.
[1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:18.200]  Like, I'm currently live streaming my show weekly out to Cloud Hub.
[1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:22.200]  It's also going out to YouTube, Facebook, all that stuff.
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:26.200]  But diversifying is important.
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:28.200]  And you know, there's Gab out there too.
[1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:32.200]  I know Gab gets a lot of complaints from the media.
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:34.200]  Oh, they're wonderful. Exactly.
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:36.200]  I shouldn't have forgotten about Gab.
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:39.200]  Exactly. We should all stay on Twitter, Facebook, keep hitting them,
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:43.200]  but hit them everywhere else at Gab, at Mean World.
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:45.200]  This is a war, folks. They're trying to suppress you.
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:48.200]  I know our audience knows that, but to the new listeners,
[1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:52.200]  tell folks about the local AM and FM station to promote that local station.
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:54.200]  Tell them about your local Twitter.
[1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:56.200]  Every little bit we do is so important.
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:46:58.200]  Yeah, it is.
[1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:07.200]  And going back to the copyright stuff, that is something that we can do.
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:12.200]  I'm not going to ever ask anybody to do anything fraudulent,
[1:47:12.200 --> 1:47:19.200]  but if someone is using your content, like a CNN or something like that,
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:21.200]  they're using your content, go report it.
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:26.200]  And make sure that they're getting hit with the same crap that we're getting hit with.
[1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:32.200]  This is the example I use every single time, because it's so ridiculous.
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:39.200]  Two years ago, I made a video. It was a parody of a Super Bowl commercial
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:45.200]  in which the song All Apologies by Nirvana was played on a xylophone,
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:49.200]  and somebody came after me for the rights of that thing
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:51.200]  and had it taken down off of Twitter.
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.200]  Somebody just playing the tune on a xylophone was claimed,
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:58.200]  and then I would have to send my information, again, to some random person.
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:00.200]  I have no idea who they are.
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:02.200]  And that's the game that's being played.
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:05.200]  Well, that's what Matt Drudge said here in studio four years ago, five years ago.
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:08.200]  He said, I've met with Supreme Court Justice. I've seen the evidence.
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:12.200]  They're going to use copyright to ban free speech, and the EU's already done it.
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:15.200]  And so we're just totally giving up on our free society.
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:19.200]  And I got to tell you, Trump's done a terrible job standing up against this and fighting it.
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:23.200]  He says he's going to take big, bold action and not just monitor the situation.
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:27.200]  Okay, well, with 130 days left, we're waiting.
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:32.200]  Well, and, you know, I think we really have to hold Congress responsible as well,
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.200]  because, I mean, they've got subpoena power.
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:38.200]  They could be subpoena, bring in these tech people.
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:42.200]  They talk to them, expose what they're doing.
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:44.200]  But, you know, a lot of them are in bed with them.
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:46.200]  So they don't really want to get into this.
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:48.200]  Yeah, that's the problem is these companies are God,
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:51.200]  and they're not even liberals. They're authoritarian tyrants,
[1:48:51.200 --> 1:48:54.200]  and we the people put up with this crap.
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:58.200]  I mean, folks shouldn't just falls on us eventually.
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:02.200]  You know, I mean, it all it all ends up falling on who are we electing locally?
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:06.200]  Who are we electing statewide? Who are you heard from Trump yet?
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:11.200]  Because I know people that talk to Trump, you know, he's really pissed about about this.
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:14.200]  I haven't heard from him, him specifically yet.
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:18.200]  But I mean, I know that the White House is is pretty inflamed about it.
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:22.200]  I'm getting I'm getting messages from all over the place of, you know,
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:25.200]  there's a lot of people that are really, really mad about this.
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.200]  This and the stuff that was happening at Facebook with with James O'Keefe.
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:31.200]  So that's what it's all about.
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:34.200]  And you know, that's the thing is these are obviously jokes.
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:36.200]  A three year old knows that.
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:41.200]  So the claim of he's putting out fake news is just outrageous.
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:44.200]  Well, you know, so I fun story for me.
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:48.200]  I play adult kickball, which is which is a fun time on Sundays.
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:53.200]  But, you know, I was talking to some people that know what I do outside of,
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:55.200]  you know, my normal life here.
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:58.200]  And these are not conservative people.
[1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:00.200]  And they're like, I thought it was funny.
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:01.200]  I don't know.
[1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:04.200]  I don't know what you guys were what these people are talking about.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:06.200]  But I thought the thing was hilarious.
[1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:12.200]  So, I mean, the normal people that are not, you know, 24 seven Twitter people
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:18.200]  or 24 seven politics people have a completely different view of all this stuff.
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:23.200]  And I think a lot of normal people, you know, the normies are are seeing
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:29.200]  all of these things and just wondering what in the world is going on in this country.
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:33.200]  Well, be sure and join us for the next few days as this unfolds.
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:36.200]  But people can find you for now at YouTube at carpe.com.
[1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:38.200]  They can find you at memeworld.com.
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:40.200]  And now you're going to start the new channel.
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:43.200]  You already have a meme world on Band-Aid video, but please start your car.
[1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:48.200]  Carpe don't anybody wants a channel out there that is a known quantity.
[1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:50.200]  You know, obviously he put random people on they'll get a suit,
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:53.200]  but we're going to have the form on there where it's like, you know, third party,
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:55.200]  just like the section 230.
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:50:57.200]  But we built it for everybody.
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:50:58.200]  It's gotten so much traffic.
[1:50:58.200 --> 1:50:59.200]  We've had to update it.
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:01.200]  We've had some pickups at Band-Aid video in the live streams,
[1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:05.200]  but the the archived clips have not had any problems.
[1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:06.200]  Thank God.
[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:07.200]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:10.200]  I want to thank you carpe.com for the great work you're doing and look forward to
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:12.200]  what you're going to put out next.
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:14.200]  Well, thanks for having me on again.
[1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:15.200]  Great to see you.
[1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:16.200]  We appreciate you, brother.
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:17.200]  All right.
[1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:20.200]  I've had him on for 15 years or longer.
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:23.200]  But Larry Pinkney is one of the original real Black Panther members.
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:25.200]  He was on two weeks ago.
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:26.200]  Leave with censorship.
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:28.200]  Millions of views on the internet.
[1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:30.200]  People went crazy.
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:31.200]  He has been on fire.
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:34.200]  Well, that's coming up straight ahead with Larry Pinkney.
[1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:37.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:08.200]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:38.200]  Either get chill for us today at infoarstore.com.
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:06.200]  It's great to keep with you.
[1:53:06.200 --> 1:53:11.200]  And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine,
[1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:13.200]  not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:53:13.200 --> 1:53:14.200]  We're really excited about it.
[1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:16.200]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:21.200]  It was Lister's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:25.200]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:28.200]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:34.200]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infoarstore.com
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:54:00.200]  and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:54:00.200 --> 1:54:12.200]  This is the end of this video.
[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:15.200]  We want more of that Black Panther guy.
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:16.200]  We want him.
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:17.200]  I'm like, great, you got him.
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.200]  So that's coming up next segment.
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:26.200]  But I want to air this report about the second phase of the COVID hoax and the lockdown.
[1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:30.200]  And the fact that this is meant to create a total depression against all Americans and
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:32.200]  they're openly in the news and they want to kill the dollar.
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:34.200]  This report is at banned.video.
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:36.200]  Lockdown part two is here.
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:39.200]  And again, we're going to be protesting this Sunday at the Texas Capitol.
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:41.200]  We're launching a nationwide movement.
[1:54:41.200 --> 1:54:43.200]  We can't breathe.news.
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:55:09.200]  Here is the report.
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:34.200]  It's going to kill hundreds of millions of people.
[1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:39.200]  I'm going to get into the new lockdown measures that we always knew were coming.
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:40.200]  It's been pre-engineered in a moment.
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:45.200]  But first, let's just remember that it's on record that all these hospitals were completely empty
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:50.200]  and that the hospital ships Trump sent, there was no patients for them.
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:56.200]  And let's remember that it's now come out that for any patient they claimed had COVID,
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:03.200]  they got over $52,000 and would put COVID on charts when the person didn't even have COVID.
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:08.200]  And that they would count people who died of heart attacks and cancer and pneumonia
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:11.200]  or the flu as COVID again to get the money.
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:19.200]  It's been engineered all over the world because the WHO, the UN, set the standards and the parameters.
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:23.200]  And then when all those medical doctors came out, prestigious scientists,
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:28.200]  the head former virologist at Rockefeller Hospital came out and said,
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:33.200]  there's a hoax, this is a fraud, they were banned off of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:38.200]  because the system knows this hoax can't stand the light of day.
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:43.200]  And the virus, which is a real virus and a nasty pneumonia, can't stand a lot of day.
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:46.200]  That's why they're trying to keep you locked in to these compact cities
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:52.200]  and that's why it's spread the most and killed the most people in blue cities and blue states
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:55.200]  that are these urban canyons where people don't get sunlight.
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:56:58.200]  Blue states, blue cities are making similar announcements saying,
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:02.200]  hey, you got to wear masks for the next year, you can never take your mask off.
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:08.200]  This is all about creating fear and testing, obedience and control over the population
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:14.200]  to wreck the economy and bring in a planetary government based on medical tyranny.
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:18.200]  There's still time to stop this operation.
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:20.200]  They've been planning this for decades.
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:23.200]  The Rockefeller Foundation admits on record with Bill and Linda Gates.
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:28.200]  We have their battle plans and if the public simply speaks out and exposes it, it will fail.
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:34.200]  That's why they brought in total censorship ahead of this and daring this to shut down debate.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:39.200]  But if we get the information to members of the Senate and to good governors like Governor Abbott
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:43.200]  and if you hit the streets and demonstrate and don't let the left intimidate you
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:46.200]  from exercising your First Amendment, we're going to win.
[1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:49.200]  The globalists know that conservatives on average are very compliant
[1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:51.200]  and we believe it helps America.
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:54.200]  And so they're telling us that we have to stay indoors or we're bad.
[1:57:54.200 --> 1:58:00.200]  But the leftist and the anti-fun, the black class matter, they're heroes when they go out and protest.
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:05.200]  This is all a form of martial law to make the American people stand down
[1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:09.200]  ahead of this election with election fraud being prepared to artificially,
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:11.200]  fraudulently remove President Trump.
[1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:17.200]  We can stop it if we simply do the research, face the facts and take action and say no.
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:22.200]  COVID-19 is a hoax. It's not killing anyone but old people.
[1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:27.200]  That's why they sent people that had it to the old folks' homes to get the numbers up.
[1:58:27.200 --> 1:58:31.200]  Instead of bowing down to the politicians that follow U.N. orders,
[1:58:31.200 --> 1:58:35.200]  these governors that ordered people into nursing homes to get the death numbers up
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:38.200]  should be indicted, tried and imprisoned.
[1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:42.200]  We either go in the offense or we're totally enslaved.
[1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:46.200]  It really is up to all of us now what we're going to do.
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:49.200]  We can't breathe.News.
[1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:54.200]  The majority of the population knows COVID-19 is a power grab and a medical tyranny hoax.
[1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:57.200]  But Big Tech is censoring hundreds and hundreds of prominent doctors,
[1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:01.200]  virologists, scientists and nurses that are exposing what's really going on
[1:59:01.200 --> 1:59:06.200]  and how they're killing people by intubating them and then covering it up claiming it was COVID.
[1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:09.200]  This is so diabolical, but we can stop it.
[1:59:09.200 --> 1:59:12.200]  Even if Big Tech censors us, we still have banned on video.
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:16.200]  We still have the key website, WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:22.200]  We're the science and the real facts are posted that vouching the U.N. hope nobody gets to see.
[1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:24.200]  But they can't stop you.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:28.200]  So share those links to WeCan'tBreathe.News and Banned.Video
[1:59:28.200 --> 1:59:33.200]  and join me this Sunday, the 28th in downtown Austin at the south side of the Capitol
[1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:36.200]  where we're going to protest this and then march to the nearby governor's mansion.
[1:59:36.200 --> 1:59:38.200]  Don't lay down to this tyranny.
[1:59:38.200 --> 1:59:41.200]  Take action and say no to the COVID-19 lockdown martial law.
[1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:46.200]  We're breaking it all down. Have the facts posted at WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[2:00:11.200 --> 2:00:21.200]  The dream of the Renaissance of humanity coming together and standing for justice
[2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:26.200]  when Martin Luther King said, judging people not about what color they are or what sex they are
[2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:30.200]  but what they build, what they stand for, what their integrity is.
[2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:33.200]  We all know that. I don't care what color you are.
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:35.200]  You're cooking good food. I'm going to your restaurant.
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:39.200]  I don't care what color you are. You're singing beautiful music or playing beautiful music.
[2:00:39.200 --> 2:00:44.200]  I love you. I don't care what color you are. You're a beautiful person. I love you.
[2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:48.200]  Instead, they teach us not about who we are. It's about what color we are,
[2:00:48.200 --> 2:00:51.200]  which is the same thing the Nazis taught.
[2:00:51.200 --> 2:00:56.200]  You see the total abandonment by the left and by the liberals, supposedly,
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:01:02.200]  of the promise of what America was shooting for, not that we ever reached it.
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:06.200]  Why has it been abandoned? Because the global corporations run slave camps in China
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:11.200]  and Africa and Latin America, and they know our weak spot is the fact we do care.
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:15.200]  So they show us how we're bad and magnify it and twist it
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:18.200]  so they can run away with the whole planet's future. That's my view.
[2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:22.200]  But Larry Pickney's come on many times in the last 15 years done an amazing job,
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:25.200]  author, researcher, one of the founding members of the Black Panther Party,
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:28.200]  been a political prisoner, dealt with COINTELPRO,
[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:31.200]  but he transcended all that and forgave the system.
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:36.200]  But he's fighting to, I guess, build a new system for everybody.
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:42.200]  He's written the saying, know to power, autobiography, a 20th century activist and thinker,
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:45.200]  and of course, blackactivistwg.org.
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:49.200]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio, veteran of the Black Panther Party,
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:51.200]  former minister of the Interior Republic of New Africa,
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:53.200]  former political prisoner of only America,
[2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:57.200]  and have successfully self-authored his civil political rights in the United Nations
[2:01:57.200 --> 2:02:00.200]  under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights
[2:02:00.200 --> 2:02:03.200]  in connection with his political organizing activities
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:05.200]  in opposition to voter suppression.
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:09.200]  Pickney was interviewed again at International Televised PBS News Hour.
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:11.200]  He's been on everything. He's here with us now.
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:15.200]  Larry, don't pause for me as you've been on fire with what's happening
[2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:18.200]  and what we're witnessing, and now they're pulling down Lincoln statues
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:20.200]  and anti-slaver statues.
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:24.200]  And now the left's announcing, we've got the article.
[2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:28.200]  They want Jesus Christ statues taken down.
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:32.200]  We've got a new Jesse Smollett out here with Bubba Wallace in the news.
[2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:37.200]  I mean, what in the hell is going on from your expert perspective?
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:43.200]  What's going on is a concerted effort to destroy the Republic.
[2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:47.200]  Let me be clear about that. They want to destroy the Republic.
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:52.200]  This is not about, and first of all, let me extend my greetings and love and strength
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:58.200]  to you, Brother Alex, and to Info Wars, and to all Patriots of this Republic.
[2:02:58.200 --> 2:03:01.200]  Now, let me get back to what I was saying.
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:07.200]  The fact is that the objective, their goal, what their goal is,
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:13.200]  to cause as much chaos, division, and disunity as possible.
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:15.200]  That's what they thrive on.
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:18.200]  That is precisely what they grow and thrive on.
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:23.200]  And we, black, white, brown, red, yellow, we citizens of this Republic
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:27.200]  must understand that, do not be hoodwinked or bamboozled.
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:33.200]  All right? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is going on.
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:36.200]  We are united.
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:41.200]  We will continue to be united, and we are growing.
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:43.200]  We are growing daily.
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:50.200]  So, don't mean to go on and on, but to me, from my subjective perspective,
[2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:54.200]  that is what is happening.
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:58.200]  I totally agree with you. They admit that's what they're doing.
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:00.200]  How do you think we counter this?
[2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:05.200]  Because it's just getting more intense every day, more insane.
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:11.200]  Well, the more intense that it becomes, actually, is what we have to do as some scientists say,
[2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:17.200]  we have to take the nastiness and reverse it.
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:20.200]  And I don't mean we have to be nasty in return.
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:24.200]  We simply need to push for the boomerang effect.
[2:04:24.200 --> 2:04:27.200]  And what do I mean by the boomerang effect?
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:31.200]  What I mean is that we have the capability.
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:37.200]  And by we, I mean all patriots, black, white, brown, red, yellow, citizens of this Republic,
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:41.200]  we have got to hold on tightly to one another.
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:48.200]  We have got to remember that we are not the quote-unquote minority.
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:50.200]  We are, in fact, the majority.
[2:04:50.200 --> 2:04:56.200]  But we have got to inform one another, keep putting it out there.
[2:04:56.200 --> 2:04:59.200]  We've got to seize the narrative.
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:01.200]  Seize, take the narrative.
[2:05:01.200 --> 2:05:03.200]  It's our narrative.
[2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:05.200]  It's our Republic.
[2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:10.200]  It doesn't belong to these lunatics and thugs and liars.
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:18.200]  And let me give you the three P's, the three P's, parasitic political pimps.
[2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:19.200]  All right?
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:24.200]  Every time you think about the three P's, think about the Democrats, the deep state,
[2:05:24.200 --> 2:05:28.200]  the globalists, the so-called mainstream media.
[2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:35.200]  Clan Tifa, yes, clan Tifa because they used the tactics of the clan and the BLM.
[2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:38.200]  We can talk about that later, the BLM.
[2:05:38.200 --> 2:05:40.200]  I have another name for them.
[2:05:40.200 --> 2:05:44.200]  But we have got to seize the narrative and keep it.
[2:05:44.200 --> 2:05:46.200]  Turn that narrative on them.
[2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:51.200]  Show who the real racists and fascists are.
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:53.200]  They're not just racists.
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:56.200]  They're out and out, blatant fascists.
[2:05:56.200 --> 2:05:58.200]  And we have to understand that.
[2:05:58.200 --> 2:06:04.200]  And we must take heart, hold on to each other tightly, inform each other,
[2:06:04.200 --> 2:06:12.200]  encourage each other, and intensify, intensify, intensify.
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:16.200]  I want to go over a few of the issues that are unfolding right now with Larry Pinkney,
[2:06:16.200 --> 2:06:17.200]  who's joining us right now.
[2:06:17.200 --> 2:06:20.200]  One of the founding members of the real Black Panther Party, not the modern Soros fund.
[2:06:20.200 --> 2:06:22.200]  And one that's basically like they fund the clan.
[2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:24.200]  They fund the other group too.
[2:06:24.200 --> 2:06:27.200]  Just like, and we'll play that clip coming up next segment.
[2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:32.200]  At least part of the clip with what, of course, one of the top experts on this.
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:36.200]  Many decades ago, Jabra Griffin talked about when he said,
[2:06:36.200 --> 2:06:39.200]  the main thing we got to stop is the white supremacist counter responding to this
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:41.200]  because that's their plan, what they're hoping for.
[2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:47.200]  But pro BLM medical workers silent when black men ask if unborn black babies matter.
[2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:50.200]  We're talking half the black people are aborted, folks.
[2:06:50.200 --> 2:06:54.200]  And you bring this up to a leftist, they will not stand up for,
[2:06:54.200 --> 2:06:56.200]  I don't care if it's a black baby or a white baby,
[2:06:56.200 --> 2:06:58.200]  but they particularly want those black babies.
[2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:02.200]  Here's what he had to say in this viral video.
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:04.200]  Lives matter or just some black lives?
[2:07:04.200 --> 2:07:06.200]  All Black Lives Matter.
[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:09.200]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[2:07:09.200 --> 2:07:11.200]  Yes.
[2:07:11.200 --> 2:07:15.200]  The black babies killed in the abortions clinics matter, right?
[2:07:15.200 --> 2:07:17.200]  Thought so.
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:23.200]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:24.200]  Okay.
[2:07:24.200 --> 2:07:27.200]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter,
[2:07:27.200 --> 2:07:30.200]  do they are medical people?
[2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:32.200]  Do their lives matter?
[2:07:32.200 --> 2:07:35.200]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:36.200]  Huh?
[2:07:36.200 --> 2:07:37.200]  What's up?
[2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:38.200]  What's up?
[2:07:38.200 --> 2:07:40.200]  All for quiet now, aren't they?
[2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:41.200]  Uh-huh.
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:45.200]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[2:07:45.200 --> 2:07:47.200]  But you have a problem when we,
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:50.200]  you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[2:07:50.200 --> 2:07:53.200]  Yes, we know they're the same issue.
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:57.200]  If we don't, if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:00.200]  enough to save them and fight for them,
[2:08:00.200 --> 2:08:03.200]  our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:05.200]  And again, that's everything right there.
[2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:07.200]  You, if you're a radio listener, you don't see,
[2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:09.200]  there's probably a hundred nurses and doctors.
[2:08:09.200 --> 2:08:12.200]  And as soon as he says, what about black babies, they shut up.
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:15.200]  Training, that's cult training because they know all day in there,
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:17.200]  they're sterilizing black women.
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:19.200]  They know all day in there that the target's black people.
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:24.200]  This is some social justice signaling by me.
[2:08:24.200 --> 2:08:27.200]  Folks, if they can do this, the black people will do it to everybody and they are.
[2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:29.200]  It's evil, Larry.
[2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:31.200]  It's more than evil.
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:33.200]  You know, the fact is that they talk about, you know,
[2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:37.200]  you've heard that expression, virtual signaling.
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:39.200]  Throw that out.
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:41.200]  Take the narrative back.
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:45.200]  When they virtue signal, when they have no virtue.
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:46.200]  All right.
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:47.200]  Exactly.
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:49.200]  The fact is, you know, the fact is, my brother Alex,
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:54.200]  that it's all about controlling, dividing, manipulating,
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:57.200]  staring up as much chaos as possible.
[2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:58.200]  No, I agree.
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:09:00.200]  But how do they have a hundred nurses and doctors so trained?
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:01.200]  What about black people?
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:02.200]  Yeah.
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:03.200]  What about black people?
[2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:04.200]  Yeah.
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:05.200]  What about black babies?
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:06.200]  Nothing.
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:07.200]  They're trained.
[2:09:07.200 --> 2:09:08.200]  Nothing.
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:09.200]  That's right.
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.200]  They're trained chimpanzees.
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:13.200]  In fact, I give a chimpanzee more credit.
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:18.200]  The fact is that we need to not only wake up ourselves,
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:22.200]  and I know your audience is awake, but we need to push this.
[2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:26.200]  That's why I keep saying, take back the narrative.
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:28.200]  Tell us how to do it, Larry Pinkney on the other side,
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:29.200]  former political prisoner.
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:31.200]  And we've got exclusive info.
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:32.200]  Roger Stone's got out too.
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:33.200]  That's coming up.
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:35.200]  He's about to go into prison for what he did.
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:36.200]  It's unbelievable.
[2:09:36.200 --> 2:09:40.200]  So if you're interested in infowars.com, newswars.com,
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:10:08.200]  we'll be right back.
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:34.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:59.200]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:25.200]  today.
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:51.200]  Thanks for watching.
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:12:24.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:53.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:55.200]  Thanks for watching.
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:26.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:00.200]  Larry, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[2:14:00.200 --> 2:14:04.200]  Pulling back from this and just seeing where it's all going.
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:07.200]  What other knowledge do you want to impart on to us?
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:11.200]  What do you want to say about BLM and the sortos funded groups?
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:14.200]  Because a lot of these young people are really listening to what you have to say.
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:18.200]  They really believe that the sortos funded groups really care about black people
[2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:20.200]  or folks in general.
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:25.200]  First of all, BLM is a fraud, it's a fake, it's disgusting,
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:27.200]  and it's extremely dangerous.
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:28.200]  Right?
[2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:29.200]  BLM.
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:30.200]  What a name.
[2:14:30.200 --> 2:14:31.200]  Black Lives Matter.
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:36.200]  What about the 14 people that died last week on Father's Day in Chicago?
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:37.200]  Where's BLM?
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:41.200]  One of those 14 black people was a three year old boy.
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:42.200]  Okay?
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  Where's BLM?
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:44.200]  They're nowhere.
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:49.200]  They're nowhere to be found because they don't really give a damn about black
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:51.200]  lives or any lives.
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:55.200]  They are political, parasitic political pimps.
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:15:00.200]  They're getting money and they're funneling that money to whom?
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:06.200]  To the seditious, racist, Ku Klux Klan Democrats.
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:09.200]  And yes, I said Ku Klux Klan Democrats.
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:14.200]  That's why I call Antifa Klan Tifa because that's really what they're about.
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:17.200]  So, getting back to your original point, Alex.
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:20.200]  We need to understand that it's up to us.
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:22.200]  I don't mean to interrupt, but you're absolutely right.
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:24.200]  The Democrats were not raising any money.
[2:15:24.200 --> 2:15:30.200]  Now they've raised $50 million off BLM, which they run, and Antifa wears masks just like
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:33.200]  the Klan, and they're funded by a Nazi collaborator.
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:35.200]  You can't make that up.
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:39.200]  And that Nazi collaborator is none other than George Soros.
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:46.200]  People have been so dumbed down by this insidious and sippid media, and we can call it a media
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:48.200]  and we can call it a media.
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:51.200]  I call it the propaganda arm of the Third Reich.
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:16:00.200]  In fact, it's so insidiously controlling and manipulative that it would make the Third
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:04.200]  Reich propaganda arm green with envy.
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:07.200]  It would run circles around Goebbels.
[2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:11.200]  Yes, Goebbels would be envious.
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:17.200]  So we know this, but let's concentrate on our power, because our power is us.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.200]  It's you, me, all of us.
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:20.200]  That's right.
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:21.200]  Exactly.
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:22.200]  Let's focus on us.
[2:16:22.200 --> 2:16:23.200]  What do we do?
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:28.200]  We have got to ensure, and I say this, I said it before and I'm going to say it again and
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:30.200]  I'm going to try to explain it.
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:37.200]  When I say take back the narrative, I mean we have got to determine our own means, our
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:40.200]  own words, our own phrases.
[2:16:40.200 --> 2:16:46.200]  Every time, you know, when I was a kid, right, in elementary school, they say, oh, you're
[2:16:46.200 --> 2:16:47.200]  not in my way.
[2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:48.200]  It's got bad moods.
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:52.200]  It's something stupid, you know, and kids would do that with each other.
[2:16:52.200 --> 2:16:53.200]  Right?
[2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:54.200]  So I would do like this.
[2:16:54.200 --> 2:16:58.200]  I don't know if you all can see my hand, but I would go like this.
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:16:59.200]  All right?
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:03.200]  And it meant right back at you.
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:04.200]  All right?
[2:17:04.200 --> 2:17:09.200]  And we need to understand that everything and not only understand it, but we need to
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:11.200]  tell people that every-
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:12.200]  No, you're right.
[2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:13.200]  We don't take it.
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:16.200]  We've got to respond back in our own original way every time, and we get stronger, they
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:17.200]  get weaker.
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:18.200]  We don't submit.
[2:17:18.200 --> 2:17:19.200]  We fight back.
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:20.200]  That's right.
[2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:24.200]  And we fight back with truth, with facts.
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:25.200]  Okay?
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:27.200]  These folks can't stand facts.
[2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:29.200]  They treat facts.
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:30.200]  Okay?
[2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:34.200]  They treat facts like Dracula treats the cross.
[2:17:34.200 --> 2:17:38.200]  It's like, oh my God, no, no, don't give me facts.
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:39.200]  All right?
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:40.920]  Give me the Kool-Aid.
[2:17:40.920 --> 2:17:46.800]  And so we have got to, and we've got a grand opportunity to do this.
[2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:47.800]  We've got to do it.
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:48.800]  No, I agree.
[2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:51.520]  I think if we strike, the globalists have miscounted.
[2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:52.640]  They really are going for broke.
[2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:54.200]  I think out of weakness.
[2:17:54.200 --> 2:17:57.200]  Well, they've overplayed their hand, Alex.
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:18:00.240]  My brother, they've overplayed their hand.
[2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:03.120]  They pushed so far and so fast.
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:04.120]  And you watch.
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:06.000]  Now they're going to start trying to moderate.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:09.880]  Well, you can't moderate fascism, they're fascists.
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:13.760]  You can't moderate globalism, they're globalists.
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:21.160]  So our job is to intensify, to keep pushing our narrative, which is the truth.
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:22.160]  That's our job.
[2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:24.600]  Keep laying it on us, brother Pinkney.
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:31.120]  I have to tell you, and I'm going to say this again, I want to reiterate, I said it on another
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:32.120]  show.
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:36.160]  On this show, we are not alone, all right?
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:42.360]  The media, the so-called mainstream media, I say so-called because they're not mainstream.
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:43.880]  They're mainstream.
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:49.600]  But in any event, the so-called mainstream media wants you and me and all of our brothers
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:53.360]  and sisters out there to think that we're by ourselves.
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:55.880]  We are far from by ourselves.
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:18:57.280]  We are united.
[2:18:57.280 --> 2:18:58.440]  We are strong.
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:00.120]  We are getting stronger every day.
[2:19:00.120 --> 2:19:02.920]  I want to emphasize that because you're not going to find out.
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:04.400]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:07.160]  This whole attack is because we're strong.
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:08.160]  That's right.
[2:19:08.160 --> 2:19:10.160]  Why else would they attack my brother?
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:11.760]  Because we are strong.
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:17.440]  So look at it from the standpoint of, ah, over the target.
[2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:19.600]  That's why we're getting the flag.
[2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:24.160]  And that's why Info Wars got the flag and is still getting the flag.
[2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:26.720]  We're all over the target.
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:33.800]  Let's intensify, let's keep on hitting them with troop bombs every single day.
[2:19:33.800 --> 2:19:35.160]  We'll plant the seed.
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:36.160]  If it grows, great.
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:40.640]  If it doesn't, we move on and plant some more seeds.
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:41.640]  I agree with you.
[2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:42.640]  And I agree.
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:43.640]  We should focus on our power when we come back, though.
[2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:47.080]  And just tell us now, gut level, though, people should be wary what to look out for.
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:50.960]  I think they're going to stage a mass racial shooting or a bombing of a federal building.
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:51.960]  And you can just smell it.
[2:19:51.960 --> 2:19:53.920]  I think the false flags about to happen.
[2:19:53.920 --> 2:19:54.920]  Right.
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:55.920]  Absolutely.
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:56.920]  We know that.
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:19:57.920]  You're absolutely correct.
[2:19:57.920 --> 2:19:58.920]  Let's talk about it.
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:19:59.920]  All right.
[2:19:59.920 --> 2:20:00.920]  Larry Pigny.
[2:20:00.920 --> 2:20:04.000]  Larry, you've got great sides, great books, never promote yourself.
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:05.280]  You deserve to be all over the place.
[2:20:05.280 --> 2:20:06.280]  We love you.
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:07.920]  Where do people find your material?
[2:20:07.920 --> 2:20:13.640]  Well, you know, as you mentioned, I'm in the book called Saying No to Power written
[2:20:13.640 --> 2:20:17.480]  by William M. Mandel, introduction by Howard Zinn.
[2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:24.480]  I'm also on reality underscore dot one on, not dot one, reality underscore the number
[2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:26.600]  one on Twitter.
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:33.120]  I'm also at blackactivistwg.org, which stands for writer's yield.org.
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:34.120]  But you're right.
[2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:35.320]  I don't promote myself.
[2:20:35.320 --> 2:20:39.240]  I want to promote my brothers and my sisters of all colors.
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:40.240]  No, no, no.
[2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:41.240]  We're going to win.
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:42.240]  People need to know where to find more of what you do.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:43.240]  We'll be right back.
[2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:44.240]  We've got to work from Roger Stone.
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:21:02.520]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:08.040]  We can't survive without pure clean drinking water.
[2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:14.040]  So make sure that it's always available to you with the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:22.040]  This gravity-fed system filters through all the toxins and gets straight to clean, healthy, great tasting water.
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:26.040]  Mmm. Mmm. Yummy in my tummy.
[2:21:26.040 --> 2:21:37.040]  Bring the purest, most refreshing water to your home by ordering the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System today from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:43.040]  InfowarsStore.com. Other systems just don't compare.
[2:22:08.040 --> 2:22:17.040]  None of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[2:22:17.040 --> 2:22:26.040]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people creating hysteria and segment numbers spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election.
[2:22:26.040 --> 2:22:33.040]  And it's all Trump's fault. And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city. We've got to lock down again. Everything's over.
[2:22:33.040 --> 2:22:42.040]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners. Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it. Your choice.
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:09.040]  I present China, the worst on the planet, and then lecture white people in America how they're bad to black people.
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:15.040]  And now all over the world, people are taking knees and trying to overthrow police and put leftists in control.
[2:23:15.040 --> 2:23:19.040]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:25.040]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer? Leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people.
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:30.040]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[2:23:30.040 --> 2:23:37.040]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:24:02.040]  Why aren't they at the United Nations? Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:13.040]  A lot of big breaking news.
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:16.040]  Larry Pinckney is our guest.
[2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:21.040]  Girlfriend of man who flew White Lives Matter banner fired from her job in the UK.
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:24.040]  Premier League football players Neil for BLM.
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:28.040]  No recognition for victims of Redding terror attack.
[2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:32.040]  COVID-19 is a nursing home disaster. We've got so many reports.
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:38.040]  Larry Pinckney is our guest. Before I go back to him, we're funded by listeners and viewers, Brian Products,
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:40.040]  then PolarStore.com.

[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:27.040]  Want to thank you all for your support. Okay, going back to Larry Pinckney.
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:30.040]  Larry, I could ask a thousand questions, but you've got the floor.
[2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:32.040]  It's about nine minutes left in this segment.
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:36.040]  What else do you want to impart as a founding member of the real Black Panther Party
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:42.040]  versus what G. Ebert Griffin talked about, how they're funding Black Extremists and White Extremists.
[2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:48.040]  That's come out since he said that in 69 in court that these shadowy corporations are trying to create a race war.
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:52.040]  Well, obviously, they're enslaving us all. They want us to kill each other.
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:57.040]  Of course, and the fact of the matter is, since you mentioned the original,
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:25:59.040]  and I'm glad you make that crystal clear.
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:06.040]  Yes, I'm a member, a veteran of the original Black Panther Party, alright?
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.040]  That's dating back to when it was founded in 1966.
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:16.040]  Not this job time has stepped in a so-called new Black Panther Party,
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:21.040]  which I have nothing to say about other than go away, alright?
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:31.040]  Now, the fact of the matter is, when it comes down to organizations, if you can call them that,
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:38.040]  such as Black Lives Matter, BLM, why aren't they doing what historically we did?
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:41.040]  We were in the communities, alright?
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:47.040]  In the communities, and we were there with our brothers and sisters of all colors.
[2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:55.040]  We had health programs, medical programs, food programs, senior citizens programs, alright?
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:57.040]  It's an endless list. We had that.
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:02.040]  That's what we meant when we said, serve the people, body, and soul.
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:08.040]  And in our breakfast programs, it didn't matter if you were white, brown, yellow, or red.
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:14.040]  If you needed food, and you were in our community, then you have got it, okay?
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:20.040]  And of course, as a Black person in the Black community, quote-unquote,
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:29.040]  we were going to do everything that we possibly could to get you to understand that you can take care of yourself.
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:33.040]  You can sustain yourself and your own community.
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:37.040]  We didn't turn to no George Soros to get funding.
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:41.040]  We didn't turn to the federal government to get funding.
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:45.040]  We didn't turn to private enterprise to get funding.
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:47.040]  We did it ourselves.
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:53.040]  And a so-called Black Lives Matter really cared, which they do not.
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:28:02.040]  But if they really cared, then send them to Chicago, send them to Detroit, send them to Baltimore, Philadelphia, okay?
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:09.040]  These major cities, send them there and tell them you serve the people, body, and soul.
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:13.040]  You serve them. You pieces serve them, okay?
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:15.040]  Not all this crap.
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:23.040]  I'm sick and tired of seeing this insidious nonsense about Black Lives Matter.
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:30.040]  Indeed, all lives matter. How can Black Lives Matter if all lives don't matter, right?
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:37.040]  I mean, that's just common sense. Whatever happened to common sense, I'll tell you what happened to common sense.
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:46.040]  It's not common anymore thanks to decades of brainwashing of these people who are now out in the streets, okay?
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:55.040]  And then we have these passive-aggressive, self-deprecating whites who think that they can somehow absolve themselves,
[2:28:55.040 --> 2:29:02.040]  which they really don't need to be absolved because there's enough blame to go around to everybody.
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:06.040]  I don't care what your color or gender is, alright?
[2:29:06.040 --> 2:29:15.040]  But these self-deprecating whites who want to bow down, bow down what?
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:18.040]  Bring slavery back, only reverse it?
[2:29:18.040 --> 2:29:21.040]  No, I believe what Dr. King said.
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:29.040]  I believe Dr. King made it clear that it's about the content of one's character and not the color of the skin.
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:36.040]  Who are the real racists? Why they are? Who are the real fascists? Why they are?
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:41.040]  And we need to remember that, my brothers and sisters. I don't care what your color is.
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:47.040]  We don't have time for that. We've got to save each other, save our republic.
[2:29:47.040 --> 2:29:51.040]  And yes, I support President Donald J. Trump.
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:30:02.040]  You bet I do, just like Frederick Douglass, the late, great Frederick Douglass, supported the Republican President Abraham Lincoln.
[2:30:02.040 --> 2:30:07.040]  And I'm not pushing the Republican Party, I'm pushing principles here.
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:13.040]  Principles. And this is what we need to have, principles with each other.
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:20.040]  And by the way, when we disagree, and there will be times that we will and should disagree,
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:30.040]  but do it in private. Don't do it openly so that these fascists and these real races can take advantage of that and exploit it.
[2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:32.040]  Do it in private.
[2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:36.040]  But as Brother Malcolm said, come out as a united front.
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:40.040]  And this is what we have got to do constantly.
[2:30:40.040 --> 2:30:47.040]  These so-called liberals, so-called progressives, they're not progressive, they're regressive.
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:53.040]  I repeat, they are regressive. They are parasitic political pimps.
[2:30:53.040 --> 2:30:57.040]  Be proud of what you are. And I don't give a damn what your color is.
[2:30:57.040 --> 2:30:59.040]  I totally agree with you. Let me ask you this.
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:10.040]  And why are they so upset from the top of the globalist, the chai comms of the EU, the Hollywood, right down to their average, method weird white dude trying to strip a war?
[2:31:10.040 --> 2:31:14.040]  What do they think they're getting? Where does all this come from?
[2:31:14.040 --> 2:31:22.040]  Well, I think some of it is coming from what I said before. They're trying to, you know, I call it passive aggressive guilt.
[2:31:22.040 --> 2:31:29.040]  You know, I don't want to be in the foxhole with somebody who's in the foxhole because they're doing it out of guilt.
[2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:37.040]  I want to be, if I have to be in the foxhole, let me be with a brother or sister who's doing this out of love for the Republic.
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:39.040]  Okay? What are they doing?
[2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:43.040]  Exactly. Doing this because you care, not because you're doing some weird guilt thing.
[2:31:43.040 --> 2:31:48.040]  Right. Right. That's very dangerous. It's totally unacceptable.
[2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:52.040]  And I love my brothers and sisters. I don't give a damn what your color is.
[2:31:52.040 --> 2:31:54.040]  I'm not kissing your ass. What you just said is so deep.
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:32:01.040]  Doing something out of some fake guilt somebody puts on you versus what you know is right. It's two different things.
[2:32:01.040 --> 2:32:03.040]  Completely different. And that is powerful.
[2:32:03.040 --> 2:32:07.040]  Like doing it because you know it and you love it and you want it.
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:12.040]  Like I don't want to die, but I'm ready to versus somebody lays guilt on me.
[2:32:12.040 --> 2:32:16.040]  But think about the types that do this out of guilt. They've got some other issues.
[2:32:16.040 --> 2:32:21.040]  They're trying to work out and using black people as some weird thing they've got.
[2:32:21.040 --> 2:32:25.040]  Any people they can find in this case is black people.
[2:32:25.040 --> 2:32:32.040]  And the globalists, okay, take full advantage of that. They know this. They take full advantage of this.
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:35.040]  That's some weird psychology. Explain that to me. How does that work?
[2:32:35.040 --> 2:32:38.040]  You seem to figure it out.
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:46.040]  I've looked at it and I must admit, I shake my head and go, oh my God, have these people lost their minds?
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:55.040]  Are they actually getting on their knees doing the very thing that we struggle against for hundreds of years and now they're on their knees?
[2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:01.040]  No, that's not what I struggled for. That's not what we in the original parties struggled for.
[2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:04.040]  We struggled for equality for justice.
[2:33:04.040 --> 2:33:09.040]  And that threatens the big globalist, new-old-ordered chai-com slave grid.
[2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:15.040]  So they become what they fear. They fear the West Renaissance of us trying to get ourselves right.
[2:33:15.040 --> 2:33:22.040]  So they become it and then turn it in against itself, make it a fool, destroy it, and then they're done with it.
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:26.040]  That's right. But you know what, my brother? We're going to have our Renaissance.
[2:33:26.040 --> 2:33:32.040]  We are in our Renaissance right now, and it's going to grow and grow and grow.
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:38.040]  Let's start that song by the Temptations, like a snowball rolling down the hill. It keeps on growing.
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:43.040]  See if you can find that when we come back. Temptations. Save that song.
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:47.040]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:48.040]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:49.040]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:56.040]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:33:58.040]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:05.040]  I'm Juan in Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:19.040]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar.
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:21.040]  And I just want to thank you for that, man.
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:26.040]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:31.040]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. You didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues,
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:39.040]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there in your savings.
[2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:41.040]  It's made your life better, so that means a lot to me. Thank you.
[2:34:41.040 --> 2:34:57.040]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:16.040]  Two nursing homes during COVID-19 to actually jack up numbers and kill people.
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:21.040]  We're breaking it all down. Have the facts posted at WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:29.040]  The evidence, the nurses, the doctors, the scientists, the virologists exposing that COVID-19 is a tyranny, is a hoax, and is a lie.
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:32.040]  Only the truth can set us free from this great lie.
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:34.040]  And the truth is posted right now.
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:38.040]  It needs you to take action by spreading it at WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:43.040]  For more information, go to WeCan'tBreathe.News today.
[2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:14.040]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:19.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have,
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:24.040]  because we are going into hardcore United Nations-controlled bondage.
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:30.040]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are announcing they're going under UN control
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:34.040]  and turning their, quote, police into community activist organizers.
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:38.040]  This is just the beginning. Everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:37:04.040]  So, it's here. No more games. The New World Order has arrived.
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:14.040]  Forcing escalations that they have contact tracing on their phones and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:21.040]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government, forced inoculation, and complete enslavement of the human population.
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:26.040]  This is medical tyranny. This is the Bill of Mellon, the Gates, the UN takeover.
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:32.040]  This is the end of civilization. As you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:36.040]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:40.040]  If you want everyone you know that it's a giant hoax, show them the numbers, show them the facts,
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:38:09.040]  and explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:19.040]  Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow cover, it's growing.
[2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:30.040]  Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel, it's growing.
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:34.040]  You know, I've been working around these cranes here for a long time.
[2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:39.040]  It's brought to my attention that manufacturers might be a little bit racist.
[2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:45.040]  Here you got a bunch of fine white folk, just happy as s***, giving crane signal.
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:50.040]  Then you do a good walk around, around the crane, and you find out that guess what?
[2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:55.040]  Every time there's a hazard, it's a black man getting hurt.
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:59.040]  You look at his hand here, guess what? It's a black man getting crushed.
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:04.040]  What you got here, a little electricity? Uh oh, I mean black electricians you know.
[2:39:04.040 --> 2:39:09.040]  Let's climb on up this sucker here, watch our footing, come back here.
[2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:14.040]  Oh, innocent black man getting crushed by the counterweights.
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:17.040]  But then you got old Billy Bob here, happier than a pig in s***.
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:24.040]  Cable up, darl, look at this little s***, cable down, hey, lower that boom.
[2:39:24.040 --> 2:39:31.040]  I mean, look at all the white folk, all of them, happy, happy, happy, happy.
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:36.040]  Then guess what? Another black man. Oh, hey man, watch that there hook.
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:38.040]  It's gonna fall on your head if you don't get out the way.
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:40.040]  Black man?
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:44.040]  Uh, what we got here? Black welder, guess what?
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:47.040]  Don't weld on it black man, you're gonna get shocked.
[2:39:47.040 --> 2:39:53.040]  Look here, black man's hand getting burnt by some pressurized hydraulic old leak.
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:58.040]  And white man over here just hanging out, just doing him, no big deal.
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:03.040]  Black man, don't step there with your black foot, it's my crane.
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:11.040]  Hey black man, don't put your hand in that cable, it'll hurt.
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:15.040]  So next time you see one of these crane manufacturers walking around Walmart,
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:21.040]  go ahead and slap the s*** out of him, tell him to stop being so racist, come on.
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:28.040]  And that shows like, Bubba Wall is saying that the pull down on the garage was a noose
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:32.040]  and it turned out they have years of footage of the same thing, things there.
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:37.040]  Uh, so, so, again, it's not lessening the fact that they're boarding the black babies
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:42.040]  and there is this agenda to, you know, depopulate the third world, but that's going on.
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:47.040]  And it's all covered by saying, well, I see a noose, I'm gonna call the police.
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:52.040]  Like I said today, what happened to this NASCAR driver, who's about as black as I am,
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:57.040]  is I got a good tango and I'm, you know, I mean, look at this right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:01.040]  He says he sees, it's a pull, and again, we don't even blame him.
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:05.040]  He was told by his corporate sponsors, he'll probably get a Nike sponsorship to divide us
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:07.040]  because Nike has slave camps.
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:08.040]  Well, how does Nike cover that up?
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:10.040]  Well, Klan, they love black lives.
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:12.040]  Larry Pinkney, this is sick.
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:17.040]  It's sick, it's disgusting, it's insidious, and it's well-planned.
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:22.040]  Sick, disgusting, insidious, and well-planned, but we've got something that they don't have.
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:28.040]  We have truth, and we have each other, and we have determination.
[2:41:28.040 --> 2:41:29.040]  You know what?
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:32.040]  To slip off into some little ghetto ease.
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:35.040]  They ain't seen nothing yet, my brother.
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:37.040]  They ain't seen nothing yet.
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:38.040]  They think we're silent.
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:40.040]  They think we're fools.
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:45.040]  They think they're gonna keep on pimping and hoodwinking and bamboozling us.
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:46.040]  They are wrong.
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:48.040]  They are wrong.
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:53.040]  We have only just begun, and it's gonna happen like a wildfire.
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:54.040]  You hear me?
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:56.040]  Like a wildfire.
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:00.040]  So, all I have to say is, y'all just keep on doing it.
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:02.040]  Keep on overplaying your hand.
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:06.040]  Keep on saying that everything you see is racist.
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:09.040]  Nobody's saying that there's no racism at all.
[2:42:09.040 --> 2:42:11.040]  Of course there is racism.
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:14.040]  And by the way, it's on all sides.
[2:42:14.040 --> 2:42:17.040]  I might emphasize, all sides.
[2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:23.040]  So, what we need to do is, I keep saying this, hang tight to each other.
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:26.040]  Keep putting the information out there.
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:28.040]  Intensify, intensify.
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:33.040]  Stop feeling like you're all alone because you're not all alone.
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:34.040]  You're strong.
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:35.040]  You're beautiful.
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:42.040]  And the most beautiful thing I have seen in the past few years, frankly, is the rise of
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:46.040]  patriotism and patriots for our great republic.
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:47.040]  I didn't say perfect.
[2:42:47.040 --> 2:42:51.040]  I said our great republic and all power to the people.
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:52.040]  You're absolutely right.
[2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:58.040]  That's the thing is, the big mega corporations are literally number wise killed more than
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:42:59.040]  Hitler.
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:01.040]  I mean, and Hitler's a bad guy.
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:04.040]  They're so damn evil and they've got us all fighting with each other.
[2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:06.040]  When they're clearly the enemy.
[2:43:06.040 --> 2:43:08.040]  And I don't mean that in the communist way.
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:09.040]  The corporations are communist.
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:10.040]  They're all tax exempt.
[2:43:10.040 --> 2:43:14.040]  I want to tax Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple.
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:16.040]  And I want them out of China and not having slave camps.
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:18.040]  And I want China to be free.
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:23.040]  But to have Tim Cook literally on record with all these people in slave camps confirmed
[2:43:23.040 --> 2:43:27.040]  making Apple parts and then he tells me I'm bad.
[2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:29.040]  This is so obvious.
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:32.040]  Well, I mean, it's like the frying pan calling the pot black.
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:37.040]  I mean, you know, if you'll excuse that expression, brothers and sisters, but the bottom line is
[2:43:37.040 --> 2:43:39.040]  we're talking hypocrisy here.
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:41.040]  We're talking hypocrisy here.
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:47.040]  And the reality is that's why I keep saying seize the narrative, turn it on them, seize
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:51.040]  the narrative, put it back on them and be serious about it.
[2:43:51.040 --> 2:43:55.040]  By the way, I'm sure you saw the Charlottesville thing early this year in January.
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:59.040]  50,000 people at a good 10, 15% were black.
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:02.040]  At totally nothing happened violent.
[2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:05.040]  The left even said 50,000 guns or something all together.
[2:44:05.040 --> 2:44:07.040]  They said it was a white supremacist rally.
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:09.040]  It was a big love fest about rights.
[2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:11.040]  That scared the hell out of the establishment.
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:14.040]  Of course it did because then what do you have?
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:16.040]  We had unity.
[2:44:16.040 --> 2:44:19.040]  We had real unity between black, white, brown, red, yellow.
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:21.040]  They don't want to see that.
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:24.040]  They want to see the opposite of that while claiming that they won.
[2:44:24.040 --> 2:44:27.040]  Under the under, we're all allowed to have guns.
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:32.040]  When they saw every color of the rainbow with guns saying we're a republic and we have freedoms
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:35.040]  and we tell the man we're not your slave.
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:39.040]  That's what made the governor blackface of Virginia shit his pants.
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:40.040]  That's right.
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:41.040]  And you know what?
[2:44:41.040 --> 2:44:47.040]  We need to do that nationwide, nationwide because we are one people.
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:49.040]  I repeat, we are one people.
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:56.040]  This is one republic and any sour grapes that we have, we will deal with with each other.
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:44:59.040]  And that's the republic out of many one.
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:00.040]  That's right.
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:04.040]  And we're not going to let the chai comms who enslave their own people manipulate us.
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:05.040]  They think we're weak.
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:06.040]  We're strong.
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:07.040]  They think we're weak.
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:09.040]  Let them keep thinking that.
[2:45:09.040 --> 2:45:11.040]  But they got another thought coming.
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:13.040]  We are much stronger than they ever.
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:14.040]  I know you're 15 years.
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:15.040]  I've never seen you so positive.
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.040]  You can just gut level and all your years of research.
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:19.040]  I mean, you can feel it.
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:21.040]  You can see it.
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:23.040]  I can see it and I can feel it.
[2:45:23.040 --> 2:45:27.040]  As you know, brother, I've been in the struggle for well over 50 years.
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:35.040]  And the only thing that's actually different now is that the media has is playing this
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:37.040]  game of, oh, I'm on your side.
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:41.040]  The media has never been on the side of the people, especially now.
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:42.040]  Okay.
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:45.040]  They're pimping, pimping all of us, black, white, brown, red and yellow.
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:52.040]  So I'm positive because I think and can see that more of our people and by our black, white,
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:55.040]  brown, red and yellow citizens of this republic are.
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:00.040]  Larry, listen, I don't want to be over positive, but I took a week off one to the coast, you
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:05.040]  know, the, the, the, uh, go to Mexico and I was in restaurants and everywhere ever.
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:09.040]  I mean, it was black, white, old, young, you name it, Hispanic, Asian, Chinese, getting
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:10.040]  foes with me.
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:12.040]  They were all like COVID's a hoax.
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:14.040]  They want to race for FM.
[2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:15.040]  We love you.
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:16.040]  We get it.
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:18.040]  I mean, I probably shook a hundred black hands.
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:20.040]  There weren't a lot of black folks in Texas.
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:23.040]  Anybody else, I agree with you that they have really pushed it.
[2:46:23.040 --> 2:46:28.040]  I don't think the establishment knows how screwed up they are right now.
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:30.040]  And we want to make sure that they don't know.
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:36.040]  Keep on keeping on because they haven't seen, and I repeat, they have not seen my brother
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:37.040]  anything yet.
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:38.040]  They're tired of it.
[2:46:38.040 --> 2:46:39.040]  We are tired.
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:43.040]  As Fanny Lou Hamer said, we are tired of being tired.
[2:46:43.040 --> 2:46:46.040]  Enough is enough.
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:47.040]  It is super obvious.
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:50.040]  So you're reduced to the general community.
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:53.040]  Are folks where you're at waking up as well?
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:54.040]  Yes.
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:47:00.040]  To my great surprise and delight, I'm hearing people saying, oh my God, I was telling
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:05.040]  us this, you know, about what Biden had to say about you're not black if you don't vote
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:06.040]  for me.
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:07.040]  And she went, what?
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:08.040]  Lost my vote.
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:10.040]  I said, well, that's the Democrats.
[2:47:10.040 --> 2:47:12.040]  Don't you know about Robert C. Byrd?
[2:47:12.040 --> 2:47:16.040]  Of course, she didn't know about Robert C. Byrd, but she learned that's my job.
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:17.040]  That's our job.
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:18.040]  Get it out.
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:23.040]  You know, share with our brothers and sisters and learn from our brothers and sisters.
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:30.040]  None of us are perfect, but not one of us is as strong as all of there is Robert Byrd
[2:47:30.040 --> 2:47:31.040]  KKK.
[2:47:31.040 --> 2:47:33.040]  Anyway, not so scared of us.
[2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:37.040]  Like you just said, I probably talked to 500 people on the street the last few weeks.
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:39.040]  I mean, I've never been this aggressive and people are ready.
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:42.040]  I just do it because I know, oh, you think you're going to censor me?
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:43.040]  I'm going to do this in person.
[2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:45.040]  You see, oh, they can feel it too.
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:47.040]  I'm just boom, boom, boom.
[2:47:47.040 --> 2:47:48.040]  That's right.
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:49.040]  And I'm proud of you.
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:51.040]  And you know what, brother?
[2:47:51.040 --> 2:47:53.040]  People are all over the world.
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:55.040]  This is not just a national thing.
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:47:56.040]  This is a global thing.
[2:47:56.040 --> 2:47:58.040]  We're all proud of you.
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:02.040]  Info wars and all patriots, all power to the people.
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:04.040]  Larry, we're proud of you because we wouldn't be here without you.
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:05.040]  And we're all the same thing.
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:10.040]  We're all unified under human love, red blood and a future for our children.
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:13.040]  Larry Pitten, we love you and God bless you, my friend.
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:15.040]  God bless you all.
[2:48:15.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  Power to the people.
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:17.040]  Love you, brother.
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:18.040]  Powerful interview.
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:19.040]  All right, I do it.
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:20.040]  Roger Stone update.
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:23.040]  And then the next post is taken over a week.
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:24.040]  We got so much to cover.
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:25.040]  That was powerful.
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:27.040]  I'm telling you, it's, it's, it's, it's incredible.
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:29.040]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[2:48:29.040 --> 2:48:34.040]  Stay with us.
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:37.040]  The United States is not communist China.
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:40.040]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:42.040]  We don't blow up churches.
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:45.040]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:51.040]  But all of the news, we see the UN, billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media,
[2:48:51.040 --> 2:48:54.040]  praising communist China for their response.
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:59.040]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:02.040]  robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:07.040]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:08.040]  virus.
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:11.040]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:16.040]  People are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:20.040]  we, the people, are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:21.040]  power grab.
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:25.040]  The resistance lives at band.video and at FullWars.com.
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:29.040]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:34.040]  defeat their operation that much quicker.
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:36.040]  I was talking to my patriot supplier, great suppliers.
[2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:39.040]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:41.040]  It's the highest quality.
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:42.040]  They've got it.
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:46.040]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service, get some
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:48.040]  air before you get sucked back down.
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:50.040]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:53.040]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[2:49:53.040 --> 2:49:58.040]  80 percent's offense, but I've always been 100 percent offense, trying to fully, you
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:00.040]  know, stop the globalists, and we've given them a good run.
[2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:05.040]  And I think down the road they'll be defeated, but we are going to still go down the hard
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:06.040]  road now.
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:10.040]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this,
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:12.040]  but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:14.040]  You need to get high quality, storeable food.
[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:15.040]  It's something you need.
[2:50:15.040 --> 2:50:18.040]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast.
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:19.040]  The 360 wins.
[2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:21.040]  So please take care of your storable foods.
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:26.040]  Needs at mfullwars.com and get your orders in now so you get it, so you have it.
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:27.040]  It's in great containers.
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:28.040]  High quality.
[2:50:28.040 --> 2:50:32.040]  Last 25 years, get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:36.040]  may see nothing yet.
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:52.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:56.040]  You know, the great part about my job is they ain't seen nothing yet.
[2:50:56.040 --> 2:51:03.040]  I get to know folks like Matt Drudge and Donald Trump and Larry Pinckney and Ron Paul and
[2:51:03.040 --> 2:51:07.040]  Rand Paul and everybody else.
[2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:10.040]  All right, we are back live.
[2:51:10.040 --> 2:51:14.040]  Laura Loomer's coming up.
[2:51:14.040 --> 2:51:27.040]  And then who takes over after that?
[2:51:27.040 --> 2:51:34.040]  John Rappaport's ready to go.
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:36.040]  Roger Stone is starting to break his silence.
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:46.040]  He reportedly has to report to federal prison next Tuesday, and it's seven days left to
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:48.040]  count down to deep state death sentence.
[2:51:48.040 --> 2:51:52.040]  And a lot of folks have been asking Roger, did he get special treatment?
[2:51:52.040 --> 2:51:54.040]  They've been spinning it.
[2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:56.040]  Well, he went ahead and told it all.
[2:51:56.040 --> 2:52:01.040]  He fell on his sword and spilled his guts and sang like a canary.
[2:52:01.040 --> 2:52:08.040]  So here's Roger Stone setting the record straight that he did get special treatment.
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:09.040]  There it is.
[2:52:09.040 --> 2:52:11.040]  This is Roger Stone.
[2:52:11.040 --> 2:52:17.040]  Former Hillary Clinton lawyer Aaron Zelinski, now posing as a non-political career line
[2:52:17.040 --> 2:52:23.040]  prosecutor, is testifying to the House Judiciary Committee today that I received special treatment
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:25.040]  in my recent prosecution.
[2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:26.040]  He's right.
[2:52:26.040 --> 2:52:32.040]  When the FBI shows up at your house at 6 a.m. with 29 heavily armed agents to rouse you
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:36.040]  out of bed for the CNN cameras, that's very special.
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:42.040]  When Comey, Brennan, Clapper, McCabe and others lie to Congress, but only you are indicted
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:45.040]  for lying to Congress, that's special too.
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:52.040]  And now with Michael Avenatti, Michael Cohn and Rick Gates move from prison to home confinement
[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:57.040]  because of the dangers of coronavirus, yet Roger Stone is ordered to go to a prison where
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:00.040]  my life would be in danger from COVID-19.
[2:53:00.040 --> 2:53:02.040]  That's special too.
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:03.040]  He's absolutely right.
[2:53:03.040 --> 2:53:09.040]  But the only politicization of my case was by Mr. Zelinski and the gang of four who are
[2:53:09.040 --> 2:53:14.040]  not non-political career line prosecutors, but ideologues aligned with Hillary Clinton
[2:53:14.040 --> 2:53:17.040]  or Barack Obama.
[2:53:17.040 --> 2:53:23.040]  Wow, this is shot video, Roger Stone admits to special treatment.
[2:53:23.040 --> 2:53:25.040]  Who would have thought it?
[2:53:25.040 --> 2:53:29.040]  All right, we're going to come back with Laura Loomer.
[2:53:29.040 --> 2:53:34.040]  He's running for Congress, being banned and demonized and so much more, but I'm going
[2:53:34.040 --> 2:53:36.040]  to throw this out here right now.
[2:53:36.040 --> 2:53:38.040]  I want to thank you all for keeping us in the fight.
[2:53:38.040 --> 2:53:42.040]  Plus, these are great products that everybody absolutely needs.
[2:53:42.040 --> 2:53:55.040]  X2, Ultra 12, Living Defense, Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, Rain Force Plus is even too
[2:53:55.040 --> 2:53:56.040]  strong for me to take.
[2:53:56.040 --> 2:54:00.040]  I mean, people ask me, not like a lawyer ask me once, are these products real?
[2:54:00.040 --> 2:54:02.040]  I said, is your mama real?
[2:54:02.040 --> 2:54:04.040]  What the hell do you think I'm doing here?
[2:54:04.040 --> 2:54:08.040]  There's all the fake people and there's me and there's you.
[2:54:08.040 --> 2:54:11.040]  Are you fake?
[2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:14.040]  I don't back down for nothing.
[2:54:14.040 --> 2:54:15.040]  Everybody knows that.
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:18.040]  I don't sell you products that are crap.
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:20.040]  I can get products for $2, $3 a bottle.
[2:54:20.040 --> 2:54:27.040]  Some of these products are $25, $30 a bottle because they're loaded.
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:29.040]  I take them.
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:32.040]  It's the best stuff on the market.
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:38.040]  And by the way, just selfishly, you think I give up my spiritual mojo to sell you crap.
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:42.040]  The money I get from crap sales is like a curse.
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:47.040]  The money I get from something honest is like green grass, beautiful mountains and little
[2:54:47.040 --> 2:54:48.040]  bluebirds singing.
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:55.040]  And you know why God made this guy so bluebirds wouldn't bump their heads.
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:55:04.040]  Seriously, folks, we got the 4th of July super sale starts now and Ultra 12, 50% off, been
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:10.040]  sold out for months now back in stock, winter sun plus vitamin D3 that you need period not

[2:55:12.040 --> 2:55:14.040]  It's essential for your cells to operate.
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:16.040]  Well, it's the highest quality sold out for months.

[2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:28.040]  needs for these uncertain times is to have that little box checked off to have that back
[2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:29.040]  up.
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:33.040]  That's back in stock only four weeks for delivery now in VolwarStore.com.
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:38.040]  All right, Laura Lumer running for Congress to respond to all the huge Internet censorship
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:42.040]  and more at an extremist gave her a donation.
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:43.040]  It's finally here.
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:48.040]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:53.040]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep
[2:55:53.040 --> 2:55:54.040]  earth crystal nascent iodine.
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:57.040]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:03.040]  Pryotary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7000
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:06.040]  feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:10.040]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:12.040]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:14.040]  I can personally feel the difference.
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:18.040]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:22.040]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function.
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:26.040]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:31.040]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[2:56:31.040 --> 2:56:32.040]  today.
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:37.040]  Get the new survival shield X2 spray for 33% off at infowarstore.com before we sell out
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:39.040]  of our new limited first shipment.
[2:56:39.040 --> 2:57:04.040]  That's infowarstore.com.
[2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:12.040]  Wake up boys, there's a light at the window.
[2:57:12.040 --> 2:57:17.040]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:26.040]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet and they whisper the word.
[2:57:26.040 --> 2:57:30.040]  But this is a communist revolution.
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:35.040]  Laura Loomer is here with us, Laura Loomer for congress.com.
[2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:39.040]  Whether she wins, loses or draws, some poll she's ahead, doesn't matter.
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:43.040]  She's taking action and going to be in the debates and engaging truth right there in
[2:57:43.040 --> 2:57:46.040]  that key district where my logo is.
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:50.040]  And so that's why I called her up today and I said I'm making my maximum donation for a
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:59.040]  congressional run of $2,800 from my personal account to Laura Loomer for what she's doing.
[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:02.040]  And so I hope other people support her.
[2:58:02.040 --> 2:58:07.040]  But I wanted to get her take just in general before I mail this off today, just on Carpe
[2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:10.040]  Duncan being banned, congress admitting its total censorship.
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:14.040]  Yeah, is Trump a day late, a month short?
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:16.040]  I mean, I want Trump to win.
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:17.040]  I think Trump's a great guy.
[2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:23.040]  But my god, you know, from Facebook to Twitter to Google, the censorship is just unbelievable,
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:24.040]  Laura.
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:26.040]  Yeah, well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:32.040]  And thank you so much for committing to make a max out donation to my campaign as a free
[2:58:32.040 --> 2:58:37.040]  speech hero, free speech warrior yourself, one of the first to be canceled by the cancel
[2:58:37.040 --> 2:58:38.040]  culture mob.
[2:58:38.040 --> 2:58:42.040]  Your donation really speaks volumes to what this battle, what this war we're up against
[2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:43.040]  is really all about.
[2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:45.040]  And look, it's not just President Trump.
[2:58:45.040 --> 2:58:50.040]  I think that the Republican Party as a whole is late to the table when it comes to the
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:52.040]  issue of big tech social media censorship.
[2:58:52.040 --> 2:58:57.040]  I remember two years ago, Alex, when you and I were sitting next to each other in that hearing
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:59:04.040]  room, and it was Republicans who auctioned us off and didn't stand by us when we were
[2:59:04.040 --> 2:59:08.040]  confronting Jack Dorsey in Congress during the tech censorship hearing where he perjured
[2:59:08.040 --> 2:59:12.040]  himself along with Mark Zuckerberg and others like Sundar Pekai.
[2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:13.040]  It wasn't Democrats.
[2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:14.040]  It was Republicans.
[2:59:14.040 --> 2:59:17.040]  And we've been warning them about what was coming for years.
[2:59:17.040 --> 2:59:19.040]  You and I have been screaming at the top of our lungs.
[2:59:19.040 --> 2:59:25.040]  Alex, other people like Milo and Gavin McGinnis have as well about this tech censorship and
[2:59:25.040 --> 2:59:29.040]  election interference that we predicted for the last four years.
[2:59:29.040 --> 2:59:31.040]  And nothing has been done about it.
[2:59:31.040 --> 2:59:36.040]  Several years ago, Republicans had the presidency, the Senate and the House, and they could have
[2:59:36.040 --> 2:59:37.040]  taken action.
[2:59:37.040 --> 2:59:43.040]  But unfortunately, we are looking and experiencing right now the consequences of inaction.
[2:59:43.040 --> 2:59:44.040]  By the way, let's talk about that.
[2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:46.040]  You and I are in there two years ago.
[2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:49.040]  Jack Dorsey's are saying we don't censor, we don't.
[2:59:49.040 --> 2:59:50.320]  The sky isn't blue.
[2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:58.640]  And then like this porcupic guy does this auctioning... to talk over you and you're
[2:59:58.640 --> 3:00:01.320]  like, Trump, do something, they're going to censor you next, it's terrible.
[3:00:01.320 --> 3:00:03.540]  They're like, that's ridiculous on the news.
[3:00:03.540 --> 3:00:04.760]  No one censored anybody.
[3:00:04.760 --> 3:00:06.480]  Here's the video.
[3:00:06.480 --> 3:00:11.160]  Oh, we don't have audio?
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:14.040]  Well, maybe we'll have it a little while.
[3:00:14.040 --> 3:00:15.040]  more, please continue.
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:16.040]  Right.
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:20.840]  So you can watch that video, and that's a video I posted to my parlor account last night
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:24.640]  to remind people that this has already been said.
[3:00:24.640 --> 3:00:29.960]  It was pretty prophetic, everything I predicted while, you know, confronting Jack Dorsey in
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:33.800]  a congressional meeting two years ago came true.
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:37.880]  And I made a personal plea to President Trump, and now President Trump himself is being censored.
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:44.240]  You see the way that Twitter now has literally become a recruitment tool and a propaganda
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:48.840]  tool for these Marxist jihadists who are leading a cultural insurrection in our country to
[3:00:48.840 --> 3:00:53.520]  overthrow the Constitution and all things good and American.
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:56.440]  And so that's, you know, that's why we eat fighters like me in Congress.
[3:00:56.440 --> 3:01:00.400]  We need people who are going to have the balls to take these people on.
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:02.240]  And there's no time for writing letters.
[3:01:02.240 --> 3:01:03.880]  There's no time for being nice.
[3:01:03.880 --> 3:01:08.880]  There's no time for sitting back and hoping that someday the left is going to be civilized
[3:01:08.880 --> 3:01:14.600]  because they are never going to get the decency required to participate in civil discourse
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:16.680]  and be civilized human beings.
[3:01:16.680 --> 3:01:20.040]  These people are hell bent on seeing the destruction of our country.
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:25.400]  And I don't know if you saw last night, AOC's election results, but she won in a landslide.
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:26.400]  Okay.
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:30.440]  And it was Republicans and Democrats who pumped millions of dollars into the race to try
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:32.840]  to defeat her in the primary Alex.
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:33.840]  Okay.
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:37.720]  We are being swept in this nation by a communist wave and we need the counter.
[3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:38.720]  Exactly.
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:39.720]  There's a communist wave.
[3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:42.280]  Laura Loomer warns of communist wave.
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:44.160]  And people want radicalism.
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:45.520]  They want aggression.
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:46.520]  We're being attacked.
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:50.400]  We're all milk-toes and scared and let's kneel and let's bow.
[3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:51.800]  That encourages this.
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:56.400]  We need Trump to like flamethrow and call on the enemy and attack them.
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:01:57.400]  And we need Americana.
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:01:59.760]  Well, we do have the clip ready with audio now.
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:00.760]  Here it is two years ago.
[3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:01.760]  You warning Trump.
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:02.760]  What is that?
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:03.760]  Regal order.
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:04.760]  Order.
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:11.760]  Because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election to sway the election.
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:12.760]  What's she saying?
[3:02:12.760 --> 3:02:13.760]  I can't understand her.
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:14.760]  What?
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:15.760]  You'll be elected.
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:16.760]  That is why she's entering in shadow.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:17.760]  How about it then?
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:18.760]  12 and a half, 15.
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:19.760]  Seven and a half, $20.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:21.760]  Two and a half, $7 and a half, $30.
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:22.760]  Half $30 down here.
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:23.760]  Two and a half, $35.
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:24.760]  Seven and a half, $40.
[3:02:24.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  Half $40.
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:26.760]  Two and a half, $45.
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:27.760]  Seven and a half, $50.
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:28.760]  Half $50 down here.
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:29.760]  Two and a half.
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:31.760]  Officer, will you escort this young lady out, please?
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:33.760]  Get two and a half, $5.
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:34.760]  $75.
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:35.760]  Half $70.
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:36.760]  But two and a half, $5.
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:37.760]  $75.
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:38.760]  Seven and a half, $80.
[3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:39.760]  $85.
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:40.760]  $85.
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:41.760]  $90.
[3:02:41.760 --> 3:02:42.760]  And $100.
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:43.760]  A $100.
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:44.760]  A $10.
[3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:45.760]  A $14.
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:46.760]  A $14.
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:47.760]  A $14.
[3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:48.760]  A $14.
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:49.760]  They shut it down and make a joke about it.
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:50.760]  Or a totally sickening.
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:53.960]  Yeah, at Israel sickening because the same people, Alex, who are getting banned today, the same
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:57.600]  people who are being shut down, I remember when they were mocking me and you.
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:01.000]  Remember when they were laughing at us when, when you got, I think you got into a couple
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:05.200]  with a few MSNBC reporters and people were saying, oh, look, it's the crackpots who showed
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:10.800]  up to Congress today to, to scream about this conspiracy theory called censorship of conservatives.
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:13.120]  They're like, no one even censored them.
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:14.120]  It's made up.
[3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:18.440]  Oh, well, maybe if they weren't so controversial, maybe they'd still have their accounts.
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:20.920]  Well, are they going to say the same thing about President Trump?
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:25.040]  Are they going to say the same thing about Carpe Duncan or Rakhine Cassom or, you know,
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:28.520]  their everyday American who is simply just posting facts?
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:32.400]  It is now hate speech, Alex, to post facts.
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:39.600]  It is now hate speech to simply exist as a freedom-loving American in this country.
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:45.400]  If you do not embrace and endorse the Marxist-Jahadist agenda, you have no social media, according
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  to these tyrants.
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:50.320]  I mean, all you got to do is look at the Twitter bio, look at what, what Twitter made as the
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:52.440]  hashtags in their official account.
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:56.760]  Hashtag black lies matter, hashtag black trans lies matter, hashtag black queer lies matter.
[3:03:56.760 --> 3:03:57.760]  Okay.
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:03.440]  Jack Dorsey, encouraging Antifa terrorists and BLM, you know, disruptors to basically.
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:07.320]  Well, if Congress would have acted years ago, they could have beaten us.
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:10.440]  But big techs bigger than the government, bigger than Congress.
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:13.320]  Libertarians go, oh, don't mess, it's a government.
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:18.920]  Big tech surveils me, controls me, locks my bank accounts, doesn't let you get an Airbnb,
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:20.520]  doesn't let you get an Uber.
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:23.320]  This is, if Hitler had this, he would have won.
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:24.840]  And they just do it.
[3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:25.840]  And they do it.
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:26.840]  And they do it.
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:31.640]  And now Congress finally figures out they're being taken over, but is it too late?
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:37.600]  Well, I think, I think that this election, more so than any other election in our country's
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:41.720]  history is going to determine whether or not America succeeds and continues to live or
[3:04:41.720 --> 3:04:44.320]  America fails as a nation as we know it.
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:47.960]  We can't allow for the communists to gain a stronghold in our country.
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:48.960]  Okay.
[3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:51.000]  We're just trying to cancel Jesus Christ.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  I don't know if you saw this.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:57.560]  I was going to raise it info wars.com left now calls for statues of Jesus to be pulled
[3:04:57.560 --> 3:04:59.040]  down because he's white.
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:03.560]  So whiteness or I guess Jewishness itself is now not allowed.
[3:05:03.560 --> 3:05:04.560]  Yeah.
[3:05:04.560 --> 3:05:10.600]  Well, look, we have one more shot, Alex, one more chance on this planet, one more chance
[3:05:10.600 --> 3:05:13.720]  in our lifetime, in your children's lifetime and your grandchildren's life.
[3:05:13.720 --> 3:05:14.720]  Oh, no, I agree.
[3:05:14.720 --> 3:05:19.600]  Right now, we're going to live like in Russia under communist for 50 years.
[3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:20.600]  Yeah.
[3:05:20.600 --> 3:05:24.600]  And look, we see the way that big tech is actually partnering with the Chinese government
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:26.120]  and you mentioned Hitler.
[3:05:26.120 --> 3:05:27.960]  Well, what is Hitler well known for?
[3:05:27.960 --> 3:05:32.320]  Well, subjecting Jewish people to concentration camps, the big tech social media companies
[3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:38.640]  are getting a lot of their manufacturing done in China, who is putting Muslim leaders into
[3:05:38.640 --> 3:05:40.040]  concentration camps.
[3:05:40.040 --> 3:05:44.800]  So first it starts with the censorship and the debanking and the ostracization and the
[3:05:44.800 --> 3:05:51.080]  blacklisting and and the Chinese social credits for we're facing the new Hitler.
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:55.040]  And not to be a little Hitler, but this is bigger, not to be a little the bad things
[3:05:55.040 --> 3:05:56.040]  Hitler did.
[3:05:56.040 --> 3:05:57.280]  I'm saying this is bigger.
[3:05:57.280 --> 3:05:58.280]  China is a bigger threat.
[3:05:58.280 --> 3:06:01.880]  I mean, they've killed more people with Hitler and they're literally in our lives.
[3:06:01.880 --> 3:06:04.720]  Well, and look, I'm a Jewish woman.
[3:06:04.720 --> 3:06:09.360]  And when you look at comparisons between the Holocaust and you look at Nazis, right?
[3:06:09.360 --> 3:06:12.680]  We look at six million Jews who were who were killed.
[3:06:12.680 --> 3:06:15.880]  But communism has killed over 100 million people.
[3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:20.480]  And so I don't understand why the left thinks, oh, well, it's such a slur to call somebody
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:21.480]  a Nazi.
[3:06:21.480 --> 3:06:24.400]  Yeah, you obviously don't want to be called a Nazi or be known as a Nazi.
[3:06:24.400 --> 3:06:25.400]  Exactly.
[3:06:25.400 --> 3:06:26.560]  The chai comms, the biggest murderers ever.
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:28.520]  Laura Loomer for Congress dot com.
[3:06:28.520 --> 3:06:30.600]  I've killed more people.
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:34.600]  So I don't know why it's okay to suddenly call yourself an open communist.
[3:06:34.600 --> 3:06:35.600]  No, I agree.
[3:06:35.600 --> 3:06:39.560]  It's like saying you're a Nazi, come back and join us again soon.
[3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:40.960]  Laura Loomer for Congress dot com.
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:43.520]  I'm always excited about info wars life products.
[3:06:43.520 --> 3:06:44.520]  They're amazing.
[3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:45.520]  They're cutting edge.
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:46.520]  You love them.
[3:06:46.520 --> 3:06:47.520]  I love them.
[3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:49.560]  And they found the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:06:54.680]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[3:06:54.680 --> 3:06:56.160]  That is amazing.
[3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:03.920]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:08.200]  And there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[3:07:08.200 --> 3:07:14.440]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[3:07:14.440 --> 3:07:15.760]  it in a really great way.
[3:07:15.760 --> 3:07:19.000]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:23.880]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes, but I just love it personally
[3:07:23.880 --> 3:07:26.160]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[3:07:26.160 --> 3:07:27.960]  So this is a real innovation.
[3:07:27.960 --> 3:07:32.040]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[3:07:32.040 --> 3:07:35.880]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:37.800]  It's so refreshing.
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:40.840]  This is a big winner.
[3:07:40.840 --> 3:07:44.600]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:48.760]  Coffee and energy drinks provide a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[3:07:48.760 --> 3:07:53.120]  That's why we created a Mixable Energy Formula to take on the go, Turbo Force.
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:58.480]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used across the
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:02.360]  globe to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:06.920]  Turbo Force is a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:11.360]  Try adding this to your daily routine and revolutionize your day today.
[3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:15.000]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:18.880]  The Electropure Pro Water Filtration System is the same water filter that Alex and the
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:22.080]  Info Wars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:25.400]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:26.400]  water.
[3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:29.680]  If you have any preppers or anyone concerned with a healthier source of water, the Electropure
[3:08:29.680 --> 3:08:33.080]  Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:37.360]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:44.680]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Electropure Pro.
[3:08:44.680 --> 3:09:12.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:17.360]  Here he goes, ladies and gentlemen, the guy who's had his people so long without censoring
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:22.360]  and they lied to Congress that you'd be arrested just like that Chinese spy got arrested in
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:23.360]  Canada two weeks ago.
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:28.360]  It's all that you can do to get your picture out of this trash.
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:29.360]  Shun D'Art.
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:30.360]  You know you're not Americans.
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:32.360]  You can't work with Congress Chinese.
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:33.360]  You can't work with Congress Chinese, Shun D'Art.
[3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:38.360]  You can't work with Congress Chinese on brand-new plot censoring and rounding up your business.
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:45.360]  Shun D'Art is arresting dissidents of China.
[3:09:45.360 --> 3:09:49.360]  Apple's working with China to suppress their people.
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:51.360]  Shun D'Art, you're engaged in treason.
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:55.360]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress and you're not censoring conservatives.
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:09:58.360]  Shun D'Art, you will not silence the people.
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:02.360]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Shun D'Art.
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:06.360]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your
[3:10:06.360 --> 3:10:08.360]  coverage results.
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:10.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:12.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:13.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:15.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:16.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:17.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:18.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:31.360]  Google is evil.
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:34.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:41.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:10:44.880 --> 3:10:51.920]  Okay, here we are again. Big news today. Soil and green is people.
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:57.760]  COVID-19 is old people. That's the headline.
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:11:01.640]  And this is the story.
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:10.720]  Nursing homes. What is happening in nursing homes?
[3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:16.440]  People dying in nursing homes. All over the world.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:21.640]  I want to give you some figures. I'm going to be reading some stats here.
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:25.560]  So listen up. Do not go anywhere.
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:32.400]  This is May 22, Forbes. In the 43 states that currently report such figures,
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:40.360]  an astounding 42% of all COVID-19 deaths have taken place in nursing homes
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:45.000]  and assisted living facilities. Washington Post May 18.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:51.280]  The World Health Organization said half of Europe's COVID-19 deaths occurred
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:55.720]  in such facilities have. Headline of the same post article.
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:12:02.880]  Canada's nursing home crisis, 81% of coronavirus deaths in the country
[3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:08.320]  are in long-term care facilities. 81. The Guardian, May 16.
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:14.440]  About 90% of the 3,700 people who've died from coronavirus in Sweden
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:19.520]  were over 70 and half were living in care homes, according to a study
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:22.120]  from Sweden's National Board of Health, et cetera.
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:27.640]  Spain, shocked at the end of March when the Defense Minister revealed
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:32.880]  that soldiers drafted in to disinfect residential nursing homes
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:37.760]  had found some elderly people abandoned and dead in their beds.
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:44.240]  In Madrid, the total for COVID or suspected COVID death since March 8
[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:51.240]  stood at 5,886 on Thursday. In Catalonia, it was 3,375.
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:56.480]  Between them, care home deaths in the two regions account for more
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:00.920]  than a third of all the coronavirus deaths in the country.
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:06.560]  The Guardian, April 13. About half of all COVID-19 deaths
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:11.160]  appear to be happening in care homes in some European countries.
[3:13:11.160 --> 3:13:15.880]  They name Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, and Belgium.
[3:13:16.600 --> 3:13:18.480]  Getting the picture.
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:24.320]  Getting the picture.
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:29.720]  OK, now here's the inside story.
[3:13:31.400 --> 3:13:35.000]  How are these people being diagnosed with COVID-19?
[3:13:36.720 --> 3:13:40.040]  Well, some of them are just being coded COVID-19
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:44.240]  after they die. And, of course, they're dying from other causes.
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:46.120]  So that's ridiculous.
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:52.640]  Then you have the people that are diagnosed as COVID-19 by eyeball alone.
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:57.440]  Oh, they have the general symptoms, which are vague and flu-like
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:01.040]  and so on and pneumonia-ish and so on and so on.
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:07.240]  COVID-19. Ridiculous, absurd, unscientific, stupid, criminal.
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:09.680]  Then you have the people who are actually tested.
[3:14:10.040 --> 3:14:13.200]  And as I've discussed here and in other places,
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:18.520]  maybe a thousand times by now, the tests are worthless and ridiculous.
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:22.240]  Talking about the PCR and the antibody tests,
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:27.240]  they spit out false positives like coins from rig slot machines.
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:31.560]  That's what they are designed basically to do,
[3:14:31.560 --> 3:14:33.360]  although nobody will admit that.
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:37.320]  So it's very easy, in other words, to give somebody a test and say,
[3:14:37.320 --> 3:14:40.280]  oh, you're positive, therefore, you have COVID-19.
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:47.280]  So to say that people in these nursing homes are really COVID-19,
[3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:52.520]  they have the virus is complete crap, complete crap.
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:56.520]  What is the actual story?
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:14:59.080]  They're old.
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:04.480]  They have multiple health problems sending back years and years and years.
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:10.560]  They've been treated for years and years with toxic medical drugs.
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:19.360]  They are now the new factors, terrified at the possibility
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:22.600]  that they will be diagnosed with COVID-19.
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:26.080]  Then they are diagnosed with COVID-19.
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:30.160]  Then they are diagnosed, and they're even more terrified.
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:34.720]  And then on top of that, they're isolated and alone,
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:37.480]  cut off from the world,
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:41.920]  cut off from family and friends who may not visit them.
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:44.680]  And they die.
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:50.400]  Many patient advocacy groups have already said
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:54.480]  that the main monitor on what is happening in these
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:59.240]  nursing homes, where the treatment is often very indifferent,
[3:15:59.240 --> 3:16:02.600]  very unkind, sometimes brutal.
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:07.160]  The best way to monitor all that is through friends and family
[3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:10.960]  of the residents themselves, because they come in frequently,
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:14.720]  they look around, they check on things, they see what's happening
[3:16:15.240 --> 3:16:19.560]  to their family, they won't take any nonsense from the staff.
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:22.680]  They're gone, all gone.
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:23.680]  All gone.
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:30.480]  If you don't think that the situation that I described adds
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:32.600]  up to death, you're crazy.
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:35.640]  That's exactly what it adds up to.
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:40.280]  Has nothing to do with the virus, has nothing to do with COVID-19,
[3:16:40.680 --> 3:16:45.520]  but it has a great deal to do with pumping up and hijacking
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:49.720]  and jacking up case numbers to make it appear that this is a
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:56.040]  worldwide pandemic. If you subtracted all of the people
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:17:01.040]  around the world, elderly people who are dying of the effects
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:06.920]  of this murderous operation from the COVID statistics,
[3:17:07.640 --> 3:17:11.680]  the truth would be exposed in an hour and the whole thing
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:15.240]  would be seen to be a complete fraud and a fake.
[3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:19.680]  And there is much more, because it's not just the nursing homes,
[3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:22.800]  it's the hospitals, it's the lonely apartments,
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:25.120]  it's the ventilators that are killing people.
[3:17:26.640 --> 3:17:31.120]  We have to add in all of that as well in order to see what
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:35.120]  the staggering fraudulence about statistics are, and we will
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:37.600]  after the break, do not go anywhere.
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:40.880]  I told you this five months ago, and now it's official.
[3:17:40.880 --> 3:17:44.040]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and the U.S.
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:47.680]  Permanent, the psychological war chiefs that developed the
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:51.880]  COVID-19 mine control hoax knew that once they got the public
[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:54.840]  for several months to wear masks in social distance, they
[3:17:54.840 --> 3:17:57.640]  would be able to permanently turn it on and off at any time
[3:17:57.640 --> 3:18:01.240]  they want by putting handcuffs on someone and then add new
[3:18:01.240 --> 3:18:04.160]  demands that people take force inoculations, that they have
[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:07.320]  contact tracing on their phones and that every aspect of our
[3:18:07.320 --> 3:18:11.000]  lives be controlled. This is all complete and total preparation
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:14.120]  for world government, forced inoculation, and complete
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:16.360]  enslavement of the human population.
[3:18:16.360 --> 3:18:18.240]  This is medical tyranny.
[3:18:18.240 --> 3:18:21.080]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates UN Takeover.
[3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:23.240]  This is the end of civilization.
[3:18:23.240 --> 3:18:27.320]  As you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:30.360]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much
[3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:33.000]  time. Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:35.560]  Show them the numbers, show them the facts, and explain
[3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:37.680]  that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:47.680]  up and resist.
[3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:50.680]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[3:18:50.680 --> 3:18:56.680]  Where did it come from?

[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:32.680]  tyranny, take action and say no to the COVID-19 lockdown
[3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:35.680]  martial law. We're breaking it all down. Have the facts posted
[3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:38.680]  at wecan'tbreath.news.
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:21:00.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:09.680]  We're looking for something I couldn't find anywhere.
[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:13.680]  John Rappaport back here, so you remember the film 1973
[3:21:13.680 --> 3:21:19.680]  Soylent Green, New York police detective discovers that in a
[3:21:19.680 --> 3:21:26.680]  crowded, polluted, demented city of New York, people are
[3:21:26.680 --> 3:21:30.680]  eating government processed food called Soylent and the latest
[3:21:30.680 --> 3:21:34.680]  version is called Soylent Green and what he finally discovers
[3:21:34.680 --> 3:21:41.680]  at the end is, as he says, Soylent Green is people.
[3:21:41.680 --> 3:21:45.680]  The government is processing dead people and that's the food
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.680]  that everybody in New York is eating and COVID-19 is old
[3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:53.680]  people. They're killing old people and that's how they're
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:57.680]  jacking up the statistics and that's how they're also, if you
[3:21:57.680 --> 3:22:02.680]  want to follow some money here, think about all of the
[3:22:02.680 --> 3:22:06.680]  government and private insurers around the world who are
[3:22:06.680 --> 3:22:11.680]  paying out untold amounts of money in long term care for
[3:22:11.680 --> 3:22:15.680]  these people in residential nursing homes year after year
[3:22:15.680 --> 3:22:18.680]  after year and now don't have to pay any of that money
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:22.680]  because they're dying early deaths, premature deaths.
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:26.680]  Now you see a money figure that is staggering.
[3:22:26.680 --> 3:22:30.680]  That's a sidebar, but it's an important sidebar.
[3:22:30.680 --> 3:22:33.680]  So now I want to read something else to you because we're
[3:22:33.680 --> 3:22:38.680]  adding up the old people that are being killed here, which
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:43.680]  is COVID-19 essentially. That's what it is.
[3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:47.680]  It's not a virus. It's not this. It's not that.
[3:22:47.680 --> 3:22:53.680]  This is what it is. So I described nursing homes.
[3:22:53.680 --> 3:22:59.680]  Now here from the Hill late April 2020, they're talking
[3:22:59.680 --> 3:23:04.680]  about a study done, a data gathered at Northwell Health,
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:08.680]  New York State's largest hospital system.
[3:23:08.680 --> 3:23:11.680]  Study was published in Journal of America Medical Association,
[3:23:11.680 --> 3:23:17.680]  examined 5,700 patients, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:20.680]  Okay. Here's the kicker.
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:26.680]  For the next oldest age group, 66 and older, patients
[3:23:26.680 --> 3:23:30.680]  receiving mechanical ventilation, that's breathing
[3:23:30.680 --> 3:23:40.680]  ventilation, recorded a 97.2% mortality rate end quote.
[3:23:40.680 --> 3:23:51.680]  You get that? 97.2% in this hospital system, older
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:55.680]  than 66 years old, put it on breathing ventilators,
[3:23:55.680 --> 3:24:00.680]  died, dead. Oh, well, because they were early very ill
[3:24:00.680 --> 3:24:04.680]  with COVID and no, no, no, no, you don't get those figures.
[3:24:04.680 --> 3:24:10.680]  97.2% on that explanation.
[3:24:10.680 --> 3:24:13.680]  Sorry, go back to mommy's basement and start blogging
[3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:19.680]  some more about science. That isn't it.
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:23.680]  They're killing them. They're killing them with ventilators
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:27.680]  and heavy, heavy sedation.
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:31.680]  So now we come to the rest of it.
[3:24:31.680 --> 3:24:35.680]  Old people, not in nursing homes, but the ones who
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:39.680]  managed to make it to hospitals.
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:43.680]  A huge number of people around the world.
[3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:48.680]  Already ill for decades, multiple serious health
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:52.680]  conditions, immune system teetering on the edge of
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:58.680]  collapse, living with it, okay, treated with toxic
[3:24:58.680 --> 3:25:04.680]  medical drugs for decades, chronically low oxygen levels,
[3:25:04.680 --> 3:25:06.680]  but they're living with it.
[3:25:06.680 --> 3:25:13.680]  But now, now the new thing terrified out of their minds
[3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:19.680]  by the potential that they quote have the COVID-19 virus.
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:22.680]  They get to the chaos of a hospital.
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:25.680]  They are coded COVID-19.
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:30.680]  Boom, either eyeball diagnosis or these worthless
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:32.680]  diagnostic tests.
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:38.680]  Now, they're put on breathing ventilators, sedated,
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:43.680]  cut off completely, isolated from friends and family,
[3:25:43.680 --> 3:25:46.680]  and they die. What else would you expect?
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:49.680]  I mean, what else would you expect?
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:51.680]  Let's get real, okay?
[3:25:51.680 --> 3:25:55.680]  What else do you think is going to happen to people?
[3:25:55.680 --> 3:25:59.680]  Imagine if you were old, old, old, and your immune
[3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:02.680]  system was teetering on the edge of collapse, and you had
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:07.680]  multiple health conditions for 10, 15, 20 years, and you
[3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:11.680]  were treated by doctors with toxic medical drugs.
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:15.680]  And now, all of a sudden, you're terrorized by the
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:20.680]  propaganda wall-to-wall intentional, mind control
[3:26:20.680 --> 3:26:24.680]  mass, mind control day after day, COVID, COVID, COVID,
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:28.680]  COVID, COVID, you manage to make it to a hospital,
[3:26:28.680 --> 3:26:31.680]  and there you are diagnosed.
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:36.680]  What do you think is going to happen to you?
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:38.680]  Oh, well, fear doesn't really kill you.
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:40.680]  No, you don't think so.
[3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:44.680]  Terror on top of all that doesn't kill people.
[3:26:44.680 --> 3:26:47.680]  Go back to mommy's basement and blog some more.
[3:26:47.680 --> 3:26:50.680]  You're schmuck.
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:56.680]  This is a world crisis intentionally being imposed.
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:02.680]  The huge numbers of old people being killed is COVID-19.
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:04.680]  That's what it is.
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:10.680]  If you subtracted all of those numbers, untold numbers
[3:27:10.680 --> 3:27:19.680]  from the fake statistics that are already being rigged,
[3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:24.680]  the whole game would be exposed overnight.
[3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:30.680]  The whole vicious, cruel, disgusting, devastating
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:38.680]  lockdown, bankruptcy, poverty, starvation in so-called
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:42.680]  third-world countries and even in so-called developed
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:46.680]  countries, the whole thing would be exposed completely.
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:50.680]  COVID-19 is old people being murdered.
[3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:57.680]  That's the story.
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:27:59.680]  They're doing it.
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:00.680]  Oh, we didn't know.
[3:28:00.680 --> 3:28:01.680]  We're learning.
[3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:02.680]  No, you're not.
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:04.680]  You're not learning anything.
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:07.680]  You're killing people.
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:13.680]  Minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, it goes on.
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:18.680]  And if the whole thing were exposed, as I say,
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:22.680]  what would be the next domino to fall?
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:27.680]  Well, that virus you all have been talking about
[3:28:27.680 --> 3:28:31.680]  and terrorizing us with, I guess that really doesn't amount
[3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:35.680]  to a hill of beans, really does it because you've been
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:39.680]  exploding and hustling and conning this fake pandemic
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:43.680]  on the backs of corpses of old people that you've been
[3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:49.680]  killing and when we remove that from the equation,
[3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:54.680]  we get nothing.
[3:28:54.680 --> 3:28:55.680]  That's true.
[3:28:55.680 --> 3:28:57.680]  We get no masks.
[3:28:57.680 --> 3:28:58.680]  We get no distancing.
[3:28:58.680 --> 3:28:59.680]  We get no lockdowns.
[3:28:59.680 --> 3:29:00.680]  We get no torture.
[3:29:00.680 --> 3:29:02.680]  We get no starvation.
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:03.680]  We get no bankruptcy.
[3:29:03.680 --> 3:29:06.680]  We get no people committing suicide because of the
[3:29:06.680 --> 3:29:12.680]  lockdowns and brutality among families and drug addiction
[3:29:12.680 --> 3:29:17.680]  and all of the rest does not happen.
[3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:23.680]  Fauci, Bill Gates, World Health Organization,
[3:29:23.680 --> 3:29:28.680]  World Economic Forum, all jockeying and planning
[3:29:28.680 --> 3:29:31.680]  and what they were really planning for in all of these
[3:29:31.680 --> 3:29:39.680]  exercises and drills is the structure of death,
[3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:42.680]  how it's going to account, how it's going to be arranged,
[3:29:42.680 --> 3:29:45.680]  how the message is going to be flooded,
[3:29:45.680 --> 3:29:49.680]  how the public health officials around the world
[3:29:49.680 --> 3:29:52.680]  are going to coordinate with the governors and the mayors
[3:29:52.680 --> 3:29:56.680]  and the prime ministers and the premiers and the presidents,
[3:29:56.680 --> 3:30:01.680]  the cowards who are going to knuckle under because it's
[3:30:01.680 --> 3:30:05.680]  medical, medical, medical, medical, medical.
[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:09.680]  The Rockefeller plan, the Gates plan,
[3:30:09.680 --> 3:30:11.680]  that's how it's being done.
[3:30:11.680 --> 3:30:13.680]  That was the plan.
[3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:16.680]  That's what all the exercises and drills were about,
[3:30:16.680 --> 3:30:21.680]  to coordinate the structure, propaganda, messaging,
[3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:27.680]  lockdowns before anything could happen,
[3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:30.680]  before anybody could turn around and say,
[3:30:30.680 --> 3:30:32.680]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3:30:32.680 --> 3:30:52.680]  wait, wait, we didn't do everything,
[3:30:52.680 --> 3:30:51.680]  we didn't do everything, we don't want the施
[3:30:51.680 --> 3:30:53.680]  people to stay down, they're in bad spirits,
[3:30:53.680 --> 3:30:56.680]  and being born, we don't want them that way.
[3:30:56.680 --> 3:30:59.680]  It's not until the next few days,
[3:30:59.680 --> 3:31:04.480]  US economy, while at the same time, covering up for the NIH and the UN, they're actually
[3:31:04.480 --> 3:31:10.040]  sending people with communicable diseases to nursing homes during COVID-19 to actually
[3:31:10.040 --> 3:31:11.600]  jack up numbers and kill people.
[3:31:11.600 --> 3:31:12.600]  We're breaking it all down.
[3:31:12.600 --> 3:31:18.320]  Have the facts posted at wecan'tbreath.news, the evidence, the nurses, the doctors, the
[3:31:18.320 --> 3:31:23.640]  scientists, the virologists, exposing that COVID-19 is a tyranny, is a hoax, and is a
[3:31:23.640 --> 3:31:24.640]  lie.
[3:31:24.640 --> 3:31:29.440]  Only the truth can set us free from this great lie, and the truth is posted right now and
[3:31:29.440 --> 3:31:33.400]  we need you to take action by spreading it at wecan'tbreath.news.
[3:31:33.400 --> 3:31:38.080]  For more information, go to wecan'tbreath.news today.
[3:31:38.080 --> 3:31:44.040]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two-plus million
[3:31:44.040 --> 3:31:49.560]  Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die, that we did not do exactly as they
[3:31:49.560 --> 3:31:50.560]  said.
[3:31:50.560 --> 3:31:55.400]  And it turned out it was all frauds, the models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting
[3:31:55.400 --> 3:31:59.200]  it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[3:31:59.200 --> 3:32:03.000]  But none of them are getting sued, none of them are getting prosecuted, none of them
[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:07.120]  are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down his factories that are
[3:32:07.120 --> 3:32:11.000]  making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:15.720]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and segment
[3:32:15.720 --> 3:32:20.960]  numbers spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's
[3:32:20.960 --> 3:32:21.960]  fault.
[3:32:21.960 --> 3:32:27.360]  Now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city, we've got to lock down again, everything's over.
[3:32:27.360 --> 3:32:30.640]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[3:32:30.640 --> 3:32:40.840]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it, your choice.

[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:45.080]  United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third world sectors of the
[3:33:45.080 --> 3:33:46.080]  world.
[3:33:46.080 --> 3:33:51.720]  Bill and Melinda Gates that control the UN WHO openly say they want to depopulate brown
[3:33:51.720 --> 3:33:52.720]  people.
[3:33:52.720 --> 3:33:59.440]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:04.240]  on the planet, and then lecture white people in America how they're bad to black people.
[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:08.920]  Now all over the world people are taking means and trying to overthrow police and put leptis
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:10.320]  in control.
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:13.440]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[3:34:13.440 --> 3:34:18.440]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer, leftists are evil and
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:23.960]  they divide and conquer people, but at the heart of them is a eugenics based depopulation
[3:34:23.960 --> 3:34:24.960]  operation.
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:30.240]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter and Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:32.440]  operation trying to topple statues?
[3:34:32.440 --> 3:34:34.560]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:42.320]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:35:09.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:26.000]  So now let me describe what could have happened and remember, COVID-19 is old people.
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:31.280]  Needing in the White House, Fauci is there.
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:38.200]  Well sir, we just have a new report in for the UK from the most famous computer modeler
[3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:44.160]  in the world, Neal Ferguson of the Imperial College of London, who predicts 500,000 deaths
[3:35:44.160 --> 3:35:47.720]  in the UK and 2 million in America.
[3:35:47.720 --> 3:35:53.200]  And the only conclusion we can reach is that state of emergency and we must have a national
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:54.200]  lockdown.
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:36:00.680]  We have to get the governors and the mayors on board and lock down country.
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:01.680]  Really?
[3:36:01.680 --> 3:36:02.680]  Yes sir.
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:03.680]  That's it.
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:10.600]  Otherwise, 2 million deaths are going to be on your head in America soon.
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:15.200]  Well, who else could be in the room?
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:17.760]  Who else could be in the room?
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:21.400]  Another scientist perhaps, two or three.
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:23.640]  Would that be excessive to say?
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:30.600]  I don't think so in a manner of momentous decision making like this.
[3:36:30.600 --> 3:36:37.560]  A few other scientists might be there to be turned to, well, what do you think?
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:44.560]  Well, we have some data on this man, Neal Ferguson, who just made the computer prediction.
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:45.560]  Really?
[3:36:45.560 --> 3:36:54.720]  He is the most famous, yeah, but you see actually, doctor or is it Mr. Fauci, he's a failed computer
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:36:56.920]  model.
[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:00.920]  He's an abysmal failure.
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:05.320]  None of his predictions come true.
[3:37:05.320 --> 3:37:07.840]  He's an ass.
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:11.480]  He's a total ass, sir.
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:12.480]  Really?
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:13.480]  I didn't know that.
[3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:14.480]  Explain.
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:18.320]  Well, for example, in 2005, bird flew, do you remember that one?
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:21.880]  So he said that 200 million people could die.
[3:37:21.880 --> 3:37:23.080]  Really?
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:24.080]  How many died?
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:32.960]  Well, official statistics, sir, said there was a few president looks at Fauci.
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:35.080]  Mr. Fauci, what do you have to say to that?
[3:37:35.080 --> 3:37:36.600]  Well, sir, I don't know.
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:40.400]  I mean, he's got a reputation as the most famous computer modeler in the world.
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:42.760]  I mean, what can I say?
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:44.480]  His colleagues think that he's the best.
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:45.920]  What do you mean his colleagues?
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:48.080]  You mean other computer modelers?
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:49.080]  Yes.
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:50.080]  Okay.
[3:37:50.080 --> 3:37:51.080]  Another scientist speaks up.
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:53.680]  Sir, I really have to say.
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:38:01.480]  I'm sorry to say, Mr. Fauci, but the complete profession of computer prediction is generally
[3:38:01.480 --> 3:38:10.360]  run by complete idiots, aggressive idiots who are pulling down paychecks for nothing
[3:38:10.360 --> 3:38:15.200]  at all because their models are always overplayed.
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:17.400]  They're always being paid for by somebody else.
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:23.600]  In this case, I should add, sir, that Neil Ferguson, his instituted imperial college is
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:27.880]  being bankrolled by Bill Gates for 10 million or so a year.
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:28.880]  Really?
[3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:29.880]  I didn't know that.
[3:38:29.880 --> 3:38:30.880]  Yes, sir.
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:31.880]  That's right.
[3:38:31.880 --> 3:38:38.080]  Well, Mr. Fauci, it looks like maybe we have a mistake here, that maybe we shouldn't lock
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:45.720]  down the entire nation for whatever it is, three months or so, and destroy the economy
[3:38:45.720 --> 3:38:54.720]  and kill off huge numbers of people with that economic tactic, nothing to do with the virus,
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:39:03.640]  just on the basis of you, Mr. Fauci, saying that this potato head, Neil Ferguson, is famous
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:05.680]  as a computer modeler.
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:10.640]  Now, also in the room in this momentous meeting in the White House, you would think there
[3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:20.040]  would be a couple of economic experts who would say, you know, on their computer, little
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:31.480]  calculator, excuse me, sir, sir, yes, what Mr. Fauci is suggesting here, let me run it
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:33.640]  down for you.
[3:39:33.640 --> 3:39:40.600]  If we were to lock down the national economy for, say, three months, we would be talking
[3:39:40.600 --> 3:39:50.440]  roughly 50 million people unemployed, stock market, of course, just outget it.
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:57.680]  And if I may mention, your legacy as the president of the economy to, you know, make America
[3:39:57.680 --> 3:40:03.840]  great again through the economy would be a complete and utter devastating failure.
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:12.640]  Now, that's just the beginning, because I would predict that the bailout, because we
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:16.800]  would have to have a bailout, sir, I mean, you just can't let all these, you know, we're
[3:40:16.800 --> 3:40:21.600]  talking about locking down businesses, big businesses, small businesses, all businesses,
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:28.840]  cities, you know what I'm saying here, sir, understand what lockdown actually means, what
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:31.280]  it means?
[3:40:31.280 --> 3:40:38.240]  Less numbers of bankruptcies, right, complete and utter bank, I mean, boarded up cities,
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:44.320]  a great city of New York, your cities are, I mean, it would just be desolate.
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:46.120]  That's what we're talking about.
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:57.560]  So in order to stave off mass starvation, and I don't know, possible mass revolution
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:05.240]  to overthrow the government, you would have to bail out all of these people, which means
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:10.240]  basically everybody, sir, everybody, yes, sir, everybody.
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:13.240]  Well, how much is that going to cost?
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:18.760]  Because, you know, I've said already that I'm authorizing $2 billion, but if Congress
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:24.040]  wants $6 billion, that's okay with these, no, no, no, sir, I'm sorry.
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:28.000]  That's not even remotely in the ballpark, that's chump change.
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:39.520]  We're talking about maybe $5 trillion, yes, sir, $5 trillion, where are we going to get
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:41.160]  that kind of money?
[3:41:41.160 --> 3:41:44.360]  Well, basically, reinvent it.
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:45.360]  Really?
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.000]  How does that work?
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:52.760]  Well, that's a complicated subject for another time, sir, but the point is, it would be a
[3:41:52.760 --> 3:41:57.000]  disaster, a complete and utter disaster.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:06.760]  Just imagine rubble everywhere, so to speak, in what was the economy, rubble, the people
[3:42:06.760 --> 3:42:14.320]  wearing masks, walking like robots down the empty, deserted streets, businesses boarded
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:21.600]  up everywhere, people walking six feet apart because, you know, this is what the whole
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:28.960]  program is supposed to be now, isolated from each other, and that wall-to-wall surveillance
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:34.680]  of the population, I mean, sir.
[3:42:34.680 --> 3:42:41.360]  I don't know whether Mr. Fauci knows what he is presenting here and what he's recommending
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:50.640]  on the back of a completely failed, as we say, underlying failed computer modeler, one
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:43:01.320]  idiot at the Imperial College in London, page four by Bill Gates, sir.
[3:43:01.320 --> 3:43:08.000]  You've been calling fake news, fake news, ever since you campaigned for the presidency.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:19.200]  I know it's tough, I know it would take humongous balls to do this now, but I mean, I'm afraid
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:24.960]  you've got to because I know, excuse me, sir, Mr. Fauci, but I know you and I know that
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:31.880]  you're not going to relent or let up and neither are your comrades at the CDC and et cetera,
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:32.880]  et cetera.
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:38.600]  So, Mr. President, you're going to have to go up against all of the medical cartel here
[3:43:38.600 --> 3:43:43.840]  and call them fake, but if you don't, this is what we're looking at, this is what is
[3:43:43.840 --> 3:43:53.120]  going to happen, and furthermore, a scientist pipes up.
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:57.000]  Here's my prediction, sir.
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:44:04.400]  This whole thing is going to be, and by whole thing I mean the pandemic, which as we're
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:12.160]  seeing now is just not panning out to be a pandemic at all, sir, falling far, far short
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:18.920]  of that in every sense of the word, is going to be revved up and pumped up and hyped up
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:25.160]  and lied about and falsified and faked on the backs of dead old people.
[3:44:25.160 --> 3:44:26.160]  What?
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:27.160]  What do you mean by that?
[3:44:27.160 --> 3:44:32.760]  Well, they're going to kill old people because they're the easiest to say they were impacted
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:37.160]  by the virus, you see.
[3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:38.160]  What old people?
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:41.600]  We're talking about people in nursing homes, people that make it to hospitals, people that
[3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:47.360]  are isolated in their apartments in big cities and towns and never get to the hospital, but
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:52.360]  are terrified from all the propaganda about the virus and on top of all their other medical
[3:44:52.360 --> 3:44:55.440]  conditions and being isolated.
[3:44:55.440 --> 3:44:57.160]  The terror just kills them.
[3:44:57.160 --> 3:45:00.840]  Terror on the back of all of that can kill you, sir.
[3:45:00.840 --> 3:45:07.200]  That's what we're talking about, really.
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:10.880]  Well then, Mr. Fauci, I'm afraid we're not going to follow your advice.
[3:45:10.880 --> 3:45:11.880]  That's sir.
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:12.880]  How can you not?
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:15.680]  It's pretty easy, actually.
[3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:24.760]  First of all, we dump your ass in the grass and we leave you behind and I will see you
[3:45:24.760 --> 3:45:43.440]  next time.
